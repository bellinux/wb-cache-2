40|$|To {{assess the}} {{photodegradation}} {{extent of the}} organophosphorus pesticides, fenthion and <b>disulfoton</b> in the envi-ronment, degradation rates of their chemicals under irradiation by visible light and each region of the ultraviolet (UV) sources, UVA (320 – 400 nm radiation), UVB (280 – 320 nm radiation) and UVC (250 – 260 nm radiation) in liquid- and solid-phases were determined and their photolysis products identified. Although visible light did not cause photodegradation of either fenthion or <b>disulfoton</b> even after the maximal irradiation of 8 hr in both phases, all the ranges of UV sources resulted in the photolysis of both pesticides, despite the solid-phase. The photolysis rates of fenthion under UVB and UVC irradiation in both phases were higher than that under UVA irradiation and also exceeded all of the degradation rates of <b>disulfoton.</b> This confirms that fenthion is more readily degraded than disul-foton in the UVB range. Fenthion sulfoxide and <b>disulfoton</b> sulfoxide were identified as oxidative photolysis prod-ucts whose photolysis rates were considerably slower than parent compounds, and the oxidation reaction of both pesticides in the liquid-phase was superior to those on the solid-phase, indicating that dissolved oxygen in water {{is an important factor}} affecting the photolysis.

The 96 -h toxieity of four {{organophosphates}} (thio-meton, <b>disulfoton,</b> malathion, and demeton-S-methyl, the oxy-gen analogue of thiometon) in the freshwater bivalve molluse Dreissena polymorpha {{was tested}} using different nominal con-centrations ranging between 6 and 50 mglL. No mortalities were observed in musseis exposed to malathion and demeton-S-methyl (26 mglL and 6 mglL, respectively), and at the lowest eoncentrations of thiometon and <b>disulfoton</b> (6 and 10 mglL, respectively). At higher thiometon and <b>disulfoton</b> concentra-tions, mortalities occurred. At the highest concentrations of 50 mg thiometonIL and 30 mg disulfotonIL, mussei mortalities of 88 and 93 %, respectively, were determined. Organophosphate concentrations of up to a factor 10 times {{higher than in the}} ambient water were found in exposed musseis, irrespective of whether they were alive or dead. The search for organophos-phate metabolites via GCIMS analysis of mussei tissue extraets was negative, suggesting lacking or low oxidative activation of the insecticides used. The mollusc is highly resistant to toxie effects of organophosphate insectieides and their biologieal aetive oxygen analogues. On November 1, 1986, a pestieide storing facility at Sandoz in Basel (Switzerland) caught fire. In order to extinguish the fire, water was pumped at high volurnes from the nearby river Rhine. This water found its way back into the river Rhine due to overflowing sewage canals (Capel et al. 1988; Güttinger and Stumm 1992). Along with the fire-extinguishing water, pesticides stored in the affeeted facility were swept into the river.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} concern regarding the biological plausibility {{of the response}} of certain chemicals in the in vitro photoclastogenicity assay, suggesting that this assay is oversensitive and lacks specificity. To explore this further, four coded compounds (aminotriazole, propanthe-line bromide, cycloheximide and <b>disulfoton)</b> were evalu-ated for their potential response in a photoclastogenicity assay in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. None of the four compounds were shown to absorb ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or visible light in the 290 - to 700 -nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A fifth coded compound, tetracycline, which absorbs UVR, was also tested as this has previously {{been shown to be}} phototoxic in vitro (3 T 3 -NRU assay) and is cytotoxic, but not genotoxic, at high concentrations in standard ‘dark’ genotoxicity assays in mammalian cells. The results showed that cycloheximide, <b>disulfoton</b> and tetracycline were clastogenic in CHO cells following UVR exposure (solar-simulated light at 700 mJ/cm 2) but not in the absence of UVR. Aminotriazole and propantheline were negative in the presence and absence of UVR exposure. Follow-up testing showed that neither cycloheximide nor <b>disulfoton</b> was positive in the 3 T 3 -NRU assay, the standard in vitro regulatory test for phototoxicity, a result consistent with their inability to absorb UVR. These data suggest that both cycloheximide and <b>disulfoton</b> are pseudophotoclastogens, like zinc oxide. Together, these data question the specificity of the in vitro photoclastogencity assay in CHO cells and raises further concern regarding its use for the assessment of chemical photosafety for regulatory purposes.

40|$|<b>Disulfoton</b> (O,O, diethyl S- 2 -(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioate) {{and other}} organophosphorus ester {{compounds}} are insecticides which inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Chemicals of this class cause signs of toxicity in mammals which are referable to acculmulation of acetylcholine at neuroeffector sites. A tolerance to this toxic action can be induced in experimental animals by giving multiple, sublethal {{doses of the}} compounds. There is strong evidence that <b>disulfoton</b> tolerance occurs because of {{a reduction in the}} sensitivity of tissues in the affected animals to acetylcholine. ^ Experiments were designed to test the possibility that a {{decrease in the number of}} muscarinic cholinergic receptors could be downmodulating the sensitivity of tissues to acetylcholine. It was found that, concomitant with the onset of <b>disulfoton</b> tolerance, there was a decrease relative to control values in the specific binding of (2 ̆ 73) H quinuclidinyl benzilate ((2 ̆ 73) HQNB, a compound which selectively labels muscarinic cholinergic receptors) to homogenates of rat brain and ileal muscle. The decrease in (2 ̆ 73) HQNB binding was due to a reduction in the density of muscarinic receptors. There was, however, no alteration in the binding of (2 ̆ 73) H QNB, or the muscarinic agonists (2 ̆ 73) H oxotremorine-M and oxotremorine to atria from disulfoton-tolerant rats. The possibility that cardiac tissue was not subsensitive to cholinergic agonists was ruled out in experiments testing the effect of the muscarinic agonist carbachol on heart rate in vivo, and the negative chronotropic effect of oxotremorine on atria from disulfoton-tolerant rats: a clear reduction in the sensitivity to cholinergic agonists was seen in each case. It was, therefore concluded that the specificity and temporal correlation of (2 ̆ 73) HQNB binding decreases suggested that the loss of muscarinic receptors might play a role in modulating the sensitivity of several tissues to acetylcholine, but that other mechanisms also contribute to the tolerance phenomenon. ^ Other experiments revealed that <b>disulfoton</b> tolerance, as measured by resistance to the lethal effects of carbachol, could be induced by feeding rats low levels of the organophosphorus ester in the diet. The concentration of <b>disulfoton</b> used inhibited acetylcholinesterase, but not to the extent that overt signs of toxicity were observed. These results suggested that tolerance to organophosphorus ester insecticides could be induced in rodents with a dosing scheme which more closely modeled the sort of low level exposures which would be expected in humans environmentally or occupationally in contact with these compounds. ...|$|E

40|$|Germination of mung bean, Phaseolus mungo L., and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., seeds {{was used}} for {{bioassay}} to demonstrate the toxic effects of selected pesticides [...] menazon, <b>disulfoton,</b> and GS- 14254 [...] and allergens [...] alantolactone and usnic acid. The ability of gibberellic acid to counteract the toxic effects of these chemicals on germination and seedling growth was studied. Chemical composition of the treated and untreated seeds was made with special attention to starch and protein degradation. Effect of these toxicants on the synthesis of amylase, ATPase, and protease enzymes during germination was studied since these enzymes are synthesized de novo during germination. To ascertain their effect on protein synthesis in storage tissue of the germinating seeds, uptake and incorporation of 14 C-L-leucine into protein was studied in potato tuber slices and germinating mung beans. Correlation of biochemical data and histochemical changes in the treated and untreated seeds of mung bean was obtained with menazon and usnic acid. Furthermore, ultrastructural changes were studied in order to relate functional and structural changes in the seeds. in conjunction with phytotoxic actions of these chemicals. Among the insecticides, menazon (250 ppm) {{was found to be}} more toxic to both species than was <b>disulfoton.</b> GS- 14254 (100 ppm) also was equally inhibitory to seed germination and seedling growth of mung bean and wheat seeds. When a solution of the herbicide GS- 14254 (100 ppm) was added to either of the insecticides at their maximum concentrations the inhibitory effect of the combined pesticides on seed germination and seedling growth was more pronounced, especially with wheat. Usnic acid (50 to 250 mg/ 1) and alantolactone (100 mg/ 1) significantly inhibited germination and root and shoot growth in both mung bean and wheat seeds. These two compounds appeared to be more phytotoxic than the pesticides. Gibberellic acid partially counteracted the inhibitory effects of the pesticides and allergens, thus these chemicals showed no antiauxin activity. Before any growth is observed there is a marked increase in respiration during germination that releases energy from food materials already present in usable form in the cells. At their maximum concentrations, menazon, <b>disulfoton,</b> GS- 14254, alantolactone, and usnic acid significantly blocked the respiration of the germinating seeds at the end of 72 h after treatment. In all cases except alantolactone respiration of wheat seeds was considerably more affected than that of the mung beans. Compared to control seeds, pesticide chemicals as well as allergenic compounds caused significant reduction in the amounts of soluble reducing sugars and free amino acids after 72 h germination period. Similarly, starch degradation was less in the treated seeds. Among the species of seeds, considerably less amounts of reducing sugars and amino acids were formed in the pesticide-treated wheat seeds than in the mung beans as compared to their respective controls. Such differences in the inhibitory effects were not observed in seeds treated with allergenic compounds. The development of amylase and ATPase activity in the seeds treated with maximum concentrations of pesticides tended to be lower than that in the control seeds. In case of menazon, inhibition of amylase activity was more pronounced than that of <b>disulfoton</b> or GS- 14254. Proteoiytic activity in control and disulfoton- and menazon-treated seeds was not significantly different during germination period, but in case of GS- 14254, it was considerably lower. Usnic acid at highest concentration tested completely inhibited the development of amylase activity in mung beans whereas it was significantly lower in seeds treated with the maximum concentration of alantolactone. The inhibition of amylase activity in wheat seeds treated with these compounds was more or less similar. ATPase inhibition in seeds treated with usnic acid was more severe than that in alantolactone treated seeds. However, proteolytic activity in control and treated seeds showed almost the same trend during the germination period. The activity per se of amylase isolated from mung bean and wheat seeds germinated for 3 days was not significantly inhibited by the presence of the pesticides or allergens in the reaction mixture indicating that these chemicals do not inhibit already synthesized amylase enzyme. Observations with potato tissue and germinating mung beans indicated that both total uptake and incorporation of 14 c-L-leucine into protein were significantly inhibited by menazon, <b>disulfoton,</b> GS- 14254, and alantolactone. On the other hand, the uptake in germinating mung bean treated with usnic acid was not affected although both uptake and incorporation were inhibited in potato tissue. Menazon and usnic acid were then selected as the representative chemicals for pesticides and allergens, respectively, and their toxic effects were studied histochemically in 3 -day germinating mung beans. It was observed that total nucleic acid content and RNA content in seeds treated with these chemicals were considerably less than that in the control seeds. Similarly, treated seeds showed more starch grains and protein bodies indicating less metabolic activity in these seeds. At the ultrastructural level, menazon- or usnic acid-treated mung bean cotyledons at day 3 of germination contained no vacuoles but many undigested protein bodies were observed. In contrast, fully developed mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes, and vacuoles were seen in control cells indicating protein (enzyme) synthesis and digestion of the food reserves...|$|E

For rice, EWG (R), EWG (S), LWG (R), and LWG (S), the B-carotene NOECs were 0. 21, < 0. 08, < 0. 08, 0. 08 and 0. 46 µM clomazone, respectively and IC 25 s were 0. 42, 0. 08, 0. 08, 0. 33 and 0. 54 µM, respectively. At a field-relevant clomazone application rate resistance to clomazone was observed in EWG (R) and LWG (R) as measured by growth and B-carotene, respectively. Due to similar sensitivity between rice and late watergrass, use of clomazone in rice culture may {{require the use of}} a safening technique. Rice and EWG (S) were exposed to 14 C-labeled clomazone to determine accumulation, biotransformation and mass balance. In terms of extractable 14 C, rice contained more total residues than EWG (p < 0. 05), but the concentration in EWG was significantly higher (p < 0. 01). More metabolized residue was measured in EWG compared to rice (p < 0. 01). Both species produced hydroxylated forms of clomazone, B-D-glucoside conjugates, and unidentified polar metabolites. The suspected active metabolite, 5 -ketoclomazone, was found at a significantly higher concentration in EWG vs. rice (21 ± 2 vs. 5. 7 ± 0. 5 pmol g- 1, respectively; p < 0. 01). Qualitatively and quantitatively, more clomazone metabolism was observed in the relatively sensitive EWG compared to rice. R and S biotypes of EWG and LWG were exposed to clomazone alone and in combination with P 450 inhibitors. Growth reduction (GR 25, GR 50, and GR 75) values were lower for S biotypes than for R biotypes (p < 0. 05) with exposure to clomazone alone indicating resistance to clomazone in the R biotypes. In combination with clomazone <b>disulfoton</b> increased 20 -d growth in LWG (R) by as much as 5 -fold, compared to application of clomazone alone. Oxydemeton methyl increased 20 -d growth by as much as 6 -fold. <b>Disulfoton</b> and oxydemeton methyl reduced !) -carotene levels compared to treatment with clomazone alone. For EWG (S), <b>disulfoton</b> increased 4 -d growth by 46 % and increased B-carotene levels by 52 %. Demeton-S increased B-carotene levels by 48 %. At 6800 g ai ha- 1 PBO increased growth and B-carotene levels by 28 and 48 %, respectively. These results indicate that P 450 enzymes serve both to activate and detoxify clomazone...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{evaluation}} of the stability of pesticides in fruits and vegetables during cryogenic sample processing (comminution of samples {{in the presence of}} dry ice) is reported. Pesticides were spiked onto the undamaged surface of individual units of fruit before freezing and comminution. The mean recoveries of pesticides spiked before and after comminution of the sample were compared to determine the relative stability of the individual pesticides during cryogenic sample processing. A stable internal deposition standard (IDS) was used to correct for physical losses and volumetric errors. Mean recovery results together with associated standard errors were obtained using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) analysis. A total of 134 pesticides in 4 commodities (apples, grapes, lettuce and oranges) were evaluated. The results demonstrated that 120 pesticides were stable (i. e. the mean difference in recovery of pesticides spiked pre and post processing was 20 %); biphenyl, cadusafos, captan, chlorothalonil, dichlorvos, <b>disulfoton,</b> ethoxyquin, etradiazole, heptenophos, malaoxon, phorate, tebuconazole, tecnazene and trifluralin...|$|E

Polydimethylsiloxane-coated fiber (100 mm) was used. The samples were screened using gas chromatography with flame thermionic detection. Detection was confirmed by gas chromatography– mass spectroscopy. The most frequently detected pesticides were some of the more commonly used herbicides, such as S-ethyl-N,N-di-n-propylthiol carbamate (EPTC), trifluralin, atrazine, deethylatrazine, terbuthylazine and alachlor, and insecticides, such as carbofuran, diazinon, <b>disulfoton,</b> parathion methyl, parathion ethyl, fenthion and ethion. Concentrations of individual compounds ranged from 0. 020 to 0. 3 mg/L. Greater pesticide concentrations occurred during the seasons of application. A comparison with a well-established solid-phase extraction (C disks) procedure was performed for samples of 18 high-season application (May–September) in order to confirm the effectiveness of the SPME technique. The results demonstrate the suitability of the SPME method for routine screening multiresidue analysis in natural waters. 200...|$|E
40|$|A photoionisation {{detector}} (PID) was coupled to packed-capillary liquid and supercritical-fluid chromatography to study its performance. Several mobile phases were tested {{to evaluate the}} potential of liquid chromatography with photoionisation detection, LC-PID. The behaviour of the PID was {{not as good as}} in gas chromatography (GC), due to the absorption of photons by the mobile phase vapour. Therefore, the minimum detection limits (MDLs) were high compared to those in GC-PID, being at the low nanogram level for, e. g., ketones, aldehydes and amides. Coupling of the PID with supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) using modified carbon dioxide gave more satisfactory results. For aromatic compounds like phenanthrene and pyrene MDLs were found to be 12 and 20 pg, respectively. These values were almost the same as found in GC-PID. Separation and detection of aliphatic C 4 -Q 3 carboxylic acids and some organosulphur/phosphorus pesticides (<b>disulfoton,</b> ethion and sulfotepp) showed the possibility to detect several classes of compounds at the low nanogram level using methanol-modified carbon dioxide. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The degradation was studied by monitoring the change in substrate concentration employing UV spectroscopic analysis or HPLC technique and the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content, respectively, as a function of irradiation time. The degradation kinetics was studied under different conditions such as reaction pH, substrate and photocatalyst concentration, type of photocatalysts and the presence of alternative additives such as H 2 O 2, KBrO 3 and (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 besides molecular oxygen. The degradation rates and the photonic efficiencies were found to be strongly influenced by the above parameters.

A further three poisonings of livestock occurred following the ingestion of the foliar insecticide, endosulfan (two poisonings), and the seed protectant insecticides diazinon plus lindane (one poisoning). There were six poisoning cases {{as a result of}} excessive topical applications of the three insecticides coumpahos, fenthion, and lindane as dusts or sprays to control external parasites. Together, these events caused the deaths of 258 domestic animals of which 200 were cattle, 23 were swine, and 35 were sheep. Not all deaths are reported to the Ministry and the cases reported here may only represent 30 - 50 % of the actual deaths over the period. Based on total populations of livestock, the percent losses were very small but they represent serious losses to individual growers.

In {{the past}} few years, organophosphorus {{compounds}} {{become one of the}} most widely used classes of pesticides due to their acute toxicity against a wide variety of pests. In this work, a method based on solid-phase microextraction in mode headspace (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was developed and optimized throughmultivariate factorial design to determine residues of organophosphorus pesticides in cow's milk. Different parameters of the method were evaluated, such as fiber type, temperature, extraction and desorption times, sample volume, effect of salt addition and stirring velocities. The evaluated pesticideswere dichlorvos, sulfotep, demeton-S, dimpylate, <b>disulfoton,</b> parathion,methylparathion, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos and ethion. The best results were obtained using polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber and headspacemode at 90 °C for 45 min, alongwith stirring at 600 rpmand desorption for 5 min at 250 °C. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed methodology was able to determine all of the pesticides with variation coefficients between 6. 1 % and 29. 5 %. Detection and quantification limits ranged from 2. 16 to 10. 85 μg L− 1 and from 6. 5 to 32. 9 μg L− 1, respectively.

40|$|AbstractMicrowave Assisted Extraction and a {{modified}} CEN-QuEChERS methodology were evaluated as extraction {{and clean up}} procedures for the simultaneous analysis of 42 organophosphate pesticides in yerba mate (Ilex paraguaiensis). The obtained extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame photometric detector. Linearity, recovery percentages, relative standard deviations, detection and quantification limits and matrix effects were determined according to DG-SANCO guidelines for both methods. At 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg/kg the evaluated methods showed percentages recoveries between 70 and 120 % {{for most of the}} analytes. Using Microwave Assisted Extraction methodology, 33 pesticide residues could be properly analyzed whereas only 27 could be determined with the proposed modified QuEChERS. All relative standard deviation were below 18 % except for omethoate and <b>disulfoton</b> sulfone when evaluated by the modified QuEChERS. The limits of detection in both methodologies were 0. 2 mg/kg for most of the analyzed compounds. The average detection limit for QuEChERS was 0. 04 mg/kg. For 19 of the analytes determined through Microwave Assisted Extraction the lowest validated level were 0. 004 mg/kg. Signal suppression/enhancement was observed for most of the pesticides, thus matrix-matched calibration curves were used for quantification. The Microwave Assisted Extraction and QuEChERS procedures studied could detect the organophosphate pesticides above the MRL fixed for “mate” by the European Union. They have been successfully applied for the determination of organophosphate pesticide residues in commercial samples and the positives were confirmed through GC–(ITD) -MS...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{and acute}} {{exposure}} to organophosphate (OP) pesticides {{may lead to}} persistent neurological and neurobehavioral effects, which cannot be explained by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibi-tion alone. It is suggested that other brain proteins are involved. Effects of commonly used organophosphate pesticides on rat neuronal a 4 b 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes have been investigated using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Several OP pesticides, e. g., parathion-ethyl, chlorpyrifos and <b>disulfoton,</b> inhibited the ACh-induced ion current with potencies in the micromolar range. The potency of inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of the agonistACh. Comparison of the potency of nAChR inhibition with the potency of AChE inhibition demonstrated that some OPs inhibit nAChRsmore potently thanAChE. Binding experiments on a 4 b 2 nAChRs showed that the OPs noncompetitively interact with nAChRs. The inhibitory effects on nAChRs are adequately described and explained by a sequential two-step mechanism, in which rapidly reversible OP binding to a separate binding site leads to inhibition followed by a stabilization of the blocked state or receptor desensitization. It is concluded thatOPs interact directly with neuronal a 4 b 2 nAChRs to inhibit the agonist-induced response. This implicates that neuronal a 4 b 2 nAChRs are addi-tional targets for some OP pesticides. Key Words: organophosphate pesticides; neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; rat brain acetylcholinesterase; Xenopus oocytes; two-microelectrode voltage clamp.

40|$|Neurotoxicology {{presents}} major {{challenges to}} the development of biological markers in accordance to conventional research strategies. Because of the inaccessibility of the nervous system, one of the proposed alternatives is the study of biochemical signals in peripheral tissues which can easily and ethically be obtained in humans, and which could represent surrogate indicators of equivalent parameters in the nervous tissue. Considerable scientific support to this approach is provided by the results of recent investigations in major areas of pharmacology and psychobiology. Studies examining parameters of neurotransmission and second messenger systems in peripheral blood cells, and variations in the peripheral body fluid content of endogenous substances reflecting nervous tissue dysfunction or damage are presented in this paper as examples of efforts toward rational development and validation of novel indicators of nervous system toxicity. Cholinergic muscarinic receptors and calcium signalling in peripheral blood lymphocytes, myelin basic protein in cerebrospinal fluid, and blood polyamines are discussed as potential surrogate indicators {{based on the results of}} in vitro or in vivo animal studies of neurotoxic metals (mercury, triethyltin), pesticides (<b>disulfoton),</b> drugs of abuse (d-fenfluramine) and model epileptogenic compounds (kainic acid). Data from investigations examining serum prolactin, type B monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) in workers occupationally exposed to manganese, lead or styrene are also presented. Although research in this field is still at its very early stage, current evidence suggests that (i) certain neurochemical markers may be valuably used in animal studies as a complement to conventional laboratory tests to augment their sensitivity or predictivity; (ii) a mechanistic research approach is required to establish which markers offer the greatest promise for application in human biomonitoring.

40|$|The study {{determined}} {{the types of}} pesticide/herbicide pollutants in water, sediment and fish from the Kafue River. A preliminary investigation of the oxidative stress from these pesticides/herbicides was also assessed by measurement of catalase activity. Water, sediment and fish samples were collected upstream, midstream and downstream the Kafue river in Chingola, Kitwe, Kafue National Park and Kafue Town. Water, sediment and fish muscle were sampled and analysed for pesticides using Gas chromatography. For catalase activity fish liver samples only were examined. The pesticides/herbicides detected in all samples collectively included : Heptachlor, pp’-DDE, Cypermethrin, Chlordane, Toxaphene, Terbufos, Kelthane, Endosulfan, Dieldrin, pp’ -DDD, pp’-DDT, Atrazine, <b>Disulfoton,</b> d-trans-Allethrin and Endrin. On the other hand, catalase activity was detected in all fish liver samples from all sites. Its levels increased significantly from Chingola upstream to sites downstream with highest being in Kafue town. This study therefore, demonstrates that there is widespread contamination of the Kafue River with pesticides/ herbicides. It also demonstrates that organochlorides are found throughout the river especially in fish samples. The spectrum of pesticides/herbicides was much wider in fish probably due to bioaccumulation. It was also observed that fish are subjected to oxidative stress as determined by catalase levels. The stress is more pronounced downstream where the catalase levels {{were significantly higher than}} Chingola. The observation that more pesticide varieties are also found downstream may suggest a likely causative effect of the pesticides on oxidative stress although this needs further investigation. This study further tentatively highlights the potential dangers of these agro-related substances to dependants of the Kafue River water body and the need to carry out risk assessments and thereafter institute corrective measures to help reduce contamination and adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|O conhecimento das interações entre Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), outros ácaros fitófagos ou predadores e as plantas de cafeeiro ainda são insuficientes para se poder elaborar um programa adequado de manejo da cultura, para tentar solucionar os problemas causados pela mancha anular. Apesar da importância do problema, pouco se sabe sobre a diversidade de ácaros, assim como a dinâmica populacional do ácaro B. phoenicis e seus inimigos naturais na cultura cafeeira, bem como nas diversas cultivares comercialmente exploradas. As informações sobre o impacto de agroquímicos nas populações de ácaros em cafeeiro são praticamente inexistentes. Contudo, sabe-se que alguns inseticidas ou fungicidas podem afetar a população de ácaros predadores podendo favorecer o aumento populacional de ácaros pragas. Ao caracterizar a diversidade de ácaros em duas importantes regiões produtoras (Jeriquara e Garça), constatou-se que em Jeriquara a diversidade foi {{superior}} ao encontrado em Garça. Foram coletados no total 13. 052 ácaros nos dois locais estudados, sendo 7. 155 em Jeriquara e 5. 897 em Garça. De um total de 108 espécies encontradas, 45 espécies foram observadas em ambos os locais avaliados, que apresentaram similaridade de 56 %. Os predadores mais freqüentes nas folhas foram Euseius citrifolius Denmark & Muma, E. concordis (Chant) e Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira. Foram observadas correlações significativas a 0, 05 % (Pearson) entre as populações E. concordis e B. phoenicis; Zetzellia malvinae Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira e B. phoenicis; E. concordis e A. brasiliensis; entre outras. Em relação à diversidade em diferentes cultivares de cafeeiro (Coffea canephora cv Apoatã e de C. arabica cultivares Mundo Novo, Icatu Vermelho, Icatu Amarelo e Catuaí Amarelo) realizado em Garça, verificou-se que a maior riqueza de espécies e o maior número de indivíduos na superfície das folhas foram observados para Apoatã. A cultivar Icatu Vermelho foi a que apresentou maior uniformidade na distribuição das espécies de ácaros e Apoatã a que apresentou menor uniformidade. Em relação à preferência hospedeira, B. phoenicis foi encontrado em maior abundância na cultivar Apoatã, representando 61 % de todos os indivíduos. E. citrifolius ocorreu em maior número na cultivar Mundo Novo e E. concordis na Apoatã. A. brasiliensis ocorreu em maior quantidade na cultivar Icatu Vermelho e Z. malvinae ocorreu sem diferença estatística em todas as cultivares. Em relação aos efeitos de pesticidas sobre a diversidade de ácaros, constatou-se que no tratamento com triadimenol + <b>disulfoton</b> apresentou a menor, enquanto que no deltametrina + triazophos a maior. B. phoenicis apresentou redução no número de indivíduos no tratamento com aldicarb e um aumento de cerca de duas vezes nos tratamentos com triadimenol + <b>disulfoton</b> e no thiamethoxam. Os tratamentos que apresentaram as maiores semelhanças na composição das espécies foram: testemunha e cartap, e thiamethoxam e ethion; e os tratamentos de menor similiaridade foram: testemunha e aldicarb, aldicarb e cartap, e aldicarb e deltametrina + triazophos. Reduções significativas na população de A. brasiliensis nos tratamentos com aldicarb e thiamethoxam e de E. citrifolius no tratamento com cartap foram detectadas.

In spite of the problem, little is known on the diversity of mites, {{as well as on the}} population dynamics of B. phoenicis and its natural enemies on coffee plants of several important commercial cultivars. Information on the impact of agrochemicals on the population of mites on coffee plantations are practically inexistent. However, it is known that some insecticides and fungicides can affect the population of predaceous mites inducing pest mite population increases. Characterizing the diversity of mites on two important coffee-producing areas of the state of São Paulo (Jeriquara and Garça), it was observed that the diversity of mites was higher in Jeriquara county than in Garça. A total of 13, 052 mites was collected in both studied areas, of which 7, 155 in Jeriquara and 5, 897 in Garça. Of the total of 108 species identified in this study, 45 species were observed in both localities (Garça an Jeriquara), which presented 56 % of similarity. The most frequent predaceous mites on leaves were Euseius concordis (Chant), E. citrifolius Denmark & Muma and Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira, among others. The study on the diversity of mites in different coffee cultivars (Coffea canephora cv. Apoatã and C. arabica cv. Mundo Novo, Icatu Vermelho, Icatu Amarelo and Catuai Amarelo), carried out in Garça, showed the highest species richness and the highest number of specimens for the leaf surface of Apoatã. Icatu Vermelho was the cultivar which presented the highest uniformity of distribution of mite species and Apoatã was the cultivar with the lowest uniformity. The species B. phoenicis was found in higher abundance in Apoatã, representing 61 % of all specimens collected. E. citrifolius occurred in higher number on the cultivar Mundo Novo and E. concordis in Apoatã. The stigmaeid mite A. brasiliensis occurred in higher number on the cultivar Icatu Vermelho and Z. malvinae was present in similar populations on all coffee cultivars. The study on the effect of pesticides on the mite diversity, showed the lowest diversity for the treatment with triadimenol + dissulfoton, and the highest diversity was observed for treatment with deltamethrin + triazophos. B. phoenicis presented population reduction for the treatments aldicarb, but an increase of around two times for treatments with triadimenol + <b>disulfoton</b> and with thiamethoxam.
