50|$|Interestingly, forced {{circulation}} evaporators {{in the food}} industry use modified designs that mimic the original system however involve extra secondary steam units to enhance <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>flow.</b> Whilst the single effect design employs a condenser unit to stimulate a condensation action subsequent to vapour inflow from the heat exchanger, the double effect design does a similar duty however the extra component acts to reduce the overall pressure in the system. In comparison, the triple effect system is used when high levels of effective evaporation are needed with minimum labour. In this design, the liquid enters the third effect at a low temperature {{and moves to the}} second stream in which concentration is increased due to the previous evaporation effect. Finally, the optimum product concentration is achieved in the first effect.|$|E

Retrofitting conventional domestic hot water heaters when installing a new solar hot water system can decrease the total investment cost. In this study, retrofitting of existing water heaters using <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> was investigated. A comparison with a standard solar thermal system is also presented. Four simulation models of different system configurations were created and tested for the climate in Lund, Sweden. The results from the simulations indicate that the best configuration consists on connecting the collectors to the existing heater throughout an external heat exchanger and adding a small heater storage in series. For this retrofitted system, preliminary results show that an annual solar fraction of 53 % is achieved. In addition, a co nventional solar thermal system using a standard solar tank achieves a comparable performance for the same storage volume and collector area. Hence, it is worth to further investigate and test in practice this retrofitting. Furthermore, using the same system configuration, solar collectors can also be combined with new standard domestic hot water tanks at new installations, accessing a world-wide developed and spread industry...|$|E
40|$|The SWR 1000 {{fuel pool}} coolers are tubular heat exchangers. They are {{installed}} on the fuel pool wall around the spent fuel storage racks. Fuel pool water is cooled by means of natural convection. <b>Forced</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>flow</b> of closed-cooling water exists on the tube side of each heat exchanger. The penetrations of the cooling water supply lines through the fuel pool liner are all located above the pool water surface. This ensures that the fuel pool cannot lose water {{in the event of}} a pipe break. Integration of the cooling components inside the fuel pool ensures only noncontaminated piping within the reactor building. The fuel pool cooling system consists of two redundant cooling trains. Each cooling train comprises four heat exchangers connected in parallel. The system must ensure adequate heat removal both during normal plant operation and {{in the event of a}}ny postulated accident. To verify proper functioning of the component, full-scale, steadystate tests were performed at the INKA (Integral Teststand Karlstein) test facility in Karlstein Germany. The characteristic diagram for heat transfer capacity of the component as a function of cooling water temperature and fuel pool water temperature obtained from these experiments will be presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} {{were investigated}} of various operating parameters on beat transmission, i. e. the evaporative capacity, {{in a single}} vertical evaporator tube, fed with pure water. With natural circulation, temperature level and difference had a pronounced influence, especially at lower values of these parameters (e. g. boiling temperature 40 Â°C, temperature difference 15 Â°C). The heat transmission coefficient k increased for increasing temperature level {{as well as for}} increasing temperature difference. The influence of the apparent liquid level was very important and was more pronounced for lower temperature levels and smaller differences. For each set of operating temperatures an apparent liquid level existed, for which k was maximum. The apparent liquid level had a very big influence on <b>circulation</b> rate. <b>Forced</b> <b>circulation</b> induced higher values of k only if the <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> rate was much higher than the natural one. Because natural circulation was slow for low temperatures and small differences <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> was found to be advantageous in these conditions. With <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> the influence of temperature difference on k was small and sometimes reversed. Due to decreased viscosity, k was higher at higher temperatures.

5000|$|In {{water tube}} boilers, {{the way the}} water is {{recirculated}} inside the boiler before becoming steam {{can be described as}} either natural <b>circulation</b> or <b>forced</b> <b>circulation.</b> In a water tube boiler, the water is recirculated inside until the vapor pressure of the water overcomes the vapor pressure inside the stream drum and becomes saturated steam. The <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler begins the same as a natural circulation boiler, at the feed water pump. Water is introduced into the steam drum and is circulated around the boiler, leaving only as steam. What makes the <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler different is its use of a secondary pump that circulates water through the boiler. The secondary pump takes the feed water going to the boiler and raises the pressure of the water going in. In a natural circulation boilers, the circulation of water is dependent on the differential pressures caused by the change of density in the water as it is heated. That is to say that as the water is heated and starts turning to steam, the density decreases sending the hottest water and steam {{to the top of the}} furnace tubes. In contrast to the natural <b>circulation</b> boiler, the <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler uses a water <b>circulation</b> pump to <b>force</b> that flow instead of waiting for the differential to form. Because of this, the generation tubes of a <b>forced</b> <b>circulation</b> boiler are able to be oriented in whatever way is required by space constraints.
