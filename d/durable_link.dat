40|$|In the paper, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} explain the {{previously}} observed increased effectiveness of utilising hydrated sodium water-glass grade 137 after hardening moulding sands with selected physical methods. In the modified process of preparing sandmixes, during stirring components, water as a wetting additive {{was introduced to the}} sand-binder system.

The measurement results were confronted with SEM observations of linking bridges and with chemical analyses of grain surfaces of high-silica base. On the grounds of comprehensive evaluation of hardened moulding sands, positive effects were found of the applied physical process of binder dehydration and presence of the wetting additive. It was observed that introduction of this additive during stirring, before adding the binder, improves flowing the binder to the places where <b>durable</b> <b>linking</b> bridges are created. It was also found that the applied methods of hardening by dehydration enable creation of very <b>durable</b> <b>linking</b> bridges, strongly connected with the sand base, which results in damages of high-silica grain surfaces, when the bridges are destroyed...|$|R

For a firm embedding of the oxide nanofillers via covalent bonds {{to the network}} acrylates their surfaces were modified by polymerization-active trialkoxysilanes, e. g., methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and vinyltrimethoxysilane. The cured nanocomposite clear coats showed improved scratch and abrasion resistance. However, oxide modifications accomplished by silanes having polymerization-inactive methyl, n-propyl, and isobutyl functionalities yield coatings with similar scratch and abrasion resistance.

40|$|This explorative {{qualitative}} research investigates {{whether there is}} a difference in the symbolic meanings between the bulimic’s behaviour of purposefully expelling food versus the anorexic’s deprivation of food by administering the Thematic Apperceptive Test, as well as, conducting in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews with two bulimic women, two anorexic women of the restrictive sub-type and one anorexic woman of the binge-eating/ purging sub-type, whose ages ranged from twenty-one to thirty-five years of age. Both the conscious and unconscious themes that emerge from their stated relationship with food and their TAT responses are explored, with particular interest being focused on whether the symbolic meaning of food is in essence a “symbolic equation” for an object, specifically the mother and parental couple. The concept of “symbolic equation” is explored analytically from a Kleinian perspective to ascertain whether it is not food, per se that the anorexic is depriving herself of or that the bulimic suddenly and uncontrollably ingests, but then rapidly and violently expels. On the contrary, it appears that the refusal to introject or the ambivalent battle between introjection and expulsion of food is used as a disguise for the underlying conflictual object relation/s. The modified version of the Bellak Scoring System (1986) was used to analyse their TAT responses in order to elicit the themes that represent their internal worlds and object relations. Individual thematic content analysis was conducted on each interview transcript separately, and then a comparative analysis performed to explore commonalities and differences across the transcripts and TAT responses amongst the three anorexic women as a group and the bulimic women as a separate group. After which, the two different eating disorder groups were compared to explore both their differences and similarities. The findings suggest that a variety of conscious and unconscious motives might best be understood within the historical context of each participant’s early development and family dynamics. It appears that the anorexic is unconsciously motivated, at least partly, by her desire to repudiate any experience of dependency, separateness, loss, frustration, envy, fear, guilt and helplessness. Conversely, the bulimic appears to be motivated, at least partly, by the repetitive magical quest to restore a ‘good’ self-object bond and to stifle her destructiveness. Nonetheless, underlying both the anorexic’s and the bulimic’s illness is an ambivalent struggle with internalising a gainful and <b>durable</b> <b>link</b> to an object, which can in some way be permitted to be ‘good’. This appears to have its origin in the mother-daughter relationship, father-daughter relationship, parental couple, as well as, the triangular space between the mother-daughter-father link.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{exploration}} of the preconceptions held by Primary PGCE students about the relationship of theory to classroom practice in learning to teach. Preconceptions about learning to teach have been found in the past to be unsophisticated and unhelpful, yet <b>durable.</b> <b>Linking</b> theory and practice within teacher education is notoriously difficult and studies report scepticism about the value of research findings and theory in everyday classroom practice. Furthermore, the nature of teachers’ professional knowledge is itself uncertain and highly complex. Unlike many previous investigations into student teacher thinking, this small-scale case study captures participants’ views before the start of their training and explores the research question through three key issues: what constitutes teacher knowledge, where this knowledge is learned and how these different facets of knowledge relate to one another. While many of the complexities of teaching are yet to be understood fully in this pre-course phase, these participants prove to be far from naïve and begin the course open to a range of forms of learning, with a positive view of the potential contribution of theory to practice. The insight into this starting point leads to some potentially important implications for future course design.

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} ethno-territorial {{conflicts in}} which there are two conflict groups with corresponding ‘reference states’. ‘Reference states’ are internationally recognised states with co-nationals in the aforementioned disputed territory. The literature on ethno-national conflict regulation largely neglects the potential constructive role of ‘reference states’. In particular, Arend Lijphart’s work on consociational democracy focuses on elite accommodation within the conflict zone, but views other agents as ‘external’ to the dispute. Unlike most of the current ethnic conflict literature, the thesis will use a theoretical approach to derive the features of a settlement, not distil traits from purely empirical research. An informal model is employed assuming that that a military option is not open to reference states and that disengagement from the co-nationals is costly. The actions of the reference state are simplified to four options: remaining at the same level of conflict, escalating the dispute, attempting cooperation, or disengaging from the dispute. The features derived for the resulting transnational consociation settlement are: <b>durable</b> reference state/conational <b>links,</b> bipartisanship within reference states, intergovernmentalism between reference states, and consociational democracy internal to the disputed territory. The thesis then focuses on the post-conflict power-sharing settlements in Bosnia- Hercegovina and in Northern Ireland to investigate the features of transnational consociation in these two cases. The settlement after the Belfast Agreement exhibits the traits of transnational consociation, with a strong intergovernmental Dublin- London axis acting as reliable long-term guarantors of the settlement. By contrast, there is little intergovernmentalism between Zagreb and Belgrade regarding the settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The post-conflict institutions are held together by international agencies that do not have as <b>durable</b> a <b>link</b> to the conflict zone as the ‘reference states’. Therefore, a durable transnational consociation with the ‘reference states’ as guarantors is more likely in Northern Ireland than in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

Social media (including Web 2. 0) practices have an impact on long distance relations that previous technologies have not had, due to differences in the way these technologies are utilized.

40|$|Ion {{irradiation}} {{has been}} investigated as a route for the preparation of mechanically stable and highly <b>durable</b> cross <b>linked</b> sulphonated PEEK for fuel cell application. The formation of cross linking was confirmed by solvent extraction using the well known Charlsby–Pinner equation. The DSC {{results indicated that the}} cross links retard the crystallization, but no changes were observed in the mechanism of crystallization. The thermal kinetic data for irradiated PEEK quantitatively suggest that these films still have sufficient thermal stability for long term applications as fuel cell membranes. Analysis of the dielectric response by Cole-Cole, Havrilak and Negami and Williams and Watts equations indicated that the dipole relaxation was broadened and becoming more asymmetric with cross link density. The sulphonation of the cross linked PEEK in concentrated sulphuric acid indicated that the rate of reaction decreased with cross linking density and was consistent with diffusion control kinetics. Increasing cross link density resulted in more bound water in the equilibrated membranes and the nano-structure present was comparable to that of Nafion. Cross linking improved the chemical stability of PEMs in particular in methanol solution. The measurement of power output and energy efficiency suggested that the cross linked PEMs produced are promising candidates to replace Nafion membranes but more information are required, in particular on their long term stability under fuel cell operating conditions.

In addition, industry exemption of CO 2 tax is studied. The results indicate that if Sweden unilaterally decides to increase its carbon dioxide tax, the total European Union carbon dioxide emissions will increase, i. e. there will be a "carbon leakage" effect. Perhaps more surprisingly, a European Union multilateral implementation of a carbon dioxide tax rate will induce a lower welfare (exluding environmental benefits) in Sweden as compared to the situation where the same carbon dioxide tax was introduced unilaterally in Sweden.

40|$|Some neuropsychological {{studies of}} brain damaged {{patients}} presenting memory deficits suggest that working memory directly {{contribute to the}} long-term learning of non-familiar phonological structures. It seems that a phonological store impairment leads to problems in learning new words (Baddeley, Papagno & Vallar, 1988). Gathercole and Baddeley (1993) studies of normal young children lead to the same conclusion. Phonological short-term memory abilities of 4 - 5 years-old children directly influence lexical acquisition. Children who exhibit the higher phonological memory skills produce higly discriminable and stable phonological memory traces. For these children, {{there is a greater}} probability that memory traces become <b>durable</b> and semanticaly <b>linked</b> to the referent. One can then conclude that the phonological short-term memory abilities directly influence the way young children acquired new vocabulary items. A study of memory abilities and lexical knowledge of Down's syndrome subjects (mental age: 3; 5 to 5; 4 years old, chronological age: 8; 10 to 25; 11 years old) lead us to the following conclusion: in Down's syndrome subjects, as well as in normal subjects, one cannot reject the hypothesis that lexical knowledge are linked to the subjects phonological short-term memory abilities and more specially to non-word repetition.

Such a sequence is said to be T-interval connected if for any t∈ [1, δ-T+ 1] all graphs in {G_t,G_t+ 1, [...] .,G_t+T- 1 } share a common connected spanning subgraph. In this paper, we consider the problem of deciding whether a given sequence G is T-interval connected for a given T. We also consider the related problem of finding the largest T for which a given G is T-interval connected. We assume that the changes between two consecutive graphs are arbitrary, and that two operations, binary intersection and connectivity testing, are available to solve the problems. We show that Ω(δ) such operations are required to solve both problems, and we present optimal O(δ) online algorithms for both problems.

The BB resistance genes, Xa 1, xa 5, xa 13, Xa 21, Xa 26 and Xa 27 have been cloned and used for breeding program. With the exception of xa 5 and xa 13, the BB resistance genes are dominant in nature and the markers developed from the sequencing information of these genes are widely used in MAS (Song et al. 1995; Yoshimura et al. 1998; Gu et al. 2005; Chu et al. 2006 a). Using the gene pyramid approach, improved indica rice cultivars with broad spectrum durable BB resistance have been developed by combining different genes (Huang et al. 1997; Sanchez et al. 2000; Shanti et al. 2001; Singh et al. 2001; Joseph et al. 2004; Pha and Lang 2004; Bharatkumar et al. 2008; Hu et al. 2008; Perez et al. 2008; Sundaram et al. 2008; Rajpurohit et al. 2011; Dokku et al. 2013; Suh et al. 2013).

Therefore, incorporation of three BB resistant genes combination was taken up in the popular variety Jalmagna background by integrating marker-assisted backcrossing with phenotypic selection for development of pyramiding lines for the handicapped ecology.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{international}} financial and food crisis that started in 2008, strong emphasis has been made {{on the importance of}} Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) (or “transgenics”) under the claim that they could contribute to increase food productivity at a global level, as the world population is predicted to reach 9. 1 billion in the year 2050 and food demand is predicted to increase by as much as 50 % by 2030. GMOs are now {{at the forefront of the}} debates and struggles of different actors. Within civil society actors, it is possible to observe multiple, and sometime, conflicting roles. The role of international social movements and international NGOs in the GMO field of struggle is increasingly relevant. However, while many of these international civil society actors oppose this type of technological developments (alleging, for instance, environmental, health and even social harms), others have been reportedly cooperating with multinational corporations, retailers, and the biotechnology industry to promote GMOs. In this thesis research, I focus on analysing the role of “international civil society” in the GMO field of struggle by asking: “what are the organizing strategies of international civil society actors, such as NGOs and social movements, in GMO governance as a field of struggle?” To do so, I adopt a neo-Gramscian discourse approach based on the studies of Laclau and Mouffe. This theoretical approach affirms that in a particular hegemonic regime there are contingent alliances and forces that overpass the spheres of the state and the economy, while civil society actors can be seen as a “glue” to the way hegemony functions. Civil society is then the site where hegemony is consented, reproduced, sustained, channelled, but also where counter-hegemonic and emancipatory forces can emerge. Considering the importance of civil society actors in the construction of hegemony, I also discuss some important theories around them. The research combines, on the one hand, 36 in-depth interviews with a range of key civil society actors and scientists representing the GMO field of struggle in Brazil (19) and the UK (17), and, on the other hand, direct observations of two events: Rio+ 20 in Rio de Janeiro in 2012, and the first March Against Monsanto in London in 2013. A brief overview of the GMO field of struggle, from its beginning and especially focusing in the 1990 s when the process of hegemonic formation became clearer, serves as the basis to map who are the main actors in this field, how resource mobilization works, how political opportunities (“historical contingencies”) are discovered and exploited, which are the main discourses (“science” and “sustainability” - articulated by “biodiversity preservation”, “food security” and “ecological agriculture”) articulated among the actors to construct a collective identity in order to attract new potential allies around “GMOs” (“nodal point”), and which are the institutions and international regulations within these processes that enable hegemony to emerge in meaningful and <b>durable</b> hegemonic <b>links.</b> This mapping indicates that that the main strategies applied by {{the international}} civil society actors are influenced by two central historical contingencies in the GMO field of struggle: 1) First Multi-stakeholder Historical Contingency; and 2) “Supposed” Hegemony Stability. These two types of historical contingency in the GMO field of struggle encompass deeper hegemonic articulations and, because of that, they induce international civil society actors to rethink the way they articulate and position themselves within the field. Therefore, depending on one of those moments, they will apply one specific strategy of discourse articulation, such as: introducing a new discourse in hegemony articulation to capture the attention of the public and of institutions; endorsing new plural demands; increasing collective visibility; facilitating material articulations; sharing a common enemy identity; or spreading new ideological elements among the actors in the field of struggle...|$|R
