50|$|The current {{geodetic}} {{model of}} the earth used in the US is the North American Datum 1983, often called NAD83. The system is used to define <b>horizontal</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> of reference markers all over the US. Although created as a geocentric datum which originates {{at the center of}} the earth, more recent models of the earth have shown the origin to be 2.2 m off the centre of the earth. Elevation is recorded against the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88), which uses as its origin point Father Point, in Quebec, Canada. Error in the system is approximately 0.5 mm per mile, resulting in a total error of approximately 1 m from one corner of the continental US to the other. Due to these developments, the National Geodetic Survey is working on new geodetic systems.|$|E
40|$|For {{the future}} linear {{accelerator}} TESLA the demanded accuracy for the {{alignment of the}} components is 0. 5 mm horizontal and 0. 2 mm vertical, both on each 600 m section. Other accelerators require similar accuracies. These demands can not be fulfilled with open-air geodetic methods, mainly because of refraction. Therefore the RTRS (Rapid Tunnel Reference Surveyor), a measurement train performing overlapping multipoint alignment on a reference network is being developed. Two refraction-free realizations of this concept are being developed at the moment: the first one (GeLiS) measures the <b>horizontal</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> using stretched wires, combined with photogrammetric split-image sensors in a distance measurement configuration. In areas of the tunnel where the accelerator is following the earth curvature GeLiS measures the height using a new hydrostatic leveling system. The second concept (LiCAS) is based on laser straightness monitors (LSM) combined with frequency scanning interferometry (FSI) in an evacuated system. LiCAS measures both co-ordinates with respect to its LSM-beam and is thus suitable for geometrically straight tunnel sections. Both measurement systems will be placed on a train, which could do the reference survey autonomously...|$|E

40|$|The {{periodic}} quasigeostrophic equations are a coupled {{system of}} a second order elliptic equation for a streamfunction and first order hyperbolic equations for the relative potential vorticity and surface potential temperatures, on a three-dimensional domain which is periodic in both <b>horizontal</b> spatial <b>co-ordinates.</b> Such equations are used in both numerical and theoretical studies in meteorology and oceanography. In this paper Schauder estimates and a Schauder fixed point theorem are used to prove the existence and uniqueness of strong, that is classical, solutions of the periodic quasigeostrophic equations for a finite interval of time, which is inversely proportional to {{the sum of the}} norms of the initial vorticity and surface temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Field trials {{carried out}} at Tarbes {{airfield}} {{in the summer of}} 2002 offered the unique opportunity to compare the results of simultaneous wake-vortex measurements by the 2 -μm pulsed Doppler lidar from DLR, German Aerospace Research Center, and the 10 -μm continuous wave (cw) Doppler lidars from ONERA and QinetiQ. The discrepancies in vortex core position obtained from the data of the pulsed lidar and the cw lidars are 9 m for the vertical and 13 m for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> The accuracies of the vortex circulation measurements with the DLR and ONERA lidars are almost the same and equal 13 m 2 /s. This accuracy and the long-range capability of the pulsed lidar allows precise measurements over long periods from the moment of wake generation to a progressed state of vortex decay. Moreover, the influence of different atmospheric turbulence conditions and aircraft configurations on the wake-vortex circulation can be analyzed. This has been demonstrated out of ground effect under conditions of weak to moderate levels of turbulence...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} numerical time-domain model {{based on}} the linearised Euler equation is applied to idealised urban situations with elongated, isolated buildings beside a straight street with sound emissions. The paper aims at the investigation of principle relationships between the source–receiver geometry (street and building facades) and sound propagation under the consideration of ground and wind. By applying cyclic lateral boundary conditions for either one or both <b>horizontal</b> <b>co-ordinates,</b> two different idealised urban environments were considered: a single street and parallel streets. Numerical experiments were performed to elaborate the effects of different roof types, ground properties, wind flow, and turbulence in both urban environments with {{the focus on the}} back facades ('quiet' sides) of the buildings. As a result {{it was found that the}} back facades of flat-roof buildings are quieter than those of hip roof buildings despite equal cross-cut areas. The wind effect (resulting in quieter upwind and louder downwind facades) is more pronounced for hip-roof buildings. In the case of parallel streets upwind facades are slightly louder than downwind facades because they are simultaneously exposed to downwind propagating sound from the next parallel street...|$|E
40|$|Two {{video cameras}} were {{installed}} at Perranporth in August 1996, {{as part of}} the international ARGUS program. The video images recorded, were used to estimate the intertidal bathymetry. The aim was to develop a technique {{that could be used to}} estimate quantitative changes in the intertidal morphology over large spatial scales (km) and over short time scales (hours). The waves impinging on the beach face are highlighted in the unages. Time exposure images have a Shoreline Intensity Maximum, SLIM, where there is the greatest intensity of wave breaking. Standard deviation images highlight the shorebreak, due to the large fluctuations of pixel intensity. The location of this shoreline represents a height contour across beach. The shorebreak was used to estimate the intertidal bathymetry. Image processing techniques were used to extract the <b>horizontal</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> of the shoreUne from rectified images. The tidal height at the time of image exposure was used as the vertical co-ordinate. There is an vertical offset due to shoreline run-up, a function of gravity and infragravity band swash, wave set up and atmospheric and wind surge. To generate quantitative estimates of the bathymetry the image data must be corrected for this offset, it can be measured or calculated theoretically. The technique developed by Plant and Holman (1996) proved to be successful, a standard error of 0. 19 m was observed. Changes in the surveyed bathymetry were approximately 0. 4 m therefore these changes could be resolved. The twin peak of the standard deviation signal observed by Janssen (1997) was not found in the images. The differential image method developed for Perranporth by Davidson et al (1997) was used to estunate the intertidal bathymetry, the standard error was 0. 18 m. Time exposure and standard deviation images were processed. It was also calibrated to be used without the need for ground truth data. Additional error using this calibration may have been due to a phase shift in the tidal model and identification features other than the SLIM. A time series of the evolution of the intertidal bathymetry was generated. The quantitative changes were related to the wave cUmate over the survey period. The intertidal zone was featureless in the early stage (May) of the survey, this was characterised by higher waves. Under lower energy conditions at the end of the survey (August), a complex ridge rurmel formation had evolved. This was consistent with surveyed and visual observations. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} governments may use results-based budgeting to <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>horizontal</b> policies, {{and how a}} country's regime type may affect the incidence and success of such efforts. A rational choice institutional approach is used to frame the relations between "guardian " budget-makers in central budget agencies and "spender" civil servants in line departments. We undertake a quantitative analysis of primary budget documents of selected departments in the federal governments of Canada and the United States, and confirm our findings {{through a series of}} interviews with budget-makers, departmental officials and academics in both countries. Our findings suggest that, regardless of regime type, results-based budgeting is rarely used to help <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>horizontal</b> policies, for two main reasons. First, results-based budgeting's potential to co-ordinate is limited by methodological difficulties. In particular, {{it is often difficult to}} fully understand the causal theory behind programs and to fully measure all the relevant aspects of programs. Second, the motivation of budget-makers to so use results-based budgeting is limited by political disincentives. In particular, there are many disincentives to publicize the true objectives of programs and to reveal the actual performance of programs. On balance, the theoretical potential of and incentives to adopt "horizontal budgeting " is often outweighed by the practical difficulties and disincentives. This research contributes to existing knowledge of the public administration of expenditure budget-making by highlighting similarities between current budgetin...|$|R

40|$|Time-distance {{helioseismology}} {{has shown}} that f-mode travel times contain information about horizontal flows in the Sun. The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide a simple interpretation of these travel times. We study the interaction of surface gravity waves with horizontal flows in an incompressible, plane-parallel solar atmosphere. We show that for uniform flows less than roughly 250 m s 1, the travel-time shifts are linear in the flow amplitude. For stronger flows, perturbation theory up to third order is needed tomodelwaveforms. The case of small-amplitude spatially varying flows is treated using the first-order Born approximation. We derive two-dimensional Fréchet kernels that give the sensitivity of travel-time shifts to local flows. We show that the effect offlows on travel times depends on wave damping and on the direction from which the observations are made. The main physical effect is the advection of the waves by the flow rather than the advection of wave sources or the effect of flows on wave damping. We compare the two-dimensional sensitivity kernels with simplified three-dimensional kernels that only account for wave advection and assume a vertical line of sight. We find that the three-dimensional f-mode kernels approximately separate in the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>co-ordinates,</b> with the <b>horizontal</b> variations given by the simplified two-dimensional kernels. This consistency between quite different models gives us confidence in the usefulness of these kernels for interpreting quiet-Sun observations.

40|$|Purpose: We {{term the}} visual field {{position}} {{from which the}} pupil appears most nearly circular as the pupillary circular axis (PCAx). The aim was to determine and compare the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>co-ordinates</b> of the PCAx and optical axis from pupil shape and refraction information for only the horizontal meridian of the visual field. Method: The PCAx was determined from the changes with visual field angle in the ellipticity and orientation of pupil images out to ± 90 ° from fixation along the horizontal meridian for the right eyes of 30 people. This axis was compared with the optical axis determined from {{the changes in the}} astigmatic components of the refractions for field angles out to ± 35 ° in the same meridian. Results: The mean estimated horizontal and vertical field coordinates of the PCAx were (‒ 5. 3 ± 1. 9 °, ‒ 3. 2 ± 1. 5 °) compared with (‒ 4. 8 ± 5. 1 °, ‒ 1. 5 ± 3. 4 °) for the optical axis. The vertical co-ordinates of the two axes were just significantly different (p = 0. 03) but there was no significant correlation between them. Only the horizontal coordinate of the PCAx was significantly related to the refraction in the group. Conclusion: On average, the PCAx is displaced from the line-of-sight by about the same angle as the optical axis but there is more inter-subject variation in the position of the optical axis. When modelling the optical performance of the eye, it appears reasonable to assume that the pupil is circular when viewed along the line-of-sight...|$|R
