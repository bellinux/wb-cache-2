Oftentimes international actors readily offer aid and assistance but the governing legal framework remains uncertain. Thus, the current ILC drafting project presents a welcome opportunity to codify and concretise matters. This chapter analyses the ILC draft Article concerning external actors’ rights to offer assistance to disaster-stricken states.

An alternative reading challenges any such duty. This chapter analyses the ‘right to offer’ in its own terms, and {{in the context of the}} other draft Articles, and considers whether the draft provision materialises international solidarity...|$|E
