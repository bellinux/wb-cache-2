50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese</b> is {{also used}} every spring for the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, a sport {{considered}} to be dangerous due to the lengthy, steep Gloucestershire hillside (50% downhill gradient at over 200 yards) in which the event takes place.|$|E
50|$|The milk of Gloucesters is well-suited to cheese-making, being high {{in protein}} and with high butterfat, in {{particularly}} small globules. Single Gloucester and Stinking Bishop cheeses are made exclusively from Gloucester cattle milk. <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese</b> {{may now be}} made from the milk of any cattle, although it was traditionally made from that of Gloucesters.|$|E
50|$|Gloucester cattle, a rare breed, {{can still}} be found in and around Gloucestershire. They can be {{recognised}} by the white stripe that runs down the centre of {{their backs to the}} tip of their tails. The cattle are famous for producing milk for both Single <b>Gloucester</b> and <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheeses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cheese {{currently}} {{used in the}} event is 7-9 lb. <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester,</b> a hard <b>cheese</b> traditionally made in a wheel shape. Each is protected for the rolling by a wooden casing round the side and is decorated with ribbons {{at the start of}} the race. Formerly, three cheeses were presented by parishioners, and the cheeses were usually rolled by them. A collection is usually made now to purchase them as well as sweets and also to provide prize money. The current supplier is local cheesemaker Diana Smart and her son Rod, who have supplied the cheese since 1988.|$|R

50|$|From {{the top of}} {{the hill}} a 9 lb round of <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese</b> is rolled, and {{competitors}} start racing down the hill after it. The first person over the finish line at the bottom of the hill wins the cheese. In theory, competitors are aiming to catch the cheese; however, it has around a one-second head start and can reach speeds up to 70 mph (112 km/h), enough to knock over and injure a spectator. In the 2013 competition, a foam replica replaced the cheese for reasons of safety. The winner was given the prize after the competition.|$|E
5000|$|Brockworth {{is a large}} {{village in}} Gloucestershire, England, {{situated}} on the old Roman road that connects the City of Gloucester with Barnwood, Hucclecote and Cirencester. The population taken at the 2011 census was 7,387. [...] Since the mid-19th century, Brockworth has been known locally for the annual rolling of <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese</b> down Cooper's Hill. During World War II its Gloster Aircraft Company produced the famous Hawker Hurricane fighter, and following the war it gained renewed fame for producing several notable aircraft, including Britain's first jet aircraft, which was test flown here. It is also the birthplace of actor, comedian and writer Simon Pegg.|$|E
5000|$|Both types have {{a natural}} rind (outer layer) and a hard texture, but Single Gloucester is more crumbly, lighter in texture and lower in fat. Double Gloucester is allowed to age for longer periods than Single, {{and it has a}} {{stronger}} and more savoury flavour. It is also slightly firmer. The flower known as Ladyâ€™s Bedstraw (Galium verum), was responsible for the distinctively yellow colour of <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>Cheese.</b> In the United Kingdom today, of these two types of cheese, it is the [...] "Double Gloucester" [...] which {{is more likely to be}} sold in supermarkets. Both types are produced in round shapes, but Double Gloucester rounds are larger. Traditionally whereas the Double Gloucester was a prized cheese comparable in quality to the best Cheddar or Cheshire, and was exported out of the County, Single Gloucester tended to be consumed within Gloucestershire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason is}} not known for {{the two types of}} <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese</b> being called 'double' and 'single'. The main {{theories}} are: ...|$|R
50|$|Huntsman {{cheese is}} made with both Blue Stilton and <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cattle {{of similar}} type were {{numerous}} in the Cotswold Hills and the Severn Valley of England {{as early as}} the 13th century. They were valued for their milk (used for <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheeses),</b> for providing strong and docile draught oxen and finally for their beef.|$|R
50|$|Huntsman cheese, {{also known}} as Stilchester, is made with {{alternating}} layers of <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> and Stilton.|$|R
50|$|Cheshire was {{the most}} popular cheese on the market in the late 18th century. In 1758 the Royal Navy ordered that ships be stocked with Cheshire and <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheeses.</b> By 1823, Cheshire cheese {{production}} was estimated at 10,000 tonnes per year; in around 1870, it was estimated as 12,000 tons per year.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{else can}} be the consequence," [...] said Herbert, in explanation, [...] "if he will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand--and {{everywhere}} else--can't expect {{to get through a}} <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> without hurting himself." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> {{is often}} blended with other ingredients. One variety made by {{blending}} with chives and spring onions has been marketed as Cotswold cheese, {{though this is}} not a traditional English cheese name. This cheese is supposedly coloured similarly to Cotswold stone.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>Double</b> <b>Gloucester</b> sold in UK {{supermarkets}} is slab cheese, made {{in large}} creameries operated by major dairy {{companies such as}} Dairy Crest. It is normally sold as a supermarket own brand. This version of the cheese is pasteurised but not processed.|$|R
5000|$|He kept more state {{than the}} King; he never {{permitted}} a gentleman to be seated {{in his presence}} (which King George did as an exceptional favour) and expected to be served coffee by the ladies of any party he attended, {{and that they would}} stand while he drank it. The general estimate of his capacity is given by his nickname, [...] "Silly Billy"; he was also called [...] "Slice of Gloucester" [...] and [...] "Cheese", a reference to <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
50|$|Annatto, {{made from}} {{the seeds of the}} achiote tree. Annato {{contains}} carotenoids, the same ingredient that gives carrots and other vegetables their orange colour. Annato has been used to dye certain cheeses in Britain, particularly <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese,</b> since the 16th century. It is now commonly used to colour American cheese, snack foods, breakfast cereal, butter and margarine. It is used as a body paint by native populations in Central and South America. In India, women often put it, under the name sindoor, on their hairline to indicate that they are married.|$|R
50|$|People {{associate}} certain colours {{with certain}} flavours, and the colour of food {{can influence the}} perceived flavour in anything from candy to wine. Since orange is popularly associated with good flavour, many companies add orange food colouring to improve the appearance of their packaged foods. Orange pigments and dyes, synthetic or natural, are added to many orange sodas and juices, cheeses (particularly cheddar <b>cheese,</b> <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese,</b> and American cheese); snack foods, butter and margarine; breakfast cereals, ice cream, yoghurt, jam and candy. It is also often added to children's medicine, and to chicken feed to make the egg yolks more orange.|$|R

5000|$|In the past, {{the dried}} plants {{were used to}} stuff mattresses, as the {{coumarin}} scent of the plants acts as a flea repellant. The flowers were also used to coagulate milk in cheese manufacture and, in Gloucestershire, to colour the <b>cheese</b> <b>double</b> <b>Gloucester.</b> The plant {{is also used to}} make red madder-like and yellow dyes.In Denmark, the plant (known locally as [...] ) is traditionally used to infuse spirits, making the uniquely Danish drink [...]|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes, {{when he is}} {{sure that}} I have found him out, {{and that there is}} no chance of money, he writes to inform me that I have got rid of him at last. He has enlisted into the Company's service, and is off {{directly}} - but he wants a cheese. He is informed by the serjeant that it is essential to his prospects in the regiment that he should take out a single <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese,</b> weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds. Eight or nine shillings would buy it. He does not ask for money, after what has passed; but if he calls at nine, to-morrow morning may he hope to find a cheese? And is there anything he can do to show his gratitude in Bengal? ...|$|R
50|$|Annatto {{has been}} a {{traditional}} colorant for <b>Gloucester</b> <b>cheese</b> since the 16th century. During the summer, {{the high levels of}} carotene in the grass would have given the milk an orange tint which was carried through into the cheese. This orange hue came to be regarded as an indicator of the best cheese, spurring producers of inferior cheese to use annatto in order to replicate it. The custom of adding annatto then spread {{to other parts of the}} UK, for cheeses such as Chesire and Red Leicester, as well as colored cheddar made in Scotland. Many cheddars are produced in both white and red (orange) varieties, with the latter being more popular despite the only difference between the two being the presence of annatto as a coloring. That practice has extended to many modern processed cheese products, such as American cheese and Velveeta.|$|R
500|$|In 1813, {{with the}} tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously {{consider}} the question of Charlotte's marriage.
