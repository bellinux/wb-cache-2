40|$|Not a {{long time}} ago, {{marketing}} was almost unrecognised and surely marginalised conception for libraries. Nowadays the situation is changing for the better. The libraries tend to slowly change their old passive management strategy for active market behaviour, {{there is a tendency}} to â go an <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> the clientâ. In my opinion it is the only way how to compare favourably in current competitive environment and not become obsolete and outmoded. The aim of this case study is to compare the marketing of two different sorts of libraries â academic library and public library. For the academic library we have chosen the SWOT analysis type of survey, for the public library the â four Pâ method. Considering the dissimilarity of those two sorts of libraries we regard the methods as the most appropriate. The objective of our case study is to verify the presumption that the public library has to make much bigger effort in its active market behaviour than the academic library...|$|R
5000|$|Because Offaly had {{finished}} so strongly {{in all of}} their games, they entered the All Ireland Final on September 4, 1994 wearing the unwelcome [...] "favorites" [...] tag. Nonetheless, it was Limerick who set the pace, and at times seemed about to overwhelm Offaly. Éamonn Cregan's philosophy of direct first-time hurling, keeping it simple, paid dividends as Offaly had more left in the tank in the dramatic finale. Offaly scored only 1-2 from frees and 2-14 from open play. Limerick's relatively poor return (2-9 from play, 0-4 from frees) was due to Brian Whelahan, Kevin Martin, Martin Hanamy, Kevin Kinahan & co. hunting in packs. Offaly's deft touches and flicks forced Limerick to go the <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> their scores. Moreover, having established a half time lead of 2-8 to 1-5, Tom Ryan's team only added five {{points in the second}} half. This was indicative of how Offaly gradually started to get to grips.|$|R
5000|$|The {{word here}} {{translated}} as mile {{refers to the}} Roman definition of 1000 paces, slightly shorter than a modern mile.

Miles would only have been used by the imperial government and the local occupying forces, which further links this verse with imperial repression.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test Rosabeth Moss Ranter’s (1997) {{structural}} theory of organisational behaviour in public hospital’s nursing manager population in the Northern Province. Specifically, it is the examination of the relationship between nurse managers’ perceptions of organisational commitment and job-related empowerment in their current work environment, a replication study of McDermott (1994), and Dubuc (1995). Ranter (1993) sees power in the organisation as being derived from the structural conditions, not from personal characteristics or socialisation effects. Therefore the determination of how much power anybody has in the organisation depends on formal characteristics of the job, and the development of informal alliances; these influence access to the sources of job-related empowerment i. e. information, support, resources and opportunity for growth and advancement. Organisational commitment for the {{purpose of this}} study is defined as “making the welfare of the organisation as one’s responsibility; the willingness to go an <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of the organisation or the client without being exploited”. A total sample of nurse managers in-charge of public hospitals in the Northern Province and their deputies was targeted (58...|$|R

5000|$|Giana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi {{say that}} the sharing economy {{promotes}} and prioritizes cheap fares and low costs rather than personal relationships, which is tied to similar issues in crowdsourcing. For example, Zipcar is advertised as a ride-sharing service, but it's been brought into consideration that the consumers reap similar benefits from Zipcar as they would from, say, a hotel. In this example, there is minimal social interaction going on and the primary concern is the low cost. Other examples many include myriad other sharing economies such as AirBnB or Uber. Because of this, the [...] "sharing economy" [...] may not be about sharing but rather about access. Giana Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi say the [...] "sharing" [...] economy has taught people to prioritize cheap and easy access over interpersonal communication, {{and the value of}} going the <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> those interactions has diminished. In light of the discussion on sharing economy versus access economy, the business models of the sharing economy platforms are also under examination. The escrow-like model practiced by several of the largest sharing economy platforms, in which they facilitate and handle contracting and payments on behalf of their subscribers, further underlines an emphasis on access and transaction rather than on sharing.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. This study {{examined}} if compassionate love (CL) predicts HIV disease progression and transmission risk. Scientific study of CL emerged with Underwood’s working model of other-centered CL, defining five criteria: free choice, cognitive understanding, valuing/empowering, openness/receptivity for spirituality, and {{response of the}} heart. Method. This 10 -year cohort study collected 6 -monthly interviews/essays on coping with HIV and trauma of 177 people with HIV in South Florida. Secondary qualitative content analysis on other-centered CL inductively added the component of CL towards self. Deductively, we coded {{the presence of the}} five criteria of CL and rated the benefit of CL for the recipient on a 6 -point Likert scale. Growth-curve modeling (reduced to 4 years due to cohort effects) investigated if CL predicts CD 4 slope (HIV disease progression) and cumulative viral load detection (transmission risk). Results. Valuing/empowering and cognitive understanding were the essential criteria for CL to confer long-term benefits. CL had a higher benefit for recipients if given out of free choice. High scores of CL towards self were reciprocal with receiving (93 %) and giving (77 %) other-centered CL. Conversely, those rated low on CL towards self were least likely to score high on receiving (38 %) and giving (49 %) other-centered CL. Growth-curve modeling showed that CL towards self predicted 4 -year cumulative undetectable viral load (independent from sociocultural differences, substance use disorder, baseline CD 4 and viral load). Those high versus low on CL self were 2. 25 {{times more likely to have}} undetectable viral load at baseline and 1. 49 times more likely to maintain undetectable viral load over time. CL towards self predicted CD 4 preservation after controlling for differences in CL giving. Conclusions. CL towards self is potentially the seed of being expressive and receptive of CL. Health care professionals prepared to walk the <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> <b>for</b> those who neglect and isolate themselves may break a vicious circle since those lacking CL self were least likely to receive CL from others. Future studies should examine whether any enhancement of CL towards self may translate into slower disease progression and reduction of transmission risk...|$|R
