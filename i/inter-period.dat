40|$|Given {{the growing}} {{attention}} to quality improvement, comparative effectiveness research, and pragmatic trials embedded within learning health systems, {{the use of the}} cluster randomization design is bound to increase. The number of clusters available for randomization is often limited in such trials. Designs that incorporate pre-intervention measurements (e. g. cluster cross-over, repeated parallel arm, and stepped wedge designs) can substantially reduce the required numbers of clusters by decreasing between-cluster sources of variation. However, there are substantial risks associated with few clusters, including increased probability of chance imbalances and type I and type II error, limited perceived or actual generalizability, and fewer options for statistical analysis. Furthermore, current sample size methods for the stepped wedge design make a strong underlying assumption with respect to the correlation structure-in particular, that the intracluster and <b>inter-period</b> correlations are equal. This is in contrast with methods for the cluster cross-over design that explicitly allow for a smaller <b>inter-period</b> correlation. Failing to similarly allow for the <b>inter-period</b> correlation in the design of a stepped wedge trial may yield perilously low sample sizes. Further methodological and empirical work is required to inform sample size methods and guidance for the stepped wedge trial and to provide minimum thresholds for this design...|$|E

The standard time-weighted mean return (or {{geometric mean}} return) is generally used to report returns on investors' retirement portfolios. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the standard time-weighted mean return and point out additional deficiencies in the time-weighted mean in this situation, which have not been addressed in the literature. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides examples that point out additional deficiencies that arise using geometric mean returns as estimates of an individual investor's performance. Findings – With <b>inter-period</b> cash flows the dollar-weighted return can be affected by both timing and the sequence of the asset return series even if the investor has constant inflows or outflows of capital. In contrast for these same asset return arrays, the time-weighted mean return measure may be unaffected by these important variations in the return arrays, and thus may misrepresent actual investor results.

40|$|The optimization-based {{design of}} {{renewable}} energy systems is a computationally demanding task {{because of the high}} temporal fluctuation of supply and demand time series. In order to reduce these time series, the aggregation of typical operation periods has become common. The problem with this method is that these aggregated typical periods are modeled independently and cannot exchange energy. Therefore, seasonal storage cannot be adequately taken into account, although this will be necessary for energy systems with a high share of renewable generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel mathematical description for storage inventories based on the superposition of <b>inter-period</b> and intra-period states. <b>Inter-period</b> states connect the typical periods and are able to account their sequence.

Agrawala Department of Computer Science This thesis {{focuses on}} the twin goals of proposing scheduling models that are apposite for Real-Time Systems and designing efficient algorithms for queries of interest in these models. Our models find applications in diverse areas ranging from real-time process scheduling and database management to robotics and machine control. The unique feature of our scheduling models is the explicit accommodation of process parameter variability; in particular, we analyze the effect of nonconstant execution times on schedulability queries. Our investigations commence with the study of relatively straightforward, but inflexible, Static Schedulability predicates, proceed through extremely flexible, though computationally "hard" CoStatic Schedulability queries and culminate {{in the analysis of}} Parametric Schedulability specifications. We establish that the scheduling flexibility afforded by Co-Static and Parametric specifications comes at a price; such specifications can be decided efficiently only for restricted constraint classes. Although our models were developed primarily for periodic job-sets with intraperiod constraints, we show that there is a natural extension to accommodate job sets with <b>inter-period</b> constraints as well. We use fixed-point theorems to develop a simple algorithm for static scheduling in job-sets with <b>inter-period</b> constraints. c fl Copyright by K.

40|$|Online {{broadcasting}} substantially {{affects the}} production, distribution, and profit of TV series. In addition, online word-of-mouth significantly affects {{the diffusion of}} TV series. Because on-demand streaming rates {{are the most important}} factor that influences the earnings of online video suppliers, streaming statistics and forecasting trends are valuable. In this paper, we investigate the effects of periodic impulsive stimulation and pre-launch promotion on on-demand streaming dynamics. We consider imbalanced audience feverish distribution using an impulsive susceptible-infected-removed(SIR) -like model. In addition, we perform a correlation analysis of online buzz volume based on Baidu Index data. We propose a PI-SIR model to evolve audience dynamics and translate them into on-demand streaming fluctuations, which can be observed and comprehended by online video suppliers. Six South Korean TV series datasets are used to test the model. We develop a coarse-to-fine two-step fitting scheme to estimate the model parameters, first by fitting <b>inter-period</b> accumulation and then by fitting inner-period feverish distribution. We find that audience members display similar viewing habits. That is, they seek new episodes every update day but fade away. This outcome means that impulsive intensity plays a crucial role in on-demand streaming diffusion. In addition, the initial audience size and online buzz are significant factors. On-demand streaming fluctuation is highly correlated with online buzz fluctuation. To stimulate audience attention and interpersonal diffusion, it is worthwhile to invest in promotion near update days. Strong pre-launch promotion is also a good marketing tool to improve overall performance. It is not advisable for online video providers to promote several popular TV series on the same update day. <b>Inter-period</b> accumulation is a feasible forecasting tool to predict the future trend of the on-demand streaming amount.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in international capital markets. In Chapter I, we examine the herd trading behavior of institutional investors trading around the world. Using a new transaction-level trades database of 531 U. S. institutional investors trading across 37 countries for the period 2002 - 2009, we find robust evidence of intra- and <b>inter-period</b> herdings at the monthly frequency. We find no evidence that trades by institutions in our sample destabilize local stock markets. Further analysis shows that: (i) in the buy side, both intra- and <b>inter-period</b> herdings are more pronounced in countries with weaker information environments; and (ii) in the sell side, intra-period herding is more pronounced in countries with stronger information environments, whereas <b>inter-period</b> herding is not significantly related to information environments. In Chapter II, we document {{that the degree of}} co-movement between bilateral USD ex- change rates has increased substantially since the introduction of the euro in 1999 and investigate what drives the increased co-movement. For each of our 33 sampled bilateral USD exchange rates, we measure the degree of co-movement using the R-square from re- gressing weekly exchange rate changes on the weekly world exchange rate factor. Our results show that, for the majority of sample exchange rates, the R-square has increased substan- tially over the period 1999 - 2010. Specifically, the average R-square was 0. 15 in 1999, but it increased to 0. 47 by more than 200 % in 2010. Further analysis reveals that the rising influence of the euro relative to USD over a third currency can explain most of the increase in the measured co-movement over time. In Chapter III, we examine the level and trend of U. S. domestic market integration. For each of our sample states, we construct the state (market) portfolio comprising public firms headquartered within the state and compute R-square, our measure of integration, from regressing state portfolio returns on national stock market factors. Using weekly returns, we estimate the regression for each year of our sample period 1963 - 2008. The key findings are: (i) For the majority of sample states, the R-square exhibits a statistically significant upward trend, implying that U. S. domestic stock markets were not fully integrated and have been integrating during the sample period; (ii) consistent with the previous result, the explanatory power of the state factor over individual stock returns has been decreasing for the majority of states; and (iii) the increasing integration of U. S. domestic stock markets is associated with the decreasing home state bias, suggesting that investors' pursuit of nation- wide investment opportunities may be a significant driver of domestic financial integration.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the nature and extent of {{instability}} of capital asset pricing model (CAPM) beta in a small emerging capital market. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Inter-period</b> as well as intra beta instability are examined. <b>Inter-period</b> instability is examined by Mann-Whitney z-scores and Blume’s regressions. Intra-period beta instability is examined using Bruesch-Pagan LM test and Chow break point test. Robustness tests are performed applying time-varying parameter models. Findings – Beta instability increases with increase in holding (sample) periods. There is evidence of <b>inter-period</b> as well as intra-period beta instability. Analysis of the full eight-year interval reveals a very high incidence of beta instability, namely, about 26 per cent of the individual stocks tested and about 31 per cent of individual stocks have structural break. The extent of beta instability does not significantly decline when corrected for non-synchronous trading and thin trading as represented by Dimson beta. However, the extent of beta instability is similar to that of developed market. Time-varying parameter model under Kalman filter approach using AR(1) specification performs better than any other models in terms of in sample forecast errors. Dominance of AR(1) approach suggests that stock betas in DSE are time varying, and shocks to the conditional beta have some degree of persistence which ultimately reverts to a mean. This result is in contrast to the findings of Faff et al. revealing the dominance of Random Walk specification in Australian market, suggesting that shocks to stock beta in Australian market persist indefinitely into the future. These contrasting findings may indicate that beta instability in different markets and for different stocks in the same market are of different nature and different models may be suitable for different markets and different stocks in the same market in capturing the time-varying nature of beta coefficients. Research limitations/implications – This study covers only 110 stocks of Dhaka Stock Exchange. It can be extended to include more stocks. The study can also be done in other developing markets. Originality/value – While the issues of beta instability have been extensively explored for developed markets, evidence for emerging markets is less readily available. The present study contributes to the emerging market literature on beta instability by investigating the extent of beta instability and its time-varying properties in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), Bangladesh. Understanding the systematic risk behaviour of individual stocks in DSE is important for both local and international investors. With the saturation of investment opportunities in developed markets due to their high integration, and with the enhanced deregulation and liberalization of emerging economies, emerging financial markets like DSE provide suitable and a relatively safe investment environment for international investors and fund managers seeking global diversification for better risk-return trade-offs. When most of the world markets declined during the recent global financial crisis, stock prices in DSE experienced a continuous rise. This makes it more interesting as an emerging market to study beta instability...|$|E

There is long-term ex-post inequality of opportunity if individuals who exert the same effort have different permanent incomes. In comparison, the ex-ante approach focuses on the expected permanent income for individuals with identical circumstances.

By totally removing inter-core communication overhead, a shorter period can be applied and system throughput can be improved. Our basic idea is to let tasks with intra-period data dependencies transform to <b>inter-period</b> data dependencies so as to overlap the execution of computation and inter-core communication tasks. To solve the problem, we first perform analysis and obtain the bounds of the times needed to reschedule each task. Then we formulate the scheduling problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) model and obtain an optimal schedule. We perform simulations {{on a set of}} benchmarks from both real-life streaming applications and synthetic task graphs. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant reduction in schedule length and improve the memory usage compared with the previous work.
