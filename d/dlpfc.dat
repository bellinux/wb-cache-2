5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<b>DLPFC),</b> anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the <b>DLPFC,</b> inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
2500|$|The first cognitive/associative pathway {{proposes a}} pathway from the <b>DLPFC,</b> into the dlcaudate, {{followed}} by a projection into the lateral dosomedial GPi, and rostral SNr before projecting into the lateral VAmc and medial pars magnocellularis.|$|E
2500|$|The oculomotor loop {{involved}} projections {{from the}} frontal eye fields, the {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (<b>DLPFC),</b> and the posterior parietal cortex into the caudate, into the caudal dorsomedial GPi and ventrolateral SNr, finally looping back into the cortex through the lateral ventralis anterior pars magnocellularis.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{inconsistent}} {{findings in}} GWAS, multiple studies have undertaken {{the approach of}} analyzing SNPs in biological pathways. [...] Signaling pathways traditionally associated with bipolar disorder that have been supported by these studies include CRH signaling, cardiac β-adrenergic signaling, Phospholipase C signaling, glutamate receptor signaling, cardiac hypertrophy signaling, Wnt signaling, Notch signaling, and endothelin 1 signaling. [...] Of the 16 genes identified in these pathways, three {{were found to be}} dysregulated in the <b>DLPFC</b> in post-mortem studies, CACNA1C, GNG2, and ITPR2.|$|E
50|$|<b>DLPFC</b> {{may also}} be {{associated}} with human intelligence. However, even when correlations are found between the <b>DLPFC</b> and human intelligence, {{that does not mean}} that all human intelligence is a function of the <b>DLPFC.</b> In other words, this region may be attributed to general intelligence on a broader scale as well as very specific roles, but not all roles. For example, using imaging studies like PET and fMRI indicate <b>DLPFC</b> involvement in deductive, syllogistic reasoning. Specifically, when involved in activities that require syllogistic reasoning, left <b>DLPFC</b> areas are especially and consistently active.|$|E
50|$|The dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (<b>DLPFC)</b> works in {{conjunction}} with the ACC, and acts as the overseer of the reaction to the racial conflict. It is the main region activated in top-down processing. The <b>DLPFC</b> controls the emotional response through interactions with the amygdala connected through the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The <b>DLPFC</b> suppresses the amygdala activity to lower the initial racial bias and resolve the conflict. Suppression of the <b>DLPFC</b> through TMS techniques has made the patients increase their expression of racial bias. The <b>DLPFC</b> function is determined by internal beliefs and awareness of societal attitudes.|$|E
50|$|There {{have also}} been some {{suggestions}} that {{the function of the}} <b>DLPFC</b> in verbal and spatial working memory is lateralised into the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Smith, Jonides and Koeppe (1996) observed a lateralisation of <b>DLPFC</b> activations during verbal and visual working memory. Verbal working memory tasks mainly activated the left <b>DLPFC</b> and visual working memory tasks mainly activated the right <b>DLPFC.</b> Murphy et al. (1998) also found that verbal working memory tasks activated the right and left <b>DLPFC,</b> whereas spatial working memory tasks predominantly activated the left <b>DLPFC.</b> Reuter-Lorenz et al. (2000) found that activations of the <b>DLPFC</b> showed prominent lateralisation of verbal and spatial working memory in young adults, whereas in older adults this lateralisation was less noticeable. It was proposed that this reduction in lateralisation could be due to recruitment of neurons from the opposite hemisphere to compensate for neuronal decline with ageing.|$|E
50|$|As <b>DLPFC</b> {{undergoes}} long maturational changes, one {{change that}} {{has been attributed to}} <b>DLPFC</b> for making early cognitive advances is the increasing level of neurotransmitter dopamine in <b>DLPFC.</b> Studies where the adult macaques' Dopamine receptors were blocked, it was seen that the adult macaques had deficit in the A-not-B task, as if the whole DFPLC was taken out altogether. Similar situation was seen when the macaques were injected with MPTP injection as it reduces the level of Dopamine in the <b>DLPFC.</b> Even though, there have been no physiological studies about involvement of cholinergic actions in sub-cortical areas, behavioral studies indicate that neurotransmitter acetylcholine is essential for working memory function of the <b>DLPFC.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>DLPFC</b> {{is known}} for its {{involvement}} in the executive functions, which is an umbrella term for the management of cognitive processes, including working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning. A couple of tasks have been very prominent in the research on the <b>DLPFC,</b> such as the A-not-B task, the delayed response task and object retrieval tasks. The behavioral task that is most strongly linked to <b>DLPFC</b> is the combined A-not-B/delayed response task, in which the subject has to find a hidden object after a certain delay. This task requires holding information in mind (working memory), which is believed {{to be one of the}} functions of <b>DLPFC.</b> The importance of <b>DLPFC</b> for working memory was strengthened by studies with adult macaques. Lesions that destroyed <b>DLPFC</b> disrupted the macaques’ performance of the A-not-B/delayed response task, whereas lesions to other brain parts did not impair their performance on this task.|$|E
5000|$|The dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (<b>DLPFC</b> or DL-PFC) is an area in the prefrontal cortex of the brain of humans and {{non-human}} primates. It {{is one of the}} most recently evolved parts of the human brain. It undergoes a prolonged period of maturation which lasts until adulthood. The <b>DLPFC</b> is not an anatomical structure, but rather a functional one. It lies in the middle frontal gyrus of humans (i.e., lateral part of Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 46). In macaque monkeys, it is around the principal sulcus (i.e., in Brodmann's area 46). Other sources consider that <b>DLPFC</b> is attributed anatomically to BA 9 and 46 [...] and BA 8, 9 and 10. [...] The <b>DLPFC</b> has connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (specifically, the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex (including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas). The <b>DLPFC</b> is also the end point for the dorsal pathway (stream), which is concerned with how to interact with stimuli. An important function of the <b>DLPFC</b> is the executive functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstractreasoning. However, the <b>DLPFC</b> is not exclusively responsible for the executive functions. All complex mental activity requires the additional cortical and subcortical circuits with which the <b>DLPFC</b> is connected. The <b>DLPFC</b> is also the highest cortical area that is involved in motor planning, organization and regulation.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, {{studies by}} Pierrot-Deseilligny et al. {{correlated}} high error rates of AS to specific lesions in the {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (<b>DLPFC).</b> In this study, patients with unilateral infarctions of the posterior parietal lobe were compared against infarctions in 3 frontal regions: the supplementary motor area, frontal eye fields (FEF), and the <b>DLPFC.</b> Only patients with infarctions of the <b>DLPFC</b> showed statistically significant error rates.|$|E
50|$|Todd A. Hare et al. use {{functional}} MRI {{techniques to}} show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<b>DLPFC)</b> are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the <b>DLPFC.</b> The study found that a lack of self-control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the <b>DLPFC.</b> Hare’s study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective <b>DLPFC.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>DLPFC</b> is {{involved}} in both risky and moral decision making; when individuals have to make moral decisions like how to distribute limited resources, the <b>DLPFC</b> is activated. This region is also active when {{costs and benefits of}} alternative choices are of interest. Similarly, when options for choosing alternatives are present, the <b>DLPFC</b> evokes a preference towards the most equitable option and suppresses the temptation to maximize personal gain.|$|E
50|$|<b>DLPFC</b> is not {{required}} for {{the memory of a}} single item. Thus, damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does not impair recognition memory. Nevertheless, if two items must be compared from memory, the involvement of <b>DLPFC</b> is required. People with damaged <b>DLPFC</b> are not able to identify a picture they had seen, after some time, when given the opportunity to choose from two pictures. Moreover, these subjects also failed in Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test as they lose track of the currently correct rule and persistently organize their cards in the previously correct rule. In addition, as <b>DLPFC</b> deals with waking thought and reality testing, it is not active when one is asleep. Likewise, <b>DLPFC</b> is most frequently related to the dysfunction of drive, attention and motivation. Patients with minor <b>DLPFC</b> damage display disinterest in their surroundings and are deprived of spontaneity in language as well as behavior. Patients may also be less alert than normal to people and events they know. Damage to this region in a person also leads to the lack of motivation to do things for themselves and/or for others.|$|E
50|$|Exposure {{to severe}} stress {{may also be}} linked to damage in the <b>DLPFC.</b> More specifically, acute stress has a {{negative}} impact on the higher cognitive function known as working memory (WM), which is also traced to be a function of the <b>DLPFC.</b> In an experiment, researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the neural activity in healthy individuals who participated in tasks while in a stressful environment. When stress successfully impacted the subjects, their neural activity showed reduced working memory related activity in the <b>DLPFC.</b> These findings not only demonstrate the importance of the <b>DLPFC</b> region in relation to stress, but they also suggest that the <b>DLPFC</b> {{may play a role in}} other psychiatric disorders. In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for example, daily sessions of right dorsolateral prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at a frequency of 10 Hz resulted in more effective therapeutic stimulation.|$|E

50|$|Along with {{regions of}} the brains such as the limbic system, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex deals heavily with major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD). The <b>DLPFC</b> may contribute to depression due to being involved with the disorder on an emotional level during the suppression stage. While working memory tasks seem to activate the <b>DLPFC</b> normally, its decreased grey matter volume correlates to its decreased activity. The <b>DLPFC</b> may also have ties to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in their functions with depression. This {{can be attributed to}} how the DLPFC’s cognitive functions can also involve emotions, and the VMPFC’s emotional effects can also involve self-awareness or self-reflection. Damage or lesion to the <b>DLPFC</b> can also lead to increased expression of depression symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The <b>DLPFC</b> {{may also}} be {{involved}} in the act of deception and lying, which is thought to inhibit normal tendency to truth telling. Research also suggests that using TMS on the <b>DLPFC</b> can impede a person's ability to lie or to tell the truth.|$|E
5000|$|PV-expressing interneurons {{represent}} approximately 25% of GABAergic {{cells in}} the primate <b>DLPFC.</b> [...] Other calcium-binding protein markers are calretinin (most abundant subtype in <b>DLPFC,</b> about 50%) and calbindin. Interneurons are also divided into subgroups by the expression of neuropeptides such as somatostatin, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>DLPFC</b> is {{composed}} of spatial selective neurons, it has a neural circuitry that encompasses {{the entire range of}} sub-functions necessary to carry out an integrated response, such as: sensory input, retention in short-term memory, and motor signaling. Historically, the <b>DLPFC</b> was defined by its connection to: the superior temporal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, the anterior and posterior cingulate, the premotor cortex, the retrosplenial cortex, and the neocerebellum. These connections allow the <b>DLPFC</b> to regulate the activity of those regions, as well as to receive information from and be regulated by those regions.|$|E
50|$|Among the prefrontal lobes, the <b>DLPFC</b> {{seems to}} be the one that has the least direct {{influence}} on social behavior, yet it does seem to give clarity and organization to social cognition. The <b>DLPFC</b> seems to contribute to social functions through the operation of its main speciality the executive functions, for instance when handling complex social situations. Social areas in which the role of the <b>DLPFC</b> is investigated are, amongst others, social perspective taking and inferring the intentions of other people, or theory of mind; the suppression of selfish behavior, and commitment in a relationship.|$|E
5000|$|Substance {{abuse of}} drugs, or {{substance}} use disorder (SUD), may correlate with {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} dysfunction. Those who abuse drugs {{have been shown to}} engage in increased risky behavior, possibly correlating with a dysfunction of the <b>DLPFC.</b> The executive controlling functions of the <b>DLPFC</b> in individuals who display drug abuse may have a connection that is lessen from risk factoring areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. This weakened connection is even shown in healthy subjects, such as a patient who continued to make risky decisions with a disconnect between their <b>DLPFC</b> and insula. Lesions of the <b>DLPFC</b> may result in irresponsibility and freedom from inhibitions, [...] and the abuse of drugs can invoke the same response of willingness or inspiration to engage in daring activity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>DLPFC</b> {{may also}} be {{involved}} in threat-induced anxiety. In one experiment, {{participants were asked to}} rate themselves as behaviorally inhibited or not. Those who rated themselves as behaviorally inhibited, moreover, showed greater tonic (resting) activity in the right-posterior <b>DLPFC.</b> Such activity is able to be seen through Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Individuals who are behaviorally inhibited are more likely to experience feelings of stress and anxiety when faced with a particularly threatening situation. In one theory, anxiety susceptibility may increase as a result of present vigilance. Evidence for this theory includes neuroimaging studies that demonstrate <b>DLPFC</b> activity when an individual experiences vigilance. More specifically, it is theorized that threat-induced anxiety {{may also be}} connected to deficits in resolving problems, which leads to uncertainty. When an individual experiences uncertainty, there is increased activity in the <b>DLPFC.</b> In other words, such activity {{can be traced back to}} threat-induced anxiety.|$|E
50|$|The dorsal stream {{activates}} by {{the presence}} of response conflict. The dmPFC relays information on past reinforcement to the <b>dlPFC,</b> which initiates selective attention. <b>dlPFC</b> influences action and emotion by weighing the importance of competing goals/representations in the temporal cortex. Representations opposite to what the stimulus originally elicited are rendered more salient and compete with the original representations. These competitions influence the modulation of activity in the amygdala and the mPFC.|$|E
5000|$|Alcohol {{can create}} {{an effect on}} the {{functionality}} of the prefrontal cortex and can contribute to the regulation of alcoholism. As the ACC works to inhibit any inappropriate behaviors through processing information to the executive network of the <b>DLPFC,</b> as noted before this disruption in communication can lead to these actions being made. In a task known as Cambridge risk task, SUD participants have been shown to have a lower activation of their <b>DLPFC.</b> Specifically in a test related to alcoholism, a task called the Wheel of Fortune (WOF) had adolescents with a family history of alcoholism present lower <b>DLPFC</b> activation. Adolescents that have had no family members with a history of alcoholism did not exhibit the same decrease of activity.|$|E
50|$|BA46 {{is known}} as middle frontal area 46. In the human brain it {{occupies}} approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<b>DLPFC),</b> although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. The <b>DLPFC</b> also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex.|$|E
50|$|For neuropathic pain, {{for which}} there is little {{effective}} treatment, high-frequency (HF) repetitive TMS (rTMS) appears effective. For treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, HF-rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<b>DLPFC)</b> appears effective and low-frequency (LF) rTMS of the right <b>DLPFC</b> has probable efficacy. The Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has endorsed rTMS for treatment resistant MDD. As of October 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of rTMS as an effective treatment for clinical depression.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{supporting}} {{evidence suggests that}} the <b>DLPFC</b> may also play a role in conflict-induced behavioral adjustment, for instance when an individual decides what to do when faced with conflicting rules. One way in which this has been tested is through the Stroop test, in which subjects are shown a name of a color printed in colored ink and then are asked to name the color of the ink as fast as possible. Conflict arises when the color of the ink does not match the name of the printed color. During this experiment, tracking of the subjects’ brain activity showed a noticeable activity within the <b>DLPFC.</b> The activation of the <b>DLPFC</b> correlated with the behavioral performance, which suggests that this region maintains the high demands of the task to resolve conflict, and thus in theory plays a role in taking control.|$|E
50|$|Schizophrenia may be {{partially}} {{attributed to a}} lack in activity in the frontal lobe. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is especially under active when a person suffers from chronic schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is also related to lack of dopamine neurotransmitter in the frontal lobe. The <b>DLPFC</b> dysfunctions are unique among the schizophrenia patients as those that are diagnosed with depression do not tend {{to have the same}} abnormal activation in the <b>DLPFC</b> during working-memory related tasks. Working Memory is dependent upon the DLPFC’S stability and functionally, thus reduced activation of it causes for schizophrenic patients to perform poorly on tasks involving working memory. The poor performance contributes to the added capacity limitations in working memory that is greater than the limits on normal patients. The cognitive processes that deal heavily with the <b>DLPFC,</b> such as memory, attention, and higher order processing, are the functions that once distorted contribute to the factors of the illness.|$|E
5000|$|The first cognitive/associative pathway {{proposes a}} pathway from the <b>DLPFC,</b> into the dlcaudate, {{followed}} by a projection into the lateral dosomedial GPi, and rostral SNr before projecting into the lateral VAmc and medial pars magnocellularis.|$|E
50|$|The {{activity}} {{of any of}} the areas involved in this model depends on the efficiency of the areas that came before it. If the <b>DLPFC</b> imposes a lot of control on the response, the ACC will require less activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<b>DLPFC),</b> anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the <b>DLPFC,</b> inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
5000|$|The oculomotor loop {{involved}} projections {{from the}} frontal eye fields, the {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (<b>DLPFC),</b> and the posterior parietal cortex into the caudate, into the caudal dorsomedial GPi and ventrolateral SNr, finally looping back into the cortex through the lateral ventralis anterior pars magnocellularis.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{discussion}} if the <b>DLPFC</b> is specialized in {{a certain type of}} working memory, namely computational mechanisms for monitoring and manipulating items, or if it has a certain content, namely visuospatial information, which makes it possible to mentally represent coordinates within the spatial domain.|$|E
50|$|This {{theory was}} disproved by O’Driscoll et al. {{in a study}} that used {{positron}} emission tomography to analyze brain activity during anti-saccadic movement. The study showed that the <b>DLPFC</b> was equally activated in both saccadic and anti-saccadic movements. Anti-saccades required increased activation of the FEF, SMA and putamen.|$|E
