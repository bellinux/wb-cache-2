6000|$|... "Oh, say, let's forget those {{bonds for}} just one night!" [...] entreated Sam. [...] "I haven't been able to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep since I came here because of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure thing!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "But say, if we {{are going}} to climb around these rocks all day to-morrow I am going to bed and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{start for}} camp early to-morrow," [...] {{announced}} Snap. [...] "Now let us get {{to bed and}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest. It {{is going to be}} no picnic walking on this snow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep, if you can, Wilson," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "There won't be much sleep {{for us in}} the boats till we see the walls of Allahabad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall stay quietly here, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest; {{and then}} ride out to-morrow {{morning in the}} face of the whole shire. No, not a word! You would not have me sneak away like a coward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{the best}} thing I {{think you can do}} is to try to go to sleep and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest," [...] went on Sam. [...] "This {{worrying}} about what can't be helped won't do you any good." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} between sleep deprivation and obesity {{appears to be}} strongest in young and middle-age adults. Other scientists hold that the physical discomfort of obesity and related problems, such as sleep apnea, reduce an individual's chances of <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{have to tell}} me that, Dick," [...] put in Tom Dillon. He {{turned to}} the others. [...] "It's all right, boys; just make yourselves at home. We'll <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest here, and follow Abe and the others fust thing in the mornin'." ...|$|R
40|$|As people grow older, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep remains {{essential}} to maintaining good health. Insomnia {{is a common}} complaint in older adults, and although occasional sleep complaints may not be associated with age, chronic sleep difficulties are experienced more often by older adults than by younger adults...|$|R
50|$|Mack and Myer are two handymen, doing {{jobs for}} hire. In one episode, {{they are seen}} doing things like {{building}} a fence. However, their attempts at getting rich quick usually backfired, resulting in comedy. Sometimes the situations revolved around a common everyday problem (i.e. <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep).|$|R
6000|$|... "Do! Do {{go to bed}} by all means, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep. God knows! {{you want}} it. I am more than glad you have made the suggestion, for I feared when I saw you tonight that I might have you on my hands a patient next." ...|$|R
50|$|Heward is {{also known}} for his Mystical Organ and his fortifying bedroll, which helps a mage (or anyone else) <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep. Other magic items created by Heward include Heward's bell, which keeps time and summons extraplanar creatures, and Heward's lyre of truth, a musical {{instrument}} that affects both truth and glibness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{think it}} over {{and at the same}} time I'll think over what other {{investments}} I might make while I'm down here. But just at present I think I'll try to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep and reduce this swelling on my head," [...] added Jack's father, as he felt of the bump tenderly.|$|R
50|$|Chase goes {{to explain}} the {{procedure}} to Natalie and Joseph. He asks about her eye injury from Andres' attack. She asks Joseph to leave {{and when he does}} (after kissing her goodbye), she denies having an affair although she admits she has talked to him about it. Chase advises her to go home and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep.|$|R
50|$|Armed {{with this}} promise, Kudrun takes action to {{properly}} prepare herself. She announces to the Normans {{that she has}} finally decided to relent and marry Hartmuot, but can do so only if she and her entourage are allowed to bathe, don proper clothes, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep. These wishes are readily granted and the princess and her ladies are restored to their former status and appearance.|$|R
60|$|His {{new friends}} warmly pressed {{them to stop}} and dine with them; but Ralph pleaded that the balloon was to start at five in the morning, and that he wished Percy to lie down, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep before starting. The {{carriage}} had been discharged, hours since; {{but one of the}} officers ordered a carriage of General Trochu's to the door and, after a hearty leave taking, the boys returned to their hotel.|$|R
50|$|A person, then, who fears (i.e. {{experiences}} anticipatory anxiety over) not <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep may try {{too hard}} (that is, hyper-intend) to fall asleep, {{and this would}} hinder their ability to do so. A logotherapist would recommend, then, that the person go to bed and intentionally try not to fall asleep. This would relieve the anticipatory anxiety which kept the person awake in the first place, thus allowing them to fall asleep in an acceptable amount of time.|$|R
50|$|The direct {{consequence}} of hypopnea (as well as apnea) {{is that the}} CO2 in the blood increases and the oxygen level in the patient’s blood decrease is proportionate to {{the severity of the}} airway obstruction. This disruptive pattern of breathing generates disruptive sleep patterns, the consequences of which being that those individuals may exhibit increased fatiguability, , decreased ability to concentrate, increased irritability, and morning headaches. Basically, those individuals are extremely tired due to their inability to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep.|$|R
60|$|I {{took her}} to the house where she used to lodge, and placed her under the care of the kind {{concierge}} who was Theodore's aunt. Then I, too, went home, determined to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest. The morning would be a busy one for me. There would be the special licence to get, the cure of St. Jacques to interview, the religious ceremony to arrange for, and the places to book on the stagecoach for Boulogne en route for England--and fortune.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} tested Mental Health Australia’s ‘Ten Tips’, asking Australians {{whether they}} were things they did ‘regularly’, ‘sometimes’, ‘hardly ever’ or ‘never’. 	 	The scale was deliberately non-specific because {{the nature of the}} activities tested is varied – a person might not ‘seek out advice or support when they’re feeling stressed or down’ regularly for example because they seldom feel stressed or down, whereas ‘getting <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep’ is something everyone could potentially do every day (assuming they had the time). 	 	 	Responses do need to be viewed in this context, and in analysing the results we should pay most attention to things Australians seem to be doing less often than we might expect they would. 	 	 	In this context, the fact that only 30 % of Australians say they regularly make a conscious choice to have time periods away from electronic devices is interesting, as is the fact that 18 % say they hardly ever or never <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep. 	The survey shows good numbers of Australians claiming to do several of these activities regularly. 	 	 	 65 % say they regularly keep their consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and drugs as low as possible. 	 	 	 58 % say they regularly make an effort to eat healthily 	 	 	 51 % regularly make time to socialise with their family and/or friends 	 	 	 47 % say they regularly <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{believed}} {{that up to}} 43 % of children can experience a sleep problem at some stage during their development. Reduced quality of sleep can {{have important implications for}} the developing child as it can impair growth, learning and emotional development. It is important for health professionals to understand the significance of sleep and the ways to alleviate problems so that these can be tackled at an early age. By educating people in how to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep we shall hopefully move towards a more happy, healthy and capable child population...|$|R
5000|$|Elaine {{comes in}} and tells Jerry and Kramer that a barking dog is keeping her from <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep. Kramer says he knows someone who can [...] "fix her problem". They go to see Newman. After seeing Newman's clear dislike of dogs, Elaine becomes unsure, saying she can't allow a dog to be hurt. Kramer assures her they will merely kidnap it and {{relocate}} it to the countryside, {{where it will be}} happier. Later that night, Elaine, Kramer and Newman rent a van and prepare to steal the dog.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} his first for four years since 7, which failed to match the {{staggering}} sales of 2001's Escape. [...] "Insomniac" [...] {{is not just the}} title of the album, it is also a fact of Iglesias's life, who says he often takes sleeping pills to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest. Iglesias recorded most of the album in the evening and early hours of the morning. He wrote more than 50 songs before settling on 12 that he felt were strong enough to put on the album.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "let us {{stop talking about}} this thing, and {{thinking}} about it. We shall all be maniacs if we don't quiet ourselves a little, and, besides, it cannot be long before those black fellows come back, {{and we do not}} want to be speaking about it then. To-morrow we will examine the mound and see what it is we have discovered. In the meantime, let us quiet our minds and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep, if we can. This whole affair is astounding, but we must not let it make us crazy before we understand it." ...|$|R
50|$|Lodging {{and eating}} {{accommodations}} {{on the island}} were fashioned by renovating a building vacated by the Quarantine Service in 1937. The facility at best was austere, but one who was tired and hungry could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep; plenty of coffee, a hearty serving of bacon and eggs for breakfast; any of an assortment of sandwiches for lunch; and, a family style meal of fried mullet with all the trimmings for supper. A screened-in porch was there for those who just wanted to lean back, prop up the feet, enjoy a cool beverage, and relax. This facility became known familiarly as Mullet Key Lodge.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{performance}} benefits of shorter shifts may not outweigh {{the performance}} costs of consecutive nights of work, some departments with four platoon groups work shorter shifts. Most such departments work a 10-hour {{day and a}} 14-hour night tour. [...] This enables the firefighter to get relieved from work in the afternoon, commute home, spend time with family, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep before returning {{to work in the}} morning. Schedules that only allow 12 hours, or less, between work shifts do not allow enough time to incorporate a healthy night of sleep, and therefore begin to accumulate sleep deficit even when the employee is working days.|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, Gamelin ordered the armies trapped in Belgium and {{northern}} France to fight their way south and link up with French forces attacking northwards from the Somme river. On the evening of 19 May, the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud had sacked Gamelin and replaced him with Maxime Weygand, who claimed his first mission as Commander-in-Chief would be to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep. Gamelin's orders were cancelled and Weygand took several days during the crisis, to make courtesy visits in Paris. Weygand proposed a counter-offensive by the armies trapped in the north combined with an attack by French forces on the Somme front, the new French 3rd Army Group (General Antoine-Marie-Benoît Besson).|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to motives for <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep we don't usually think about our body's hormones. But sleep allows many of our hormones to {{replenish}} so we have the optimal energy, immunity, appetite and coping ability to face the day's highs and lows. The activities we do during the day - from having a fight with a partner, using our iPhones at night, running in a race, to travelling overseas - also affect our hormone levels and, in turn, our quality of sleep. For both men and women, changes in our levels of sex hormones can affect how well we sleep. These differences also change with age. Understanding the connections between hormones and sleep may help improve your own sleep and well-being...|$|R

"We needn't {{expect him}} before midnight at the soonest," [...] Pierre {{said as he}} nestled down on the blankets, motioning for me to follow his example, [...] "and 'twixt now and then we may <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fairly <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest {{if we do not}} spend too much time in talking." ...|$|R
5000|$|Whenever on leave, Yossarian and {{his friends}} carouse, drink, and sleep around {{as much as they}} can, knowing and fearing they could die on any given mission. One of the prostitutes they employ becomes Nately's {{unofficial}} girlfriend (she is referred to only as [...] "Nately's Whore" [...] and [...] "Nately's Girl"). Despite Nately's repeated advances, she spurns him cruelly until he, instead of sleeping with her, lets her <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep. By the next morning she has fallen deeply in love with him. When Nately is killed, she blames Yossarian for his death; she manifests a towering rage and tries to kill Yossarian several times during the remainder of the narrative in an impossible manner (constantly tracking Yossarian down, even after he dumped her hundreds of miles behind enemy territory.) ...|$|R
40|$|It’s a {{story that}} wouldn’t {{normally}} make the headlines. A middle-aged man in a central Queensland town found himself stacking {{on a lot of}} weight unusually quickly. His blood pressure was on the rise, and he struggled to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep. His diagnosis, diabetes, is far from rare, and the common explanation, “unhealthy lifestyle choices,” threw the responsibility back on the sufferer. But this is not how Dr Ewen McPhee sees it. His patient’s plight is symptomatic, he believes, of wider social, environmental and economic forces affecting the health of members of his community in Emerald, an agricultural and coal-mining centre on the Nogoa River. McPhee traces his patient’s deteriorating health back to when he moved from an active job at a local mine into a supervisory position involving long, stressful hours… Read the full articl...|$|R
40|$|For chronic insomniacs, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night’s</b> sleep {{may appear}} to be impossible. Fortunately nature {{provides}} a natural sleep aid that is both safe and effective. L-tryptophan is an amino acid found in many foods, including turkey. Turkey is well known to cause drowsiness, and the culprit is large amounts of tryptophan. For many years L-tryptophan was the nutritional supplement of choice for chronic insomnia and depression. Those that have tried L-tryptophan can attest to its benefits: “If I could take only one supplement with me on a desert island, it would be tryptophan! It helps me sleep better, and improves my mood. It’s just wonderful. ” Exclaims one long-time user. The wonderful effect that tryptophan has on both mood and sleep may be because the body naturally converts tryptophan into both serotonin and melatonin. Serotonin levels affects mood and melatonin affects sleep...|$|R
5000|$|Colonel Fair {{commanded}} 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division in Tay Ninh, in South Vietnam, in 1968-1969. He {{received the}} Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for {{his participation in}} heavy fighting around Ven Cau. During combat in Vietnam, his brigade was awarded the U. S. Valorous Unit Award and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry (with Palm). [...] He was instrumental in establishing a [...] "Holiday Inn" [...] in the Tay Ninh province so that soldiers returning from combat missions {{had an opportunity to}} shower, do laundry, repair their gear, and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> sleep, <b>a</b> hot meal, and a little rest and recuperation (R & R).

5000|$|Spencer, Mason's closest friend, allows his {{attention}} to wander {{for a short time}} in a battle, leading him to spend three seconds in a Me109's gunsight and take a three-second burst from its spinner-cannon, destroying his Spitfire instantly. The previous night, Spencer had opted not to sleep with his girlfriend in order to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>night's</b> rest before returning to action, and Mason had told him that he was to be nominated for a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross. On going through Spencer's personal effects, Mason finds a letter stating that he, Spencer, had a premonition that he was to die soon and hoped that when it came it was quick and did not inconvenience the rest of the squadron. In connection with Hodges's earlier death, this leads Mason to wonder if he too will experience the same foreknowledge of his own death.|$|R
