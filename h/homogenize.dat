5|$|Hellenization {{was coined}} by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen to denote {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to <b>homogenize</b> the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E

Smaller diameter coils also have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials; and they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter.

According to Donald Bloxham, Andranik initiated the change of Zangezur into a solidly Armenian land by destroying Muslim villages and trying to ethnically <b>homogenize</b> key areas of the Armenian state.

As of 2015, 1:54 {{is the only}} art fair dedicated to contemporary African art in the primary art market. Its name refers to the 54 countries that compose the African continent, expressed as a ratio ("one continent: 54 countries"). Moroccan curator Touria El Glaoui, daughter of the artist Hassan El Glaoui, organized the fair to improve the representation of contemporary African art in worldwide art exhibitions. Representation of non-Western countries in the contemporary art world has lagged behind that of other countries. Representation of African countries, in particular, improved alongside the continent's economic growth. El Glaoui said that the continent {{did not have a}} single art scene, and that there was great diversity between African nations. Accordingly, as in the fair's title, 1:54 tries to preserve rather than <b>homogenize</b> the differences between each country's histories and cultures. In starting the fair, its founder was supported and advised by the British Council, the Francophonie, and partners ArtReview, Beaux Art magazine, and Art.sy. For each edition, the 1:54 organizers ask themselves [...] "what is necessary, what can be achieved, how [...] do something different". The fair's organizers choose exhibitors based on proposal submissions and the firms' reputation and plans. Travel visa issues have also affected whether invitees ultimately attend.|$|E

40|$|This Licentiate {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on some new questions in homogenization theory, {{which have been}} motivated by some concrete problems in tribology. From the mathematical point of view, these questions are equipped with scales of Reynolds equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients. In particular, in this Licentiate thesis we derive the corresponding <b>homogenized</b> (averaged) equation. We consider the Reynolds equations in both the stationary and unstationary forms to analyze the effect of surface roughness on the hydrodynamic performance of bearings when a lubricant is flowing through it. In Chapter 1 we describe the possible types of surfaces a bearing can take. Out of these, we select two types and derive the appropriate Reynolds equations needed for their analysis. Chapter 2 {{is devoted to the}} derivation of the <b>homogenized</b> equations, associated with the stationary forms of the compressible and incompressible Reynolds equations. We derive these <b>homogenized</b> equations by using the multiple scales expansion technique. In Chapter 3 the <b>homogenized</b> equations for the unstationary forms of the Reynolds equations are considered and some numerical results based on the <b>homogenized</b> equations are presented. In chapter 4 we consider the equivalent minimization problem for the unstationary Reynolds equation and use it to derive a <b>homogenized</b> minimization problem.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a numerical strategy that allows {{to lower the}} costs associated {{to the prediction of}} the value of <b>homogenized</b> tensors in elliptic problems. This is done by solving a coupled problem, in which the complex microstructure is confined to a small region and surrounded by a tentative <b>homogenized</b> medium. The characteristics of this <b>homogenized</b> medium are updated using a self-consistent approach and are shown to converge to the actual solution. The main feature of the coupling strategy is that it really couples the random microstructure with the deterministic <b>homogenized</b> model, and not one (deterministic) realization of the random medium with a <b>homogenized</b> model. The advantages of doing so are twofold: (a) the influence of the boundary conditions is significantly mitigated, and (b) the ergodicity of the random medium can be used in full through appropriate definition of the coupling operator. Both of these advantages imply that the resulting coupled problem is less expensive to solve, for a given bias, than the computation of <b>homogenized</b> tensor using classical approaches. Examples of 1 D and 2 D problems with continuous properties, as well as a 2 D matrix-inclusion problem, illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the method...|$|R
