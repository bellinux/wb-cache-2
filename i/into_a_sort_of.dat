5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} of identification, {{the idea of the}} Linnaean taxonomy as translating <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dendrogram of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Despite its failure, Maslama's {{attempt to}} capture Constantinople became celebrated in later Muslim literature, with several {{surviving}} accounts, mostly semi-fictional, {{in which the}} historical defeat was transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> victory: Maslama {{was said to have}} departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital on his horse accompanied by thirty riders; Leo received him with honour and led him to the Hagia Sophia, where the emperor paid homage to the Arab general. The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in Arabic epic literature, where Maslama appears associated with another legendary Arab hero of the wars against Byzantium, Abdallah al-Battal. Furthermore, Byzantine tradition, as recorded in the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio, held that during the siege Maslama convinced the Byzantines to build Constantinople's first mosque, near the city's praetorium. Later Ottoman tradition also ascribed the building of the Arap Mosque (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s. In reality, the mosque near the praetorium was most likely erected in about 860, {{as a result of an}} Arab embassy in that year.|$|E

25|$|In 1834, under King Louis Philippe, the {{architect}} Jacques Ignace Hittorff was commissioned to redesign the Place de la Concorde and {{the gardens of}} the Champs-Élysées.

He also placed several ornamental fountains around the park, of which three are still in place.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, it was {{not until}} 205 AD, during the reign of Septimius Severus, that the two {{communities}} came together as one municipium, made “free” (see below) while Carthage’s pertica was reduced. The city was supported by the euergetism of its great families of wealthy individuals, which sometimes reached exorbitant levels, while its interests were successfully represented by appeals to the emperors. Dougga’s development culminated during the reign of Gallienus, when it obtained the status of a Roman colony with the title Colonia Licinia Septimia Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensis. Dougga’s monuments attest to its prosperity in the period from the reign of Diocletian to that of Theodosius I, but it fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stupor from the 4th century AD; Christianity only left minimal traces in the city.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked why}} he was {{compelled}} to revisit the Velázquez so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se, but merely sought [...] "an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> false fauve manner."

500|$|Gray's {{life was}} {{surrounded}} by loss and death, and many people that he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded {{a few days later}} by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh {{in the minds of the}} Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he [...] began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life. With spring nearing, Gray questioned if his own life would enter <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> rebirth cycle or, should he die, if there would be anyone to remember him. Gray's meditations during spring 1750 turned to how individuals' reputations would survive. Eventually, Gray remembered some lines of poetry that he composed in 1742 following the death of West, a poet he knew. Using that previous material, he began to compose a poem that would serve as an answer to the various questions he was pondering.|$|E

500|$|On 15 June 1863, the {{principal}} Charles Williams (principal 1857–1877) and fellows agreed {{to renovate the}} chapel. One of the prime movers behind the decision was the vice-principal, Lewis Gilbertson, {{as part of his}} unsuccessful attempt to move the college towards Anglo-Catholicism. The architect George Edmund Street was appointed, and had almost free rein in his work. In 1863, he said to the bursar that the chapel was [...] "so good in style considering its late date" [...] that it would be [...] "very inadvisable to alter it in any respect, save one, the old features of the walls and roofing". However, he later said that the fittings were [...] "incongruous", with the seats being [...] "so thoroughly uncomfortable that kneeling is rendered all but impossible, and sitting even is concerted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> penance". His work was completed in 1864, at a cost of £1,679 18s 10d. The arch of the chancel was widened and the memorials to Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell, which had been {{on each side of the}} arch, were moved to the north wall of the chancel. The original Jacobean woodwork was removed, with the exception of the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit, new seats were installed and new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel. A stone reredos was added behind the altar, although the design originally submitted by Street was not approved and he was asked to make changes. [...] The reredos as finally installed has three marble panels: a crucifixion scene (centre), Christ carrying his cross (right) and Christ on the knees of St Mary (left). The altar has a slab and six pillars, all made from granite.|$|E
