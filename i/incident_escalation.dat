50|$|The risk {{assessment}} {{takes into account}} the weather forecast, provided by the Met Office, notable events happening throughout Northern Ireland, such as concerts or VIP visits, and any planned maintenance on the network, or services required for the normal operation of the system such as IT and telecoms. The team assess the risks and decide if any action should be taken to mitigate them. If any risk factor is deemed too high, such as a strong chance of high winds over 45kts, a pre-planned escalation can be scheduled for the day in question. At any time, if there are many concurrent faults, the control room staff can escalate to an Incident Level. During an <b>incident</b> <b>escalation,</b> the Duty Incident Manager and their team man the incident room continuously and co-ordinate operations between dispatch of linesmen and other field staff, communications with customers and the media, and resourcing.|$|E
40|$|Escalation {{triggered}} by fires resulting in domino scenarios {{was the cause}} of severe accidents in the process industry. As a matter of fact, the catastrophic failure of process equipment, both pressurized and atmospheric, may be induced by the heat-up due to the exposure to accidental fires, leading to the loss of containment of hazardous materials. In this chapter, the behavior of equipment exposed to accidental fire will be investigated in order to identify the fundamental mechanisms underlying the failure of vessels exposed to fire. In particular, both simplified tools and detailed models for the assessment of the performance of vessels involved in fires will be discussed. The final aim is to provide methods for the quantitative assessment of domino hazards caused by accidental fires, and for the application of both passive and active strategies for the control and reduction of the risk associated with <b>incident</b> <b>escalation</b> {{triggered by}} fire...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of mobile}} devices by high school learners has resulted in increased networking activities for learners who take advantage of opportunities presented by mobile technologies. Mobile technology continues to {{play a key role}} in facilitating online interactions amongst South African youth, and some learners use mobile technology to enhance their learning capabilities. However, such electronic operations have also presented new risks particularly in the developing countries where online bullying is on the rise and investigations of such incidents or threats are expensive. Mobile bullying and lack of discipline of bullies, for instance, are major concerns in the society at large. To control these incidents, learners and teachers need to know what to do when incidents arise. The process of digital forensic investigation is typically left for those specialising in the field of digital forensics. Those responsible for learner's safety in schools are often faced with situations where they have to perform basic investigations or preserve evidence for <b>incident</b> <b>escalation</b> to the specialists. However, schools often do not prepare themselves well enough for the challenges relating to mobile bullying. They find themselves not knowing where to start or how to preserve evidence. Digital forensic investigations are even more challenging in school settings because of the dynamic nature of these environments. While studies have been conducted in the developed countries, little is still known about how schools in the developing world, for instance South Africa, may handle mobile bullying. Very little is known about how schools in the developing countries may maximise their potential to use digital evidence while minimising the impact resulting from the incident. There is limited guidance on how to be digital forensic ready in schools where teachers, learners, principals, and other role players are not trained well enough to deal with mobile bullying. The objective of this study was to provide insight into factors that enhance the non-technical forensic readiness program in township schools and the ability of teachers to investigate mobile bullying incidents. The study aimed at employing concepts of forensic readiness to ignite schools' ability to prepare for response to mobile bullying incidents and create a digital forensic ready learning environment. The study was conducted in South Africa, Limpopo and North West provinces. Five schools agreed to participate in this study; eighty-two valid responses were obtained from teachers. The study followed mixed methods approach to the theory...|$|E

The United Nations declared it {{to be one of}} the most serious incidents since the end of the Korean War, and by December 18 former UN ambassador Bill Richardson said tensions had escalated to become [...] "the most serious crisis on the Korean peninsula since the 1953 armistice which ended the Korean War".|$|R
40|$|Children and {{adolescents}} with behavioural and emotional disorders are very inconsistently placed in juvenile educational institutions. For some, {{it is the}} case of stable and consistent long-term difficulties, for others, one <b>incident</b> of <b>escalation</b> of deviant beaviour is enough to make placement in a juvenile educational institution an option. The article deals with the underlying causes behind behavioural and emotional disorders in children {{and adolescents}} on the premise that they have decisive influence on the child or adolescent’s placement into extra-familial care – a juvenile educational institution, a youth home or a residential group. The results have shown that possible causes of behavioural and emotional difficulties, as seen by social worker. These can stem from social, psychological and biological factors, which has also been established by comparable etiological classifications. The author emphasize that making a detailed analysis of the child {{with the help of the}} presented indicators can fundamentally contribute to making carefully considered decisions...|$|R

Tak Boleh Tahan stands for [...] "I can't take it anymore" [...] in colloquial Malay. The event was organised by the SDP and included their members. 18 were arrested when they refused to disperse as ordered by the police. All 20 were subsequently charged under Section 5(4)b Chapter 184 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public and Nuisance) Act. The Singapore Police Force described this <b>incident</b> as an <b>escalation</b> on the scale and level of defiance exhibited by the group and stated that their actions and arm-locking with each other was [...] "militant like".|$|R
40|$|During {{the late}} 1970 s, Turkey {{experienced}} a major campaign of political terrorism that was waged by {{a multiplicity of}} leftist, ultranationalist, and separatist groups. Between 1976 and 1980, more than 5000 people {{lost their lives in}} hundreds of terrorist <b>incidents.</b> The steady <b>escalation</b> of violence amidst a major political and economic crisis undermined the country's fragile democratic system and paved the way for a military coup in September 1980. This study examines the origins and growth of the terrorist movement in Turkey, the main characteristics of political violence, and the causes of the dramatic escalation of terrorism in the late 1970 s. The study suggests that although state-sponsored terrorism against Turkey facilitated the rapid proliferation of leftist, rightist, and separatist armed extremist groups, the drift into total terrorism was largely the product of domestic political and social developments...|$|R

5000|$|On 15 October 1979, {{following}} hearsay {{about an}} {{attempt on the}} life of Dom Mintoff, a large group of thugs attacked and burnt down the premises and printing presses of the independent newspaper, The Times of Malta.'''' The thugs proceeded to ransack various Nationalist Party clubs and the private residence of Fenech Adami in Birkirkara. [...] Fenech Adami's neighbours locked themselves in their homes as soon as they heard the commotion. Approaching her house from mass, Mary Fenech Adami was shocked at the mayhem: the front door was wide open, with ten men inside ransacking valuables and stealing heirlooms, smashing glass doors and shutters, hurling books and furniture outside onto the street. [...] The thugs had wooden clubs, which appeared to be solid sawn-off table legs. The six rooms forming the ground floor of the Fenech Adami residence were completely wrecked. Mary Fenech Adami was attacked and slammed against a wall. Her earrings were ripped off, and she was punched on her chest and face. She was then kicked and pushed onto the street. Mary Fenech Adami, her four sons and her mother-in-law only escaped by going up to the third storey of their house and jumping onto a neighbour's house. These <b>incidents</b> marked an <b>escalation</b> of violence in the islands, and {{came to be known as}} Black Monday. The attack consolidated Fenech Adami's leadership, with a mass meeting held outside Fenech Adami's residence attracting one of the largest crowds ever, signalling the changing mood in the country.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors were}} {{involved}} in extensive vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of over 15 large organisations across various industry sectors in the Perth CBD. The actual live testing involved a team of five people for approximately a four week period, and was black box testing. The scanning consisted of running network and web vulnerability tools, {{and in a few}} cases, exploiting vulnerability to establish validity of the tools. The tools were run in aggressive mode with no attempt made to deceive or avoid detection by IDS/IPS or firewalls. The aim of the testing was to determine firstly whether these organisations were able to detect such hostile scanning, and secondly to gauge their response. This paper does not extensively analyse the resultant empirical data from the tests this will be the subject of several other papers. Of the 15 agencies investigated, only two were able to detect the activity, and only one of these escalated this to authorities. Many had intrusion detection or prevention systems, but these did not appear to detect the scanning which was conducted. Others did not have any form of detection, only logging without active monitoring and some had no persistent logging of anything. Of those who did detect, the lack of a formal <b>incident</b> response and <b>escalation</b> plan hampered their ability to respond and escalate appropriately. Many of these organisations had recently, or very recently undergone penetration testing by external audit or IT companies, and yet there were still numerous vulnerabilities, or their system did not detect the scan. The conclusion is that organisations need to be very specific about what their needs are when engaging external agents to conduct network security testing, as current penetration testing is giving them a false sense of securit...|$|R
