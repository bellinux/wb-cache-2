Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to disturb you; I had the hope that--for a moment--I might see Miss Tarrant." [...] That was the speech with which (and a {{measured}} salutation) he greeted his advancing kinswoman.

60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> flashed bitterly, her {{emaciated}} {{face for}} the second was convulsed with rage, and her sore lips writhed {{on the verge of}} unconsidered speech. But only a splutter of gasping, unintelligible sounds issued forth, and then, by a terrible effort, she controlled herself.|$|E

'Now, sir,' then {{breaking}} out into 'Thunder and turf' (his favourite Hibernian ejaculation); 'Ssssssss!' and therewith, <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> all one glare, out burst this cat!

60|$|Day had now {{given away}} to night {{and as we}} wandered along the great avenue lighted by the two moons of Barsoom, and with Earth looking down upon us out of <b>her</b> {{luminous}} <b>green</b> <b>eye,</b> it seemed that we {{were alone in the}} universe, and I, at least, was content that it should be so.|$|R

6000|$|Downstairs, then, they went, Joseph very red and blushing, Rebecca very modest, {{and holding}} <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> downwards.

60|$|Maisie {{looked more}} than usually kissable {{as she stepped}} from the night-mail on to the windy pier, in a gray {{waterproof}} and a little gray cloth travelling-cap. The red-haired girl was not so lovely. <b>Her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> were hollow and her lips were dry. Dick saw the trunks aboard, and went to Maisie's side in the darkness under the bridge. The mail-bags were thundering into the forehold, and the red- haired girl was watching them.|$|E
5000|$|She drinks martini cocktails, smokes the {{occasional}} joint, drives a red Porsche, throws lavish parties in her Rome mansion and enjoys fiery but casual {{sex with a}} series of handsome hunks, including suspected enemies she may well have to kill. <b>Her</b> jade <b>green</b> <b>eyes,</b> raven black hair and [...] "explicit cheekbones" [...] prove the perfect smokescreen. [...] "There wasn't a line or shadow on her lovely face to show the deadly secrets that lay behind it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Volume 1 of his {{autobiography}} A Better Class of Person, Osborne describes feeling {{an immediate and}} intense attraction towards his first wife. The pair were both members of an acting troupe in Bridgwater. She had just recently shorn her hair down to a defiant auburn stubble and I {{was impressed by the}} hostility she had created by this self-isolating act… <b>her</b> huge <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> which mock or plead affection, preferably both, at least… She startled and confused me… There was no calculation in my instant obsession.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{critical}} study of Gabrielle Roy's presence in Jacques Poulin's works. Roy is a character, a reference and an inspiration; her books and <b>her</b> brilliant <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> enthral Poulin and his protagonists. She is present through intertextual references [...] -the mention of her name, her books, her characters or her quotes [...] -but also, {{in a more}} abstract sense, through influence. In order to study {{the relationship between the}} two authors, a set of themes common to their literary works are analysed: their North-American identity (americanite), and their ambiguous treatment of sexuality...|$|R
6000|$|I {{tried to}} make amends for my forgetfulness--even {{to the extent of}} {{pocketing}} my pride, and commissioning Fleming to purchase for me (out of the little stock of money left me by Fanny) a cradle, as a wedding present for Pollie, and a chest of tools for her husband. Oddly enough, she did not sniff at this request. <b>Her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> almost sparkled. At the very word, wedding, she seemed to revive into a new woman. And Pollie completely forgave me:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Lord Steyne made {{no reply}} except by beating the devil's tattoo and biting his nails. At last he clapped his hat {{on his head}} and flung out of the room. Rebecca did not rise from her {{attitude}} of misery until the door slammed upon him and his carriage whirled away. Then she rose up with the queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes.</b> She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as she sat at work, and sitting down to the piano, she rattled away a triumphant voluntary on the keys, which made the people pause under her window to listen to her brilliant music.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right-o," [...] replied Blair, with evident relief. He {{reached a}} hand to Lane to raise himself, an action he rarely resorted to, and awkwardly got his crutch in place. They started out, with Lane {{accommodating}} his pace to his crippled comrade. Thus it happened that the two ran a gauntlet with watching young people on each side, out to the open part of the hall. There directly in front they encountered Captain Vane Thesel, with Helen Wrapp on his arm. Her red hair, <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes,</b> and carmined lips, the white of her voluptuous neck and arms, united in a singular effect of allurement that Lane felt with scorn and melancholy.|$|E
6000|$|... "How delicious {{they smell}} {{in the open}} air! I adore them. Who'd think the moon was two hundred and thirty-six {{thousand}} eight hundred and forty-seven miles off?" [...] Becky added, gazing at that orb with a smile. [...] "Isn't it clever of me to remember that? Pooh! we learned it all at Miss Pinkerton's! How calm the sea is, and how clear everything. I declare I can almost see the coast of France!" [...] and <b>her</b> bright <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> streamed out, and shot into the night {{as if they could}} see through it.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Helen is at {{the flat}} with Bob when the {{doorbell}} rings. Bob repeats over and over, [...] "Don’t open," [...] but Helen ignores his plea. She {{goes to the door}} as the sounds of sirens, planes and explosions fill the air. Bob races through the flat, ending in the bathroom where he jumps face down into a bathtub full of water and floats as if dead. Meanwhile, Helen, listening to the sirens and planes as if in fear, seems unaware of the doppelganger which can be seen through the glass door. Her expression changes to something indeterminate as light from the explosions illuminates <b>her</b> brilliant, <b>green</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Miss Martian is in {{the show}} DC Super Hero Girls as a {{recurring}} character, appearing {{in just a few}} episodes. She is shown to be roommates with Killer Frost, Lady Shiva and Star Sapphire. She has her iconic appearance with <b>her</b> <b>green</b> skin, red <b>eyes</b> and long ginger hair. In all of the episodes she is seen talking, she squeals and turns invisible. Maybe because of embarrassment or shyness, being uncomfortable.|$|R
6000|$|When the Major {{heard from}} Jos of the sentimental {{adventure}} which had just befallen the latter, he was not, {{it must be}} owned, nearly as much interested as the gentleman from Bengal. On the contrary, his excitement was quite the reverse from a pleasurable one; he made use of a brief but improper expression regarding a poor woman in distress, saying, in fact, [...] "The little minx, has she come to light again?" [...] He never had had the slightest liking for her, but had heartily mistrusted her {{from the very first}} moment when <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> had looked at, and turned away from, his own.|$|E
60|$|Presently Helen {{returned}} {{to shut the}} door behind her; and her walk toward Lane had a suggestion of the oriental dancer. For Lane her face was a study. This seemed a woman beyond his comprehension. She was the Helen Wrapp he had known and loved, plus an age of change, a measureless experience. With that swaying, sinuous, pantherish grace, with <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> narrowed and gleaming, half mocking, half serious, she glided up to him, close, closer until she pressed against him, and her face was uplifted under his. Then she waited with her eyes gazing into his. Slumberous green depths, slowly lighting, they seemed to Lane. Her presence thus, her brazen challenge, affected him powerfully, but he had no thrill.|$|E
6000|$|The {{custodian}} {{must have}} had in him some of the blood of his predecessors in that ghastly tower, for he worked the engine with a deliberate and excruciating slowness which after five minutes, in which {{the outer edge of}} the door had not moved half as many inches, began to overcome Amelia. I saw her lips whiten, and felt her hold upon my arm relax. I looked around an instant for a place whereon to lay her, and when I looked at her again found that her eye had become fixed on the side of the Virgin. Following its direction I saw the black cat crouching out of sight. <b>Her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> shone like danger lamps in the gloom of the place, and their colour was heightened by the blood which still smeared her coat and reddened her mouth. I cried out: ...|$|E
5000|$|Because Erin's {{mother was}} of the Mist People, she {{inherited}} <b>her</b> <b>green</b> hair and <b>eyes.</b> Some people first believed {{that she was able}} to be close to Lilan and Eku because she learned magic tricks of the Mist People from her mother, but they later see her as someone who just wants to truly understand animals. Her classmates know her as the Ouju fanatic. Erin's name translates to [...] "wild apple" [...] both John and Kirik comment that they are free-thinking and unique; similar to Erin's personality.|$|R
60|$|But Blot {{would not}} grow plump. Her early wrongs preyed upon her, and she {{remained}} a thin, timid, melancholy little cat all her days. I could not win her confidence. She {{had lost her}} faith in mankind, and I don't blame her. She always hid in corners, quaked when I touched her, took her food by stealth, and sat in a forlorn bunch in cold nooks, down cellar or behind the gate, mewing despondently to herself, as if her woes must find a vent. She would not be easy and comfortable. No cushion could allure, no soft beguilements win her to purr, no dainty fare fill out her rusty coat, no warmth or kindness banish the scared look from <b>her</b> sad <b>green</b> <b>eyes,</b> no ball or spool lure her to play, or cause her to wag her mortified thin tail with joy.|$|R
50|$|Again at Sysa, one sunny {{tranquil}} day in {{the leafy}} month of June, a cowboy called Peter Water stopped to drink and linger at the well, while {{on his way home}} to Windy Ha. He rested and slept till near sunset, when he was awakened by a touch on his shoulder. A young lady was beside him, dressed in <b>green,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> blue and her hair in golden ringlets. Peter was bashful and felt himself blushing.|$|R
6000|$|Having Harry's bond in her pocket, {{the veteran}} Maria {{did not choose}} to press for payment. She knew the world too well for that. He was bound to her, but she gave him plenty of day-rule, and leave of absence on parole. It was not her object needlessly to chafe and anger her young slave. She knew the {{difference}} of ages, and that Harry must have his pleasures and diversions. [...] "Take your ease and amusement, cousin," [...] says Lady Maria. [...] "Frisk about, pretty little mousekin," [...] says grey Grimalkin, purring in the corner, and keeping watch with <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes.</b> About all that Harry was to see and do on {{his first visit to}} London, his female relatives had of course talked and joked. Both of the ladies knew perfectly what were a young gentleman's ordinary amusements in those days, and spoke of them with the frankness which characterised those easy times.|$|E
6000|$|Baltimore.--A big, dirty, shippy, shiftless place, full of goats, geese, colored people, and coal, {{at least}} the part of it I see. Pass near {{the spot where the}} riot took place, and feel as if I should enjoy {{throwing}} a stone at somebody, hard. Find a guard at the ferry, the depot, and here and there, along the road. A camp whitens one hill-side, and a cavalry training school, or whatever it should be called, is a very interesting sight, with quantities of horses and riders galloping, marching, leaping, and skirmishing, over all manner of break-neck places. A party of English people get in--the men, with sandy hair and red whiskers, all trimmed alike, to a hair; rough grey coats, very rosy, clean faces, and a fine, full way of speaking, which is particularly agreeable, after our slip-shod American gabble. The two ladies wear funny velvet fur-trimmed hoods; are done up, like compact bundles, in tartan shawls; and look as if bent on seeing everything thoroughly. The devotion of one elderly John Bull to his red-nosed spouse was really beautiful to behold. She was plain and cross, and fussy and stupid, but J. B., Esq., read no papers when she was awake, turned no cold shoulder when she wished to sleep, and cheerfully said, [...] "Yes, me dear," [...] to every wish or want the wife of his bosom expressed. I quite warmed to the excellent man, and asked a question or two, as the only means of expressing my good will. He answered very civilly, but evidently hadn't been used to being addressed by strange women in public conveyances; and Mrs. B. fixed <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes</b> upon me, as if she thought me a forward hussy, or whatever is good English for a presuming young woman. The pair left their friends before we reached Washington; and the last I saw of them was a vision of a large plaid lady, stalking grimly away, on the arm of a rosy, stout gentleman, loaded with rugs, bags, and books, but still devoted, still smiling, and waving a hearty [...] "Fare ye well! We'll meet ye at Willard's on Chusday." ...|$|E
60|$|Pierson {{had stayed}} in the vestry, talking with his choir and wardens; there was no hitch, for his {{resignation}} had been accepted, and he had arranged with a friend to carry on till the new Vicar was appointed. When they were gone he {{went back into the}} empty Church, and mounted to the organ-loft. A little window up there was open, and he stood leaning against the stone, looking out, resting his whole being. Only now that it was over did he know what stress he had been through. Sparrows were chirping, but sound of traffic had almost ceased, in that quiet Sunday hour of the evening meal. Finished! Incredible that he would never come up here again, never see those roof-lines, that corner of Square Garden, and hear this familiar chirping of the sparrows. He sat down at the organ and began to play. The last time the sound would roll out and echo 'round the emptied House of God. For a long time he played, while the building darkened slowly down there below him. Of all that he would leave, he would miss this most--the right to come and play here in the darkening Church, to release emotional sound in this dim empty space growing ever more beautiful. From chord to chord he let himself go deeper and deeper into the surge and swell of those sound waves, losing all sense of actuality, till the music and the whole dark building were fused in one rapturous solemnity. Away down there the darkness crept over the Church, till the pews, the altar-all was invisible, save the columns; and the walls. He began playing his favourite slow movement from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony--kept to the end, for the visions it ever brought him. And a cat, which had been stalking the sparrows, crept in through the little window, and crouched, startled, staring at him with <b>her</b> <b>green</b> <b>eyes.</b> He closed the organ, went quickly down, and locked up his Church for the last time. It was warmer outside than in, and lighter, for daylight was not quite gone. He moved away a few yards, and stood looking up. Walls, buttresses, and spire were clothed in milky shadowy grey. The top of the spire seemed to touch a star. 'Goodbye, my Church!' he thought. 'Good-bye, good-bye!' He felt his face quiver; clenched his teeth, and turned away.|$|E

500|$|Johansson is {{described}} as a sex symbol by the media, which considers <b>her</b> lips, <b>green</b> <b>eyes,</b> and voice among her trademarks. The Sydney Morning Herald describes Johansson as [...] "the embodiment of male fantasy". During the filming of Match Point, director Woody Allen said he found it [...] "very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are". In 2014, New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane wrote that [...] "she is evidently, and profitably, aware of her sultriness, and of how much, down to the last inch, it contributes to the contours of her reputation." [...] Regardless, Johansson dislikes being [...] "super-sexualised" [...] as [...] "the new Marilyn Monroe" [...] and [...] "always be an object of desire. Because it doesn't last." [...] Johansson's sex appeal also cost her the lead role in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) as its director David Fincher thought she was [...] "too sexy" [...] for the part.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the address, Montero finds the house to be completely dark, with the door ajar, as if the owner were {{waiting for him to}} arrive. Montero then enters the dark house, and hears a voice in the darkness calling to him. The voice guides him through the dark house, upstairs, to a room where an old widow, Consuelo, is lying in her bed. The old widow appears to be expecting Montero, and immediately begins to explain what she needs Montero to do: organize, finish, and publish her dead husband's journals before her death. While she is explaining this task to Montero, the widow's niece, Aura, enters the room. Montero is mesmerized by the young niece's beauty ‒ especially <b>her</b> bright <b>green</b> <b>eyes.</b> Shortly after, the widow directs Montero to the room where he will be living.
