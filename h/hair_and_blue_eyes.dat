25|$|By the 1880s {{a number}} of {{linguists}} and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of {{the southern part of}} Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lantos joined Wallenberg's network; {{his fair}} <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> which to the Nazis were {{physical}} signs of Aryanism, {{enabled him to}} serve as a courier and deliver food and medicine to Jews living in other safe houses. In January 1945, less than a year later, Russian military forces fought door-to-door battles and liberated Hungary from Nazi occupation. However, Lantos, then 17, returned home only to discover that his mother and other family members had all been killed by the Germans, along with 440,000 other Hungarian Jews, during the preceding 10 months of their occupation.|$|E
25|$|Turtledove depicts his {{nations as}} being {{analogous}} to real European nations, including {{as far as}} possible actual linguistic relationships. For example, the Derlavaian analogs of the Germanic nations are the Algarvic nations of Algarve, Sibiu, and Lagoas, but to confuse things somewhat, each uses names drawn from a different Romance language. In addition, {{the vast majority of the}} individuals belonging to each language group share the same hair and eye color; Algarvic peoples have red hair and green eyes, Kaunian peoples have blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the Unkerlantic peoples and most others have dark hair and eyes.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} 17th {{century to the}} middle 18th century, European colonists {{reported}} encounters with gray-eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists (although at least one, {{a story of a}} Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language, {{is likely to be a}} hoax). Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> not long after their arrival. As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement, and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora, the likelihood that the origin of those fair-skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high.|$|E

He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets. He grew up in an orphanage and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined TNT on accident. He is one of the most trusted agents of Number One.|$|E

Jeanne and Trusha had blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and ventured out in public as non-Jews, while Lion and Pais hid in the apartment. In March 1945, however, they were betrayed and all four were arrested. The same week the Americans had crossed the Rhine and cut the rail lines, making impossible their transfer to a concentration camp. The women were soon released. After a month of interrogation by the Gestapo, Pais was released several days {{before the end of the}} war. Nordheim was executed ten days before the end of the war.|$|E

500|$|Kishimoto was {{satisfied}} with his character having blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> something rarely seen in Japanese anime or manga.

When asked why Naruto's favorite food was ramen instead of kitsune udon, Kishimoto said that he himself likes eating ramen. In the , Naruto is playable in various stages of the Demon Fox's manifestation, characterized by a red chakra.

Tessa is portrayed as a tall, thin woman with blonde <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> Because Highlander: The Series was an international co-production, the producers cast a French-speaking actor to play Tessa. Producer Gary Goodman explained that they wanted someone [...] "...that would be appealing on a television screen... {{in the sense that you}} were comfortable with her accent and her character".

Even though several {{years had passed since}} the gang rape and Todd had [...] "since settled down", and had become a more sympathetic character, rape victim advocate groups thought that selling the doll glorified sexual assault; so ABC removed the doll from its online store. Pictures of the doll were pulled from the Internet and the doll was blocked from being available at eBay or any other online store.|$|E

500|$|In Pasadena, Cameron {{ran into}} a former colleague, who invited her to visit the large American Craftsman-style house where he was {{currently}} lodging, 1003 Orange Grove Avenue, also known as [...] "The Parsonage". The house was so-called because its lease was owned by Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist {{who had been a}} founding member of the JPL and who was also a devout follower of Thelema, a new religious movement founded by English occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904. Parsons was the head of the Agape Lodge, a branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Unbeknownst to Cameron, Parsons had just finished a series of rituals using Enochian magic with his friend and lodger L. Ron Hubbard, all with the intent of attracting an [...] "elemental" [...] woman to be his lover. Upon encountering Cameron with her distinctive red <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> Parsons considered her to be the individual whom he had invoked. After they met at The Parsonage on January 18, 1946, they were instantly attracted to each other and spent the next two weeks in Parsons' bedroom together. Although Cameron was unaware of it, Parsons saw this as a form of sex magic that constituted part of the Babalon Working, a rite to invoke the birth of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth in human form.|$|E
500|$|Jasmine {{appears in}} the Broadway musical {{adaptation}} of Aladdin, which premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre in March 2014. The role was originated by actress Courtney Reed, becoming her first time originating a Broadway character after appearing in minor roles in Broadway productions such as In the Heights and Mama Mia!. Reed had grown up a long-time fan of Disney films and princesses, and, being of mixed ethnicity, cites Jasmine as her favorite princess because [...] "she was my first experience seeing a Disney princess who looked like me ... So I thought, 'Wow, I can be like her'", while the others tend to have blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> Equally {{a fan of the}} film itself, the actress' childhood home included an Aladdin-themed room used to store toys; Reed also portrayed Aladdin's pet monkey Abu in a Children's Theatre of Elgin production of the film, although she had really wanted to be cast as Jasmine. Despite having already been associated with the project since its early beginnings and initial readings in 2010, Reed auditioned for the role for director Casey Nicholaw in Seattle before the production finally relocated to Broadway, selected out of only a few actresses who were invited to audition. Unlike co-stars Adam Jacobs and Jonathan Freeman, who portray Aladdin and Jafar, respectively, Reed was the only main cast member required to audition.|$|E
500|$|Romanian vampires {{were known}} as moroi ( [...] from the Romanian word [...] "mort" [...] meaning [...] "dead" [...] or the Slavic word meaning [...] "nightmare") and strigoi, with the latter {{classified}} as either living or dead. Live strigoi were described as living witches with two hearts or souls, sometimes both. Strigoi {{were said to have}} the ability to send out their souls at night to meet with other strigoi and consume the blood of livestock and neighbours. Similarly, dead strigoi were described as reanimated corpses that also sucked blood and attacked their living family. Live strigoi became revenants after their death, but there were also many other ways of a person becoming a vampire. A person born with a caul, an extra nipple, a tail, or extra hair was doomed to become a vampire. The same fate applied to the seventh child in any family if all of his or her previous siblings were of the same sex, as well as someone born too early or someone whose mother had encountered a black cat crossing her path. If a pregnant woman did not eat salt or was looked upon by a vampire or a witch, her child would also become a vampire. So too would a child born out of wedlock. Others who were at risk of becoming vampires were those who died an unnatural death or before baptism. Finally, a person with red <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> was seen as a potential strigoi.|$|E
