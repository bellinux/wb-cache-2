50|$|Quantification {{of water}} {{resources}} and water quality and the relevant processes is the overall topic of WP4000. Because almost all water related issues in the Mekong Delta as the most downstream and receiving part of the Mekong can hardly be investigated or even solved without taking a look on the processes in the basin, WP4000 extends the general focus of WISDOM to {{the scale of the}} whole Mekong basin.

Isotope tracers are used within a top-down catchment intercomparison framework to investigate the role of geology in controlling streamwater mean transit time and their scaling relationships with the surrounding landscape. We found that streams draining catchments with permeable bedrock geology at the Drift Creek watershed in the Oregon Coast Range had longer mean transit times than catchments with poorly permeable bedrock at the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest in the Oregon Cascades. We also found that differences in permeability contrasts within the subsurface controlled whether mean transit time scaled with indices of catchment topography (for the poorly permeable bedrock) or with catchment area (for the permeable bedrock). We then investigated the process-reasons for the observed differences in mean transit time ranges and scaling behavior using a detailed, bottom-up approach to characterize subsurface water stores an...|$|R

30|$|Drainage basins, {{catchments}} and sub-catchments are {{the fundamental}} units {{for the management}} of land and water resources (Moore et al. 1994). Morphometric analysis in a drainage basin is important for <b>hydrological</b> <b>investigation</b> and development and management of drainage basin (Rekha et al. 2011). Morphometric parameters and climatic conditions are the key determinants of running water ecosystems functioning at the basin scale (Lotspeich and Platts 1982; Frissel et al. 1986). The quantitative analysis of morphometric parameters is found to have immense utility in river basin evaluation, watershed prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resource management at watershed level (Malik et al. 2011). The morphometric characteristics of the watershed control all surface runoff, and due to this condition, the watershed is considered an ideal territorial unit (Lima et al. 2011). Evaluation of morphometric parameters could be calculated from the analysis of various drainage parameters such as ordering of the various streams and basin area, perimeter and length of drainage channels, drainage density, stream frequency, bifurcation ratio, texture ratio, basin relief, ruggedness number, and time of concentration (Kumar et al. 2000; Nag and Chakraborthy 2003).|$|R

The primary objectives of the investigations were: (a) to analyse the underground karst connections, (b) to analyse discharge conditions along the River Zrmanja, and (c) to define variations in the catchment area along the River Zrmanja. The fact that the hydrological regime of the River Zrmanja is highly variable, due to the water losses along the open streamflow, strongly influenced the selection of the locations and heights of the HEPP dams. In spite of many hydrological, meteorological and hydrogeological measurements, the River Zrmanja catchment is insufficiently gauged.

The geographical area of these sub-watersheds is ranging from 6. 00 km 2 to 243. 39 km 2 and some morphometric analysis has done using GIS techniques. Outcomes of principal component analysis of 16 geomorphic parameters clearly depict that very few of these parameters like bifurcation ratio, channel sinu-osity index, dissection index and ruggedness number do not show any significant correlation with any of the component but other parameters are strongly correlated with the components. So, the bifurcation ratio, channel sinuosity index, dissection index and ruggedness number have been screened out from the analysis. The principal component loading matrix, using correlation matrix of sixteen parameters, reveals that first four components together account for 89. 075 % of the total ex-plained variance.
