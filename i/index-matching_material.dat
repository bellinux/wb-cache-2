50|$|In optics, an <b>index-matching</b> <b>material</b> is a substance, {{usually a}} liquid, cement (adhesive), or gel, {{which has an}} index of {{refraction}} that closely approximates that of another object (such as a lens, material, fiber-optic, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Some microscopes {{make use}} of oil-immersion {{objectives}} or water-immersion objectives for greater resolution at high magnification. These are used with <b>index-matching</b> <b>material</b> such as immersion oil or water and a matched cover slip between the objective lens and the sample. The refractive index of the <b>index-matching</b> <b>material</b> is higher than air allowing the objective lens to have a larger numerical aperture (greater than 1) so that the light is transmitted from the specimen to the outer face of the objective lens with minimal refraction. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved. The larger numerical aperture allows collection of more light making detailed observation of smaller details possible. An oil immersion lens usually has a magnification of 40 to 100×.|$|E
50|$|For more details, see {{the main}} article, oil {{immersion}}. Some microscopes also use other <b>index-matching</b> <b>materials</b> besides oil; see water immersion objective and solid immersion lens.|$|R
50|$|If a {{sculpture}} is broken into several pieces, art conservators may reattach the pieces using an adhesive such as Paraloid B-72 or epoxy. If the sculpture {{is made of}} a transparent or semitransparent material (such as glass), the seam where the pieces are attached will usually be much less noticeable if the refractive index of the adhesive matches the refractive index of the surrounding object. Therefore, art conservators may measure the index of objects and then use an index-matched adhesive. Similarly, losses (missing sections) in transparent or semitransparent objects are often filled using an <b>index-matched</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
40|$|There is a {{trend in}} the optical {{industry}} to automate the edge-blackening of optical components. The goal of edge-blackening is to coat the areas outside the functional region of optical components, namely the peripheral areas including the surface edge or "diaphragm" and apertures, with light absorbing, <b>index-matched</b> <b>material</b> to minimise scattering light. The common method today is the manual application with brush or ink-writer of quick-drying liquid pigmented synthetic resin. The lenses are fitted at a rotary table with a vacuum-pump or with plug-in socket. The increasing diversity of components and the decreasing quantity of batch size are a considerable disadvantage inhibiting the automation. Another problem {{is the use of}} a high number of lacquers with different or partly unknown properties, due to varying chemical bases. There were developed some automatic techniques to black the optical components: airbrush, microdispensation, application by a canula. The optical and mechanical p roperties of the lacquer were investigated...|$|R
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an <b>index-matching</b> <b>material</b> {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an <b>index-matching</b> <b>material,</b> Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} {{broadband}} enhancement of single-photon emission from color centres in silicon carbide (SiC) nanocrystals coupled to a planar hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) resonator. The design {{is based on}} positioning the single photon emitters within the HMM resonator, made of a dielectric <b>index-matched</b> with SiC <b>material,</b> and using a nanoantenna for improved collection efficiency. We show that employing HMM resonators {{can result in a}} significant enhancement of the spontaneous emission of a single photon source and its collection efficiency, compared to previous designs...|$|R
40|$|Triethanolamine {{was used}} as {{complexing}} agent to prepare soluble titania and alumina precursor powders from the respective metal alkoxides. Long-term stable coating solutions were obtained by dissolving varying ratios of these precursors in mixtures of ethanol and polyethylene glycol (PEG 200); the refractive index of the resulting films could be adjusted between 1. 48 and 2. 37. Thickness, refractive index and porosity were characterized {{as a function of}} annealing temperature. For an intermediate treatment temperature of 300 °C, partial liquefaction of the film material was observed. X-ray diffraction experiments reveal that the crystallization of TiO 2 is effectively suppressed by the presence of alumina precursor material. The titania and alumina precursor powders were successfully used as <b>index-matched</b> binder <b>material</b> of SiO 2 Stöber particles in the preparation of optical scattering layers. Such films may be used for light harvesting in thin film solar cells or the outcoupling of light from LEDs or OLEDs...|$|R
40|$|Based on the polarized-dependent {{absorption}} {{characteristic of}} Ti: S crystals, we propose {{a method to}} reduce the absorption coefficient of Ti: S by using a sigma-polarized pump. For Ti: S crystals, the absorption cross section of sigma-polarized pump light is approximately half that of pi-polarized pump light, which reduces the excited state density near {{the surface of the}} amplifier crystal, resulting in reduced transverse parasitic lasing and amplified spontaneous emission. The experimental results based on a diameter of 80 mm Ti: S confirmed the proposed method with different <b>index-matched</b> cladding <b>materials</b> [ethanol and bromonaphthalene (BN) ]. In the case of an ethanol cladding, the maximum amplified output energies for pi-and sigma-polarized pumping are 20. 8 J and 26. 8 J, respectively-corresponding to 28. 8 % energy improvement achieved by the s-polarized pump. In the case of a BN cladding, the maximum amplified output energies achieved by pi-and sigma-polarized pumping are 40 J and 44 J, respectively; this result corresponds to about 10 % energy improvement achieved by the sigma-polarized pump. This method can be used in larger size Ti: S amplifiers. (C) 2015 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
