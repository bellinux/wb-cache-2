50|$|While it's marketed for the Xbox 360 segment, {{this remote}} {{must be said}} {{to be part of the}} 5xx series. It runs the same software. The Harmony 360 is pre-configured to be used with the Xbox 360 console, and has special buttons, X, Y, A, B and media center control, {{correlating}} with the same as found on native Xbox controllers. It has a back-lit LCD screen and uses four AAA batteries.The hardware layout is mostly the same as the 550. The extra up/down arrows of the 550 is removed to make room for the colored X, Y, A and B buttons beneath the play and pause rows.

5000|$|Arashi is {{most famous}} for its {{involvement}} in the Battle of Midway. Providing escort to the carrier group, the destroyer was alerted {{to the presence of}} an approaching U.S. submarine, , when a Japanese Zero fighter aircraft dived and fired machine guns at Nautilus as it came to periscope depth. Arashi spotted the encounter and began to drop depth charges. The Japanese Task force changed course while Arashi continued its attack on Nautilus. Having kept Nautilus down long enough that she no longer was a threat, the captain of Arashi finally broke off the attack and steamed north to rejoin the carrier group. As two squadrons of dive bombers from Enterprise searched above for the Japanese Task Force, Arashi was spotted making great speed to the north. The ship's speed created a long wake, which acted as a <b>direction</b> <b>arrow</b> to the American aviators, guiding them to the Japanese carriers. Meanwhile, Japanese fighter aircraft protecting the carriers had been pulled away as they all attempted to engage an incoming torpedo attack from Hornets VT-8 torpedo squad. At the moment of decision, the Japanese carriers were essentially without high air cover. This made for an uncontested approach for the American dive bombers. The Enterprise dive bombers happened to arrive over the Japanese carriers [...] and [...] unimpeded, scoring multiple hits on Kaga and a single hit on Akagi that doomed both ships.|$|E

30|$|During {{the online}} {{measurements}} {{with the three}} feedback systems, few implementation errors were registered, and potential refinements were suggested. A general problem was detected in all three paradigms. At {{the beginning of each}} trial (except the first trial), the first few segments from the sliding window contained data from the previous trial due to overlapping. Therefore these ‘old’ data could affect the first few classifications of the new trial and in the worst case affect the first final classification of each trial (recall the voting process). Another potential improvement concerning all three feedback systems is to illustrate the stepwise moves (of the cross, ball and the bar fill) as continuous moves. Even though this change is only visual, it may minimize confusion, and prevent unconscious step-synchronized body movements. Finally the last common improvement is to instruct the subjects about the feedback paradigms (Cross and Basket: red target, Bars: <b>direction</b> <b>arrow)</b> at least few seconds before each trial. In the current paradigms, it was introduced concurrently with the beginning of the trial. Thus, the subjects spent up to couple of seconds to react on these commands while the segments from the sliding window were classified, possibly wrongly. In the following three subsections, specific improvements and changes of the paradigms are suggested.|$|E

U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are conducting research with the aim of providing critical data to the Native peoples of the region in response to growing dune activity, diminished vegetation cover, and an increasingly arid environment (Redsteer, 2002). The USGS interdisciplinary studies are focused on understanding the processes responsible for initiation of eolian (wind-blown) sand movement, including the influence of source sediment availability, climate, vegetation, and land use. Reactivation of inactive dunes could have serious consequences on human and anima...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the philosophical {{consequences of the}} recent discovery of direct violations of the time-reversal symmetry of weak interactions. It shows that although we have here an important case of the time asymmetry {{of one of the}} fundamental physical forces which could have had a great impact on the form of our world with an excess of matter over antimatter, this asymmetry cannot be treated as the asymmetry of time itself but rather as an asymmetry of some specific physical process in time. The paper also {{analyzes the}} consequences of the new discovery for the general problem of the possible connections between <b>direction</b> (<b>arrow)</b> of time and time-asymmetric laws of nature. These problems are analyzed in the context of Horwich’s Asymmetries in time: problems in the philosophy of science (1987) argumentation, trying to show that existence of a time–asymmetric law of nature is a sufficient condition for time to be anisotropic. Instead of Horwich’s sufficient condition for anisotropy of time, it is stressed that for a theory of asymmetry of time to be acceptable it should explain all fundamental time asymmetries: the asymmetry of traces, the asymmetry of causation (which holds although the electrodynamic, strong and gravitational interactions are invariant under time reversal), and the asymmetry between the fixed past and open future. It is so because the problem of the direction of time has originated from our attempts to understand these asymmetries and every plausible theory of the direction of time should explain them...|$|E

We present a data-driven method for learning hair models that enables the creation and animation of many interactive virtual characters in real-time (for gaming, character pre-visualization and design). Our model {{has a number of}} properties that make it appealing for interactive applications: (i) it preserves the key dynamic properties of physical simulation {{at a fraction of the}} computational cost, (ii) it gives the user continuous interactive {{control over the}} hair styles (e. g., lengths) and dynamics (e. g., softness) without requiring re-styling or re-simulation, (iii) it deals with hair-body collisions explicitly using optimization in the low-dimensional reduced space, (iv) it allows modeling of external phenomena (e. g., wind). Our method builds on the recent success of reduced models for clothing and fluid simulation, but extends them in a number of significant ways. We model motion of hair in a conditional reduced sub-space, where the hair basis vectors, which encode dynamics, are linear functions of userspecified hair parameters. We formulate collision handling as an optimization in this reduced sub-space using fast iterative least squares. We demonstrate our method by building dynamic, user-controlled models of hair styles.
