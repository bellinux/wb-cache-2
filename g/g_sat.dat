40|$|In three {{tropical}} rain forest light environments in Sabah, Malaysia, we compared photosynthesis in seedlings of ten climax tree species with putatively differing shade tolerances. The objectives {{of the study were}} (a) to characterise the range of photosynthetic responses in ten species of the Dipterocarpaceae and (b) to elucidate those photosynthetic characteristics that might provide a basis for niche partitioning. Seedlings were acclimated (c. 7 months) in three light environments; understorey, partial shade and a gap (140 m 2). The light environments represented a gradation in median diurnal (0630 - 1830 hours) photon flux density (PFD) ranging from understorey (4. 7 μmol m- 2 s- 1) through partial shade (21. 2 μmol m- 2 s- 1) to gap (113. 7 μmol m- 2 s- 1). Integrated diurnal PFD were in the sequence gap > partial shade > understorey (15. 2, 4. 7, 1. 3 mol m- 2 day- 1, respectively). In gap-acclimated plants, species differed in the photosynthetic light-response variables apparent quantum yield, dark respiration rate, light compensation point, net saturated leaf assimilation rate (A(sat)), and in stomatal conductance (<b>g(s</b> <b>sat))</b> when assimilation rate (A) was saturated. A light-demanding pioneer species (Macaranga hypoleuca) and a shade-demanding understorey species (Begonia sp.) had, respectively, higher and lower A(sat) and <b>g(s</b> <b>sat)</b> than the dipterocarp species. In high-light conditions A(sat) and <b>g(s</b> <b>sat)</b> were strongly positively correlated in dipterocarp species. Differing photosynthetic characteristics of gap acclimated plants suggest that, in these dipterocarp species, different rates of carbon fixation may be an important factor contributing towards niche partitioning. Mean integrated diurnal A (A(diurnal)) in the gap, partial shade and understory were, respectively, 122. 9, 52. 7, 20. 5 mmol m- 2 day- 1. Differences occurred in A(diurnal) of dipterocarp species between light environments. When Macaranga was included, differences in A(diurnal) were evident in the gap and partial shade, and in both cases were attributed to the pioneer. For the variable A(diurnal), there was of a shift in the rank position of Macaranga among light environments, but a shift did not occur among the dipterocarp species. Results from this study are consistent with the idea that rates of carbon fixation per unit leaf area may contribute towards niche differentiation between the climax and single pioneer species, but not within the group of climax species. Other physiological and/or carbon allocation factors may be involved in any niche partitioning; dipterocarp species often have inherently different growth rates and susceptibility to herbivory. As an alternative to niche partitioning, dipterocarp species may co-exist in natural light environments as a result of habitat disequilibrium or purely stochastic processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{adaptive}} noise mechanism {{was introduced}} in Novelty+ to automatically adapt noise settings during the search [4]. The local search algorithm <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT</b> deterministically exploits promising decreasing variables to reduce randomness and consequently the dependence on noise parameters. In this paper, we first integrate the adaptive noise mechanism in <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT</b> to obtain an algorithm adaptG 2 W SAT, whose performance suggests that the deterministic exploitation of promising decreasing variables cooperates well with this mechanism. Then, we propose an approach that uses look-ahead for promising decreasing variables to further reinforce this cooperation. We implement this approach in adaptG 2 W SAT, resulting in a new local search algorithm called adaptG 2 W SATP. Without any manual noise or other parameter tuning, adaptG 2 W SATP shows generally good performance, compared with <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT</b> with approximately optimal static noise settings, or is sometimes even better than <b>G</b> 2 W <b>SAT.</b> In addition, adaptG 2 W SATP is favorably compared with state-of-the-art local search algorithms such as R+adaptNovelty+ and V W. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} invertibility of certain analogs of the Turing jump {{operator}} in the polynomialtime Turing degrees. If C is some complexity class, the C-jump {{of a set}} A is the canonical C-complete set relative to A. It is shown that the PSPACE-jump and EXP-jump operators are not invertible, i. e., there is a PSPACE-hard (resp. EXP-hard) set that is not ptime Turing equivalent to the PSPACE-jump (resp. EXP-jump) of any set. It is also shown that if PH collapses to Σ p k, then the Σ p k -jump is not invertible. In particular, if NP = co-NP, then the NP-jump is not invertible, witnessed, in particular, by <b>G</b> Φ <b>SAT,</b> where <b>G</b> is any 1 -generic set. These results run contrary to the Friedberg Completeness Criterion [Fri 57] in recursion theory, which says that every (recursive) Turing degree above 0 0 is the Turing jump of another degree. The sets used in the paper to witness C-jump noninvertibility are all of the form G Φ C, where G is 1 -generic and C is some C-complete set. Other facts regarding 1 -generics G and <b>G</b> Φ <b>SAT</b> are also explored in this paper; in particular, G always lies in NP A Γ P A for some A p tt G, but if A p Φ <b>G</b> Φ <b>SAT</b> p T SAT A for some A, then G p T A, which in turn implies either G p T A or P 6 = NP. ...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{model of}} graph related {{formulae}} that we call the Constraint-Graph model. A constraintgraph is a labeled multi-graph (a graph where loops and parallel edges are allowed), where each edge e is labeled by a distinct Boolean variable and every vertex is associate with a Boolean function over the variables that label its adjacent edges. A Boolean assignment to the variables satisfies the constraint graph if it satisfies every vertex function. We associate with a constraint-graph G the property of all assignments satisfying <b>G,</b> denoted <b>SAT</b> (<b>G).</b> We show that the above model is quite general. That is, for every property of strings P there exists a property of constraint-graphs PG such that P is testable using q queries iff PG is thus testable. In addition, we present a large family of constraint-graphs for which <b>SAT</b> (<b>G)</b> is testable with constant number of queries. As an implication of this, we infer the testability of some edge coloring problems (e. g. the property of two coloring of the edges in which every node is adjacent {{to at least one}} vertex of each color). Another implication is that every property of Boolean strings that can be represented by a Read-twice CNF formula is testable. We note that this is the best possible {{in terms of the number}} of occurrences of every variable in a formula. ...|$|R

40|$|Aerial {{parts of}} lettuce plants were grown under natural {{tropical}} fluctuating ambient temperatures, but with their roots exposed to two different root-rone temperatures (RZTs) : a constant 20 degreesC-RZT and a fluctuating ambient (A-) RZT from 23 - 40 degreesC, Plants grown at A-RZT showed lower photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), midday leaf relative water content (RWC), and chlorophyll fluorescence ratio F-v/F-m than 20 degreesC-RZT plants on both sunny and cloudy days. Substantial midday depression of A and g(s) occurred on both sunny and cloudy days in both RZT treatments, although F-v/F-m did not vary diurnally on cloudy days. Reciprocal temperature transfer experiments investigated the occurrence and possible causes of stomatal and non-stomatal limitations of photosynthesis. For both temperature transfers, light-saturated stomatal conductance (<b>g(s)</b> (<b>sat))</b> and photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation (A(sat)) were {{highly correlated with}} each other and with midday RWC, suggesting that A was limited by water stress-mediated stomatal closure, However, prolonged growth at A-RZT reduced light- and CO 2 -saturated photosynthetic O- 2 evolution (P-max), indicating non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis. Tight temporal coupling of leaf nitrogen content and P-max during both temperature transfers suggested that decreased nutrient status caused this non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis...|$|R

In this study, total productivity, root morphology, photosynthesis and nitrogen (N) metabolism of two RILs, 168 HS and 200 HR were studied under full N (100 % NO 3 –), +N (125 % NO 3 –) and –N (50 % NO 3 –). The shoot and root productivity of both RILs under +N and –N treatments declined compared to those of full N plants. Reductions in root length, root surface area and total number of root tips were observed in 168 HS plants under both +N and –N treatments.
