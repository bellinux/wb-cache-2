5|$|Riders have experimented, however. After the Second World War many tried wooden rims of {{the sort}} used {{at the start of}} cycle racing. Francesco Moser wrapped his {{handlebars}} with strips of foam in the 1970s. Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and Greg LeMond experimented with suspension in their <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The bicycle {{made for}} Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The {{distance}} from bottom bracket to rear axle was 419mm {{rather than his}} normal 403. The distance from the bottom bracket to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1980s, Lamborghini {{produced}} a limited-production run of a 1,000cc sports motorcycle. UK weekly newspaper Motor Cycle News reported in 1994 – when featuring an example available through an Essex motorcycle retailer – that 24 examples were produced with a Lamborghini alloy frame having adjustable steering head angle, Kawasaki GPz1000RX engine/transmission unit, Ceriani <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> and Marvic wheels. The bodywork was plastic and fully integrated with front fairing merged into fuel tank and seat cover {{ending in a}} rear tail-fairing. The motorcycles were designed by Lamborghini stylists and produced by French business Boxer Bikes.|$|E
25|$|The novelty {{lasted only}} a day. Gaston Rebry escaped next day with two others and took the lead, {{although}} the three previous leaders were now equal second. A day later, Fontan {{was back in the}} lead. He wore the yellow jersey again for a stage of 323km that started before sunrise. He rode seven kilometres and then fell. Some accounts say he rode into a gutter, others that he was knocked off by a dog. The fall broke his <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> {{and the rest of the}} race rode by. Fontan was entitled to ride a replacement bike but only if he could show the irreparable damage to judges.|$|E
25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted tooth drive chain. It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|E
50|$|Piaggio also {{produced}} some stablemates to the Ciao: The Piaggio Si, with a telescopic <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> suspension, the Piaggio Grillo, with 14-inch wheel, Piaggio Boxer, the Si's ancestor, the Piaggio Boss, with kick starter, mass button and speedometer and the Piaggio Bravo with a telescopic <b>front</b> <b>fork</b> and a shock absorber rear suspension.|$|R

500|$|When braking is {{increasing}} {{the center of}} mass m may move forward relative to the front wheel, as the rider moves forward relative to the bike, and, if the bike has suspension on the front wheel, the <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> compress under load, changing the bike geometry. This all puts extra load on the front wheel.|$|E
500|$|SYM Motors of Taiwan {{licensed}} the Super Cub {{design as}} the Symba 100, previously called the Symba 110, which they exported to the US. While keeping the basic design, SYM increased {{the size of}} the front brake from , and added an LED fuel gauge. Instead of leading link <b>front</b> <b>forks,</b> it uses telescopic forks. The Symba engine has a carbureted [...] single claimed to produce [...] at 8500rpm, with a four speed gearbox using a centrifugal clutch semi-automatic transmission.|$|E
500|$|In 1966 the C50 {{appeared}} and remained in production through the mid 80s, {{becoming one of}} the most widespread and familiar versions of the Super Cub. Honda replaced the C100's [...] 50cc OHV engine with the [...] OHC alloy head and iron cylinder engine from the CS50 and C65, which increased power from [...] Similarly the CM90 was replaced in 1966 with the [...] OHC CM91, which a year later on 1967, got restyled forks and headlamp like the C50, [...] to become the familiar C90. Though the basic design of Cub remained unchanged, new styling and improvements included enclosed <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b> The C100 stayed in production alongside the newer versions one more year, until 1967. After 1980 the USA C70 was called the C70 Passport.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{development}} was the Indian Velo 500, a limited-production run using a Velocette single-cylinder engine and gearbox with mainly Italian cycle parts, including a lightweight frame from the Italjet company, Marzocchi <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> with Grimeca front hub having a twin-leading shoe brake, Borrani aluminium rims and quickly-detachable tank and seat, {{resulting in a}} weight-saving of [...] compared to the traditional Velocette Venom.|$|E
2500|$|After {{becoming}} {{a member of}} the Bavarian Police Team, Meier competed in 1000km endurance trials that were popular at the time, considered as good training for motorcycle dispatch riders. In 1934, Meier attracted attention from the German Army motorcycle team after finishing a 1000km enduro an hour ahead of schedule, riding an unpopular 400cc single-cylinder BMW R4 with pressed-steel frame and out-moded trailing-link <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b> With fellow competitors [...] Fritz Linhardt and Joseph Forstner in the German Army team, they won so many enduro events that Meier became known as [...] "Der Gusseiserne Schorsch" [...] (Ironman Georg).|$|E
2500|$|Nineteen fifty-three saw the {{introduction}} of a new 175cc overhead cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (Turismo Lusso) for street use and soon developed a sportier 175cc version with larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version (1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname [...] "Disco Volante" [...] (flying saucer) as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing version 175cc [...] "Super Sport" [...] for MSDS racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b> In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. Its design earned it the nickname [...] "Squalo" [...] (Shark). This 175cc racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid-1950s, where tuners learned to bore it out to over 200cc capacity. [...] Racers including Micheal O’Rourke, Derek Minter, and Bob Keeler raced the 175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe {{with a great deal of}} success. The marketing strategy of [...] "race it on Sunday, sell it on Monday" [...] was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP off-road race, in California.|$|E

5000|$|Conic SLX; early (1989) models had {{round tubes}} with {{internal}} stiffeners and curved <b>front</b> <b>forks,</b> later models had clover leaf design down tube to add stiffness to the frame, and had straight <b>front</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The frames were {{initially}} available with AMC and Norton telescopic <b>front</b> <b>forks</b> and British Hub Co. (Motoloy) brakes front and rear.
