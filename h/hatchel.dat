40|$|Abstract: Standard {{algorithms}} {{for state}} estimation {{may be viewed}} as quasi-Newton's methods applied to the rst order optimality conditions of a least squares minimization problem. Previous work in the literature has documented the (somewhat surprising) fact that when a full Newton's method is applied to the same formulation, convergence properties are far worse than the quasi-Newton's method, until the iterates reach an EXTREMELY small neighborhood of the solution. Motivated by these results, and by availability of e cient algorithms to compute higher order derivatives necessary in an exact Newton formulation, the companion paper [2] proposes several Newton's method variants to improve state estimator convergence. In this paper Benchmarks for the IEEE 118 and 300 bus test systems are provided, with comparisons against classical normal equations, <b>Hatchel's</b> method, and QR algorithms. In these benchmark examples, the new algorithms developed show more reliable convergence for ill-conditioned cases, while making minimal sacri ces in computational e-ciency for well-conditioned cases...|$|R

Not a mouthful could he taste before he plowed and sowed, and cut and bound sheaves, and threshed and winnowed and sifted the grain, and ground and sifted the flour, and kneaded and baked, and then he ate; but I {{get up in the}} morning and find all this ready before me. How much had Adam to weary himself with! Not a shirt could he put on before he sheared and washed the wool, and <b>hatcheled</b> and dyed and spun and wove and sewed, and then he clothed himself; but I rise in the morning and find all this ready before me. How many trades are anxiously busy early in the morning; and I rise and find all these things before me!" ...|$|R
50|$|Émile Sacré's {{father was}} Auguste Sacré, an {{engineer}} who had invented a machine dividing the bast of {{hemp and flax}} with a <b>hatchel</b> (hackle) to make it safe to be spun, and who was manager of the Société de Saint-Gilles linen mill near Brussels. Sacré studied at the Académie royale des beaux-arts de Bruxelles from 1866 to 1870 and with the architect Jean-Pierre Cluysenaer. He {{died at the age}} of 38. His brother established a triennial prize, along with the Prix Auguste Sacré for engineering in memory of the brothers' father, in a legacy of 1904. The sculptor Charles Van Der Stappen (1843-1910) made a bronze of Émile Sacré which was presented at the exhibition of Les XX in 1884.|$|E
40|$|In May 1999, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{acquired}} airborne {{synthetic aperture}} radar (AIRSAR) data over the <b>Hatchel</b> and Montague Test Sites in Texas. We analyzed P- and L-band polarimetric radar data from these AIRSAR missions to assess whether AIRSAR {{could be used as}} a rapid and remote platform for screening large areas at risk for near-surface soil and water salinization. Ongoing geological, geophysical, and hydrological studies at the <b>Hatchel</b> Test Site in Runnels County and the Montague Test Site in Montague County have demonstrated the utility of high-resolution airborne electromagnetic (EM) induction in mapping electrical conductivity changes that accompany shallow natural and oil-field related salinization at these sites in the Colorado and Red River basins. We compared AIRSAR and airborne EM data quantitatively by (1) selecting representative flight lines from airborne EM surveys of the <b>Hatchel</b> and Montague sites, (2) extracting measurement locations and apparent conductivities at the highest available EM frequency, (3) identifying and extracting all P- and L-band backscatter intensities for all locations within 5 m of an airborne EM measurement, and (4) examining the spatial and magnitude relationships between apparent conductivity and all radar polarization and polarization-ratio combinations. For both test sites, backscatter intensity in all individual P- and L-band polarizations was slightly negatively correlated with apparent conductivity. In most modes this was manifested as a decrease in the range and magnitude of backscatter intensity as apparent conductivity increased. Select single-band and cross-band polarization ratios exhibited somewhat higher correlation with apparent conductivity by partly diminishing the dominance of the vegetation contribution to V backscatter intensity. The highest correlation with conductivity was obtained using the L-band vertical- to cross-polarization ratio, the P-band vertical- to L-band cross-polarization ratio, and the P-band vertical-to cross-polarization ratio. These correlations were higher for the more arid (and less electrically conductive) <b>Hatchel</b> Test Site than they were for the Montague Test Site...|$|E
