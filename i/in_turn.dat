40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{machinability}} of BN Added Steels <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> with several cutting tools. The highest Al content TiAlN coated carbide tool showed smaller flank wear and crater depth {{than those of the}} other TiAlN, TiC, TiN and TiCN coated carbide tools. It shows that these tool wears depend on the affinity between tool surface and adhered layer including AlN. The wear of the alumina ceramic tool <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> BN added steel was smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> standard steel. However the wears <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> low Al content BN added steel and high Al content carbon steel were almost the same as that <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> standard steel. It shows that appropriate Al and BN in work material are necessary to obtain the longer tool life. The wears of the TiC added alumina ceramic tool and the CBN tool <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> BN added steel were also smaller than those <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> standard steel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{determination}} of optimal cutting parameters have significant importance for economic machining in minimizing of particular operating mistakes like tool fraction, wear, and chatter. The evolutionary algorithm GA {{is used to}} improve many solutions of optimization complex problems in many applications. This paper reviewed the ideal selection of cutting parameters <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> operation using GA and its variants. This study deals with GA algorithm in different machining aspects <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> operation like surface roughness, production rate, tool life, production cost, machining time and cutting temperature. The survey showed {{that there are many}} papers in the field of turning parameters optimization using GA, but there is a lack in studies in the field of cutting temperature optimization <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> operation which is very important problem in machining operation. In addition, there are rare papers that studied dry turning operations.

5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> might be described in terms of human physiology, which <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
