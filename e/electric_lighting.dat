The Bluebell Railway has four 1898–1900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages and a fifth, built at Neasden, is at the London Transport Museum.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, the {{congregation}} had installed 10 stained glass windows, <b>electric</b> <b>lighting,</b> a new pulpit, and two large bronze menorahs, and employed six people. Dues were $12 (today $) per year, and Sunday school fees were $0.02 (today $0) per session. Membership {{had grown to}} 140 families by 1919.

5|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>lighting</b> did {{not come}} to Honolulu for another 3 years, when Iolani Palace led the way with the first {{electric}} lights in the kingdom. The monarchy invited the public to attend the first-night lighting ceremonies, and 5,000 people showed up. The Royal Hawaiian Band entertained, refreshments were served, and the King on horseback paraded his troops around the grounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>lighting</b> was {{provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots who argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E

50|$|In 1887, the Chaudière <b>Electric</b> <b>Light</b> and Power Company {{was formed}} by Thomas Ahearn, a local man and partner of Ahearn & Soper, formed in the early 1880s.

5|$|In 1962, Richmond Council {{announced}} {{the replacement of}} the gaslamps on the bridge with <b>electric</b> <b>lighting.</b> The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today.|$|E
5|$|With the {{expansion}} of the electric supply industry in the early 1900s, power stations were built to supply homes with <b>electric</b> <b>lighting.</b> Around Newcastle upon Tyne this led to the construction of power stations at Lemington, The Close and Carville. Two supply companies built the stations, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) to the east of Newcastle, and the Newcastle and District <b>Electric</b> <b>Lighting</b> Company (DisCo) to the west. To meet an increasing demand for electricity, NESCo commissioned Dunston Power Station (later Dunston A Power Station) on the Derwent Haugh, a large flood plain to the west of Gateshead, to balance the supply of the Newcastle area with the Carville station. Construction of the new station began in 1908, the work undertaken by the company of Sir Robert McAlpine. They completed the construction in the short time of 20months, and this was to be their first in a large number of power station constructions, following the decline of the railway industry. In 1910, the station was opened and began generating electricity.|$|E
5|$|At the 1909 opening, 35miles (56kilometres) {{of track}} had been {{completed}} with electricity supplied by the <b>Electric</b> <b>Lighting</b> and Supply Co. The electric tram system ran on 600Volts DC supplied at first from two converter stations, No.1 converter station on East Terrace with 2,500kW of AC to DC capacity and No.2 station at Thebarton with a capacity of 900kW. To cope with variable loads on the system, very large storage lead–acid batteries were installed, the initial one at East Terrace comprising 293 cells and a 50ton tank of sulphuric acid.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of John Moncure Robinson's {{retirement}} {{as president of the}} company in 1893, the Old Bay Line had upgraded its fleet with propeller-driven, steel-hulled steamers equipped with modern conveniences such as <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> and staterooms with private baths. The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern screw propeller instead of old-fashioned side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay Line as president for 26years (1867–1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Patience, Carte {{built the}} large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's {{permanent}} home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by <b>electric</b> <b>lighting.</b> Patience moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran {{for a total of}} 578 performances, surpassing the run of H.M.S. Pinafore and becoming the second longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time in history.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 he {{designed}} an <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> project for Barcelona's Muralla de Mar, or seawall, {{which was not}} carried out. It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant motifs, friezes, shields and names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition {{for the construction of}} the San Sebastián social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladrén Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los Ríos; Gaudí submitted a project that synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Plaça Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.|$|E

5|$|In 1902 {{the theatre}} closed {{for nine months}} to enable {{extensive}} building work {{to be carried out}} in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of <b>electric</b> <b>lighting,</b> a new fire curtain and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, an {{increasing}} number of areas were being provided with electricity, and train and tram lines were being electrified. In the area around Newcastle upon Tyne, this required the opening of power stations at Wallsend, Forth Banks and The Close. Two supply companies built the stations, the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Electric Supply Company (NESCo) to the east of Newcastle, and the Newcastle and District <b>Electric</b> <b>Lighting</b> Company (DisCo) to the west.|$|E

Her grand saloon and skylighted promenade deck contained several fountains and a large aquarium filled with trout and other fish of the lakes. The cabins and public spaces were fitted out with oak paneling, velvet carpets, etched glass windows, leather furniture and marble. Shops and restaurants were provided for the passengers.|$|E

5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> in 1880, leading to Paddington being {{decorated}} with Christmas lights that year. Although {{the system was}} unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with gas lighting on the same scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.|$|E
5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed <b>electric</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
