He is stabbed in the spine before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery Tyrell, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. King Tommen Baratheon witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep and commits suicide by <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> a window.|$|E

5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs {{got off to}} a good start, <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> to a 12–1 {{lead and}} a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time in}} school history.|$|E

5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> {{of the building}} onto a van {{in an attempt to}} spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the roof structure on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E
5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes {{with the intention of}} fixing their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> of their seats and losing their items. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, The Haunting was only an average success at the box office.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape—two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz—the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present—briefly escaped by <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the hostages were embassy staff—predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer tasked with guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from Battersea, who had worked for the embassy in various positions since 1947.|$|E

5|$|Coltrane was the Simpsons fourth cat, {{adopted from}} an animal shelter {{shortly after the}} death of Snowball III. Lisa is not certain she wants another cat, but her other one has haunted her and Coltrane name wins her over due to its {{resemblance}} of jazz musician John Coltrane's name. Upon bringing Coltrane home, Lisa decides to play him some of John Coltrane music on her saxophone, but the noise frightens him and he commits suicide by <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> the window. Coltrane was the Simpsons only cat since Snowball I to have been white, although {{he was the only one}} not to be named Snowball. However, Lisa evidently considers him as part of the Snowball lineage, as she names her next cat Snowball V, implying that Coltrane was Snowball IV.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Indiana Jones {{narrowly}} escapes {{the clutches}} of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai, China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone {{may be one of the}} five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualifier}} round, in atrocious {{conditions the}} Crusaders defeated the Highlanders 17-0. The game was notable for the Crusaders defence, which kept the highly-talented Highlanders scoreless. The Crusaders then defeated the Chiefs comfortably 27-13, repaying earlier playoff losses to the team. The Crusaders faced the Lions in the final, and {{owing to the}} Lions holding home advantage, had to fly nearly 12,000km. The Crusaders confronted a daunting task to win the 2017 title. The Crusaders would have to battle a formidable Lions team, altitude and 61,000 Lions fans in the fortress of Ellis Park Stadium. The Crusaders started strongly with two tries, <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> to a 12-0 lead. In the 38th minute Kwagga Smith took out David Havili in the air, causing Havili to fall dangerously. Smith was given a red card. At half time the Crusaders led 15-3. Kieran Read scored a try immediately after half time to extend the lead to 22-3. However, the travel, altitude and fast pace of the game took a toll on the Crusaders. The attacking Lions scored two tries {{to reduce the deficit}} to 25-17. But the defence of the Crusaders held out giving the Crusaders a record eighth title 25-17, while avenging last years result.|$|E

25|$|On March 10, 1948, the Czechoslovakian {{minister}} {{of foreign affairs}} Jan Masaryk was found dead, in his pajamas, {{in the courtyard of}} the Foreign Ministry below his bathroom window. The initial investigation stated that he committed suicide by <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> of the window, although some believe that he was murdered by the ascendant Communists. A 2004 police investigation into his death concluded that, contrary to the initial ruling, he did not commit suicide, but was defenestrated, most likely by Czechoslovak Communists and their Soviet NKVD advisers for opposing the February 1948 Communist putsch.|$|E
25|$|The Knights {{scored on}} seven {{of their first}} eight possessions, <b>jumping</b> <b>out</b> to an early 21–0 lead.

A touchdown in the fourth quarter put the game well out of reach, and the Knights lengthened their winning streak to six straight.|$|E
