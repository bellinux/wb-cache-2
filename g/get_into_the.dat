5|$|Believing that {{by taking}} {{in one of}} the Cortexiphan {{subjects}} they can stop the effects of another quake, a willing Lane from the parallel universe travels to the prime and is hooked to Walter's (John Noble) equipment. Olivia also hooks herself up, allowing her to communicate what she sees in Lane's mind. When the prime version of Lane attempts to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting the process for Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that the next set of quakes will cause both universes to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Avalanche {{were forced}} to lose many of their key players {{in order to stay}} below the salary cap. Even with the loss of {{teammates}} Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote, Sakic still helped the Avalanche <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, where they eventually lost to the Anaheim Ducks in the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the Avalanche for the 2006–07 season. Upon the retirement of Steve Yzerman a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the League leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was in {{good health}} {{for most of his}} life.

In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful heart valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.

According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their children and grandchildren were at the hospital.|$|E

The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty.

5|$|In The Battle of the Labyrinth, Annabeth and Percy find an {{entrance}} into the Labyrinth during a game of capture the flag.

Using the Labyrinth, Percy tries to find Daedalus so Luke cannot get Ariadne's string, thereby foiling Luke's invasion.|$|E

5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2008, Samaras {{signed for}} Scottish Premier League club Celtic on a six-month loan deal, {{with the club}} having an option to buy him {{at the end of}} his loan spell.

He also said that he was attracted to the fact that he would regularly be able to play in European competition with Celtic.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 1768, two customs {{employees}} (called tidesmen) boarded Hancock's brig Lydia in Boston Harbor. Hancock was summoned, {{and finding}} that the agents lacked a writ of assistance (a general search warrant), he did {{not allow them to}} go below deck. When one of them later managed to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck. Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when Massachusetts Attorney General Jonathan Sewall ruled that Hancock had broken no laws. Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth}} between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} set of The Queen Victoria pub {{was taken}} apart and rebuilt exactly to scale on the George Lucas Stage, a fire stage at Elstree Film Studios, for interior scenes, filmed over four days.

Controlled gas pipes were used to shoot jets of flames and a header was specially built to collapse on Phil. Salisbury had {{to ensure that the}} fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already-filmed exterior scenes. Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy's departure by ten minutes, meaning it would clash with rival soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen any sense of awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally able to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> story, {{in part due to}} the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E

They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} these new routes offered a more {{efficient}} way to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower town than the cramped streets of rue du Midi/Zuidstraat, rue des Fripiers/Kleerkopersstraat and rue Neuve and helped revitalize the lower quarters of the town. In order to accomplish this revitalization and attract investment, public buildings were constructed {{as part of the}} Léon Suys project including the Brussels Stock Exchange. The vast Halles Centrales/Centrale Hallen, a good example of metallic architecture, replaced unhygienic open-air markets, though it was torn down in 1958. The monumental fountain that was to break the monotony of the boulevards at Fontainas Square was abandoned for budgetary reasons.|$|E
