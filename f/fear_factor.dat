In {{order to make it}} more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair it up with the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; <b>Fear</b> <b>Factor</b> and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season.

30|$|Social Debt is {{indirectly}} {{connected to}} socio-technical decisions; analysing the latter requires {{aiming for the}} former - As evident from Figure 1 {{there is no direct}} relation between socio-technical decisions (“Socio-Technical Decision” class in Figure 1) and the emergence of social debt (“SocialDebt” class in Figure 1). For example in our case study of “Integra” we found a key decision to adopt a new programming language as an Integration bridge between RED and GREEN. This decision seemed good {{at the time it was}} taken and was motivated by two reasons: (a) the language’s efficiency for the job; (b) the language was shared between RED and GREEN, tentatively helping in the creation of an organisational bridge between the two communities. Eventually, however, the decision caused the addition of new technicians to the organisational and social structure which caused <b>fear</b> <b>factors</b> to emerge in the rest of developers. Consequent condescending behaviour resulted in managers and software architects to issue a project slow-down, for problem-solving. At the end of the study, we confirmed that problems related to that decision were still causing slowdowns. This not withstanding, this property might be related to the exploratory nature of our study. Since we introduced social debt only after the interviews, it would have been impossible for interviewees to point out direct relationships between social debt and socio-technical decisions, if any.|$|R

The subject was very largely unexplored in the veterinary world, but extensive research had been done in the medical field. There were the challenges of formulating methods of collecting primary data in the veterinary field, and looking at the medical field to see if the methodologies were transferable.
