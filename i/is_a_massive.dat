5|$|An {{embankment}} dam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> artificial water barrier. It is typically {{created by the}} emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae B <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{luminous}} hot star, {{about which}} little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that {{ought not to}} be produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B is thought to be a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these stars}} and Sirius lie Omicron1, Omicron2, and Pi Canis Majoris. Omicron2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun. Only 7 million years old, it has {{exhausted}} {{the supply of}} hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium. It has an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval. Omicron1 is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an irregular variable star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99. Around 18 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its luminosity.|$|E
5|$|Cox {{has also}} said that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> irony, both in the film and in real life, that a {{religion}} so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality. In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay. Nevertheless, a major theme of Latter Days {{is that there is}} an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E

5|$|The primary (IK Pegasi A) is an A-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{displays}} minor pulsations in luminosity. It is categorized as a Delta Scuti variable star {{and it has}} a periodic cycle of luminosity variation that repeats itself about 22.9 times per day. Its companion (IK Pegasi B) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> white dwarf—a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. They orbit each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31 million kilometres, or 19 million miles, or 0.21 astronomical units (AU). This is smaller than the orbit of Mercury around the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Doom leverages his {{experience}} into {{a deal with}} the American military, which forces the Fantastic Four to work with Doom. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a tachyon pulse generator that will separate the Surfer from it, while Doom devises a machine whose function he keeps secret. In the Black Forest, the Surfer confronts Sue and reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the Fantastic Four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia, where they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where he informs her that his master, known by the people of his world as Galactus, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> cloud-like cosmic entity that feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a homing beacon summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus, who will otherwise destroy the Surfer's planet.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has a very}} {{localised}} distribution, being {{restricted to}} Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon, both located in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Mount Kinabalu <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic batholith. At 4095.2m, it {{is by far the}} tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area's rarest species can be found here.|$|E

5|$|The oldest extant Japanese lexica date to {{the early}} Heian period. Based on the Chinese Yupian, the Tenrei Banshō Meigi was {{compiled}} around 830 by Kūkai and is the oldest extant character dictionary made in Japan. The Hifuryaku <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> Chinese dictionary in 1000 fascicles listing the usage of words and characters in more than 1500 texts of diverse genres. Compiled in 831 by Shigeno Sadanushi and others, it is the oldest extant Japanese proto-encyclopedia. There are two National Treasures of the Ishinpō, the oldest extant medical treatise of Japanese authorship compiled in 984 by Tanba Yasuyori. It {{is based on a}} large number of Chinese medical and pharmaceutical texts and contains knowledge about drug prescription, herbal lore, hygiene, acupuncture, moxibustion, alchemy and magic. The two associated treasures consist of the oldest extant (partial) and the oldest extant complete manuscript respectively.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} Rainbow Program's deactivation, {{there is a}} {{resurgence}} of terrorist activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, yet they are causing chaos across the world. To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett). Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. The operation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks and uncertainties. Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission – to hunt down the leader of their enemy – and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.|$|E
