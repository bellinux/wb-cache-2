5000|$|He is {{a pioneer}} in <b>information</b> <b>physics,</b> edited an {{influential}} book on [...] "Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of Information", and spearheaded the efforts that finally exorcised Maxwell's demon. Zurek showed that the demon can extract energy from its environment for [...] "free" [...] {{as long as it}} (a) is able to find structure in the environment, and (b) is able to compress this pattern (whereas the remaining code is more succinct than the brute-force description of the structure). Like this the demon can exploit thermal fluctuations. However, he showed that in thermodynamic equilibrium (the most likely state of the environment), the demon can at best break even, even if the information about the environment is compressed. As a result of his exploration, Zurek suggests to redefine entropy and distinguish between two parts: the part that we already know about the environment (measured in Kolmogorov complexity), and, conditioned on our knowledge, the remaining uncertainty (measured in Shannon entropy).|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} 'information' in five {{different}} realms – technological, physical, biological, social and philosophical – is briefly examined. The 'gaps' between these conceptions are dis‐ cussed, and unifying frameworks of diverse nature, {{including those of}} Shannon/Wiener, Landauer, Stonier, Bates and Floridi, are examined. The value of attempting to bridge the gaps, while avoiding shallow analogies, is explained. With <b>information</b> <b>physics</b> gaining general acceptance, and biology gaining the status of an information science, it seems rational to look for links, relationships, analogies and even helpful metaphors {{between them and the}} library/information sciences. Prospects for doing so, involving concepts of complexity and emergence, are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{that we have}} a {{timetable}} of a round-robin tournament with a number of teams, and distances among their homes. The home-away assignment problem is to find a home-away assignment that minimizes the total traveling distance. We propose a formulation of the home-away assignment problem as an integer problem, and a rounding method [2]. Computational experiments show that our method quickly generates feasible solutions close to optimal. This paper is also referred to as A. Suzuka, R. Miyashiro, A. Yoshise and T.

40|$|When {{the bulk}} spacetime has a {{foliation}} structure, the collective {{dynamics of the}} hypersurfaces should reveal {{certain aspects of the}} bulk physics. The procedure of reducing the bulk to a hypersurface, called ADM reduction, was implemented in [3] where the 4 D Einstein-Hilbert action was reduced along the radial reduction. In this work, reduction along the angular directions is considered with a main goal to firmly establish the method of dimensional reduction to a hypersurface of foliation. We obtain a theory on a 2 D plane (the (t, r) -plane) and observe that novel and elaborate boundary effects are crucial for the consistency of the reduction. The reduction leads to a 2 D interacting quantum field theory. We comment on its application to black hole <b>information</b> <b>physics.</b> ar X i...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{information}} theory has been generalized to allow binary data to be represented by two-state quantum mechanical systems.

The additional freedom introduced into <b>information</b> <b>physics</b> with quantum systems has opened up a variety of capabilities that go well beyond those of conventional information.
