5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, <b>his</b> <b>murder</b> was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store.

Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} turned against him and organized <b>his</b> <b>murder,</b> only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>murder</b> {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, as {{a result}} of the {{declarations}} of Di Carlo, the judicial inquiry was reopened.

(D'Agostino and Bontate were killed by Riina’s Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War; Badalamenti died in a US prison in April 2004.) In 2011 the new Mafia turncoat Naimo testified at the trial saying that the journalist was killed by the Mafia on the orders of Riina.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} year Yaropolk returned and reportedly came to an agreement with Vladimir Monomakh, but nothing specific is known of the terms other than Yaropolk being reinstated. In 1087, Yaropolk was murdered. The circumstances of <b>his</b> <b>murder</b> are not clear, but the Primary Chronicle suggested the complicity of Riurik Rostislavich, Prince of Peremyshl, and his brother Vasilko Rostislavich, Prince of Terebovl. His murderer was a man called Neradets, who put a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl; the date given is November 22, 1087. His body was taken to Kiev and buried in the church of St Peter, the church which Yaropolk himself had endowed.|$|E

Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving <b>his</b> <b>murder</b> of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
