25|$|The Apple Lisa was {{immediately}} {{recognized as a}} significant machine, with BYTE opining it {{more important than the}} IBM PC. Further, though a limited number of Lisas were sold, the Lisa software, in combination with an Apple <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printer,</b> could produce documents that surpassed other comparably priced options available at the time. This one compelling usage meant that the Lisa was introduced into a number of larger offices, and due to the price, {{the number of people who}} had used a Lisa was much larger than the number of Lisas sold.|$|E

50|$|Patrick Madison, a CSM {{computer}} science instructor, and Dan Smith, a graduate student, began a partnership in 1983 {{with the development}} of a printer interface language that took advantage of the full resolution available to <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{page printer}} is a {{computer}} printer which processes and prints a whole page at a time, as opposed to printers which print one line or character at a time such as line <b>printers</b> and <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> Page printers are often all incorrectly termed “laser printers” - although virtually all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies also exist.|$|R

50|$|NLQ {{became a}} {{standard}} feature on all <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> While NLQ was well {{received in the}} IBM PC market, the Apple Macintosh market did not use NLQ mode at all, as it did not rely on the printer's own fonts. Mac word-processing applications used fonts stored in the computer. For non-PostScript (raster) printers, the final raster image was produced by the computer {{and sent to the}} <b>printer,</b> which meant <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printers</b> on the Mac platform exclusively used raster ("graphics") printing mode. For near-letter-quality output, the Mac would simply double the resolution used by the printer, to 144 dpi, and use a screen font twice the point size desired. Since the Mac's screen resolution (72 dpi) was exactly half of the ImageWriter's maximum, this worked perfectly, creating text at exactly the desired size.|$|R
50|$|MultiMate was {{especially}} good at supporting {{a variety of}} PC clones and hundreds of computer printers, each of which required its own printer driver.

50|$|ImageWriter LQ (Letter Quality) was a 27-pin {{dot matrix}} printer {{introduced}} in 1987 by Apple Computer. The print quality was comparable to competing 24-pin <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> and offered graphics at 320 × 216 DPI. Unlike the ImageWriter II, the LQ was unreliable and noisy. Its printhead {{had a tendency to}} overheat with large multi-page prints and melt the glue holding the crystal that supported the pins.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{personal}} computer software {{focused on the}} processing of text, but as graphics displays became ubiquitous throughout the {{personal computer}} world, users wanted to print both text and images. Ironically, whereas the daisy-wheel printer and pen-plotter struggled to reproduce bitmap images, the first <b>dot-matrix</b> impact <b>printers</b> (including the MX-80) lacked the ability to print graphics. Yet the dot-matrix print head was well-suited to this task, and the capability, referred to as [...] "dot-addressable" [...] quickly became a standard feature on all <b>dot-matrix</b> <b>printers</b> intended for the personal and home computer markets. In 1981, Epson offered a retrofit EPROM kit called Graftrax to add the capability to many early MX series printers. Banners and signs produced with software that used this ability, such as Broderbund's Print Shop, became ubiquitous in offices and schools throughout the 1980s.|$|R
