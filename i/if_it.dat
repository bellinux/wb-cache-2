5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is <b>if</b> <b>it</b> moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate <b>if</b> <b>it</b> managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
5|$|According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the {{application}} of local custom, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars. Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E

This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – <b>if</b> <b>it</b> flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but <b>if</b> <b>it</b> stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
