5|$|The What If? book {{contains}} {{a selection of}} questions and answers from the original blog, as well as nineteen new ones. Furthermore, Munroe selected a few unanswered questions from his <b>inbox</b> and collected those in separate sections in the book. Alt text, which was commonly used for illustrations on the original blog, was omitted from the book in many cases, though is sometimes included as small captions underneath the images. Instead, Munroe has added footnotes to the essays in the book to inform or entertain the reader. The cover of the book depicts a Tyrannosaurus rex being lowered into a Sarlacc from Star Wars, a topic not covered in the book.|$|E
5|$|Anti-phishing {{integrates}} with Internet Explorer. It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the <b>inbox.</b> Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E

25|$|Google Wave {{was a new}} Internet {{communications}} platform. It {{was written}} in Java using OpenJDK and its web interface used the Google Web Toolkit. Google Wave works like previous messaging systems such as email and Usenet, but instead of sending a message along with its entire thread of previous messages, or requiring all responses to be stored in each user's <b>inbox</b> for context, message documents (referred to as waves) that contain complete threads of multimedia messages (blips) are perpetually stored on a central server. Waves are shared with collaborators who can be added or removed from the wave at any point during a wave's existence.|$|E
25|$|Kelley, a Florida socialite who {{frequently}} entertained senior military personnel {{at her and}} her husband's Tampa mansion, had approached an acquaintance {{who worked for the}} FBI Tampa Field Office in the late spring with regard to anonymous emails she considered threatening. The Bureau traced the emails to Broadwell, and noted that Broadwell appeared to be exchanging intimate messages with an email account belonging to Petraeus, which instigated an investigation into whether that account had been hacked into or was someone posing as Petraeus. According to an Associated Press report, rather than transmit emails to each other's <b>inbox,</b> which would have left a more obvious email trail, Petraeus and Broadwell left messages in a draft folder and the draft messages were then read by the other person when they logged into the same account.|$|E
25|$|The UAE {{was one of}} {{only three}} {{countries}} to recognise the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government (Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the other two countries). The UAE maintained diplomatic relations with the Taliban until 11 September attacks in 2001. A hacker group calling itself GlobalLeaks distributed hacked emails from the <b>inbox</b> of Yousef Al Otaiba, UAE's Ambassador to US, which was covered by The New York Times, Huff Post and other major newspapers. Leaks show that the UAE supported a major effort to spread skepticism about Qatar in the United States. The New York Times further reported that UAE wanted to host Taliban embassy and used massive sums to influence decisions of D.C. diplomats. The UAE has long maintained close relations with Egypt and is Egypt's largest investor from the Arab world. Pakistan was the first country to formally recognize the UAE upon its formation and continues to be one of its major economic and trading partners; about 400,000 Pakistani expatriates are employed in the UAE.|$|E

40|$|Ten years ago, Whittaker and Sidner [8] {{published}} research on email overload, coining {{a term that}} would drive a research area that continues today. We examine a sample of 600 mailboxes collected at a high-tech company to compare how users organize their email now to 1996. While <b>inboxes</b> are roughly {{the same size as}} in 1996, our population’s email archives have grown tenfold. We see little evidence of distinct strategies for handling email; most of our users fall into a middle ground. There remains a need for future innovations to help people manage growing archives of email and large <b>inboxes...</b>|$|R

25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: {{a cause for}} growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail <b>inbox,</b> threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating virus protection, using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening e-mail, shutting down spyware, controlling cookies, using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.|$|E
25|$|As Fox was {{unavailable}} to reprise {{his role as}} Marty for the game, newcomer A.J. Locascio voiced the character instead, though Fox later provided voice work for Marty's great grandfather William in the fifth and final episode of the game, {{as well as for}} the three futuristic versions of Marty who appear in the game's final cutscene. Locascio was able to get the part when his audition sample ended up in the email <b>inbox</b> of voice director Julian Kwasneski, and managed to impress both Gale and Lloyd with how closely it resembled the sound of Fox's voice during the time the trilogy was filmed. Lloyd returned to voice Doc Brown and began his first recording session for the game in late September 2010. Later, Claudia Wells joined the cast, reprising her role as Jennifer Parker from the first film. Kid Beyond provides the voice for Biff Tannen in place of actor Tom Wilson, and James Arnold Taylor as the younger Emmett. Though the game features other returning characters including George and Lorraine McFly, voicework for these characters are provided by a variety of available voice actors in the Bay Area. Tom Wilson reprised his role as Biff Tannen for the 30th anniversary revamp. The song Back in Time by Huey Lewis and the News, which was written for first film, appears in the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{widespread}} use of email caused the number of warnings being made about the dark side our technological revolution to increase and we are becoming uniquely vulnerable to many mysterious and malicious threats. Viruses, worms, {{and other forms of}} malicious software started targeting our email <b>inboxes</b> to propagate. Spam and other forms of unsolicited bulk electronic commerce started filling our email <b>inboxes</b> and invading our privacy. Phishing and other forms of fraud attacks have been using email as their primary communication channel to trick users into giving out their credentials.

Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of what was about to happen. Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his <b>inbox</b> had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E
500|$|Norton AntiSpam was {{discontinued}} as {{a separate}} product from Symantec, now only available in Norton Internet Security. The feature can block all e-mail from unknown senders, and automatically blocks messages with suspicious elements such as invisible text, HTML forms, and phishing URLs. To improve accuracy, Norton analyzes outgoing e-mails and messages whose categorization is corrected by users by hitting the [...] "This is spam" [...] and [...] "This is not spam" [...] buttons. In PC Magazine testing, the feature marked one in ten valid e-mail as spam and let one in every six spam messages in the <b>inbox.</b> 400 messages were used, and the program was allowed to process the messages for over a week. In PC Pro testing, the feature performed better, blocking 96 percent of spam, with a false positive rate of 0.2 percent.|$|E
40|$|Email {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} computer applications yet devised. Our empirical data show however, that although email was originally designed as a communications application, it is now being used for additional functions, that it was not designed for, such as task management and personal archiving. We call this email overload. We demonstrate that email overload creates problems for personal information management: users often have cluttered <b>inboxes</b> containing hundreds of messages, including outstanding tasks, partially read documents and conversational threads. Furthermore, user attempts to rationalise their <b>inboxes</b> by filing are often unsuccessful, with the consequence that important messages get overlooked, or &quot;lost &quot; in archives. We explain how email overloading arises and propose technical solutions to the problem...|$|R

500|$|The reveal of Sheriff Lamb's {{death was}} not leaked {{anywhere}} online prior to the airing of [...] "Mars, Bars", something about which Muhney was happy. He stated that [...] "the surprise was the best part" [...] and that he disliked it when spoilers from other series were released early. After the episode's initial airing, Muhney reported that his <b>inbox</b> was flooded with emails from press members seeking interviews, stating that new messages came after the airing in each United States time zone. Some fans were upset about his death, and debate occurred online. However, Muhney also received messages {{of support for the}} character, commenting [...] "it's nice to know that he will be missed." [...] With the announcement of the Veronica Mars film in 2013, Zap2it speculated that Muhney might return; however, this was later revealed not to be the case when the official casting was announced. Thomas praised Daran Norris's performance in the episode, particularly his voice in the scene in which he defends Steve Botando in front of Sheriff Lamb. Thomas noted that Norris was also a voice actor and that he was particularly well-liked on the set for his humorous performances.|$|E
500|$|Other {{facets of}} Quorum are parental {{controls}} and spam filtering. Norton Internet Security 2010 bundles a free subscription of OnlineFamily.Norton, which PC Magazine {{found to be}} an improvement over the parental controls bundled with prior releases. Spam filtering uses technologies Symantec acquired from Brightmail. Two filters are used to find spam: a locally installed one and a check against Symantec's servers {{to see if the}} message is known spam. In PC Magazine testing, no valid e-mail were marked as spam. However, 11 percent of spam still made it to the <b>inbox.</b> [...] This was a significant improvement over prior releases. Another improvement to the product is the improved heuristic feature called SONAR 2. [...] It leverages reputation data to judge if a program is malicious or clean. Norton Insight has also been expanded, showing users the number of Norton Community participants who have a certain program installed, its impact of system resources, and how long it has been released. Information about the program's origin and a graph of its resource usage is also provided. A new feature codenamed [...] "Autospy" [...] helps users understand what Norton did when malware was found. The malware's actions and Norton's resolution are presented to the user. Previous releases removed threats on sight and quietly warned users, potentially confusing when users are deceived in downloading rogue security software.|$|E
