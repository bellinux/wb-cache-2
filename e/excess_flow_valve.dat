Specifically, Pilgrim requests approval of {{an alternative to the}} Operations and Maintenance Standard, Part 10 (OM- 10), valve exercising test frequency specified in subsection 4. 3. 2 and valve leakage test frequency specified in sub-paragraph 4. 2. 2. 3 (a) for Category AC valves. Currently, in accordance with Pilgrim's In-Service Testing (IST) Program, each EFCV is required to be exercised once each refueling interval (defined as once per refueling outage not to exceed two years, with a six month grace period allowed) and leak tested once every two years (6 month grace period allowed) The proposed alternative would relax the number tested each refueling outage to a representative sample of EFCVs, such that each EFCV will be tested at least once every 10 years (nominal).

40|$|By letter dated February 2, 2001, and {{pursuant}} to the provisions specified in 10 CFR 50. 55 a(a) (3) (i), Entergy Nuclear Generation company (ENGC) - Pilgrim requested relief from the Code requirements for examinations of <b>Excess</b> <b>Flow</b> Check <b>Valves</b> (EFCVs). The following information provides additional information in support of that request. The following also changes Pilgrim's commitment concerning the EFCV Sample Test Program method {{to be used for}} trending, and removes 6 valves (relating to 3 high flow instruments) from the relief because further investigation has determined that the associated lines may not have restricting orifices. Amended Relief Requests Numbers RV- 44 and RV- 45 are attached to reflect the changes. Operational Impact The operational impact of an EFCV failing to close following an instrument line rupture would be the environmental effects of a steam release {{in the vicinity of the}} instrument racks. The magnitude of the release of steam through a Pilgrim instrument line has been determined to be within the pressure control capacity of reactor building ventilation systems, and the functional integrity of secondary containment would continue to be met (Pilgrim UFSAR 5. 2. 3. 5. 3). Instrument line "bundles " are routed so as to minimize the potential for accidental damage. Also, the separation of redundant equipment in the Reactor Building is expected to minimize the impact of such a break due to such factors as jet impingement. However, continuously monitored variables such as area radiation or temperature would alert operators to damage and require reactor shutdown and depressurization to limit the release and allow manual isolation of the line (Pilgrim UFSAR 5. 2. 3. 5. 3).

50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point.

The triple valve assembly connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank.

The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled.

These valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the Space Shuttle Main Engines, creating an even flow.

To achieve the accurate control of the outlet flow, the actual input voltage of the pilot spool valve is regulated according to the actual pilot pressure drop, the desired flow rate and the given input voltage.

One end of the ground information, downloading device is connected with the three-way connecting pipe of the high-pressure riser pipe, and the other end is connected with the mud tank back-flow port. The <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> opens to a pre-designed opening to open the shut-off valve between the standpipe and the information drop unit. When the signal reception short reaches the underground predetermined depth, the mud pump is turned on to establish the circulation condition. After the mud pump is stable, save the pump pressure to maintain a certain pump pressure, and then, use the computer control information to realize the different time intervals, the preset pressure pulse signal is sent out. The signal receiving short section receives the pulse signal from the ground pressure in the well bottom and stores it. According to the test results, {{it can be seen}} that the increase of the <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> opening and the increase of the pump pressure have obvious improvement on the information transmission. The deeper the depth of field, the greater the impact on information delivery. The width of the pulse width increases; the information has significantly improved, especially in the depth of the case; but more than a certain value of the effect is not obvious, the pulse width interval value of 9  s or so; to improve the information pass to take the signal suppression approach, that is, to increase the signal gap on the ground, so that the original received useful signal is much larger than the noise. In the process of information transmission, the depth, pump pressure, pulse width, and <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> open four factors together, because the depth and pump pressure by the engineering conditions, so the quantitative <b>flow</b> <b>valve</b> opening and pulse width interval is the important factors that should be identified before work.|$|R
