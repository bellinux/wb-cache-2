40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to study the seed quality aspects of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the extent of weed seed contamination present in wheat seeds produced in different regions of Iran. Four districts (cities), each including 12 fields (six <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> fields and six farm-saved seed fields), were selected in each regions (provinces). One kilogram of the wheat seed sample was collected from each field for analysis in the laboratory. Wheat seeding was commonly done by farm-saved seed sourced from within the farm due to the high costs of <b>certified</b> <b>seeds</b> purchased from outside sources, followed by the low seed quality. The use of a farm-saved seed resulted in a higher germination rate and a lower mean time to germination compared with another system. The more positive temperatures experienced by mother plants could decrease the number of normal seedling and seedling length vigor index. Generally there was virtually no difference about physiological quality between <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> and farm-saved seed sector that is related to lower quality of <b>certified</b> <b>seed.</b> The <b>certified</b> produced <b>seeds</b> had the lower number of weed seed, species and genus before and after cleaning.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{structure}} and performance of the sorghum and millet seed sector in Mali. The Sahel is the origin of pearl millet and sorghum, seed selection and management of these crops is embedded in local cultures, and most producers of these crops are subsistence oriented. Despite seed sector reform, no <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> of these crops is sold in local markets and farmers prefer to rely on themselves or each other for seed. The dominant source of <b>certified</b> <b>seed</b> is the national <b>seed</b> service. <b>Certified</b> <b>seed</b> is multiplied by contracted farmers and seed producer groups, and supplied to farmers through farmers' associations, development organizations, and extension services. The informal sector supplies farmers with non-certified seed directly and indirectly through village grain markets. There is no consensus about whether it is lack of effective demand or supply that constrains farmer use of certified sorghum and millet seed, but researchers generally conclude {{that the process of}} <b>certifying</b> <b>seed</b> is too lengthy, some mechanism must be established for production and trade of locally-adapted landraces, and Mali's highly structured farmers' associations could play an even stronger role in testing and promoting demand for <b>certified</b> <b>seed.</b> Recommendations have included the use of small packs and seed auctions where market infrastructure is sparse, and in more commercialized areas, involvement of agro-input dealers, shopkeepers and traders. Still, estimated adoption rates for improved millet (under 10 percent of crop area) and sorghum seed (under 20 percent of crop area) could be as high as can be expected in this challenging natural environment and institutional context.
