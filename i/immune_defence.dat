25|$|Plasmid DNA itself {{appears to}} have an {{adjuvant}} effect on the immune system. Bacterially derived DNA can trigger innate <b>immune</b> <b>defence</b> mechanisms, the activation of dendritic cells {{and the production of}} TH1 cytokines. This is due to recognition of certain CpG dinucleotide sequences that are immunostimulatory. CpG stimulatory (CpG-S) sequences occur twenty times more frequently in bacterially-derived DNA than in eukaryotes. This is because eukaryotes exhibit “CpG suppression” – i.e. CpG dinucleotide pairs occur much less frequently than expected. Additionally, CpG-S sequences are hypomethylated. This occurs frequently in bacterial DNA, while CpG motifs occurring in eukaryotes are methylated at the cytosine nucleotide. In contrast, nucleotide sequences that inhibit the activation of an immune response (termed CpG neutralising, or CpG-N) are over represented in eukaryotic genomes. The optimal immunostimulatory sequence is an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide flanked by two 5’ purines and two 3’ pyrimidines. Additionally, flanking regions outside this immunostimulatory hexamer must be guanine-rich to ensure binding and uptake into target cells.|$|E

The indirect effect of resource quality on encapsulation mediated via body condition was substantial, whereas indirect effects on melanization were negligible.

40|$|Abstract Workers {{in social}} insects perform {{different}} roles, {{and the environment}} they experience differs markedly according to the tasks performed. Life history theory pre-dicts that individuals should adapt investment in <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> according to their cost relative {{to the risk of}} pathogen infection. Workers, which forage outside the nest, face harsher environmental conditions with increased risk of injury and infection. We then might expect higher <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> in foragers than in intra-nidal workers which remain in the relative sanctity of the nest. However, task partitioning in social insects is often age-based, and foragers are usually the oldest individuals. Hence if immune defen-ces degenerate with age, foragers could have lower <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> than intra-nidal workers. In this study, we exam-ined the difference in <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> as assessed by the level of phenoloxidase activity (PO) between intra-nidal workers and foragers in the ant Cataglyphis cursor. In three out of four colonies tested, foragers and intra-nidal workers did not differ in their level of PO. In the final colony, the level of workers PO overall was higher than in the other three colonies, and foragers displayed a lower level of PO than intra-nidal workers. These results may suggest that, when a sus-tained colonial PO activity is necessary, foragers may be less able than intra-nidal workers to activate their PO. Our results are discussed in the light of previous studies that underline the diversity of PO activity patterns in social insects. The variation observed among studies and even colonies clearly emphasizes the plasticity of immune parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} between hosts and parasites {{is characterized by}} the evolution of reciproca adaptations aiming at reducing the cost of infection (from the host point of view) and to optimize host exploitation (from the parasite point of view). Within this co-evolutionary scenario, the immune system takes a central role. The immune system has evolved to fight off parasitic attacks. However, <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> cannot be deployed without costs which set a limit to the protective effect of immunity. Moreover, <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> impose strong selection pressures on the parasite and can favour the evolution of more virulent pathogen strains. In this article, we will discuss these different issues focusing on host-pathogen interactions involving birds and their parasites...|$|R

40|$|Background Defence {{mechanisms}} of organisms {{are shaped by}} their lifestyle, environment and pathogen pressure. Carpenter ants are social insects which live in huge colonies comprising genetically closely related individuals in high densities within nests. This lifestyle potentially facilitates the rapid spread of pathogens between individuals. In concert with their innate immune system, social insects may apply external <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> to manipulate the microbial community among individuals and within nests. Additionally, carpenter ants carry a mutualistic intracellular and obligate endosymbiotic bacterium, possibly maintained and regulated by the innate immune system. Thus, different selective forces could shape internal <b>immune</b> <b>defences</b> of Camponotus floridanus. Results The immune gene repertoire of C. floridanus was investigated by re-evaluating its genome sequence combined with a full transcriptome analysis of immune challenged and control animals using Illumina sequencing.

50|$|In the gut of Drosophila melanogaster the {{composition}} and action of the microbiome appears to be tightly regulated within compartments, that is different sections of the intestines. This is indicated by the differential expression of genes, especially with a regulatory function, in the epithelium of {{different parts of the}} gut. In detail, the gut is compartmentalized into three parts, the foregut, the midgut, and the hindgut. While foregut and hindgut are lined with a cuticle formed by the ectodermal epithelium, the midgut is of entodermal origin. In adult flies the midgut is further divided into five smaller regions. The immune response varies among the gut regions. The immune deficiency (IMD) pathway responds to bacterial infections and is activated by certain receptors (e.g., the peptidoglycan receptor protein PGRP-LC). These receptors and also other components of the Drosophila immune system such as Toll receptor and dDUOX pathway molecules control immune responses in ectodermal tissue of the anterior gut. Moreover, the anterior midgut is enriched in certain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This suggests that the <b>immune</b> <b>defence</b> in this area is particularly responsive, possibly because this regions represents the first contact region for newly taken up food, microbiota, and/or intestinal pathogens. In the middle and posterior midgut, other genes such as the receptor PGRP-LB, which down-regulates the IMD immune response, are expressed, possibly in order to minimize expression of <b>immune</b> <b>defence</b> against the microbiota. In addition, the microbiota itself seems to control the expression of several Drosophila metabolic genes within the midgut, possibly to facilitate digestion of food. Taken together, it appears that the interaction between host and microbiota is precisely regulated across different regions within the gut.|$|E
50|$|Plasmid DNA itself {{appears to}} have an {{adjuvant}} effect on the immune system. Bacterially derived DNA can trigger innate <b>immune</b> <b>defence</b> mechanisms, the activation of dendritic cells {{and the production of}} TH1 cytokines.

Additionally, flanking regions outside this immunostimulatory hexamer must be guanine-rich to ensure binding and uptake into target cells.|$|E
50|$|In {{its natural}} {{environment}} C. elegans is {{confronted with a}} variety of different potential pathogens. C. elegans has been used intensively as a model organism for studying host-pathogen interactions and the immune system. These studies revealed that C. elegans has well-functioning innate immune defences. The first line of defence is the extremely tough cuticle that provides an external barrier against pathogen invasion. In addition, several conserved signalling pathways contribute to defence, including the DAF-2/DAF-16 insulin-like receptor pathway and several MAP kinase pathways, which activate physiological immune responses. Finally, pathogen avoidance behaviour represents another line of C. elegans <b>immune</b> <b>defence.</b> All these defence mechanisms do not work independently, but jointly to ensure an optimal defence response against pathogens. Many microorganisms were found to be pathogenic for C. elegans under laboratory conditions. To identify potential C. elegans pathogens, worms in the L4 larval stage are transferred to a medium that contains the organism of interest, which is a bacterium in most cases. Pathogenicity of the organism can be inferred by measuring the lifespan of worms. There are several known human pathogens that {{have a negative effect on}} C. elegans survival.
