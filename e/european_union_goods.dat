The store chain Selfridges withdrew Ahava's products (among others) in December 2001 after a boycott campaign launched by pro-Palestinian groups, but reinstated them a few weeks later. Critics argue that the products are labelled as having [...] "Israeli origin" [...] when, according to the <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>goods</b> originating in the West Bank or Gaza cannot be labelled as having Israeli origin because, [...] "according to international public law, including the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, these territories cannot {{be considered to be}} part of the State of Israel", and are not included in the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The boycott of Ahava has also been endorsed by Code Pink, which argues that Ahava's use of Palestinian natural resources from the Dead Sea is, according to the Fourth Geneva Convention, a [...] "patently illegal use by an occupying power of stolen resources for its own profit". Ahava's store in a fashionable street of London's West End closed in September 2011 after constant protests by pro-Palestinian activists. Owners of the surrounding stores complained to the landlord that the repeated protests were affecting their business. A pro-Israeli group also held fortnightly counter-demonstrations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Using {{the partial}} {{equilibrium}} WITS-SMART Simulation model {{to assess the}} impact of liberalisation under the Trade Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) of a free trade area between the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and South Africa. The identification of the impact of such agreement allows for trade policy negotiation adjustment that can be beneficial for South Africa. Aim: The aim of the study is to estimate and discuss the impact of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and South Africa. More specifically, the study intends to estimate the impact of revenue, welfare, imports, exports, trade creation and to come up with policies options for South Africa that can be used in negotiations and policy formulations. Setting: The study used international trade data (2012) available in the WITS-SMART model to assess bilateral trade agreement between the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and South Africa. Methods: To identify the impact on revenue, welfare, imports, exports and trade creation, the study simulated an FTA (0 % tariff rate) for all goods exchanged between the <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> and South Africa. Also, the elasticity of substitution used for the simulation model was 99 %. Results: The findings of the study reveal that total trade effects in South Africa are likely to surge by US$ 1. 036 billion with a total welfare valued at US$ 134 million. Dismantling tariffs on all <b>European</b> <b>Union</b> (EU) <b>goods</b> would be beneficial to consumers through net trade creation. Total trade creation would be US$ 782 million. However, South African producers are likely to contribute a trade diversion of US$ 254 million which has a negative impact on consumer welfare. The country might also experience a revenue loss amounting to US$ 562 million because of the removal of tariffs. In trade, the country’s exports and imports to the EU are expected to increase by US$ 12. 419 million and US$ 1. 266 million, respectively. Conclusion: The European Union–South Africa FTA would result in both trade creation and trade expansion effects. However, trade creation and revenue loss are potential threats. In order to mitigate revenue loss, government needs to consider alternative tax such as consumption tax on certain goods and value-added tax...|$|R

In this context, increased reliability on allies may lead one country to lower defence expenditures and supply.
