5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>Critique</b> of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In <b>his</b> <b>Critique</b> of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E
25|$|The {{exception}} to Spencer's growing conservativism {{was that he}} remained throughout his life an ardent opponent of imperialism and militarism. <b>His</b> <b>critique</b> of the Boer War was especially scathing, and it contributed to his declining popularity in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the Württemberg pietism, {{inspired}} by the 18th century Swabian churchman, M. Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> of the Cartesian rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff, who {{were the most important}} German philosophers before Kant.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{think that}} one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.|$|E
25|$|Father David O'Hanlon (born 1969) is a {{controversial}} Irish Roman Catholic priest and theologian.

25|$|The {{nature of}} {{scientific}} revolutions {{has been studied}} by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase {{in the preface to}} <b>his</b> <b>Critique</b> of Pure Reason (1781). He referred to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of mathematics, physics, and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars. It was against this active background that Kuhn published his work.|$|E
25|$|Plato famously {{condemned}} poetic myth {{when discussing}} {{education in the}} Republic. <b>His</b> <b>critique</b> was primarily {{on the grounds that}} the uneducated might take the stories of gods and heroes literally. Nevertheless, he constantly referred to myths throughout his writings. As Platonism developed in the phases commonly called Middle Platonism and neoplatonism, writers such as Plutarch, Porphyry, Proclus, Olympiodorus, and Damascius wrote explicitly about the symbolic interpretation of traditional and Orphic myths.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus {{argued that}} human {{intelligence}} and expertise depend primarily on unconscious instincts rather than conscious symbolic manipulation, {{and that these}} unconscious skills could never be captured in formal rules. <b>His</b> <b>critique</b> {{was based on the}} insights of modern continental philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger, and was directed at the first wave of AI research which used high level formal symbols to represent reality and tried to reduce intelligence to symbol manipulation.|$|E

50|$|Corbridge {{has made}} several major {{contributions}} to international development theory, beginning in 1986 with <b>his</b> <b>critiques</b> of radical development.

25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, aged 34, Bacalbașa had served in the Assembly of Deputies as a {{representative}} of the Conservative Party. Despite this change in politics, he is mainly credited for his early contributions to Romanian literature, most of which reflect <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> of the political mainstream in the monarchical era. He created the stereotype of the cruel, violent and incompetent officer, and brought to public attention the hazing of young recruits.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus {{began to}} {{formulate}} <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> {{in the early}} 1960s {{while he was a}} professor at MIT, then a hotbed of artificial intelligence research. His first publication on the subject is a half-page objection to a talk given by Herbert A. Simon in the spring of 1961. Dreyfus was especially bothered, as a philosopher, that AI researchers seemed to believe they {{were on the verge of}} solving many long standing philosophical problems within a few years, using computers.|$|E
25|$|Marx's {{philosophy}} is thus {{inextricably linked to}} <b>his</b> <b>critique</b> of political economy and to his historical interventions in the workers' movement, such as the 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program or The Communist Manifesto, written with Engels (who was observing the Chartist movement) {{a year before the}} Revolutions of 1848. Both after the defeat of the French socialist movement during Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 1851 coup and then after the crushing of the 1871 Paris Commune, Marx's thought transformed itself.|$|E
