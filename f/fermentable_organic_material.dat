40|$|It is {{estimated}} that in Brazil, the municipal solid waste produced are constituted on average 55 % of <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> solid waste and that this quantity can be applied in aerobic or anaerobic stabilization process. Anaerobic digestion is an important alternative {{for the treatment of}} different types of potentially fermentable waste, considering providing an alternative source of energy {{that can be used to}} replace fossil fuels. To perform the experimental part of this work was constructed and monitored an experimental system consisting of an anaerobic batch reactor, shredding unit of <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> wastes and additional devices. <b>Fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> wastes consisted of leftover fruits and vegetables and were listed in EMPASA (Paraibana Company of Food and Agricultural Services), located in the city of Campina Grande- PB.

The substrate consisted of a mixture of <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> waste, more anaerobic sewage sludge in the proportion of 80 and 20 % respectively. In the specific case of this study, it was found that 1 m 3 of substrate concentration of total COD equal to 169 g L- 1, considering the reactor efficiency equal to 80 %, the production of CH 4 would be approximately 47. 25 Nm 3 CH 4.

40|$|Global trends {{nowadays}} towards {{long term}} sustainable crop production is hinged on either supplementing {{the use of}} chemical fertilizers with <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> or a complete use of <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> This is more so since substituting chemical fertilizers with <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> reduces the risks of exposure to ailments that arise on account of synthetic compounds and increases farmers’ gains via reduced soil erosion and carbon emissions and increased bio-diversity. In this vein, the current study investigated <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> use in Nigeria’s agriculture. Specifically, the study examined availability and use of chemical fertilizer and <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> substitutes and investigated factors affecting the use of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> in the Nigerian food sector. The study data were drawn from a survey of sixty-one farm households that used <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> as major nutrients inputs or as supplement with chemical fertilizers for their cropping activities. The study area is Shira in Nigeria. Farmers in this area usually incorporate the use of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> in their agriculture. The descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to analyse the study data. Results indicate that farmers {{in the study area}} source their chemical fertilizer inputs from the open market at an exorbitant price of N 2000 (US dollar $ 13. 8) per bag on average thereby using very low rates of chemical fertilizers. <b>Organic</b> <b>materials</b> used by farmers were sourced from cattle, goats, sheep and poultry droppings. The quantity of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> used was 12, 513. 0 kg per hectare at a cost of N 15, 015. 6 (US dollar $ 103. 5). Major constraints in the use of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> by farmers include poor transport facilities and cutworm infestations of the <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> Factors revealed to influence the quantity of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> used by farmers were the cost of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> and the quantity of chemical fertilizers used by the farmers. The study therefore calls for stakeholders in the food sub-sector to encourage the establishment of blending plants for the production of <b>organic</b> <b>materials,</b> burning of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> before usage, and the need to enhance researches aimed at establishing optimal material mixtures and application rates for <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> used in the Nigerian farming systems. farming systems, bio-diversity, carbon emissions, cut worm infestation, food sub-sector, sheep, goat, poultry, optimal mixtures, Crop Production/Industries, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
