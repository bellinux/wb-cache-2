The binding {{is dependent on}} time, temperature and pH. It is specific to follitropin {{as demonstrated by the}} very low binding activity of the <b>follitropin</b> alpha and <b>beta</b> subunits and of the other glycoprotein hormones.

A sensitive radio-ligand receptor assay was developed. Fifty percent inhibition of binding was obtained with as little as 2 ng of porcine follitropin. Ovine and bovine follitropins and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin gave binding inhibition curves parallel to that given by porcine follitropin. With equine and human follitropin, significantly different slopes were recorded. 3. Kinetics of dissociation of labelled follitropin from its testis receptors showed the presence of at least two compartments with fast and slow dissociation rate constants. The ratio between the sizes of the slow and fast compartments appeared dependent upon preincubation time. 4.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the effects of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormones (r-FSHs) (Gonal-F and Puregon) on the proliferation of human endometrial cells in vitro. Materials and MethodsHuman endometrial cells (RL 95 - 2 cells) were obtained commercially and cultured in the serum-containing media {{in the presence of}} r-FSHs (Gonal-F and Puregon at concentrations of 0 mIU/mL, 200 mIU/mL, 400 mIU/mL, and 600 mIU/mL) up to 72 hours. According to the gonadotropin concentrations, all cultured endometrial cells were divided into four groups: (1) 0 mIU/mL (control); (2) 200 mIU/mL; (3) 400 mIU/mL; and (4) 600 mIU/mL. After 72 -hour culture, endometrial cell proliferations were assessed overnight by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The influences of different r-FSH agents and dosages on endometrial cell proliferation in each group were evaluated and compared. ResultsIn the four Gonal-F groups, the cell absorption (control and 200 mIU/mL, 400 mIU/mL, and 600 mIU/mL Gonal-F) after 24 / 48 / 72 -hour cultures were as follows: (1) 0. 57 / 0. 7 / 0. 82; (2) 0. 56 / 0. 66 / 0. 78; (3) 0. 55 / 0. 64 / 0. 77; and (4) 0. 51 / 0. 61 / 0. 78. After 48 hours, higher dosage of Gonal-F appeared to significantly inhibit the endometrial cell proliferation. After 72 -hour culture, all three dosages of Gonal-F appeared to inhibit the endometrial cell proliferation similarly.

Design: A prospective, multicenter, assessor-blind, randomized, clinical trial. Setting: 12 European infertility clinics. Patients: 172 women (recombinant FSH: n= 105; urinary FSH: n= 67) with clomiphene citrate-resistant normogonadotropic chronic anovulation (WHO group II). Interventions: eligible subjects were randomized (ratio of recombinant to urinary FSH, 3 : 2) and treated for a maximum of three cycles. A low-dose step-up regimen was used, with 75 IU of FSH given IM daily for a maximum of 14 days and, if needed, weekly increments of half an ampule given thereafter until the threshold dose for follicular development was achieved. Main outcome measures: cumulative ovulation rate after three cycles, total FSH dose, and treatment period needed to achieve anovulation. Results: the cumulative ovulation rates after three treatment cycles were 95 % and 96 % for the recombinant and urinary FSH groups, respectively. Overall, ovulation was seen in 155 of 223 treatment cycles (69. 5 %) in the recombinant FSH group, compared with 92 of 138 treatment cycles (66. 7 %) in the urinary FSH group. In the first cycle, a statistically significantly lower total dose (750 versus 1, 035 UI)) and a shorter treatment period (10 vs 13 days) were needed in the recombinant FSH group to reach ovulation. Only one case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome led to hospitalization. Two sets of twin (1 in each treatment group) and 1 set of triplets (in the recombinant FSH group) were born.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGonadotropins, as ovulation-inducing drugs, {{have been}} used widely to treat infertility. An {{epidemiologic}} correlation between infertility therapy and ovarian cancer development has been reported. However, the effect of gonadotropins {{in the formation of}} reproductive tract cancers is controversial. ObjectiveThe aim {{of the study was to}} determine the in vivo genotoxic effects of gonadotropins on rat reticulocytes. MethodsIn this prospective, randomized, controlled study, rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups. The calculated rat doses of 0. 65 human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), 0. 95 hMG, 0. 65 <b>follitropin</b> <b>beta</b> (FB), 0. 95 FB, or normal saline (control group) were injected, respectively. These calculated rat doses (U/g) are based on average human gonadotropin doses of 150 and 225 IU/d for a 70 -kg woman given in 2 -mL saline (the control group received 2 mL of saline). Injections were administered once per day for 5 days, followed by 5 days of rest. Each treatment was repeated for 6 estrus cycles in the rats for a total of 12 estrus cycles. Six months after the last day of the 12 th cycle, the rats were euthanized. Bone marrow tissues were removed, and pluripotent reticulocyte cells with micronuclei, nuclear buds, and binuclear abnormalities were analyzed using an in situ micronuclei assay under light microscopy. The proportion of micronucleated cells, cells with anaphase bridge, nuclear buds, and other nuclear abnormalities were measured. ResultsThe number of cells with nuclear buds and binuclear abnormalities in the hMG 225 and FB 225 groups was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than that from the hMG 150, FB 150, and control groups in the cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow stem cells. An increased rate of genotoxicity in all gonadotropin groups versus that of placebo was found.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} multicenter {{study was}} to investigate the influence of different commercially produced gonadotropins (menotropin - HP, follitropin alpha and beta, urofollitropin), GnRH agonist (triptorelin, leuprorelin, nafarelinacetat) versus antagonists (cetrorelixacetat) upon maturity of human oocytes and the developmental potential of M II oocytes in 564 ICSI cycles. We evaluated defined extracytoplasmatic (1 st polar body, pervitellin space, oocyte shape) and cytoplasmatic (grade of granulation, vacuoles, refractile bodies) criteria and followed their effect upon the fertilization process. The number of retrieved cumulus oocyte complexes (COC) was significantly higher when agonist protocols were performed compared to antagonists (10, 4 vs. 9, 5). There was also found a significantly higher number of COC after application of <b>follitropin</b> <b>beta</b> and urofollitropin (11, 7; 11, 3) compared to menotropin (9, 3), follitropin alpha (10, 0) and the combination with menotropin (9, 0). The agonist protocol also led to a clearly higher number of mature MII oocytes than in the group with cetrorelixacetat. There was no significant difference within the various gonadotropin medications regarding the grade of oocyte maturity. 23, 5 % of all oocytes were ideally shaped. The number of oocytes with abnormal morphological criteria was greatest when the agonist protocol was applied with triptorelinacetat or urofollitropin. The different hormon medications led to the appearance of various extracytoplasmic and cytoplasmic oocyte dysmorphisms. According to my investigations the shape of the first polar body was the only morphological criterion among all inverstigated abnormal oocyte parameter which had no negative impact on the fertilization rate. The selection of ideal oocytes by detailed morphological criteria resulted in an improvement of all clinical parameter and is a valueable prognostic factor for a successful treatment. Due to a higher oocyte yield, improved fertilization-, pregnancy  and birth rates therapies with recombinant FSH or Menotropin  HP are superiour compared to treatments with urofollitropin.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Over {{the last}} four decades, various urinary FSH (uFSH) {{products}} of different purity have been developed. In 1988 recombinant FSH (rFSH) was prepared by transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with both FSH subunit genes. Both rFSH and uFSH {{are known to be}} effective in inducing ovulation in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome. Ovulation induction with FSH bears the risk of multiple follicle development, multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The dose regimen used can affect the incidence of these complications. OBJECTIVES: To compare in women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) the safety and effectiveness in terms of ovulation, pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy rate and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) of 1) rFSH with uFSH and 2) different dose regimens of rFSH. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility review group was used to identify all relevant trials. Please see Review Group details. SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant published RCT's were selected. Randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion if treatment consisted of recombinant FSH versus urinary FSH or recombinant FSH in different dose regimens, to induce ovulation in subfertile women with PCOS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A computerised MEDLINE and EMBASE search was used to identify randomised and non randomised controlled trials. The reference lists of all studies found were checked for relevant articles. Handsearching of bibliographies of relevant publications and reviews and abstracts of scientific meetings was performed. Serono Benelux BV and NV Organon, the manufacturers of follitropin alpha (Gonal F(R)) and <b>follitropin</b> <b>beta</b> (Puregon(R)) respectively, were asked for unpublished data and ongoing studies. Relevant data were extracted independently by two reviewers (NB, MW). Validity was assessed in terms of method of randomisation, completeness of follow-up, presence or absence of cross-over and co-intervention. All trials were screened and analysed according to predetermined quality criteria. Data synthesis: 2 X 2 tables were generated for all the relevant outcomes. Odds ratios were generated using the Peto modified Mantel-Haenszel technique. MAIN RESULTS: Four randomised trials comparing rFSH versus uFSH were identified. No significant differences were demonstrated for the relevant outcomes. The odds ratio for ovulation rate was 1. 19 (95 % CI 0. 78, 1. 80), for pregnancy rate 0. 95 (95 % CI 0. 64, 1. 41), for miscarriage rate 1. 26 (95 % CI 0. 59, 2. 70), for multiple pregnancy rate 0. 44 (95 % CI 0. 16, 1. 21) and for OHSS 1. 55 (95 % CI 0. 50, 4. 84). Similarly, in the only randomised trial that compared chronic low dose versus conventional regimen with rFSH no significant differences were found.
