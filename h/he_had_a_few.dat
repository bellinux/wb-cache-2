But most importantly, he worked on his shooting range and developed a dependable 18ft. jumper. As a result, he raised his scoring by 4.7 points in that season.|$|E

500|$|Blackstar was {{released}} on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim.

Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months left.

2500|$|Pride {{remained}} with RCA Records until 1986.

2500|$|For {{more than}} half a century Sir Neville Cardus was the undisputed king of cricket writing. His style {{influenced}} more than one generation of cricket writers. Moorhouse was no exception. Of course, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things in common with the great Cardus: they both came from North-West England, Cardus from Manchester, Moorhouse from Bolton, both spent a considerable amount of their professional career at the Manchester Guardian, and most importantly, both greatly loved the game of cricket. [...] The greatest thing about this book is that Moorhouse covers the matches as a cricket writer, not as a cricket reporter, and the difference can be enormous. Following the style of the great man, Moorhouse cares less about the statistics (although the scorecards are provided in details at the end of every match report). Instead, in the spirit of Cardus, he gives characters to the players, describes the scenario, talks about the past heroes of cricket, and even talks about his own emotions. He starts “The Roses Match” recollecting his family connection with the Red Roses. Wherever he goes, he tries to fathom the spirit of the particular match. Thus, this book describes the spirit of the game more than anything else.|$|E

However, he escaped a possible grid penalty. During the same weekend, his manager Steve Robertson suggested that Räikkönen was heading towards a contract extension with Ferrari. That would contradict previous suggestions from Räikkönen himself that he would 'probably' retire {{at the end of his}} Ferrari contract, and that 2015 would be his last season. Courtesy of a considerate tyre strategy by the Ferrari team, at the , Räikkönen finished second after gaining that position late in the race and starting from fourth on the grid. In the process, Räikkönen recorded his first podium since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix for Lotus, and the first in his second spell with Ferrari– his most recent Ferrari podium was a third place finish at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix. Räikkönen said that he was hopeful in winning races in the near future after the team's strong recovery relative to [...] He also commented that, both the engine and downforce had been significantly improved and that the car handled much more to his liking.
