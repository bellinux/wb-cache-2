5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate.

40|$|Leg muscle {{strength}} (LMS) and leg muscle power (LMP) are determinants of aspects of functional status and important parameters for measuring intervention effects in older adults. <b>Field</b> <b>tests</b> {{are often used}} {{for the evaluation of}} LMS and LMP in older persons. However, criteria important for the application of strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> in older adults have not been systematically taken into account and are not yet fully listed and described in a single publication. Therefore, this paper describes criteria important for the application of strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> in older adults. In addition, strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> commonly used in older adults are evaluated by using the described criteria. Based on this evaluation, this paper provides a perspective on the further development of <b>field</b> <b>tests.</b> Criteria important for strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> are: adequate accuracy, precision, concurrent validity, clinical validity, practical feasibility and pure strength or power outcomes. Commonly used strength and power related <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> do not meet all the aforementioned criteria. Therefore, further development of <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> is necessary. Mobile sensing systems are potentially useful for the evaluation of LMS and LMP in older adults. Mobile sensing systems do not have the limitations of commonly used <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> and provide important additional advantages. In particular, mobile sensing systems offer the opportunity of continuous monitoring during free-movement in the home-environment, thereby reducing the need of standardized assessments by health-care professionals. Future studies should examine the clinical validity of mobile sensing systems and evaluate the application of sensor technology in exercise-based interventions...|$|R
