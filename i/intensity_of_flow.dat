Used {{extensively}} in healthcare, manufacturing, banking, retail, and office space, Layout-iQ is a software that evaluates {{the frequency of}} flow in a workspace and measures the total travel distance that resources will travel to navigate through the workspace. The software integrates CAD drawings with a diagram of flow between points. The thickness and color of the flow lines indicate the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> in each line, so users can visually see high priority point to point relationships. As the user moves locations in the diagram, the software dynamically calculates the impact on travel distance and users can immediately see {{the impact of the}} change on operations. The software also allows for the creation of improved aisles and paths using the aisle effectiveness measurement and actual path diagramming.|$|E

The FQ identifies flow as a single construct, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors. Another strength of the FQ {{is that it does not}} assume that everyone's flow experiences are the same. Because of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flow. However, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to address. The FQ does not allow for measurement of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> during specific activities. This method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to extend the {{existing}} findings on environmental flow precursors by adopting the DIAMONDS taxonomy of psychologically meaningful situation characteristics as a comprehensive theoretical framework. It was hypothesized that an individual's perception of the flow-related situation, particularly the dimensions of duty, intellect and positivity, would represent a more powerful predictor of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> as compared to his or her basic personality traits. The first sample consisted of 169 employees who had to focus on the most engaging work-related event they had experienced in the past three months. They rated the characteristics of that situation and estimated the intensity of their flow experience. The second sample consisted of 96 students who participated in a challenging group activity. After the activity, they filled-in the same questionnaires as the first sample. Participants from both samples also rated their basic personality traits. Despite differences in the settings and flow-related situations evaluated, the obtained findings were similar for the two samples studied. While the association between flow and personality was weak, the situation characteristics were more strongly related to flow. Although the two samples differed with respect to the mean levels of the flow-related situation characteristics, regression analyses yielded similar results, suggesting that the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> at work and in studying is most prominently determined by situation characteristics related to intellect and positivity. Stable personality characteristics, on the other hand, had low predictive power in explaining the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} validation of the Flow Metacognitions Questionnaire (FMQ) for measuring metacognitions of flow. Flow {{is a state of}} deep cognitive absorption that makes a person feel fully immersed in an activity. Flow metacognitions had been defined as people’s awareness of and beliefs on the flow state, its consequences, and strategies for achieving and maintaining flow (Wilson & Moneta, 2012). Exploratory factor analysis of the pilot FMQ yielded a two-component solution, based on a sample of 204 UK university students. The two FMQ sub-scales were labelled ‘Beliefs that Flow Fosters Achievement’ (FMQ- 1) and ‘Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow’ (FMQ- 2). Confirmatory factor analysis on a convenience sample of 159 international workers confirmed the two sub-scales of the final 12 -item FMQ. The FMQ’s predictive validity was supported in a series of hierarchical regression analyses. Confidence in Ability to Self-Regulate Flow predicted the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> in work better than measures of maladaptive and adaptive metacognitions.

40|$|Cavity {{noise is}} a well known problem in the fluid {{dynamics}} field. While many methods of suppressing flow induced cavity resonance exist, the community still lacks a full under-standing of the physical process taking place during the cavity noise suppression. This paper explores one resonance control mechanism, namely the effect of lifting the shear layer above the cavity, and the physical effects associated with this technique. The noise suppression values and shear layer development are systematically quantified as a rod {{is located on the}} surface of the model at various locations upstream of the cavity leading edge. Through the experimental results and flow visualization trials, this paper shows that the presence of an upstream rod deflects the incoming shear layer upwards above the cavity, decreases the noise levels (up to 26. 5 dB for the main tone harmonic sound pressure level), and reduces the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> impingement on the trailing edge wall inside the cavity. In addition, a diminished recirculation on the side walls of the cavity is observed suggesting significant disruption of the acoustic resonance feedback loop.

30|$|Graph Theory {{provides}} us with a powerful toolkit for the modelling and treatment of data which exhibit pairwise relations, such as a transportation network. In {{the case of the}} data derived from the Lloyd’s Shipping Index, we treat each port as a node of the network, and the edges (the connections between the ports) are added if we observe at least one movement of a ship from port A to B in a given time period. We obtain in this way an undirected and unweighted graph G=(N,E), with the set of nodes (N) and edges (E). In this work we do {{not take into account the}} <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> movements among the ports; that is, each edge in the network has a weight of 1 and contributes equally to the scores that we obtain while performing calculations on the network. This is certainly a simplification, which overlooks the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flows,</b> by looking only at the existing connections which we can observe in the maritime network. As a result, busy links, such as Singapore-Shanghai contribute to the the network in the same way as the links at which we observed only one movement during the studied period. This simplification is not harmful if one wants to study just the topological properties of the network, as it is the case in the present paper, and not necessarily the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> or congestion effects. For the studies <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> per se, weighting by tonnage or number of calls seems to be a necessity.

This wetland, not only has ecological and biological importance for migratory birds and rare fish species, but also is used for farms to discharge into the Caspian Sea through this wetland. Therefore its pollution control is very important for human life. In this study 6 elements (copper, iron, lead, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in Anzali wetland were analyzed by Atomic Absorption spectroscopy method.. Water samples were collected from ten sampling sites seasonally and the results were compared with each other.

Recognizing this variability is critical for understanding biogeochemical and ecological processes associated with the hyporheic zone. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the variability of hydraulic conductivity (K), vertical hydraulic gradients (VHGs), and subsurface fluxes, over a riffle-step-pool sequence and at a high spatio-temporal resolution. A 20 m reach was equipped with a network of piezometers in order to determine the distribution of VHGs and K. During a summer month, temporal variations of VHGs were regularly surveyed and, for a subset of piezometers, the water level was automatically recorded at 15 min intervals by logging pressure transducers. Additionally, point-dilution tests were carried out on the same subset of piezometers. Whereas the distribution of vertical fluxes can be derived from K and VHG values, point-dilution tests allow for the estimation of horizontal fluxes where no VHG is detectable. Results indicate that, spatially, VHGs switched from upwelling to downwelling across lateral as well as longitudinal sections of the channel. Vertical fluxes appeared spatially more homogeneous than VHGs, suggesting that the latter can be a poor indicator of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow.</b> Finally, during flow events, some VHGs showed little or no fluctuations; this was interpreted as the result of a pressure wave propagating from upstream through highly diffusive alluvial sediments...|$|E

40|$|Mixing {{driven by}} buoyancy-induced flows is of {{particular}} interest to microgravity processes, as the body force that governs the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> fields can be directly controlled. We consider a model experimental system to explore the dynamics of mixing which employs two miscible liquids inside a cavity separated initially by a divider. The two liquids are oriented vertically inside a rectangular cavity with constant width and height, and varying depths to span the range of a Hele-Shaw cell to a 3 -D configuration. The two miscible liquids can be sufficiently diluted and died, for example water and deuterium oxide, such that a distinct interface exists across the divider. The transient mixing characteristic of the two fluids is addressed by following the Lagrangian history of the interface for various aspect ratios in the z-plane (depth variation) as well as a range of pulling velocities of the divider. The mixing characteristics of the two fluids are quantified from measurement of the length stretch of the interface and its flow field using respectively image processing techniques and Particle Imaging Velocimetry. Scaling analysis shows that the length stretch depends on four governing parameters, namely the Grashof number (Gr), Schmidt number (Sc), aspect ratio (Ar), and Reynolds number (Re). Variation of the Schmidt number is taken into account through thermophysical property variation. Thus our problem reduces to a codimension three bifurcation in parametric space for Gr, Ar, and Re...|$|E

The recent increase in the frequency and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> alterations, especially related to hydroelectric use or irrigation, represents a key element of riverine environment deterioration. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of current velocity increases on macrobenthic fauna, underlining that, in most cases, these increases enhance the drift, i. e. the abandonment of the substrate by macroinvertebrates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the drift propensity of Simulium monticola (Diptera: Simuliidae) under different water velocities. Simuliidae are one of the most characteristic components of fast-flowing environments in rivers. Experiments were conducted in an artificial stream in the laboratories of Politecnico di Torino, analysing the drift of organisms at different current velocities. The observed variability of drift appears to be related to velocity increases: interestingly, we evidenced an inverse relationship between {{velocity and}} drift propensity, with low amounts of drifting organisms at higher velocities. This tendency was not related to the size of Simuliidae larvae: when comparing the size of drifting organisms with velocity, no significant correlations were detected. We hypothesized that the tendency to drift was mainly behavioural rather than catastrophic, and related to the preference for high water velocities. Our findings support the hypothesis that increases in water velocity can cause complex changes in the drift of the macrobenthic community, increasing the propensity for some species to leave the substrate and decreasing it for other...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of small hydroelectric dams built on mountain streams induce changes in stream flow regimes that are manifested {{not only in}} the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> events, but also in the variability and frequency of high- and low-flow episodes. Former studies have shown the influence of flow variability upon the dynamics of a resident brown trout population, especially that related to the stream flow regime during spawning, incubation and emerging periods. As these life-stages are known to determine the population dynamics in further ages, stream flow variability appears to be a major influence on the regulation of a wild brown trout population. Thus, mean flow discharge should not be the only parameter taken into account when establishing ecological flow regimes to support rehabilitation of degraded trout populations in mountain streams. Ecological stream flow regime characteristics are proposed as a basis for the design of environmental flow regimes in mountain reaches downstream of hydroelectric or water supply dams. Case studies were conducted in a high mountain basin in Central Spain (River Tormes) for a period of 5 years showing that relationship between duration and frequency of high and low flow episodes during egg incubation could be linked to young-of-the-year recruitment and quantified in terms of flow management units. Duration and frequency of flow discharges could be manipulated so as to create favourable hydrological conditions for restoring sustainable populations of brown trout in rivers affected by flow regulatio...|$|E

40|$|We used {{equatorial}} glacier-fed streams as a {{model system}} to investigate the relationships between flow fluctuation and benthic fauna at different temporal scales. Water level was measured at 30 min intervals over 29 months (942 d) and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled 14 times over the study period. We performed wavelet analyses on water-level time series to identify temporal scales at which significant flow variation occurs, and calculated three indices: intensity, frequency and temporal clustering of the diurnal flow variation for periods from 2 d to 50 d. We determined the effect of temporal scaling (length of the periods considered) on relationships between benthic community dissimilarity (using Sorensen index) and differences in flow indices among the 14 sampling dates. Temporal scaling affected flow-variation frequency and temporal clustering and their subsequent relationships with benthic community dissimilarity. A time scale of 15 d before benthic sampling was relevant to the assessment of flow-biota relationships. Community dissimilarity significantly increased with increasing difference in flow-fluctuation intensity. This dissimilarity {{was associated with a}} decrease in the density of dominant taxa and a taxa turnover along the temporal gradient in flow-fluctuation intensity. Although flow fluctuations are frequent and highly predictable in equatorial glacier-fed streams, macroinvertebrate communities exhibited a temporal variability in taxon assemblage, which was linked to the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> fluctuation. We explain these patterns by downstream displacement during high flow events and upstream displacement during low flow periods, thereby highlighting the need of considering temporal scaling effects on benthic fauna to understand the ecological dynamics of lotic systems...|$|E

The simulation model was based on several hypotheses: (1) flow durations and their succeeding dry periods (time when no flow is present) are independent; (2) the distribution of the lengths of the dry periods and flows is stationary over a certain period of the year (summer); (3) stationary probability distributions for flow durations and for dry period lengths can be derived. A related problem was how to derive a simulation model for the total amount of flow (in acre-ft) within 1 flow period. Three variables were considered: flow duration (minutes), peak <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> (cu ft/sec) and antecedent dry period-minutes (ADP). Because the assumption of variance constancy does not hold, a multiplicative regression model was used. Using an analysis of variance, which is described in detail, the worth of the 3 kinds of data were examined in relation to total flow. It was concluded that there are at least 5 times during the year when the flow intervals differ significantly, and the ADP is not important in determining flow volume because of the poison flow arrival rate in summer.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{complementarity}} {{of the methods}} from the field <b>of</b> traffic <b>flow</b> theory: methods <b>of</b> traffic <b>flow</b> intersecting <b>intensity</b> and the method for the at-grade intersection capacity analysis. Apart from checking mutual implications of these methods, the proportionality of mutual influences is assessed. Harmonized application of these methods acts efficiently on the entire traffic network, and {{not only on the}} intersections that are usually incorrectly represented as the only network operators. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by a practical example.
