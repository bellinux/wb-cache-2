50|$|Francisco Anchia y Urquiza (10 April 1783 - 1831) {{became known}} as Francisco de Longa because of his {{leadership}} of that village and surrounding area. He was born in Spain in the Biscay province of Longa, Mallabia and was a blacksmith before the war. Longa was first a Spanish guerilla in 1809 with a few followers. These partidas, or groups, were encouraged by the military and civil authorities. Part {{of the reason for}} this was logistical: the bands depended upon supplies from the regular forces including arms and ammunitions. Longa’s partidas attacked lines of communications. Then he formed a battalion of 700 men by 1811 as lieutenant colonel, and he ascended to the command of the Iberian Division by 1812 as colonel. He and his forces fought in the Cantabrian mountains for four years and were familiar with the terrain, which served Wellington’s campaign well. He became commander of the Spanish Fourth Army, was made a brigadier general by 1814, lieutenant general by 1815, and then later a field marshal. Longa supported Wellington’s Anglo-Portuguese campaign of 1813. At the Battle of Vitoria, Longa’s division was part of Sir Thomas Graham’s column that ran through the mountains that were to the north. Their mission was designed to prevent the French forces from retreating east from Vitoria and they were directed to not be decisively engaged before the other columns. They faced the French Army of Portugal that had the mission of protecting the French lines of communication. They fought in the eastern area of Gammarra Mayor and sustained the highest casualties; it was named “Gomorrah” {{because of the nature of}} devastation of the battle. Longa’s forces were able to cut the main French retreat route. Longa’s support aided the allied forces under Wellington to victory. Longa’s guerilla forces were able to aide in depriving the French forces from intelligence and instead provide intelligence of French locations to Wellington’s allied forces. Longa also achieved disruption: French <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> and logistics were hampered, negatively affecting both the discipline and morale of the French forces. The major achievements of the Battle of Vitoria were a greater French casualty rate than the allied forces (approximately 8,000 to 5,000 respectively) and capture of 151 of 153 French cannons and 415 French caissons (ammunition chests). Some argue that without forces like Longa’s guerillas, the French forces would not have been defeated. Within the next month, most French forces left Spain and French rule was practically ended.|$|E

Experimental results about the structural properties, involves the positions of the elements Al and P(As). Since there were not any other efforts about the positions of the Li elements in these compounds, so to our knowledge there was no theoretical study about them till now. In the first step the interactional forces between atoms were minimized. The calculated <b>internal</b> <b>coordinations</b> of atoms agree well with the experimental results. Using these positions we obtained the equilibrium lattice constants, bulk modulus and their pressure derivative. In the second step the electronic properties of Li 3 AlP 2 and Li 3 AlAs 2 have been studied. The study of total and partial electronic DOS indicate the main contribution of DOS consists of P(As) 3 p(4 p) and P(As) 3 s(4 s) states. Our band structure calculation verifies that Li 3 AlP 2 is an indirect gap semiconductor with a value of about 2. 36 eV between valance band maximum occuring at H point and conduction band minimum occuring at Г point; though the difference between the direct (2. 38 eV) and indirect (2. 36 eV) is very small.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} the <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> {{between the}} federal government, the Regions and the Communities in Belgium {{before and during the}} 2010 Belgian Presidency of the Council of Ministers. It starts from the observation that the absence of a federal government with full powers, the global financial-economic crisis as well as Belgium’s complex multi-level structure have, counter intuitively, not led to an ineffective <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> process. Based on interviews with people who were closely involved in the Belgian Presidency team, the article explains the effectiveness of the <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> by arguing that, on the one hand, the detailed and inclusive coordination before the Presidency semester has generated a culture of responsibility and joint ownership among the officials and diplomats and, on the other hand, the Belgian Presidency limited its role to a facilitator of the European decision-making process in function of the rolling agenda of the Commission and the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Empirically illustrating these arguments with insights from the <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> in the environmental domain, this article demonstrates that an effective <b>internal</b> <b>coordination,</b> even in a difficult political context, can contribute to a successful Presidency...|$|E

We formulate an empirical model to relate the use of information technology capital to vertical integration and diversification. This model is tested using an 8 - year panel data set of information technology capital stock, firm structure, and relevant control variables for 549 large firms. Overall, increased use of IT {{is found to be}} associated with substantial decreases in vertical integration and weak increases in diversification. In addition, firms that are less vertically integrated and more diversified have a higher demand for IT capital. While we cannot rule out all alternative explanations for these results, they are consistent with previous theoretical arguments that both <b>internal</b> and external <b>coordination</b> costs are reduced by IT...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The correct {{behavior}} of a service composition depends on the appropriate coordination of its services. According {{to the idea of}} channelbased coordination, services exchange messages though channels without any knowledge about each other. The Reo coordination language aims at building connectors out of basic channels to implement arbitrarily complex interaction protocols. The activity within a Reo connector consists of two types of communication, each of which incurs a delay: <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> and data transfer. Semantic models have been proposed for Reo that articulate data transfer delays, but none of them explicitly considers coordination delays. More importantly, these models implicitly assume that (1) <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> and data transfer activities take place in two separate phases, and (2) data transfer delays do not affect the coordination phase. This assumptions prevent maximal concurrency in data exchange and distort the evaluation of end-to-end delays in service composition models. In this paper, we introduce a novel compositional automata-based semantic model for Reo that explicitly represents both <b>internal</b> <b>coordination</b> and data transfer aspects in channel-based connectors. Furthermore, we map the proposed model to the process algebra mCRL 2, which allows us to generate state spaces for connectors with time delays and analyze them automatically. ...|$|E
