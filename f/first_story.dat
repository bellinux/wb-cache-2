5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>story</b> {{arc of the}} Mega Man comic series adapts the {{original}} Mega Man game, though with certain artistic liberties, such as Dr. Wily's robot factory reusing the design of Mega Man 2s Wily Castle, Mega Man becoming obsessed with stopping the reprogrammed Robot Masters {{to the point of}} having an identity crisis, and Dr. Light mistaking a Sniper Joe controlled by Dr. Wily for Proto Man.|$|E
5|$|A later fictional {{treatment}} of the historical episode, appeared as the <b>first</b> <b>story</b> of Edward Maturin's Sejanus, and Other Roman Tales (New York 1839). It also figures in Robert Graves' I, Claudius (1934). The novel was given new life when it was adapted for television as I, Claudius in 1976; in this Antonia sends the letter of accusation to Tiberius via Claudius, after discovering her daughter is plotting with Sejanus (Patrick Stewart). The Caesars (1968) was an earlier television series which featured Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His <b>first</b> <b>story</b> was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although {{this might have been}} {{as a result of the}} story being set underground.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the <b>first</b> <b>story</b> ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945. Vandersteen though was disappointed to see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske instead of his suggestion Suske en Wiske, and also felt that Rikki too closely resembled Tintin.|$|E
5|$|Since 1993, Curtis had {{frequently}} read {{morning news}} stories and exchanged them with friends. Although this {{would later become}} the inspiration for Fark, Curtis {{toyed with the idea}} of starting an online curry recipe database. In 1999, eighteen months after registering the domain name, he launched Fark as a way to share interesting news postings with his friends rather than sending them numerous emails. The <b>first</b> <b>story</b> posted was an article about a fighter pilot who crashed while attempting to moon another fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|The Rescue was {{produced}} in a six-episode block with The Romans and was the <b>first</b> <b>story</b> produced in Doctor Who second production block. Rehearsals and recording took place from 30 November to 11 December 1964, entirely in-studio. The two episodes were watched by 12 and 13 million viewers in the UK respectively and have received generally positive reviews from critics, who praise the character-based storytelling, although plot holes were noted. Both episodes of The Rescue have been retained in the BBC archives, and the story has been novelised and released on VHS and DVD. The serial is notable as the first appearance of Maureen O'Brien as companion Vicki.|$|E

5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the <b>first</b> <b>story</b> and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden shutters and white-painted wooden lintels and sills.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The <b>first</b> <b>story</b> of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E
5|$|Paul Geerts {{joined the}} Studio in 1968, where he at first {{worked as an}} artist on the German Jerom comics. Already in 1969, he {{replaced}} De Rop as the main inker for Suske en Wiske. Geerts also drew Vandersteens attention when he proposed a few scenario's for Jerom, and in 1971 he made his <b>first</b> <b>story</b> for Suske en Wiske. From 1972 on, he became the main creator of the flagship series Suske en Wiske, which he continued until the late 1990s. De Rop and Goossens again became the main inkers, with Geerts responsible for the stories and the pencil art. In these years, Suske en Wiske reached its peak popularity, and the older stories now were republished in colours in the main series. In 1975 and 1976, the Dutch television broadcast six puppet movies with new Suske en Wiske stories. They were very successful and sales of new albums reached over 200,000 copies. The merchandising business boomed as well, and commercial comics {{were one of the}} main new jobs for the Studio.|$|E

5|$|Set on {{the fictional}} continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plot lines {{and a large}} {{ensemble}} cast but centers on three primary story arcs. The <b>first</b> <b>story</b> arc centers on the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting {{a return to the}} throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Doctor's <b>first</b> <b>story</b> was {{originally}} intended to be the four-part Project Zeta Sigma, written by John Flanagan & Andrew McCulloch. It {{was not intended to}} follow on directly from the events of Logopolis; instead, the Doctor and his companions would have already left Earth. The story was to concern nuclear disarmament. Commissioned as Project '4G on 7 October 1980, the script proved unworkable, and producer John Nathan-Turner dropped the story on 19 February 1981. He then commissioned recently departed script editor Christopher H. Bidmead to write a replacement which became Castrovalva. This last minute change disrupted the shooting schedule, meaning that Castrovalva would be the fourth serial of the series filmed, though {{it would be the first}} transmitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{first level}} of the {{building}} contains two classrooms, {{both of which have}} a cloakroom, a set of three swivel doors, and a large slate chalkboard that covers one of the walls.

The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small storage rooms. A metal fire escape door is located {{in the center of the}} west wall of the second story. The schoolhouse also has a partial basement, which contains a large storage room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>story</b> {{is about}} the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} and well-recorded duel {{occurred}} on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri. Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and {{decided to have a}} gunfight. They arranged to walk towards each other at 6 p.m. Wild Bill's armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok's shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt's shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The <b>first</b> <b>story</b> of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper's Magazine in 1867, and became a staple of the gunslinger legend.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version was only moderately successful, {{although it is}} remembered for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more sex and violence than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley {{has suggested that the}} magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with less attractive cover art and {{little in the way of}} notable fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's <b>first</b> <b>story.</b> By the end of 1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently.|$|E
