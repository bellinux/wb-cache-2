But one professor from that institution was to have a more particular and wide ranging impact on Seurat’s imagination, which bore directly discernable effects in the Bathers. CharlesBlanc had been a professor and director at the École and had arranged for copies of Quattrocento fresco paintings from Arezzo to be displayed in the École chapel. The huge, stately and dignified figures in these frescos, and the regularity of their spacing has obvious echoes in the Bathers. Among these fresco painters was PierodellaFrancesca, whose Resurrection depicts a sleeping guard at the bottom-left sharing a number of features with the seated man in Bathers at Asnières. The curvature of slumping back and bent legs is clearly matched in both figures, and indeed the posture also appears in the Young Male Nude Seated beside the Sea of Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, a painting with which any student at the École would have been familiar. The sculpted contours of Piero’s soldier’s cape find an echo in the rugged contours of the trousers in Seurat’s painting, and the flick {{at the back of the}} guard’s hat becomes a rhythmic motif showing up with hats, hair and bootstraps alike in Bathers.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} {{land prices}} in the Savinja statistical region. The analysis is performed {{on the basis of}} data including advertised and selling prices of wooded areas as well as agricultural and building land. All selling prices also comprise a <b>general</b> market <b>value</b> determined by means of the real estate mass appraisal conducted by the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia (GURS). In the beginning, the treated region is analysed as a whole. To perform a detailed analysis of the relevant land prices and <b>general</b> market <b>values,</b> an analysis {{at the level of the}} local communities is also included. The analysis of the discrepancy between advertised and selling prices shows that advertised prices are in all cases higher than the selling ones. However, the analysis of the discrepancy between selling prices and <b>general</b> market <b>values</b> reveals that <b>general</b> market <b>values</b> are lower than relevant selling prices. On the basis of the results, it was established that there exist the biggest discrepancy between advertised prices, selling prices and <b>general</b> market <b>values</b> in the sphere of building land, and the smallest in the one of wooded areas. In general, it can be concluded for all three land development degrees that the highest prices are the advertised ones, followed by selling prices and <b>general</b> market <b>values...</b>|$|R
