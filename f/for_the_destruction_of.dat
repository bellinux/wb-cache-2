5|$|According to Alfonso Archi, Hidar was {{succeeded by}} Isqi-Mari whose royal seal was {{discovered}} and it depicts battle scenes, causing Archi {{to suggest that}} he was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> Ebla while still a general. Just a decade after Ebla's destruction (c. 2300 BC middle chronology), Mari itself was destroyed and burned by Sargon of Akkad, Michael Astour give the date as c. 2265 BC (short chronology).|$|E
5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy influence that Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E

Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, using a variety of techniques, suggest dates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the site in either the last two centuries or the mid-1st millennium. The lack of Roman artifacts (common in local souterrain sites) suggests that many sites were abandoned before the arrival of the legions.|$|E
5|$|The Voronezh Front, {{commanded}} by Nikolai Vatutin, was tasked with defending the southern {{face of the}} salient. The Central Front, {{commanded by}} Konstantin Rokossovsky, defended the northern face. Waiting in reserve was the Steppe Front, commanded by Ivan Konev. In February 1943, the Central Front had been reconstructed from the Don Front, which {{had been part of}} the northern pincer of Operation Uranus and had been responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the 6th Army at Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers of the prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{news about}} the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone prepares his regiment for battle. From their cell, the captives see the outmatched Bengal Lancers deployed to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and ultimately destroy the ammunition tower, and young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger. With their ammunition gone and headquarters in ruins {{as a result of}} the battle, the remaining rebels surrender. However, McGregor, who was mainly responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the ammunition tower, is killed in the assault. To recognize their battlefield bravery and military effort, Forsythe and Lieutenant Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order and McGregor posthumously receives the prestigious Victoria Cross, with McGregor's horse awarded the medal on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recognized}} {{one of the}} men {{living in}} the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami (Kais Nashef), Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate (Skip) to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Other basic {{defensive}} measures {{included the}} removal of signposts, milestones (some had the carved details obscured with cement) and railway station signs making {{it more likely that}} an enemy would become confused. Petrol pumps were removed from service stations near the coast and there were careful preparations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> those that were left. Detailed plans were made for destroying anything that might prove useful to the invader such as port facilities, key roads and rolling stock. In certain areas non-essential citizens were evacuated. In the county of Kent, 40% of the population was relocated; in East Anglia, the figure was 50%.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} the will to take revenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> Palmyrene trade centers and {{discourage}} Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of Mesopotamia, driving out the Persian garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first onslaught was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the Persian occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45km west of the Persian capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of Mesopotamia loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus stood at {{the walls of the}} Persian capital.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer had to {{wait two}} months to achieve another victory, {{claiming}} the destruction of two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar on the night 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. On the night of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed a claim for another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had guided him into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band airborne radar. His next claim was made on the night of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. On the night of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was given credit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the Lancaster.|$|E

5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Poland began on 1 September 1939, and {{marked the beginning}} of World War II in Europe. Philipp's unit was tasked with bomber escort and ground attack as well as combat air patrol missions. He was credited with his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 without firing a single shot. Philipp maneuvered himself into a favorable attack position and aimed carefully. Just {{as he was about to}} open fire, the enemy pilot bailed out. Nevertheless, he was given credit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, which was presented to him on 10 October 1939.

By this time her uncle and brother had perished in the Cultural Revolution, and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Chou En-Lai, who personally apologized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the tombs. After this, she returned to China a number of times.|$|E

After putting herself and the cat in cryosleep, she is rescued fifty-seven years later and relieved of duty by Weyland-Yutani <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the Nostromo and her outlandish claims about the Alien. After communication is lost with LV-426, Ripley is sent with a unit of colonial marines on the Sulaco to investigate; the entire expedition, except Ripley, Corporal Hicks, the orphan Newt and the android Bishop, is lost. In cryosleep on the Sulaco, Ripley is impregnated with a queen by a facehugger Alien morph; this triggers a fire, which causes the ship to crash on the prison planet Fiorina 161, killing all aboard, save for Ripley. As the sole human survivor of the crash, Ripley helps the prisoners incarcerated on the planet to defeat an Alien created from an animal impregnated by a second facehugger.

He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall; though it is later revealed that they weren't looking for the egg at first. Eragon and Saphira manage to escape by hiding in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the house and farm are burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon is left with no reason to stay in Carvahall, so he goes after the Ra'zac with his newly hatched dragon, seeking vengeance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> his home and his uncle's death.
