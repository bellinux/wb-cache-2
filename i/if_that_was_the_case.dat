Lancaster, Chief U.S. District Judge, and pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs, specifically HGH and Erythropoietin (EPO). According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary McKeen Houghton, the retail value of the transactions brokered by Papp between Shandong Kexing Bioproducts Corp. and over 180 international clients approached $80,000USD from September 2006 to September 2007 None of the 187 customers, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, triathletes, mixed-martial artists and rowers, were identified in court.

25|$|In mid 2008 {{after the}} {{indictment}} had been served, {{it was discovered}} that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that the investigator had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation. Althin believed that the investigation might have to be redone <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation because the police were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer brushed off the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that the investigator hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police. According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that the investigator is not a key witness in the case. The investigator could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.|$|E
500|$|Professor Michael Hicks, a Richard III specialist, {{has been}} {{particularly}} critical {{of the use of}} the mitochondrial DNA to argue that the body is Richard III's, stating that [...] "any male sharing a maternal ancestress in the direct female line could qualify". He also criticises the rejection by the Leicester team of the Y chromosome evidence, suggesting that it was not acceptable to the Leicester team to conclude that the skeleton was anyone other than Richard III. He argues that {{on the basis of the}} present scientific evidence [...] "identification with Richard III is more unlikely that likely". However, Hicks himself draws attention to the contemporary view held by some that Richard III's grandfather, Richard, earl of Cambridge, was the product of an illegitimate union between Cambridge's mother Isabella of Castile (a bastard daughter of Pedro the Cruel of Castile) and John Holland (brother in law of Henry IV of England), rather than Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (Edward III's fourth son). <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> then the Y chromosome discrepancy with the Beaufort line would be explained but obviously still fail to prove the identity of the body. Hicks suggests alternative candidates descended from Richard III's maternal ancestress for the body (e.g. Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln) but does not provide evidence to support his suggestions. Philippa Langley, who commissioned the excavation refutes Hicks' argument on the basis that he does not taken into account all the evidence that points to the same conclusion.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, O'Hara {{made her}} fourth picture with Ford, The Long Gray Line, which she {{considered}} being [...] "by {{far the most}} difficult" [...] due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O'Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O'Hara and Power are overdone, {{and that there is}} little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O'Hara's relationship with Ford, and each day he would greet her with [...] "Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?". He would ask the crew if she was in a good mood, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> he would say [...] "then we're going to have a horrible day" [...] and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to [...] "move her fat Irish ass". Their relationship deteriorated further when O'Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set, and Ford knew that she thought he was a closeted homosexual. In The Magnificent Matador, O'Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who {{falls in love with a}} brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Lana Turner were considered for O'Hara's part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O'Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a [...] "full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses".|$|E

500|$|The Bill was {{introduced}} in Parliament on 21 January 1963. Opposition to the Bill came from DMK members who objected to the usage of the word [...] "may" [...] instead of [...] "shall" [...] in section 3 of the Bill. That section read: [...] "the English language may...continue {{to be used in}} addition to Hindi". The DMK argued was that the term [...] "may" [...] could be interpreted as [...] "may not" [...] by future administrations. They feared that the minority opinion would not be considered and non-Hindi speakers' views would be ignored. On 22 April, Nehru assured the parliamentarians that, for that particular case [...] "may" [...] had the same meaning as [...] "shall". The DMK then demanded, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> why [...] "shall" [...] was not used instead of [...] "may". Leading the opposition to the Bill was Annadurai (then a Member of the Rajya Sabha). He pleaded for an indefinite continuation of the status quo and argued that continued use of English as official language would [...] "distribute advantages or disadvantages evenly" [...] among Hindi and non-Hindi speakers. The Bill was passed on 27 April without any change in the wording. As he had warned earlier, Annadurai launched statewide protests against Hindi. In November 1963, Annadurai was arrested along with 500 DMK members for burning part XVII of the Constitution at an anti-Hindi Conference. He was sentenced to six months in prison. On 25 January 1964, a DMK member, Chinnasamy, committed suicide at Trichy by self-immolation, to protest the [...] "imposition of Hindi". He was claimed as the first [...] "language martyr" [...] of {{the second round of the}} anti-Hindi struggle by the DMK.|$|E

Saracoğlu rejected Papen's suggestion of an Italo-Turkish friendship pact, saying such a treaty [...] "would displease Turkey enormously". Saracoğlu also told Papen that Germany's efforts to make the Balkans its sphere of influence both politically and economically were regarded as a threat and wanted to know if the Reich was prepared to go further, leading Papen to say [...] "Jamais d'la vie!" [...] ("I wouldn't dream of it!"), leading [...] Saracoğlu [...] to retort <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> then the Germans could sleep quietly in their beds.

2500|$|The {{federal courts}} have not {{restrained}} {{state and local}} governments from seizing privately owned land for private commercial development on behalf of private developers. This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Kelo v. City of New London. This 54 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by Justice Stevens, found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that [...] "the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue." [...] Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not [...] "of primary benefit to... the developer" [...] and that <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit {{at the expense of the}} poor, asserting that [...] "Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms." [...] She argued that the decision eliminates [...] "any distinction between private and public use of propertyand thereby effectively delete the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment". A number of states, in response to Kelo, have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not [...] "for public use" [...] are not directly covered by the doctrine, however such a taking might violate due process rights under the Fourteenth amendment, or other applicable law.|$|E

The Brigade had lost its Officer Commanding {{as well as its}} Brigade Major during the previous two days fighting and over 15,000 shells had fallen on their strongpoint, known as [...] "Hotbox," [...] from the area of the Trieste Division. Pienaar advised Norrie that their position was [...] "untenable" [...] and Norrie replied that <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> he would [...] "..... relieve the Brigade, place it in reserve and replace it with another formation." [...] Offended by this [...] Pienaar called 8th Army HQ and was advised by Dorman-Smith that the Brigade was to remain where it was. [...] Not satisfied, Pienaar insisted on speaking to Auchinleck, who ordered that the Brigade hold its ground – but offered to relieve the Brigade within two days when the 9th Australian Division reached El Alamein. [...] Pienaar's demands of the evening of 2 July shook the 8th Army command’s confidence in the morale of the division and Auchinleck stated that the division could no longer be exposed to [...] "undue operational strain," [...] fearing that material losses to the division, especially after the surrender of the 2nd SA Division at Tobruk, would lead to political disaster. [...] Auchinleck deployed the 9th Australian Division to re-enforce the northern sector of the line held by the South Africans three days later. Pienaar had also been falsely accused of supporting the retreat to the Delta and engaging the Axis from behind the Suez Canal – he remained resolved to fight, stating to an American war correspondent at Alam Halfa in July 1942 [...] "....Here I stop, I've retreated far enough, whether we hold the damn thing or not!" ...|$|E
