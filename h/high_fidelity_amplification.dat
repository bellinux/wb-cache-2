50|$|By contrast, {{in modern}} <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> <b>amplification,</b> {{the trend is}} to {{separate}} the bass signal and amplify it with a dedicated amplifier. Often, amplifiers for bass are integrated with the speaker cabinet, a configuration known as the powered subwoofer. In a topology that includes a dedicated amplifier for bass, the damping factor of the main amplifier is not relevant, {{and that of the}} bass amplifier is also irrelevant if that amplifier is integrated with the speaker and cabinet as a unit, since all those components are designed together and optimized for the reproduction of bass.|$|E
40|$|A <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> <b>amplification</b> of beams {{carrying}} orbital {{angular momentum}} (OAM) is very crucial for OAM multiplexing and other OAM-based applications. Here, we report the first study of stimulated Brillouin amplification (SBA) for OAM beams, the energy conversion efficiency of photon-phonon coupling and the phase structure of amplified signals are investigated in collinear and noncollinear frame systems, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the OAM signals can be efficiently amplified without obvious noise introduced, and the modes of output signal are independent of the pump modes or the geometrical frames. Meanwhile, an OAM state depending on the optical modes and the geometrical frames is loaded into phonons by coherent light-acoustic interaction, which reveals more fundamental significance and a great application potential in OAM-multiplexing.

40|$|Perfect {{deterministic}} amplification of arbitrary quantum {{states is}} prohibited by quantum mechanics, but determinism {{can be achieved}} by compromising between fidelity and amplification power. We propose a dynamical scheme for deterministically amplifying photonic Schrödinger cat states, which show great promise as a tool for quantum information processing. Our protocol is designed for strongly coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics and utilizes artificial atomic states and external microwave controls to engineer a set of optimal state transfers and achieve <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> <b>amplification.</b> We compare analytical results with full simulations of the open, driven Jaynes-Cummings model, using realistic device parameters for state of the art superconducting circuits. Amplification with a fidelity of 0. 9 can be achieved for sizable cat states in the presence of cavity and atomic-level decoherence. This tool could be applied to practical continuous-variable information processing for the purification and stabilization of cat states in the presence of photon losses...|$|E
40|$|By {{combining}} the separation technology of CDCE (constant denaturing capillary electrophoresis) with <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> DNA <b>amplification</b> the authors devised a reliable means to measure mutant fractions of {{any and all}} point mutations in human cell or tissue mitochondrial DNA arising at mutant fractions at or above 10 {sup {minus} 6 }. Measurements in nuclear genes are more difficult than in mitochondrial genes. First, the average mutant fractions per base pair in middle-aged human T cells` hprt gene are about 10 {sup {minus} 8 } which is {{much lower than the}} approximately 3 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 6 } they have found for mitochondrial point mutations in several human tissues. To see point mutational nuclear hotspots they need an analytical procedure which is reliable at mutant fractions of 10 {sup {minus} 7 } and higher. Fortunately, they are close to that goal. At this writing, reconstruction experiments with human cells indicate they have achieved a sensitivity at least as low as 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 7 } so they are optimistic that they can reach the required criterion...|$|R
40|$|The {{melanoma}} patient's {{immune response}} to tumor {{has been extensively}} studied. Yet, the frequently observed coexistence of tumor-associated Ag (TAA) -specific T cells with their target cells in vivo remains unexplained. Loss of TAA expression might contribute to this paradox. We studied TAA expression in metastases by obtaining fine-needle aspirations from 52 tumor lesions in 30 patients with melanoma before and soon after immunotherapy. Limitations due to low amounts of starting material were overcome with a <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> antisense RNA <b>amplification</b> method. TAA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR of anti-sense RNA. Decrease in gp 100 /Pmel- 17 TAA preceded tumor disappearance in several instances and could be best explained by immune selection because most patients had received gp 100 /Pmel- 17 -specific vaccination. Conversely, immune selection was absent in nonregressing lesions. These observations suggest that vaccination, when successful, triggers a broad inflammatory reaction {{that can lead to}} tumor destruction despite immune selection. Additionally, lack of clinical response might be attributed to lack of this initiating event rather than immune escape. This study provides an insight into the natural history of tumors and defines a strategy for the characterization of gene expression in tumors during therapy...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{obstacles}} have impeded {{our ability}} to study prion transmission within and, more particularly, between species. Here, we used cervid prion protein expressed in brain extracts of transgenic mice, referred to as Tg(CerPrP), as a substrate for in vitro generation of chronic wasting disease (CWD) prions by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Characterization of this infectivity in Tg(CerPrP) mice demonstrated that serial PMCA resulted in the <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> <b>amplification</b> of CWD prions with apparently unaltered properties. Using similar methods to amplify mouse RML prions and characterize the resulting novel cervid prions, we show that serial PMCA abrogated a transmission barrier that required several hundred days of adaptation and subsequent stabilization in Tg(CerPrP) mice. While both approaches produced cervid prions with characteristics distinct from CWD, the subtly different properties of the resulting individual prion isolates indicated that adaptation of mouse RML prions generated multiple strains following inter-species transmission. Our studies demonstrate that combined transgenic mouse and PMCA approaches not only expedite intra- and inter-species prio...|$|E
40|$|Eleven new human polyomaviruses {{have been}} {{recently}} discovered, yet {{for most of}} these viruses, little is known of their biology and clinical impact. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is an ideal method for the amplification of the circular polyomavirus genome due to its <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> <b>amplification</b> of circular DNA. In this study, a modified RCA method was developed to selectively amplify a range of polyomavirus genomes. Initial evaluation showed a multiplexed temperature-graded reaction profile gave the best yield and sensitivity in amplifying BK polyomavirus in a background of human DNA, with up to 1 × 10 (8) -fold increases in viral genomes from as little as 10 genome copies per reaction. Furthermore, the method {{proved to be more}} sensitive and provided a 200 -fold greater yield than that of random hexamers based standard RCA. Application of the method to other novel human polyomaviruses showed successful amplification of TSPyV, HPyV 6, HPyV 7, and STLPyV from low-viral load positive clinical samples, with viral genome enrichment ranging from 1 × 10 (8) up to 1 × 10 (10). This directed RCA method can be applied to selectively amplify other low-copy polyomaviral genomes from a background of competing non-specific DNA, and is a useful tool in further research into the rapidly expanding Polyomaviridae family...|$|E

40|$|The case is {{made for}} {{the need to have}} <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> lunar {{regolith}} simulants to verify the performance of structures and mechanisms to be used on the lunar surface. Minor constituents will in some cases have major consequences. Small amounts of sulfur in the regolith can poison catalysts, and metallic iron on the surface of nano-sized dust particles may cause a dramatic increase in its toxicity. So the definition of a <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> simulant is application dependent. For example, in situ resource utilization will require <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> in chemistry, meaning careful attention to the minor components and phases; but some other applications, such as the abrasive effects on suit fabrics, might be relatively insensitive to minor component chemistry. The lunar environment itself will change the surface chemistry of the simulant, so to have a <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> simulant at must be used in a <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> simulated environment to get a <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> simulation.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the metamodel-based {{multidisciplinary}} design optimization (MDO) using variable fidelity modelling concept. The main aim is to improve computational costs of MDO problems based on <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> simulation model. One of the main features of the variable fidelity modelling approach adopted in this paper is the utilization of models of different fidelity (i. e. low and <b>high</b> <b>fidelity)</b> in the optimization process. In this approach, the interaction of low and <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> models are used to correct (tune) low fidelity model (metamodel) {{in such a way}} that to provide the same level of accuracy of the original <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> model but at the same time computationally is a very efficient model repeatedly to be used in the optimization process. In this process, only tuned low fidelity models are used in the optimization process. The method is demonstrated on a collaborative optimization (CO) using a 2 D airfoil wing test problem, involving <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> structural and aerodynamic models. The results obtained show that the proposed method significantly reduces computational effort and improves convergence rate for solving MDO problems based on <b>high</b> <b>fidelity</b> models within the CO. ...|$|R
