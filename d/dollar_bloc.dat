40|$|Using a {{multiple}} market model I examine {{the impact of}} euro expansion on the optimal currency denomination of external EU imports. Results suggest euro invoicing will increase more in the EU-expansion country than in the original EU. Exporting firms from <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> countries (the U. S. or countries with fixed exchange rates with the dollar) are more likely to invoice in the euro if price discrimination is already optimal. Firms from outside the <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> are more likely to use the euro when the original EU market is relatively large or transaction costs of exchanging the euro are relatively small.

40|$|Based on a {{classification}} of {{countries and territories}} according to their regime and anchor currency choice, the study considers the two major currency blocs of the present world. A nested logit regression suggests that long-term structural economic variables determine a given country’s currency bloc affiliation. The <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> differs from the euro bloc in that there exists a group of countries that peg temporarily to the US dollar without having close economic affinities with the bloc. The estimated parameters are consistent with an additive random utility model interpretation. A currency bloc equilibrium {{in the spirit of}} Alesina and Barro (2002) is derived empirically...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} an empirical strategy for determining global currency bloc equilibria. The procedure includes, first, a nested logit {{estimation of the}} combined determinants of currency regime and anchor currency choice; second, a test for a welfare-maximising regime decision, in which estimates of the relative welfare of alternative regimes are inferred {{from the results of}} the first step estimation; third, taking the path dependency of regime choice into account, a currency bloc equilibrium is derived. In equilibrium, the <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> is somewhat smaller and the euro bloc larger than at present. Counterfactual exercises assess among others the potential for a renminbi bloc...|$|E
50|$|When the United Kingdom {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in 1931 the British Honduras dollar continued with its attachment to the US dollar and as such it did not {{become part of the}} sterling bloc. At the outbreak of the second world war, unlike in the case of Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong, British Honduras did join the sterling area even though it maintained its fixed exchange rate with respect to the US <b>dollar.</b> The sterling <b>bloc</b> {{should not be confused with}} the sterling area. The former was a group of countries who pegged their local currencies to sterling when the United Kingdom {{abandoned the}} gold standard in 1931, whereas the latter was an exchange control arrangement introduced as an emergency measure at the outbreak of the second world war.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to {{evaluate}} {{the experience of the}} Euro Area to date in a broad global context. The central question is: How has the creation of the euro affected the power of participating states to cope with external challenges? Three broad issues are explored. First, how well equipped is the Euro Area to deal with any threat of financial instability? Second, can the euro compete effectively with America’s dollar in global markets? And third, does membership in the Euro Area enable European Union governments to play a more influential role in international financial forums? Overall, the chapter concludes, the project has {{failed to live up to}} expectations. Though exposure to exchange-rate disturbances has been reduced by the merger of currencies, the Euro Area remains largely a passive participant in global payments developments and, if anything, has become even more vulnerable to threats of financial instability. Likewise, the euro has failed to mount a significant challenge to the <b>dollar</b> and the <b>bloc</b> continues to punch below its weight in monetary diplomacy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{theoretical and empirical}} relationships between the major exchange rates {{and the price of}} gold using forecast error data. Among other things, it is found that, since the dissolution of the Bretton Woods international monetary system, floating exchange rates among the major currencies have been a major source of price instability in the world gold market and, as the world gold market now seems to be dominated by the U. S. <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc,</b> appreciations or depreciations of that dollar would have strong effects on the price of gold in other currencies. The results of this study are rather different from those obtained in an earlier study of the same subject. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{transmission}} of expansionary U. S. monetary policy in case where developing countries-including China-peg their currencies to the dollar. I evaluate {{the value of the}} dollar peg as a fraction of consumption that households would be willing to pay for the dollar peg to remain as well off under the dollar peg as under a flexible exchange rate. The value of the dollar peg is positive for the <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> because the U. S. can no longer improve its terms of trade at the dollar bloc's expense. This provides a rationale for fixing the exchange rate. If the expenditure switching effect is weak, the peg is harmful to the U. S., providing a rationale for criticism of China's exchange rate policy. ...|$|E

All countries appear to smooth short-term interest rates significantly, with New Zealand and Canada smoothing rates by less than {{what appears to be}} the case for Australia and the United States. We then examine the macroeconomic implications of interest rate smoothing using the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s macro model. The model is constructed such that the more interest rates are smoothed in the short-term, the larger inflation and output variability will be over the cycle. However, at least over the narrow range of the empirically based smoothing approaches, the results suggest that there may be little cost in smoothing short-term interest rates in New Zealand to the degree seen in Australia or the Unite...|$|E
40|$|January 2003 Before {{the crisis}} of 1997 - 98, the East Asian economies—except for Japan but {{including}} China— pegged their currencies to the US dollar. To avoid further turmoil, the IMF now argues that these currencies should float more freely. However, our econometric estimations show that the dollar’s predominant weight in East Asian currency baskets has returned to its pre-crisis levels. By 2002, the day-to-day volatility of each country’s exchange rate against the dollar has again become negligible. In addition, most governments are rapidly accumulating a “war chest” of official dollar reserves, which portends that this exchange rate stabilization will come to extend over months or quarters. From the doctrine of “original sin” applied to emerging-market economies, we argue that this fear of floating is entirely rational {{from the perspective of}} each individual country. And their joint pegging to the dollar benefits the East Asian <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> as a whole, although Japan remains an important outlier. Working Papers Index...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{theoretically}} analyses {{the proposals}} on foreign exchange {{system for the}} East Asia region. We argue that, {{in spite of the}} diversity of the proposals as they appear, they are rooted from two ideologies: the corners hypothesis and the intermediate regime. Taking free capital mobility as primary fact, the Mundell’s Incompatible Trinity would predict that the intermediate regime is not sustainable and that hard pegged exchange rate regimes: yen bloc, <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> and monetary union are feasible options for regional exchange rate stability. We challenge this prediction on two grounds. First, the strict condition in the Mundell’s Incompatible Trinity that forces the country to select macroeconomic goals only at its extreme corner that is perfect capital mobility, complete exchange rate stability, or comprehensive domestic monetary autonomy, may not be applicable in practice. Second, by assuming perfect capital mobility as primary fact, the corners hypothesis limits the country’s sovereignty in freely moving to different corners. The recent global financial crisis increases the possibility that the corner will shift toward the exchange rate stability or domestic monetary independence corners. In such case, the focus on foreign exchange policy may shift to capital controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{potential}} linkages among ASEAN- 5 currencies, in particular the possibility of a Singapore <b>dollar</b> <b>bloc</b> during the pre- and post-crisis periods by using the Johansen multivariate cointegration test and the Granger causality test. Significant nonstationarity and the presence of unit roots were documented for each currency under both study periods. Using ASEAN- 4 exchange rates against the Singapore dollar, the Johansen cointegration test showed that there was no cointegrating relationship during the pre-crisis period. However there were two statistically significant cointegrating vectors among ASEAN exchange rates for the post-crisis period. These findings imply that there is low financial integration before the crisis, but that ASEAN countries are financially more integrated after the crisis. This finding also indicates increasingly role of the Singapore dollar in ASEAN. Therefore, the Singapore dollar may be a possible candidate as the common currency for ASEAN. The analysis is repeated by adding the US dollar to the model. The finding ascertains the influence of the US dollar on ASEAN currencies before the crisis.
