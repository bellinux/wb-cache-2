40|$|Oxidative {{processing}} of aircraft turbine-engine exhaust was studied using a potential aerosol mass (PAM) chamber at different engine loads corresponding to typical flight operations. Measurements were conducted at an engine test cell. Organic gases (OGs) and particle emissions pre/post PAM were measured. A suite of instruments, including a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) for OGs, a multi-gas analyzer for CO, CO 2, NO X, and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) for non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM 1) were used. Total aerosol mass {{was dominated by}} secondary aerosol formation, which was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the primary aerosol. The chemical composition of both gaseous and particle emissions were also monitored at different engine loads and were thrust dependent. At <b>idling</b> <b>load</b> (thrust 2. 5 – 7  %), more than 90  % of the secondary particle mass was organic and {{could be explained by}} the oxidation of gaseous aromatic species/ OGs; e. g. benzene, toluene, xylenes, tri-, tetra-, and pentamethyl-benzene and naphthalene. The oxygenated-aromatics, e. g. phenol, furans, were also included in this aromatic fraction and their oxidation could alone explain up to 25  % of the secondary organic particle mass at <b>idling</b> <b>loads.</b> The organic fraction decreased with thrust level, while the inorganic fraction increased.

50|$|Laptops rely on {{extremely}} compact cooling systems {{involving a}} fan and heat sink that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops {{do not have}} any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at <b>idle</b> <b>load</b> levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD).|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) combustion is a new combustion principle in internal combustion engines which has in recent years attracted increased attention. In CAI combustion, which combines features of spark ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) principles, air/fuel mixture is premixed, as in SI combustion and auto-ignited by piston compression as in CI combustion. Ignition is provided in multiple points, and thus the charge gives a simultaneous energy release. This results in uniform and simultaneous auto-ignition and chemical reaction throughout the whole charge without flame propagation. CAI combustion {{is controlled by the}} chemical kinetics of air/fuel mixture with no influence of turbulence. The CAI engine offers benefits in comparison to spark ignited and compression ignited engines in higher efficiency due to elimination of throttling losses at part and <b>idle</b> <b>loads.</b> There is a possibility to use high compression ratios since it is not knock limited, and in significant lower NOx emission (≈ 90...|$|R

40|$|Possibilities {{for using}} {{straight}} vegetable oil (SVO) from Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (camelina or false flax) and its mixtures with Brassica napus (rape) SVO as fuel in adapted diesel engines are described with chemical parameters, measurements {{in a test}} engine and a field test in a tractor. Camelina as a crop is attracting attention in organic farming and is often used in mixed cropping systems with low competition to food production area. Camelina SVO has low oxidation stability. Its polymerization affinity limits the storage time and {{increase the risk of}} coking at hot motor components and of thickening processes in the lubricant oil of the engine. In mixtures with rape and camelina SVO, threshold limits for Conradson Carbon Residues and for oxidation resistance were exceeded. The oxidation resistance could be prolonged by the addition of commercial antioxidants. Camelina and rape SVO showed very similar burning characteristics at full-to-medium partial engine loads. Under low partial loads and <b>idle</b> <b>load,</b> the burning function of the various fuels was increasingly delayed, beginning with diesel fuel over pure rape SVO, then a mixture containing 700 dm 3 m! 3 rape SVO, and 300 dm 3 m! 3 camelina SVO, through to pure camelina SVO. The exhaust emissions of NOx-, CO-, particles and HC of rape SVO, camelina SVO and their described mixture were not significantly different. The typically higher NOx- and lower HC-emissions of SVO compared to diesel fuel were apparent. The results principally reveal the usability of a cold pressed, non-refined camelina-rape SVO mixture in adapted diesel engines...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the principal features of Omnivore, a spark-ignition-based research engine designed {{to investigate the}} possibility of true wide-range HCCI operation {{on a variety of}} fossil and renewable liquid fuels. The engine project is part-funded jointly by the United Kingdom's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Department of the Environment of Northern Ireland (DoENI). The engineering team includes Lotus Engineering, Jaguar Cars, Orbital Corporation and Queen's University Belfast. The research engine so far constructed is of a typical automotive cylinder capacity and operates on an externally scavenged version of the two-port Day 2 -stroke cycle, utilising both a variable charge trapping mechanism to control both trapped charge and residual concentration and a wide-range variable compression ratio (VCR) mechanism in the cylinder head. This approach permits individual control of retained and compression heat as separate inputs to the ATAC combustion process (now commonly referred to as HCCI), an ideal situation which is not possible when attempting to operate a traditional fixed compression ratio, variable valve timing 4 -stroke engine in HCCI combustion. The ease of application of the VCR system due to the elimination of poppet valves for gas exchange is fundamental to the concept and this feature is discussed in detail, together with the very wide range of compression ratios that the chosen solution permits (from 10 : 1 to 40 : 1 in this initial configuration). In addition to describing the engine and its technologies, test results from its initial operation on 98 RON gasoline are presented, including stable operation at <b>idle</b> <b>load</b> and 450 rpm in true HCCI (i. e. without spark assistance) ...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory-based {{studies have}} shown that {{combustion}} sources emit volatile organic compounds that can be photo-oxidized in the atmosphere to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In some cases, this SOA can exceed direct emissions of primary organic aerosol (POA). Jathar et al. (2017) recently reported on experiments that used an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) to measure the photochemical production of SOA from a diesel engine operated at two different engine loads (<b>idle,</b> <b>load),</b> two fuel types (diesel, biodiesel) and two aftertreatment configurations (with and without an oxidation catalyst and particle filter). In this work, we used two different SOA models, the volatility basis set (VBS) model and the statistical oxidation model (SOM), to simulate the formation and composition of SOA for those experiments. Leveraging recent laboratory-based parameterizations, both frameworks accounted for a semi-volatile and reactive POA; SOA production from semi-volatile, intermediate-volatility and volatile organic compounds (SVOC, IVOC and VOC); multigenerational gas-phase chemistry; and kinetic gas/particle partitioning. Both frameworks demonstrated that for model predictions of SOA mass to agree with measurements across all engine load-fuel-aftertreatment combinations, it was necessary to model the kinetically-limited gas-particle partitioning in OFRs as well as account for SOA formation from IVOCs, which were found to account for more than 90  % of the model-predicted SOA. Accounting for IVOCs however resulted in an underprediction of a factor of two for OA atomic O : C ratios. Model predictions of the gas-phase organic compounds (resolved in carbon and oxygen space) from the SOM compared favorably to gas-phase measurements from a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), substantiating the semi-explicit chemistry captured by the SOM. Model-measurement comparisons were improved on using vapor wall-loss corrected SOA parameterizations. As OFRs are increasingly used to study SOA formation and evolution in laboratory and field environments, models such as those developed in this work can be used to interpret the OFR data...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{focus on}} Pt {{degradation}} occurring during {{fuel cell vehicle}} (FCV) combined drive cycles involving load and open circuit voltage (OCV) just after startup and during <b>idling.</b> <b>Load</b> cycle durability is evaluated {{as a function of}} OCV/load holding time, load rate and relative humidity (RH) with a graphitized carbon black-supported platinum catalyst (Pt/GCB) in the cathode. The degradation of Pt/GCB is suppressed for shorter OCV holding times, lower load rates and lower RH. Scanning ion microscopy (SIM) images of membrane cross-sections indicate that the amount of Pt deposited in the membrane decreases during drive cycles involving load with short OCV holding times. Investigations of the Pt distribution in the cathode catalyst layer (CL) by using scanning TEM-EDX show that the dissolution of Pt is suppressed on the membrane side in the CL. The Pt dissolution is accelerated by the high Pt oxidation due to the long OCV holding time. A load cycle with both long OCV holding time and low load inhibits the Pt 2 + migration into the membrane but accelerates the Pt particle growth due to electrochemical Ostwald ripening; meanwhile, a load cycle with long OCV holding time at lower RH prevents both the Pt dissolution and particle growth...|$|R

40|$|With {{new energy}} {{directives}} in place, the Swedish Social Service (SSS) stands before the challenge {{how to reduce}} the energy demand in its locales. It is a complex matter, as the locales are rented from various property owners {{and it becomes a}} question of how to reduce the operational electricity and influence the property owners to work more with energy efficiency. This thesis takes a balanced research approach in three parts. Firstly a qualitative part in form of interviews with personnel at the SSS and its property owners, secondly a quantitative part of descriptive nature in form of energy statistics and thirdly a literature review of Energy Management (EM) Supply Chain Management(SCM), Green Supply Chain Management(GSCM) and Enviromental Performance Indicators (EPI). This {{in order to be able}} to give normative recommendations of how the SSS should act to reduce its energy consumption in its locales and provide new insights on how EM, SCM, GSCM and EPI can be applied in effect. The results show that the Swedish Social Service should act in the following areas to control its energy efficiency: statistics and follow-up, locale strategy and operational electricity. To get efficient statistical material the SSS should update their registers of property owners, update guidelines for energy statistics reporting and continue with the same collection method for data (e-mail survey) to get continuity. The literature review and interviews show that a segmentation of suppliers (property owners) based on factors like area in property, good relations, area of local and energy performance indicators should be useful as to know how to distribute resources to enable energy efficiency. Finally, the study shows that various locales has high rates of <b>idling</b> <b>loads</b> and have a energy saving potential of 10 - 15 %...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations {{of diesel}} {{particulate}} matter and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in platinum mine environments {{are likely to be}} higher than in ambient air due to the use of diesel machinery in confined environments. Airborne PAHs may be present in gaseous or particle phases each of which has different human health impacts due to their ultimate fate in the body. Here we report on the simultaneous sampling of both phases of airborne PAHs {{for the first time in}} underground platinum mines in South Africa, which was made possible by employing small, portable denuder sampling devices consisting of two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) multi-channel traps connected in series separated by a quartz fibre filter, which only require small, battery operated portable personal sampling pumps for air sampling. Thermal desorption coupled with comprehensive gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC × GC–TofMS) was used to analyse denuder samples taken in three different platinum mines. The samples from a range of underground environments revealed that PAHs were predominantly found in the gas phase with naphthalene and mono-methylated naphthalene derivatives being detected at the highest concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 18 μg m− 3. The particle bound PAHs were found in the highest concentrations at the <b>idling</b> <b>load</b> haul dump vehicle exhausts with a dominance of fluoranthene and pyrene. Particle associated PAH concentrations ranged from 0. 47 to 260 ng m− 3 and included benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene.
