25|$|As {{illustrated}} in the state report referenced in the previous sentence, the price of insurance that covered about 600,000 people in the small group market (about 10% of the population) was rising faster than the prices {{for the vast majority}} of the non-senior-citizen population, most of which were – and still are – covered by self-insured <b>group</b> <b>insurance</b> from large employers (self-insured plans are not subject to state regulation).|$|E

The reforms of the war period were defended as best they were able {{by the board of}} directors through traveling inspectors, although these did not retain the same sort of authority wielded by the officer-organizers of the military during wartime.

25|$|Despite these successes, her {{brilliant}} {{career was}} fading. She lost {{tens of thousands}} in jewelry and cash in a robbery, and she had difficulties with the IRS. Her health suffered, and she worked only sporadically in the following years. In 1950–51 she wrote her autobiography His Eye Is on the Sparrow with Charles Samuels, in which she wrote candidly about her life. She explained why her age had often been misstated: her friends had to sign a paper claiming Waters was four years younger than she was to get a <b>group</b> <b>insurance</b> deal; she stated that {{she was born in}} 1900. His Eye Is on the Sparrow was adapted for a stage production in which she was portrayed by Ernestine Jackson. In her second autobiography, To Me, It's Wonderful, Waters stated that she was born in 1896.|$|E
25|$|The statute {{expanded}} MassHealth (Medicaid and SCHIP) {{coverage for}} children of low income parents and restores MassHealth benefits like dental care and eyeglasses. The legislation included a merger of the individual (non-group) insurance market into the small group market to allow individuals to get lower <b>group</b> <b>insurance</b> rates. The process of merging the two markets also froze the market for such insurance {{for a short period}} in April–May 2010 as the current government tried to keep the leading non-profit insurers, which insure over 90% of the residents, in the state from raising premiums for small businesses and individuals. Eventually the state's non-partisan insurance board ruled that the government did not have the actuarial data or right to freeze the premiums. Five of the non-profit insurers then settled for slightly lower premium increases than they had initially requested rather than litigate further. The sixth litigated and won the right to implement all its original increases retroactively. Payment rates were supposed to be increased to hospitals and physicians under the statute but that has not happened. The statute also formed a Health Care Quality and Cost Council to issue quality standards and publicize provider performance.|$|E
