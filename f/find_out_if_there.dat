500|$|Director John Woo has {{described}} The Killer as being about [...] "honour and friendship", [...] "trying to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is something common between two people" [...] {{and as a}} [...] "romantic poem". The structure of the film follows two men {{on opposite sides of}} the law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine. Woo recalled [...] "When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, but deep in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that." [...] Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo's film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating [...] "People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege. It's certainly not intentional." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{waiting for}} equipment, the divers began {{knocking}} {{the bottom of}} the pusher to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was anyone trapped inside the capsized vessel and shortly afterwards established contact with the chief engineer and the chief officer. Shouting through the bottom, the divers told the trapped crew members that they were attempting to dive into the engine room from outside, after which those inside asked if it was possible to cut a hole to the bottom. When they were told that the rescuers were not sure yet if it was safe, the crewmen informed the divers that they were not in immediate danger although the air was becoming hard to breadth due to oil fumes. After diving inside the vessel was deemed to be impossible due to the heavy seas and the slight movement between the pusher and the barge indicated that the vessel was grounded and thus not in danger of sinking, it was decided to make a hole to the bottom to rescue the trapped crew members.|$|E

Lastly we looked at what factors influences git users choice of user interface and how?. We have collected data through three interviews and a survey, which yielded approximately 370 responses. Based on our results we’ve found that the command-line interface is the more popular user interface, in general, amongst Git users. We’ve also found that most users stop using graphical user inter- faces, as their primary user interface, as they get more experience with Git. They usually change their primary user interface to a command- line interface or start using both the graphical user interface and the command-line interface together.

2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> (<b>if</b> <b>there's</b> a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them.

One way to protect the ownership of a digital image is to secretly embed data {{in the content of}} the image identifying the owner. In particular we will describe how one can use watermarking to hide information in a digital image. Multiple watermarking is used for embedding multiple watermarks into the host single to provide authentication without bearing on the optical quality of the image. Some digital watermarking techniques ensure the host-signal noise while associating the watermark in chronological sequence on experienced image data. Our aim is to embed an watermark which contains information into an edge image and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> will be any attack on images such as. jpeg then the information embedded in an image will not be change that is the attack will survive on such images...|$|R
40|$|Migration {{of people}} {{from one place to}} another in {{countries}} of the world in search of better conditions of living predates history. It ignited western societies’ contact with Africa and the rest of the world. Prior the contact, agriculture was the main stay of Africa’s economy. Thus, the movement of farmers from one location to another in search of fertile grounds for cultivation was in vogue. After independence in Nigeria, cattle rearers are known for relocating from the North to South during dry season in search of green grass to sustain their cattle and occupation. In the present day Nigeria, the same scenario still abounds but in a new dimension. It now involves movement of highly skilled manpower from the country to developed societies. Among other things, this paper <b>finds</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a relationship between poor leadership of the country and escalation of brain drain. Simple percentage and ranking method was used to analyze the study’s data. Chi-square was used to test its hypothesis. Our result revealed a relationship between poor leadership of the country and brain drain. It equally indicated that students are interested in travelling out of the country to developed societies after their study. Also from the study, twelve causes of brain drain were indentified. Some of them are: mass unemployment, poor salaries and conditions of service, mass poverty, crises-religious, communal, political, education etc. In respect of effects of brain drain on the nation’s economy, eleven factors were identified by the respondents. Some of them are: loss of human capital assets to man various institutions in the country, loss of tax of migrated manpower to foreign countries, loss of capital invested in education of migrated manpower assets etc. Finally, eleven solutions were profiled to the lingering problem of brain drain. The most important ones are: Good leadership, salary and conditions of service as well as rewarding system for diligent staff, mass employment etc...|$|R
