25|$|Signal {{transduction}} by a GPCR {{begins with}} an inactive G protein coupled to the receptor; the G protein exists as a heterotrimer consisting of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. Once the GPCR recognizes a ligand, the conformation of the receptor changes to activate the G protein, causing Gα to bind a molecule of GTP and dissociate from the other two G-protein subunits. The dissociation exposes sites on the subunits that can interact with other molecules. The activated G protein subunits detach from the receptor and initiate signaling from many downstream effector proteins such as phospholipases and ion channels, the latter permitting the release of second messenger molecules.

One unique property of GluN 1 /GluN 2 D NMDA receptors is an unusually prolonged <b>deactivation</b> <b>time</b> course following the removal of L-glutamate.

Crystal structures of the isolated GluN 2 D LBD in complex with various ligands reveal that the binding of L-glutamate induces a unique conformation at the backside of the ligand-binding site in proximity to the region at which the transmembrane domain would be located in the intact receptors.

40|$|Abstract. The {{demand for}} {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) {{actuators}} for technical applications is steadily increasing; however SMA may have poor <b>deactivation</b> <b>time</b> due to relatively slow convective cooling. Convection heat transfer mechanism plays {{a critical role in}} the cooling process, where an increase of air circulation around the SMA actuator(i. e. forced convection) provides a significant improvement in <b>deactivation</b> <b>time</b> compared to the natural convection condition. The rate of convective heat transfer, either natural or forced, is measured by the convection heat transfer coefficient, which may be difficult to predict theoretically due to the numerous dependent variables. In this work, a study of free convective cooling of linear SMAactuators was conducted under various ambient temperatures to experimentally determine the convective heat transfer coefficient. A finite difference equation (FDE) was developed to simulate SMA response, and calibrated with the experimental data to obtain the unknown convectiveheat transfer coefficient, h. These coefficients are then compared with the available theoretical equations, and it was found that Eisakhaniet. almodel provides good agreement with the Experiment-FDE calibrated results. Therefore, FDE is reasonably useful to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient of SMA actuator experiments under various conditions, with a few identified limitations (e. g. exclusion of other associative heat transfer factors) ...|$|E

50|$|In a {{standard}} game {{it is possible}} to shoot and deactivate enemy players, but not team mates. Each player has an unlimited number of shots to fire and there is no limit on the number of times the player can be deactivated. Each time a player shoots another player they receive a number of points, depending on which sensor they shot at, and the player who was shot loses a smaller number of points. (Rules have recently been changed - no points lost for being shot). Solo games function by similar rules, with two noted exceptions: Players are able to tag all bases for points, and that the friendly fire condition in Team games has been disabled, allowing players to freely tag each other with no restrictions. Both forms of the standard game can be variated with a 'fast mode', in which <b>deactivation</b> <b>times</b> are halved and fire rates increased.

(some col.) Background and significance: Shoulder impingement {{is a common}} shoulder pathology which is associated with changes in kinematics and muscle activity around the shoulder joint. The changes in muscle activity are theorized {{to be caused by}} changes in motor program strategies controlling the smooth and coordinated movements at the joints. Changes in muscle latencies, especially feed forward contractions, indicate alterations in these motor control programs. The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess for differences in the latencies and <b>deactivation</b> <b>times</b> of scapular muscles between subjects with and without shoulder impingement. Research Methods: Twenty five healthy subjects and 24 subjects with impingement were recruited. Scapulothoracic and glenohumeral kinematic data were collected using an electromagnetic system. Simultaneously myoelectric activities using surface electrodes from upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and anterior fibers of deltoid were collected as subjects raised and lowered their arm in response to a light cue. Data was collected during unloaded, loaded and after performing repetitive arm raising motion conditions. Analysis: The ratios of the number of feedforward contractions during trials were compared by chi square analysis across groups and conditions. The other variables were analyzed using 2 or 3 way mixed model ANOVAs. Results: The percentage of trials showing feed forward contractions was higher for upper trapezius and lower trapezius in the unloaded condition and lower for serratus anterior in the condition after repetitive motion for the subjects with impingement as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with impingement also demonstrated significantly earlier contraction of upper trapezius and an earlier deactivation of serratus anterior during lowering of the arm as compared to the healthy subjects. All subjects exhibited an earlier activation and delayed deactivation of lower trapezius and serratus anterior in conditions with a weight held in hand. The study found decreased scapular upward rotation, decreased posterior tilt and a less anterior plane of elevation in combination in subjects with impingement using logistic regression analysis. No significant group differences were found for muscle activity as a percentage of the reference contraction. Discussion and conclusions: The subjects with impingement showed some significant differences for muscle activation and <b>deactivation</b> <b>times</b> to indicate differences in motor control strategies.

These channels exhibited two activity modes, spike-like (SL) and multiconductance (MC), displaying different polymodal activation. In the absence of mechanical stimulation, internal perfusion of excised patches with ATP induced robust and reversible activation of the MC but not of the SL mode. The ATP effect on channel activity was dose-dependent within a range of 1  μM– 1  mM and was induced at different values of intracellular pH and Ca 2 +. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, ATP without Mg 2 + or ADP also effectively enhanced MC activity. Adenosine mimicked the effect of its nucleotides. At negative membrane potentials, both ATP and adenosine activated the channel. Moreover, ATP but not adenosine induced a flickering block. Addition of cAMP during maximal ATP activation completely and reversibly inhibited the channel, with activation and <b>deactivation</b> <b>times</b> of minutes.

All members of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) /Degenerin (Deg) channel superfamily contain an absolutely conserved Trp {{at the base of}} their first transmembrane domain. Here, we test the importance of this conserved Trp to ENaC/Deg function. Targeted substitution of this Trp in mouse ENaC and rat ASIC subunits decrease channel activity. Differential substitution with distinct amino acids in α-mENaC shows that it is loss of this critical Trp rather than introduction of residues having novel properties that changes channel activity. Surprisingly, Trp substitution unmasks voltage sensitivity. Mutant ENaC has increased steady-state activity at hyperpolarizing compared with depolarizing potentials associated with transient activation and <b>deactivation</b> <b>times,</b> respectively. The times of activation and deactivation change 1 ms/mV in a linear manner with rising and decreasing slopes, respectively. Increases in macroscopic currents at hyperpolarizing potentials results from a voltage-dependent increase in open probability. Voltage sensitivity is not influenced by divalent cations; however, it is Na+-dependent with a 63 -mV decrease in voltage required to reach half-maximal activity per log increase in [Na+]. Mutant channels are particularly sensitive to intracellular [Na+] for removing this sodium abolishes voltage dependence.

The subunit composition of recombinant GABAA receptors (GABAARs) strongly affects the deactivation kinetics of GABA-evoked currents. However, for GABAergic synapses, the relationship between subunit composition and IPSC decay is less clear. Here we addressed this by combining whole-cell recordings of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) and quantitative immunolocalization of synaptic GABAAR subunits. In cerebellar stellate, thalamic relay, and main olfactory bulb (MOB) deep short-axon cells of Wistar rats, the only synaptic α subunit was α 1, and zolpidem-sensitive mIPSCs had weighted decay time constants (τw) of 4 - 6 ms. Nucleus reticularis thalami neurons expressed only α 3 as the synaptic α subunit and exhibited slow (τw = 28 ms), zolpidem-insensitive mIPSCs. By contrast, MOB external tufted cells contained two α subunit types (α 1 and α 3) at their synapses. Quantitative analysis of multiple immunolabeled images revealed small within-cell, but large between-cell, variability in synaptic α 1 /α 3 ratios. This corresponded to large cell-to-cell variability in the decay (τw = 3 - 30 ms) and zolpidem sensitivity of mIPSCs. Currents evoked by rapid application of GABA to patches excised from HEK cells expressing different mixtures of α 1 and α 3 subunits displayed highly variable <b>deactivation</b> <b>times</b> that correlated with the α 1 /α 3 cDNA ratio. Our results demonstrate that diversity in the decay of IPSCs can be generated by varying the expression of different GABAAR subunits that alone confer different decay kinetics, allowing {{the time course of}} inhibition to be tuned to individual cellular requirements. © 2010 the authors...|$|R
