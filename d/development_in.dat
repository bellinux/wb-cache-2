At a constant crash rate, an increase in mobility results in a larger number of road traffic crashes and a decrease in mobility results <b>in</b> fewer crashes. <b>Developments</b> <b>in</b> mobility may, however, also lead to changes in the crash rate. This exploration looks at the general <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> mobility and the factors of influence, as well as at <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> mobility that result in changes in the (average) crash rate.
