50|$|The unique {{architecture}} of the retina and its relatively immune-privileged environment help this process. Tight junctions that form the blood retinal barrier separate the subretinal space from the blood supply, thus protecting it from microbes and most <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>damage,</b> and enhancing its potential to respond to vector-mediated therapies. The highly compartmentalized anatomy of the eye facilitates accurate delivery of therapeutic vector suspensions to specific tissues under direct visualization using microsurgical techniques. In the sheltered environment of the retina, AAV vectors are able to maintain high levels of transgene expression in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, or ganglion cells {{for long periods of}} time after a single treatment. In addition, the eye and the visual system can be routinely and easily monitored for visual function and retinal structural changes after injections with noninvasive advanced technology, such as visual acuities, contrast sensitivity, fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF), dark-adapted visual thresholds, vascular diameters, pupillometry, electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG and optical coherence tomography (OCT).|$|E

This study analysed the different patterns of tissue damage, particularly in the brain, of fetuses with documented CMV infection. We studied 45 fetuses at 20 - 21 weeks of gestation with congenital CMV infection documented by invasive positive prenatal diagnosis. At the time of amniocentesis, abnormal ultrasound findings had been recorded for 13 of the 45 fetuses (29 %). Histological and immunohistochemical characterization {{was performed on the}} placenta, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. The different degrees of brain damage were correlated with tissue viral load, inflammatory response, placental functionality, and extramedullary haematopoiesis. Even though a high CMV load was detected in all amniotic fluids, brain infection occurred in only 62 % of the fetuses and with different degrees of severity. Tissues with a low viral load showed a globally weak inflammatory response, and fetuses had only mild brain damage, whereas tissues with a high CMV load showed prominent infiltration of the activated cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes responsible for <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>damage.</b> Furthermore, severe placental infection was associated with diffuse villitis and necrosis, consistent with functional impairment and possible consequent hypoxic cerebral damage.

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{cells secrete}} {{perforin}} to kill virus-infected cells. In {{this study we}} show that perforin also {{plays a role in}} immune regulation. Perforin-deficient (perf −/−) mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) contained greater numbers of antiviral T cells compared to persistently infected +/+ mice. The enhanced expansion was seen in both CD 4 and CD 8 T cells, but the most striking difference was in the numbers of LCMV-specific CD 8 T cells present in infected perf −/− mice. Persistent LCMV infection of +/+ mice results in both deletion and anergy of antigen-specific CD 8 T cells, and our results show that this peripheral “exhaustion” of activated CD 8 T cells occurred less efficiently in perf −/− mice. This excessive accumulation of activated CD 8 T cells resulted in <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>damage</b> in persistently infected perf −/− mice; ∼ 50 % of these mice died within 2 to 4 weeks, and mortality was fully reversed by in vivo depletion of CD 8 T cells. This finding highlights an interesting dichotomy between the role of perforin in viral clearance and immunopathology; perforin-deficient CD 8 T cells were unable to clear the LCMV infection but were capable of causing <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>damage.</b> Finally, this study shows that perforin also plays a role in regulating T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. Mice that were deficient in both perforin and Fas exhibited a striking acceleration of the spontaneous lymphoproliferative disease seen in Fas-deficient (lpr) mice. Taken together, these results show that the perforin-mediated pathway is involved in downregulating T-cell responses during chronic viral infection and autoimmunity and that perforin and Fas act independently as negative regulators of activated T cells...|$|E

Moreover we hypothesise that the favourable outcome in our patient, better than the most of autoimmune hepatitis cases, may be related either to the moderate necroinflammatory activity and to the low level of fibrosis at the beginning of the disease or to the role of EBV as a trigger of autoimmune hepatitis. The hypothesis that EBV-related autoimmune hepatitis could have a more favourable prognosis than the most of autoimmune hepatitis cases in general need to be confirmed on a larger series of studies...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is {{the prototype}} {{of a family of}} small DNA viruses that productively infect hepatocytes, the major cell of the liver, and replicate by reverse transcription of a terminally redundant viral RNA, the pregenome. Upon infection, the circular, partially double-stranded virion DNA is converted in the nucleus to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that assembles into a minichromosome, the template for viral mRNA synthesis. Infection of hepatocytes is non-cytopathic. Infection of the liver may be either transient (< 6 months) or chronic and lifelong, depending on the ability of the host immune response to clear the infection. Chronic infections can cause <b>immune-mediated</b> liver <b>damage</b> progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanisms of carcinogenesis are unclear.

It is unknown what effect such host signals have on the quality or duration of the immune response to viruses. In this study, we uncovered an immune-regulatory pathway that tempers the intensity of the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We found that host-derived DNA accumulates in the lung microenvironment during IAV infection. Ablation of DNA in the lung resulted in increased mortality, increased cellular recruitment, and increased inflammation following IAV challenge. The released DNA, in turn, was sensed by the DNA receptor absent in melanoma 2. Aim 2 (-/-) mice showed similarly exaggerated immune responses to IAV.
