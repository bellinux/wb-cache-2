5|$|From hot springs, {{geothermal}} energy {{has been used}} for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space <b>heating</b> since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for electricity generation. Worldwide, 11,700 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power is online in 2013. An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal <b>heating</b> capacity is installed for district <b>heating,</b> space <b>heating,</b> spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to tidal <b>heating,</b> {{the interior of}} Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic <b>heating)</b> within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic <b>heating</b> alone, thus implying that tidal <b>heating</b> has {{a leading role in}} Europa.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{temperature}} sources {{produce the}} energy equivalent of 100M BBL per year. Sources with temperatures of 30–150°C are used without conversion to electricity as district <b>heating,</b> greenhouses, fisheries, mineral recovery, industrial process <b>heating</b> and bathing in 75 countries. Heat pumps extract energy from shallow sources at 10–20°C in 43 countries {{for use in}} space <b>heating</b> and cooling. Home <b>heating</b> is the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy, with global annual growth rate of 30% in 2005 and 20% in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule <b>heating</b> effect {{employed in}} filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric <b>heating.</b> While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric <b>heating</b> in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for <b>heating</b> and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for <b>heating</b> and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for <b>heating</b> by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired <b>heating</b> plants and the year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district <b>heating</b> system.|$|E

5|$|Commercial solar {{water heaters}} began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s.

As with photovoltaics, solar water <b>heating</b> attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water <b>heating</b> sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.

5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} <b>heating</b> mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare <b>heating</b> mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} <b>heating</b> systems contain {{pumps and}} compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric <b>heating.</b> However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of geothermal <b>heating</b> may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal <b>heating</b> applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal <b>heating</b> produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal <b>heating,</b> which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional <b>heating</b> in its interior. Without this tidal <b>heating,</b> Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E

5|$|<b>Heating</b> is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric <b>heating.</b> Heat pumps can be used for space <b>heating</b> essentially anywhere.|$|E
