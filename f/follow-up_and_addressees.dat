Following previous work, we attempt to classify instances as generic or referential, and in the latter case identify the singular or plural addressee. We show that accuracy and robustness can be improved by use of simple lexical features, capturing the intuition that different uses <b>and</b> <b>addressees</b> are associated with different vocabularies; and we show that there is an advantage to treating referentiality <b>and</b> <b>addressee</b> identification as separate (but connected) problems. ...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 9981 This study {{investigates the}} use of terms of address in extra-territorial {{languages}} and determines how terms of address function in language to encode relationships. In addition, this study examines how the relationship between speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee</b> influences choice of address forms in Colombian Spanish. Finally, the hypothesis put forward by this study proposes that {{the influence of the}} relationship between speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee</b> supersedes the influence of personal characteristics of speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee,</b> such as gender, age and social class. The study begins by outlining three predicted outcomes for extra-territorial languages: i) colonial lag; the retention of linguistic features by the extra-territorial varieties of language which have fallen out of use in the variety of language used in the metropolis, ii) dialect mixing due to contact with regional dialects and iii) language variation due contact with other languages in the new territory. In addition, this study discusses Mufwene?s (2001) Founder Principle and the influence of the Founder Population on the development of new varieties of language. Mufwene proposes that the first settlers in a new territory demonstrate the strongest influence on the new variety of language which emerges...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the speech act «offer» in French in the light of some {{assumptions}} proposed by Brown and Levinson in their theory of linguistic politeness. In order to do so, we analyse the effects of several linguistic formulations over the four faces that come into play in the interaction (the speaker's positive and negative face, <b>and</b> the <b>addressee's</b> positive <b>and</b> negative face). Although the speech act «offer» is defined both as a threatening act of the speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee's</b> face <b>and</b> a flattering act of the speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee's</b> face, the linguistic formulations bound lo carry out the act do not bring these relations into play similarly or with the same intensity. We conclude that offering in French implies threatening the other's territory and that the linguistic strategies routinized tend to minimize that threatening effect.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} diminutives, a subclass of softeners, in Romanian conversational discourse as positive politeness devices for avoiding disagreement. Like many other pragmatic particles softeners are multifunctional. In addition to mitigating the imposition of face-threatening acts, softeners (diminutives being no exception) tend to serve another equally important interactional function: that of expressing shared knowledge thereby offering the addressee the opportunity to provide support and understanding, i. e., to show that both speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee</b> {{are on the same}} wavelength. By inviting shared knowledge between speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee</b> softeners become instrumental in avoiding disagreement. The function served by diminutives in the excerpts analysed in this paper is to stress the emotional bond among the participants in the interaction, rather than being intended as purely descriptive items that indicate the smallness of the referent. These affective connotations thus shift from applying to one lexical item to applying to the whole conversational encounter, which turns them into markers of small talk...|$|R
40|$|Do interlocutors {{interpret}} {{language as}} though they were “in the shoes of” the speaker? People can interpret utterances describing actions from an internal perspective ({{as though they}} are performing the action), or from an external perspective (as though they are observing the action). In Experiment 1, the speaker produced sentences such as I am cutting the tomato, <b>and</b> the <b>addressee</b> matched these sentences against pictures taking internal or external perspectives to the action. The addressee tended to take an external perspective on sentences involving I and an internal perspective to sentences involving you, irrespective of whether the interlocutors were adjacent to or opposite each other. In Experiment 2, the interlocutors alternated between acting as speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>addressee</b> tended to take an internal perspective for sentences involving I and an external perspective for sentences involving you; we also assessed the perspective that the speaker adopted. The results argue against a simple simulation account, and also against an account in which the comprehender adopts a perspective that straightforwardly accords with the meaning of the sentence. Instead, the comprehender appeared to take a complementary perspective to the speaker, perhaps to retain independence from the speaker...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{presenting}} some characteristics of pragmatic functions in textual realizations of the speech genre "Oath" and describes peculiarities and language means of the identifying, performative, inspirational, declarative, integrative functions including. The author considers the pragmatic functions as the constructive realizations of such components of speech genre "Oath" as: con-situation, semantic context, presupposition, speech. It is proved that the general presupposition of the addresser <b>and</b> <b>addressees</b> induces the general semantic meanings of con-situation of the oath, especially inspiration, solemnity, officiality, {{the importance of the}} events and the general value of the oath for society. In Russian and English linguistic cultures the tradition of taking the oath presupposes following certain standards and norms like a solemn situation, presence of some attributes, the addresser's demonstration of the opinion to future actions in his new position. The author pays special attention to description of performatives in accordance with their division into informative and verifying ones. The article shows similarity in the functions of professional oaths, which are connected with a position of the addresser <b>and</b> <b>addressees</b> <b>and</b> the communicative purpose of taking the oath, that is presented in such institutional discourse types as medical, political, military, pedagogical, legal and sport ones...|$|R

40|$|When people {{communicate}} {{in their native}} languages using machine translation, they face various problems in constructing common ground. This study investigates the difficulties of constructing common ground when multiparty groups (consisting {{of more than two}} language communities) communicate using machine translation. We compose triads whose members come from three different language communities—China, Korea, and Japan—and compare their referential communication under two conditions: in their shared second language (English) and in their native languages using machine translation. Consequently, our study suggests the importance of not only grounding between speaker <b>and</b> <b>addressee</b> but also grounding between addressees in constructing effective machine-translation-mediated communication. Furthermore, to successfully build common ground between addressees, it seems important for {{them to be able to}} monitor what is going on between a speaker <b>and</b> other <b>addressees...</b>|$|R
