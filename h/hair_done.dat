5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
25|$|The couple {{returned}} to Colorado, where they took up permanent residence in a Denver mansion. Baby Doe was snubbed by Denver socialites, from whom she received neither visits nor invitations. Although {{she did not}} join charities or clubs, as was customary during that period for wealthy women, she was generous with her money, donating funds to various charities, and providing free offices to the Colorado suffragette movement. To keep herself busy, she shopped, bought jewelry and clothing, had her <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> and continued with the hobby of scrapbooking she had taken up when living in Central City.|$|E
25|$|After {{six months}} {{residency}} at Pinocchios, Spry started booking The Flies into Sydney {{where they were}} arrested for vagrancy for having hair over their shoulders, but it was great publicity making all the papers. Back in Melbourne, Spry employed Carole West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> at a women's hair salon in South Yarra. During the shoot, Burns sang with his guitar and was joined by apprentice hairdresser Lynne Randell – who was promptly signed by Spry and managed by West. In January 1965, they supported The Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison on their first Australian tour.|$|E

During the {{animated}} titles, Dick and Dom are {{in bed and}} the hands from the logo wake them up, get out of bed, brush Dick and Dom's teeth, get their <b>hair</b> <b>done,</b> get them to the toilet and get them in the lift. At the beginning of every episode, after the titles had aired, a prerecorded segment was played in which the presenters emerged from the lift in the studio in a costume (e.g. Aeroplanes) whilst a song relating to the costume was played. Dick and Dom then {{walked back into the}} lift. The doors closed and the show then switched to live broadcast, with Dick and Dom reemerging from the lift in casual clothes and quickly starting the show.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, a woman {{residing}} in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive {{due to an}} asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> and makeup on. That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes." [...] The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly [...] "New TV Classics" [...] list, and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the Internet Movie Database (2002–2012).|$|E
500|$|McCartney's {{first serious}} girlfriend in Liverpool was {{seventeen}} year old Dorothy [...] "Dot" [...] Rhone (a bank clerk or a cashier at a chemist's, according to varying accounts), {{whom he had}} met at The Casbah Club in 1959. McCartney picked out the clothes he liked Rhone to wear and told her which make up to use, also paying {{for her to have}} her blonde <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> in the style of Brigitte Bardot, whom both he and John Lennon idolised. He disliked Rhone seeing her friends, and stopped her from smoking, even though he did so himself. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with The Beatles he wrote regular letters to Rhone, and she accompanied Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when the group played there again in 1962. According to Rhone, McCartney bought her a gold ring in Hamburg, a leather skirt, took her sightseeing, and was very attentive and caring. For the time Rhone was there, the couple lived in a bungalow by the Hamburg docks that belonged to Rosa, a former cleaner at the Indra club. McCartney admitted that he had other girlfriends in Hamburg when Rhone was in Liverpool, admitting that they were usually strippers, who knew a lot more about sex than Liverpool girls.|$|E

500|$|Willoughby's {{wardrobe}} {{was designed}} to reflect his [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "fashionable" [...] nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor." ...|$|E

In July 2008, she was permitted to leave her hospital ward under armed guard to visit a beauty salon located within the hospital grounds to have her <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> and for a pedicure. While {{she was at the}} salon, word of her presence got out and, upon leaving the salon, Corby was faced with a large number of reporters. She attempted to hide her face as she left the salon and her doctor stated that her condition was [...] "back to zero" [...] and that additional treatment for depression would be needed. On 9 July 2008, she was returned to the prison, ending a stay of {{two and a half weeks}} in the hospital. Corby was again taken to the hospital on 22 May 2009 for depression.|$|E

2500|$|Randell was 'discovered' whilst {{working as}} a 14-year-old {{apprentice}} hairdresser for Lilian and Antonio Frank. One of Frank's regular customers was publicist, Carol West. Garry Spry, the manager of Australian mod group The Flies, employed West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> at a women's hair salon. During the shoot, The Flies lead singer, Ronnie Burns sang with his guitar and Frank suggested her young apprentice should sing along. Spry was so impressed by her voice he offered her a job at his discothèque, Pinocchios, and West became her manager. For Randell's 15th birthday on 14 December 1964, West held a party in Malvern and invited local radio DJs including Stan Rofe. The Spinning Wheels backed Randell as she sang [...] "House of the Rising Sun" [...] and John Lee Hooker's [...] "Boom Boom". She cut a demo in a dining room and Rofe played it on his radio show.|$|E

60|$|The {{precautions}} were in vain. On {{the third}} morning of her stay Ada Bleek came down late to breakfast, her eyes looking very tired, but ablaze with excitement, her <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> anyhow, {{and a large}} brown volume hugged under her arm.|$|E
60|$|Cecilia {{turned and}} saw a woman of middle height, with her <b>hair</b> <b>done</b> in the early Italian fashion, and very small, dark, lively eyes, which looked as though her love of living would keep her busy each minute of her day and all the minutes that she could occupy of {{everybody}} else's days.|$|E
