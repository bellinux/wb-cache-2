5|$|By mid-December 1963, Indonesian <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> {{commando}} unit {{consisting of}} 128 volunteers and 35 regular soldiers to Sebatik. Their {{aim was to}} take Kalabakan, then invade Tawau and Sandakan. On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> massive {{expedition}} to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmouk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where, after being reinforced, they defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle {{is considered to be}} one of Khalid ibn al-Walid's greatest military victories. It cemented his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history.|$|E

The cadet battalion was redirected to Ključ to block the road KljučMrkonjić GradJajce. Nedeljković did not have the option of withdrawing via Bugojno or Prozor as those towns had been taken over by the Ustaše.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has {{been the source of}} much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon.

5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin.

Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert was the {{recipient}} of a long letter from Boniface who complained about the lax morals of the clergy in the British Isles, and too much drinking of alcohol by the Anglo-Saxon bishops. Cuthbert also sent letters to Lull who was Archbishop of Mainz and a native of England. During Cuthbert's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain, like his predecessor Theodore. Pope Gregory III in 735 <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> pallium to the bishop of York, raising the see of York {{to the status of}} an archbishopric. As a sign of the enhanced status of York, Cuthbert only consecrated bishops south of the Humber and his synods were attended only by bishops from the south of England.|$|E

5|$|During June and July 1864, Confederate forces {{under the}} command of General Jubal A. Early patrolled the Shenandoah Valley. Early's successes were a {{political}} liability for President Abraham Lincoln, and caused Union leaders to divert resources away from Richmond and West Virginia. Union soldiers from the Army of West Virginia began arriving via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Martinsburg, West Virginia, on July 19, and had an initial success in the Battle of Rutherford's Farm. A few days later, Early tricked Union General George Crook into believing that Early <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> large part of his Confederate force to Richmond. The result of this deception was a July 24 Confederate victory near Winchester, Virginia, at the Second Battle of Kernstown. Union troops, in some cases panic stricken, retreated to {{the north side of the}} Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> letter to the Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see what they could do to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E

5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E
5|$|During the club's victory parade, {{with only}} one year left on his {{contract}} Chamakh declared {{that he would be}} staying at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season, despite strong interest from Premier League club Arsenal. Despite the statement, rumors of a move to Arsenal continued to surface with negotiations reportedly having been ongoing throughout the summer. On 3 August 2009, president Jean-Louis Triaud declared that Arsenal <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> bid of €7million for Chamakh and that he had rejected it, demanding that Arsenal improve its offer. The following day, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced {{that he would not be}} offering a better deal and declared the possible transfer dead. The announcement subsequently led Chamakh to confirm his intent to remain at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season. On 29 August, Chamakh reportedly snubbed a move to West Ham United. The club offered Bordeaux £18million for the player and offered Chamakh a four-year contract worth £3million a year. However, Chamakh remained firm on his stance, reiterating his commitment to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|In December 1695 the Spanish colonial {{authorities}} in Mérida received a diplomatic visit {{sent by the}} Aj Kan Ek'. The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, alcalde of Bacalar-at-Chunjujub'. Hariza <b>had</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695, who arrived {{around the same time}} that the Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain. In August Hariza travelled to Mérida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain. Four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities. The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza king. When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza–Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696. AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.|$|E
