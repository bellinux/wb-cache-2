5000|$|The Remington-Beals Model Revolvers {{along with}} {{subsequent}} models and variations were percussion revolvers manufactured by Eliphalet Remington & Sons in [...]31 (Pocket) [...]36 (Navy) or [...]44 (Army) caliber, {{used during the}} American Civil War, and {{was the beginning of}} a successful line of medium and large <b>frame</b> <b>pistols.</b> It is commonly, though inaccurately, referred to as the Model 1858 due to the patent markings on its cylinder, [...] "PATENTED SEPT. 14, 1858/E. REMINGTON & SONS, ILION, NEW YORK, U.S.A./NEW MODEL."; although wide scale production did not start until 1861.|$|E
5000|$|The VP70 is a 9×19mm, 18-round, {{double action}} only, semi-automatic/three-round burst capable polymer <b>frame</b> <b>pistol</b> {{manufactured}} by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH. VP stands for Volkspistole (literally [...] "People's Pistol"), and the designation 70 {{was for the}} first year of production: 1970.|$|R
50|$|Many of the weapon's parts, {{including}} the <b>frame,</b> <b>pistol</b> grip/charging handle, trigger, sear, and disconnector {{are made of}} plastic, while many other parts are made of stainless steel; altogether, it has only 39 individual components. The receiver is made from stamped sheet steel with a hinged cover.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} polymer-framed pistol and predates the Glock 17 by 12 years. The weapon weighed 820 g unloaded, lighter than most other metal <b>framed</b> <b>pistols</b> of the time. Although the VP70 {{was the first}} polymer-framed handgun, the Remington Nylon 66 rifle {{introduced}} in 1959 was the first polymer-framed firearm in production.|$|R
5000|$|Smith & Wesson Model 3913LS Lady Smith: 9mm, compact <b>frame,</b> 8+1 <b>pistol</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Ultrastars {{are also}} single-column pistols, which is {{unusual for a}} newly {{designed}} pistol these days, and helps make the gun slim and comfortable. They could have been designed even more slim, but instead there is significant thickness, with reinforcing webs, under each grip area. This gives the frame a very solid feel, something lacking in many other plastic <b>framed</b> <b>pistols.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The SIG Sauer P290RS is a polymer <b>frame</b> <b>pistol</b> with a {{stainless}} steel slide. It is chambered in 9 x 17mm (aka [...]380 ACP, 9mm Kurz). It is a compact handgun suitable for concealed carry. The finish is SIG Sauer's Nitron finish. The side panels can be interchanged for a custom appearance. The trigger is a Double Action Only (DAO) model with restrike capability. Hence the RS designation in the model number.|$|R
50|$|Candidates {{included}} Browning Hi-Power variants by Canada's Inglis and Belgium's Fabrique Nationale, and Smith & Wesson's S&W Model 39. Colt {{entered a}} modified version of their M1911 pistol that was chambered for 9 mm Parabellum, had an aluminum alloy frame, a short 4.25-inch barrel, and a 9-round magazine. In 1950, Colt moved their candidate into regular production. It was the first aluminum-framed large <b>frame</b> <b>pistol</b> in major production and the first Colt pistol to be originally chambered in 9 mm Parabellum. The first year's production included 45 ACP and 38 Super chamberings.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} Kahr pistols {{appeared}} {{on the market in}} 1994 they were constructed entirely of carbon steel. Early Kahr models such as the K9 were praised as well-made and solidly constructed, but criticized for their excessive weight, which is a disadvantage in a weapon intended for concealed carry. Kahr attempted to address these concerns by introducing pistols that were physically smaller, as well as a line of polymer framed models. The PM series combined both these approaches, introducing polymer <b>framed</b> <b>pistols</b> that were also the smallest Kahr models ever produced.|$|R
5000|$|In 1867, Robert Adams' brother John Adams {{patented}} a breech-loading revolver {{which was}} adopted by the British government in place of the Beaumont-Adams. It was a solid <b>frame</b> <b>pistol</b> with six chambers, in [...]450 caliber. After official acceptance of his pistol, Adams left the London Armoury Company and established his own factory, the Adams Patent Small Arms Company. His pistol was manufactured in three distinct variations (differences related mainly to methods of spent cartridge ejection) between 1867 and about 1880. The models were tested and adopted by the British Army and Navy, with the last, the M1872 Mark III, seeing the widest use.|$|R
5000|$|Testing with {{a variety}} of {{ammunition}} proved the USP meets these high standards. During the USP testing phase, it was shown the recoil-reduction system reduces the force on the USP grip to approximately 300 newtons (67 pounds-force). Peak force shock on competing [...]40 caliber polymer and metal <b>framed</b> <b>pistols</b> was around 5,000 newtons (1,100 pounds-force). The primary benefit of low peak shock is a decrease in wear and tear on pistol components, a great concern with the +P cartridge in 9 mm, [...]40 S&W, and [...]45 ACP. Reduction of peak shock forces also contributes to softer recoil for the shooter, although these [...] "felt recoil" [...] values are much more subjective.|$|R
50|$|The Caracal is a fully ambidextrous polymer <b>framed</b> <b>pistol</b> that {{features}} an ergonomically designed grip with a rounded butt and a grip angle of 111°. The lower forward {{edge of the}} frame has a mounting-bracket or rail interface system for mounting accessories.The pistol's low slide profile design holds the pistol barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistols more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allows faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence. The distance from the pistol barrel central axis {{to the top of}} the grip is 18 mm. This low bore axis principle is also found in the Glock, Steyr M and in the later developed Arsenal Firearms Strike One pistols.|$|R
50|$|Grendel Inc., {{founded by}} George Kellgren, was a Florida {{firearms}} company which produced polymer <b>framed</b> semi-automatic <b>pistols</b> from 1987 to 1994. Zytel {{was used for}} grips, magazines, and furniture while slides, barrels, slide rails, and other high-pressure parts were manufactured using LaSalle Stressproof steel.|$|R
50|$|Since 2009 Tanfoglio is the European {{importer}} for the Caracal pistol product line. These polymer <b>framed</b> semi-automatic <b>pistols</b> {{are produced}} by Caracal International L.L.C. from the United Arab Emirates and have been introduced on the Italian civilian/sport shooters market during the 2009 EXA expo (Brescia, 18-21 April 2009).|$|R
50|$|Another {{machine pistol}} using the three shot burst {{system is the}} Heckler & Koch VP70. It will only fire three-round bursts with the stock attached. It is a 9 mm, 18-round, double action only, semi-automatic/three-round burst capable polymer <b>frame</b> <b>pistol</b> {{manufactured}} by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH; the VP designation stands for Volkspistole ("The people's pistol"), and the designation 70 was for {{the year of the}} first edition: 1970. It was the first polymer-framed pistol, predating the Glock 17. The stock incorporates a selector switch that allows selective fire. Cyclic rounds per minute for the three-round bursts is 2200 rpm. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only, so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. Despite the VP70's potential, it was never adopted by the Bundeswehr.|$|R
50|$|The Smith & Wesson SD, {{formerly}} known as the Sigma, was Smith & Wesson's first venture into using synthetic materials in pistol construction, using high-strength polymer material for the <b>frame.</b> The <b>pistol</b> is similar to a Glock safe-action pistol in both its design and operation, leading to some controversy and speculation as to the legality of the pistol's patents.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is fed from}} an 8-round {{detachable}} box magazine. A hold open device {{will keep}} the slide locked open after discharging the last cartridge from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the slide release lever located {{on the left side}} of the <b>frame.</b> The <b>pistol</b> uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch.|$|R
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson SW99 is a modern, polymer <b>frame</b> <b>pistol</b> that {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to the Walther P99. The SW99 features an internal striker, {{as opposed to the}} classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm Para, [...]40 S&W, and [...]45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action as explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator {{on the right side of}} the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of casing head rupture, reducing risk of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol.|$|R
5000|$|In the aftermath, the FBI {{initially}} {{chose the}} Smith & Wesson 1076 chambered for the 10mm Auto round, but its sharp recoil proved {{too much for}} most agents to control effectively, and a special reduced velocity loading was developed - {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "10mm Lite" [...] or [...] "10mm FBI". Soon afterwards Smith & Wesson developed a shorter cased cartridge based on the 10mm, the [...]40 S&W. This became more popular than its parent due to the ability to chamber in standard <b>frame</b> semi-automatic <b>pistols</b> initially designed for the 9 mm Parabellum.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Ruger {{introduced}} the [...] "New Vaquero" [...] which incorporated a smaller frame, based on Ruger's XR-3 grip <b>frame,</b> making the <b>pistol</b> {{closer to the}} size of the Colt Single Action Army Revolver of 1873. The New Vaquero will accept two-piece stocks made for the Colt Single Action Army.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is a short}} recoil-operated, locked breech pistol with a {{vertically}} falling {{locking piece}} and an open top slide (the locking mechanism design {{was influenced by the}} Walther P38 pistol). The locking piece, located under the barrel, is unlocked by a sliding pin and locked back into battery by a beveled surface on the <b>pistol's</b> <b>frame.</b> The locking piece features two locking lugs that engage appropriate recesses cut into the slide's internal side surfaces. When the pistol is fired, the locking piece, integral with the slide, goes back together with the barrel which is locked to the slide. After a brief period of unrestricted travel of approx. 13 mm the unlocking pin on the rear barrel lug strikes the receiver and stops. As the barrel and slide continue back, the locking piece strikes the stationary plunger and is forced down into recesses in the slide. The barrel comes to rest but the slide continues rearward for a further 50 mm. Upon forward return, the slide picks up the barrel and the locking piece on the barrel lug is lifted up by the receiver cam to lock the barrel to the slide. The spring-loaded extractor is integrated into the slide, and the fixed-type ejector is integral to the <b>pistol's</b> <b>frame.</b> The <b>pistol</b> has a hammer striking mechanism (with an exposed hammer) and a single-action trigger with a disconnector, which enables semi-automatic fire only. A cross-bolt safety mounted on the weapon's frame (beneath the hammer) provides safe operation with a cartridge introduced into the chamber. In the “weapon safe” position (the safety's button pushed in to the left) the slide catch is disabled.|$|R
50|$|The BUL Cherokee is a polymer <b>framed</b> {{semi-automatic}} <b>pistol</b> made by Israeli firearms manufacturer BUL Transmark and {{is based}} on the Czech-designed CZ 75. It is the successor to the BUL Storm. The Cherokee is equipped with a tactical rail (for lights, etc.), three-dot windage adjustable sights (night sights optional), and enlarged trigger guard, frame-mounted thumb safety and half-cock safety; no magazine safety. The frame is an injected, fiber-reinforced polymer construction. The barrel and slide are forged 18CrMo4 and 34NiCrMo6, respectively. The new models have a natural grip angle (104 degrees). Chambered only in the 9mm Parabellum (aka 9mm Luger or 9×19mm).|$|R
50|$|The RAMI {{is quickly}} {{disassembled}} for cleaning and maintenance. To do this the slide stop is pushed {{out and the}} slide is pulled forward off the <b>pistol</b> <b>frame.</b> This allows the action to be further dismantled separating the barrel, recoil spring, and trigger components. Further tear down (e.g. firing pin cleaning) should only be performed by a competent gunsmith.|$|R
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include <b>pistol</b> <b>frames</b> and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|R
50|$|The Browning Hi-Power BDA is a {{semi-automatic}} short recoil operated locked breech firearm. It has a vertically tilting delayed camming action. This {{locking mechanism}} was {{borrowed from the}} Browning Hi-Power. The handgun features a double-action trigger which cocks and then releases the hammer. The recoil of the slide recocks the hammer, and all consecutive shots are fired from the single-action mode. A disconnector ensures the pistol fires in semi-automatic mode only. The spring-loaded external claw extractor is mounted in the slide, while the fixed ejector - inside the <b>pistol’s</b> <b>frame.</b> The BDA is secured against unintentional firing with an automatic firing pin safety which blocks the firing pin and is released only when the trigger is pulled to fire. Immediately after a round is fired, the safety reengages itself even if the trigger is not released. The BDA also has a decocking safety that safely releases and captures the hammer in a safety notch. A decocking lever is mounted {{on each side of}} the <b>pistol’s</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{similarity}} to the Walther PP, the P-64 is an original design, holding a Polish patent, number 54822. The patent {{applies to the}} unique disconnecter (an elongated plate sliding vertically inside the <b>pistol's</b> <b>frame)</b> which provides an internal safety, decocks the hammer when the safety is engaged, interrupts the weapon's cycle after every shot fired, and allows the weapon to be reloaded with the safety on.|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of more advanced and cost-effective production techniques in the 1970s, a comprehensive redesign of the P-64 was attempted. In 1972, a prototype pistol was developed (called the P-70) with a 14-round magazine capacity and a slide made from copper-welded stamped steel. Instead of steel, the P-70's frame was made from a lightweight alloy. In 1976 another upgraded prototype was introduced, designated the P-75, with an itamide synthetic <b>frame.</b> This <b>pistol</b> {{was followed by the}} P-78 in 1978, which features a modular trigger group and a 12-round magazine. Production of the P-78 was terminated after it lost out to the P-83 Wanad pistol in a bid for a new service sidearm for the Polish Army and police.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine pistol}} may be {{fitted with a}} wooden (early), brown {{bakelite}} or steel wire shoulder stock (for the APB variant); otherwise, the weapon becomes difficult to control on full auto. The stock is attached via a T-slot cut into the rear strap of the <b>pistol</b> <b>frame.</b> The stock is hollowed out and {{can act as a}} holster, accepting the machine pistol inside, similar to the Mauser C96 pistol.|$|R
5000|$|The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms {{contended that}} the mere {{possession}} of a pistol having a barrel less than sixteen inches (406 mm) long, a shoulder stock, and a rifle-length (more than sixteen inches) barrel constituted constructive intent to [...] "make" [...] an illegal short-barreled rifle (SBR) (by combining the <b>pistol's</b> <b>frame,</b> the pistol-length barrel, and the shoulder stock) even if the shoulder stock {{was intended to be}} used only with the rifle-length barrel.|$|R
5000|$|Due to a {{complete}} lack of a muzzle blast, {{the action of the}} PSS is best described as [...] "Reaction action". Since no propellant gasses exit the cartridge casing after firing, rearward force is present only due to the projectile, and is used to cycle the pistol's slide. In all other respects, the PSS generally follows traditional conventions except for the slide's guide rod, which is located above the barrel and instead of guide rails on the <b>pistol</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first Stoeger Lugers were {{produced}} in 1969 with aluminum forging/machined frames (7075 T6 aluminum). Beginning in 1980 the receiver material {{was changed to}} steel. One way to identify the frame type is by the safety selector markings. Steel frames will have a red and green painted indented spot while the aluminum frames will have raised lettering that says Fire or Safe. Use of a magnet {{is another way to}} identify the composition of the <b>pistol</b> <b>frame</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|In pistols the recoil {{from the}} fired {{cartridge}} (and the slide movement) {{will make the}} muzzle rise after each shot, and how high the bore axis sits {{in relationship to the}} hand will affect the degree of muzzle rise. A low bore axis will make most of the recoil go directly into the hand, and thus give less muzzle rise. Among other things that affect muzzle rise and felt recoil is the weight of the <b>pistol</b> <b>frame</b> and tuning of recoil springs.|$|R
50|$|The BDA feeds from a dual-column box {{magazine}} with a 14-round cartridge capacity. (The FN HP-DA however uses a different 10- or 15-round magazine which is interchangeable with the Browning BDM {{but will not}} fit in a Browning BDA-9 though the guns look identical and they are both made by FN Herstal.) The magazine release button, located aft of the trigger, can be configured for either right- or left-hand users simply by swapping out the push-button. The BDA is fitted with a slide catch that holds the slide open after depleting the magazine. The slide can be released by pressing the slide release lever, placed {{on the left side}} of the <b>frame.</b> The <b>pistol</b> is aimed using fixed iron sights with contrasting dots - a front blade and dovetailed rear notch. As an option, tritium-illuminated Meprolight night sights can also be fitted.|$|R
50|$|The Picatinny rail was {{originally}} for mounting scopes atop the receivers of larger caliber rifles, but, once established, its use expanded to other such accessories as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, foregrips, bipods, and bayonets. Because of their many uses, Picatinny rails and accessories have replaced iron sights {{in the design}} of many firearms, and they are also on the undersides of semi-automatic <b>pistol</b> <b>frames</b> and grips. Their usefulness has led to their being used in paintball and airsoft.|$|R
25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the <b>pistol's</b> <b>frame</b> and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|R
5000|$|The Tanfoglio Force {{models are}} polymer frame {{versions}} of the Tanfoglio T95 Combat/Standard high strength steel frame models, that, in turn, are clones of the famous CZ-75 pistol design, save for minor details. The FORCE 22L variant has however a standard sized polymer/aluminium combination frame and the FORCE CARRY R POLICE and FORCE CARRY F PRO variants are hybrid designs, using a polymer frame, and polished steel [...] "Wonder" [...] finish slide. The Tanfoglio Force is offered in several variants in full sized, compact and subcompact <b>pistol</b> <b>frame</b> sizes.|$|R
