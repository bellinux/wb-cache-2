5|$|Melbourne carried three <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> squadrons. Initially, she had up to 22 {{planes and}} 2 {{helicopters}} embarked at any time. The number of aircraft gradually increased until 1972, {{when the air}} group peaked at 27 aircraft. Approximately 350 <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> personnel were stationed aboard the carrier.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> Royal Naval <b>Air</b> Station on Boaz Island, HMS Malabar, {{nominally}} {{an aircraft}} repair and replacement facility without its own aircrews, provided air patrols {{during the early}} years of the war, using Supermarine Walrus flying boats flown by naval pilots from ships at the dockyard, or pilots from the Royal Air Force and the Bermuda Flying School on Darrell's Island. Once the US Navy began flying air patrols from Darrell's Island in 1941, however, the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> patrols ceased.|$|R

50|$|The church {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} in the 20th century {{but has been}} taken over and restored as the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm’s</b> Memorial Church following links since World War II with the nearby airbase RNAS Yeovilton.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century the church was falling into {{disrepair}} until after World War II an association developed with the staff from the nearby RNAS Yeovilton. The churchyard contains 15 graves of British and Commonwealth forces during World War II mostly from the airbase. By 1988 the fabric of the building was considered unsafe and the church declared redundant, and was sold to the Royal Navy for £1. Restoration work was carried out funded by public donation and, in 1993, the church was reopened as the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm’s</b> Memorial Church. The church holds the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm’s</b> Roll of Honour.|$|R

5|$|Overall, <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> {{casualties}} during Operation Goodwood were 40 airmen {{killed and}} 17 aircraft destroyed. Nabob was also {{judged to be}} beyond economical repair, and was withdrawn from service. On the German side, Tirpitz suffered only superficial damage.|$|E
5|$|Fliegerkorps II sent 650 sorties against Pedestal from 11–14 August {{and claimed}} 12 {{aircraft}} shot down for 18 losses. Total Axis losses were 62 aircraft, 42 Italian and 19 German, including losses {{on the ground}} and those shot down by their own side. Royal Navy gunners and <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> fighters claimed 74 aircraft shot down but actually destroyed 42 Axis aircraft, 26 from the Regia Aeronautica and 16 Luftwaffe aircraft. The <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> lost thirteen aircraft on operations and sixteen Sea Hurricanes when Eagle was sunk, the RAF lost a Beaufighter and five Spitfires and a Sunderland was shot down by Giada. The Allies could not risk such losses again and another large convoy to Malta was not attempted until November 1942, when the re-capture of airfields in Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein made it much easier to provide land-based air cover.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940, the {{principal}} {{concern of the}} Royal Air Force, together with elements of the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm,</b> was to contest the control of British airspace with the German Luftwaffe. For the Germans, achieving at least local air superiority was an essential prerequisite to any invasion.|$|E
25|$|Flag Officer Naval Aviation (FONA) {{controls}} training, {{maintenance and}} other functions of naval aviation. Aircraft yards at Kochi, Kerala and Dabolim, Goa {{are responsible for}} maintaining the <b>fleet's</b> <b>air</b> <b>arm.</b> An exclusive base, INS Shikra for helicopters was commissioned in Mumbai.|$|R
500|$|On 5 December 1976, {{a fire at}} the Naval Air Station [...] {{destroyed}} or heavily damaged 12 of the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> 13 S-2E Trackers. The carrier {{was sent to the}} United States in 1977 to transport back 16 S-2G Tracker aircraft as replacements.|$|R
50|$|Martlet (formerly FASGW (Light) and the Lightweight Multirole Missile) {{is a short}} range, {{supersonic}} {{anti-ship missile}} for use against small surface warships, patrol vessels and craft. Martlet is due to enter service around 2015 on the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> new Lynx Wildcat maritime helicopters.|$|R
5|$|The UK Royal Navy, {{working with}} the UK Met Office, has its own {{specialist}} branch of weather observers and forecasters, {{as part of the}} Hydrographic and Meteorological (HM) specialisation, who monitor and forecast operational conditions across the globe, to provide accurate and timely weather and oceanographic information to submarines, ships and <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Goodwood, {{responsibility}} for attacking Tirpitz {{was transferred to}} the Royal Air Force in late August 1944. In three heavy bomber raids conducted during September and October 1944, the battleship was first crippled and then sunk. Historians regard Operation Goodwood as a significant failure for the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm,</b> and attribute its results to shortcomings with the force's aircraft and their armament.|$|E
5|$|Further {{missions}} by II./KG 54 to RAF Croydon were cancelled. I./KG 54 {{struck at}} the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> (FAA) base at Gosport. ZG 2 {{was supposed to}} provide escort during one these attacks, and in a breakdown of communications, arrived over the target without their Ju 88s, which had been ordered to stand down. One Bf 110 was shot down by No. 238 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 December 1976, {{a fire at}} the Naval Air Station [...] {{destroyed}} or heavily damaged 12 of the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> 13 S-2E Trackers. The carrier {{was sent to the}} United States in 1977 to transport back 16 S-2G Tracker aircraft as replacements.|$|R
50|$|The Airedale was {{designed}} by F.A.Bumpus to Air Ministry specifications R.37/22 calling for a three-seat deck-landing reconnaissance aircraft intended to replace the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> Blackburn B.1 Blackburn and the Avro 555 Bison. Unlike the B.1, it was a monoplane with a high wing for good visibility.|$|R
5000|$|The Skyhawk and Tracker squadrons {{flew from}} the {{aircraft}} carrier [...] until the carrier was decommissioned on 30 June 1982. This signalled {{the beginning of the}} end of the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> front line fixed wing capabilities, and also a scaling back of activities at Albatross.|$|R
5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} dive bomber units to begin {{operations}} against the radar stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain. The targets {{on the afternoon of}} 18 August were RAF Ford, RAF Thorney Island and Gosport, all belonging to the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> or Coastal Command. Included in the target selection was the radar station at Poling, West Sussex, near Littlehampton.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July 2012, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond {{indicated}} {{in a speech}} in the United States that the UK would order an initial 48 F-35B aircraft to be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm.</b> In November 2015, the government announced its commitment to a full order of 138 F-35 aircraft, with 24 available for carrier duties by 2023.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, over thirty {{aircraft}} were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures. After Melbourne was decommissioned, the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm</b> ceased fixed-wing combat aircraft operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.|$|E
50|$|A further {{quantity}} of WE.177As were procured for the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> (FAA) fixed-wing strike aircraft. When the Navy's large aircraft carriers were decommissioned, around twenty warheads {{were transferred to}} the Royal Air Force. The remaining weapons that {{were assigned to the}} Royal Navy were retired in 1992.|$|R
50|$|Built to Air Ministry {{specification}} O.27/34, {{it was a}} low-wing monoplane of all-metal (duralumin) construction, with a {{retractable undercarriage}} and enclosed cockpit. It was the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> first service monoplane and was a radical departure for a force that was primarily equipped with open-cockpit biplanes such as the Fairey Swordfish.|$|R
25|$|Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose (RNAS Culdrose, {{also known}} as HMS Seahawk; ICAO: EGDR) is a Royal Navy airbase near Helston on the Lizard Peninsula of Cornwall UK, and is the largest {{helicopter}} base in Europe. Its main role is serving the <b>Fleet</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Arm's</b> front line Sea King and Merlin helicopter squadrons.|$|R
