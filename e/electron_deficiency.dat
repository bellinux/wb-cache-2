40|$|Three new electron-rich metal-organic {{frameworks}} (MOF- 1 -MOF- 3) {{have been}} synthesized by employing ligands bearing aromatic tags. The key {{role of the}} chosen aromatic tags is to enhance the -electron density of the luminescent MOFs. Single-crystal X-ray structures have revealed that these MOFs form three-dimensional porous networks with the aromatic tags projecting inwardly into the pores. These highly luminescent electron-rich MOFs have been successfully utilized {{for the detection of}} explosive nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) on the basis of fluorescence quenching. Although all of the prepared MOFs can serve as sensors for NACs, MOF- 1 and MOF- 2 exhibit superior sensitivity towards 4 -nitrotoluene (4 -NT) and 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (DNT) compared to 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzene (TNB). MOF- 3, on the other hand, shows an order of sensitivity in accordance with the <b>electron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of the substrates. To understand such anomalous behavior, we have thoroughly analyzed both the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence quenching associated with these interactions. Determination of static Stern-Volmer constants (K-S) as well as collisional constants (K-C) has revealed that MOF- 1 and MOF- 2 have higher K-S values with 4 -NT than with TNT, whereas for MOF- 3 the reverse order is observed.

5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for <b>electron</b> <b>deficiencies</b> on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can recombine and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe structural, bonding, electronic, {{mechanical}} and thermal properties of ternary aluminum silicon carbides Al 4 SiC 4 and Al 4 Si 2 C 5 are investigated by first-principles calculations {{combined with the}} Debye quasi-harmonic approximation. All the calculated mechanical constants like bulk, shear and Young's modulus are in good agreement with experimental values. Both compounds show distinct anisotropic elastic properties along different crystalline directions, and the intrinsic brittleness of both compounds is also confirmed. The elastic anisotropy of both aluminum silicon carbides originates from their bonding structures. The calculated band gap is obtained as 1. 12 and 1. 04 eV for Al 4 SiC 4 and Al 4 Si 2 C 5 respectively. From the total electron density distribution map, the obvious covalent bonds exist between Al and C atoms.

The expression of osteogenesis-related genes, such as alkaline phosphatase, Type I collagen, and osteocalcin was significantly increased under hypoxia (Boyette et al., 2014). Hypoxia suppressed adipogenesis and associated HIF 1 α and PPARG gene expression in hMSCs and enhanced osteogenesis and associated HIF 1 A and RUNX 2 gene expression (Wagegg et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF- 1 α suppressed hypoxia-induced osteogenesis (Wagegg et al., 2012). The mechanism was demonstrated that HIF- 1 α can suppress oxidative metabolism through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by PDH kinase (PDK) and activate the expression of glycolytic enzymes (Papandreou et al., 2006). On the other hand, the mitochondrial <b>electron</b> transport chain <b>deficiency</b> made the expression of HIF- 1 α severely reduced, and HIF- 1 DNA binding was diminished, which suggested that electron transport chain activity is required for activation of HIF- 1 (Agani et al., 2000).|$|R

High-quality images are required in order to solve (potentially life-saving) biomedical research problems. Many microscopy techniques do not achieve sufficient resolution for these purposes, being limited by physical diffraction and hardware <b>deficiencies.</b> <b>Electron</b> microscopy addresses optical diffraction by measuring emitted or transmitted electrons instead of photons, yielding nanometer resolution. Despite pushing back the diffraction limit, blur should still be taken into account because of practical hardware imperfections and remaining electron diffraction. Deconvolution algorithms can remove some of the blur in post-processing but they depend on knowledge of the point-spread function (PSF) and should accurately regularize noise. Any errors in the estimated PSF or noise model will reduce their effectiveness. This paper proposes a new procedure to estimate the lateral component of the point spread function of a 3 D scanning electron microscope more accurately. We also propose a Bayesian maximum a posteriori deconvolution algorithm with a non-local image prior which employs this PSF estimate and previously developed noise statistics.

For example, in antiphospholipid syndrome, treatment with co-enzyme Q has been shown been shown to alter mitochondrial dynamics resulting in lower oxidative stress and slowing of the accelerated atherosclerosis (Perez-Sanchez et al. 2012).

Quinones are also being investigated for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases (Enns et al. 2012) as well as age-related diseases (Skulachev et al. 2009). In one small open-label study, patients with terminal genetic mitochondrial diseases were treated with a para-benzoquinone (alpha-trocotrienol quinone) for 13 weeks as an emergency treatment protocol. This therapy modified disease progression in 90 % of the patients by increasing quality of life and improving central nervous system oxidation state (Enns et al. 2012). This quinone is currently undergoing clinical trials for diseases such as Friedreich’s ataxia, Leigh Syndrome, and Tourette syndrome.|$|R

We measured the serum copper levels of bed-ridden patients receiving enteral feeding, and evaluated optical and ultrastructural features of bone marrow {{before and after}} copper supplemen-tation. Patients and Methods Serum samples were obtained from 15 bed-ridden elderly patients receiving tube feeding (TF) and 10 age-matched bed-ridden patients who took food orally (CO), and the copper ceruloplas-min concentration of each sample was measured. Bone marrow samples were obtained from patients who ex-hibited copper deficiency and leukopenia and/or anemia {{before and after the}} copper supplementation, for use in light and electron microscopic analysis. Results The tube-fed patients had significantly lower mean serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations than the control patients. Seven of the 15 tube-fed patients had reduced serum copper concentrations and leukopenia. Six of those 7 patients also had anemia. Copper sulfate was administered to those 7 patients by enteral tube;their copper concentration, anemia and leukopenia improved within 1 month after they were ad-ministered copper sulfate. In the bone marrow examination before copper supplementation, light microscopy showed cytoplasmic vacuolization in both myeloid and erythroid precursors, and electron microscopy showed electron-dense deposits in mitochondria and cytoplasm of erythroid and myeloid cells. After copper supple-mentation, these pathological changes disappeared. Conclusions Bicytopenia is likely to occur in tube-fed patients with copper deficiency.

40|$|Legumes, which {{develop a}} {{symbiosis}} with nitrogen fixing bacteria, {{have an increased}} demand for iron. Iron {{is required for the}} synthesis of iron-containing proteins in the host, including the highly abundant leghemoglobin, and in bacteroids for nitrogenase and cytochromes of the <b>electron</b> transport chain. <b>Deficiencies</b> in iron can affect initiation and development of the nodule. Within root cells, iron is chelated with organic acids such as citrate and nicotianamine and distributed {{to other parts of the}} plant. Transport to the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids in infected cells of nodules is more complicated. Formation of the symbiosis results in bacteroids internalized within root cortical cells of the legume where they are surrounded by a plant derived membrane termed the symbiosome membrane (SM). This membrane forms an interface that regulates nutrient supply to the bacteroid. Consequently, iron must cross this membrane before being supplied to the bacteroid. Iron is transported across the symbiosome membrane as both ferric and ferrous iron. However uptake of Fe(II) by both the symbiosome and bacteroid is faster than Fe(III) uptake. Members of more than one protein family may be responsible for Fe(II) transport across the SM. The only Fe(II) transporter in nodules characterized to date is GmDMT 1, which is located on the symbiosome membrane in soybean. Like the root plasma membrane, the symbiosome membrane has ferric iron reductase activity. The protein responsible has not been identified but is predicted to reduce ferric iron accumulated in the symbiosome space prior to uptake by the bacteroid. With the recent publication of a number of legume genomes including Medicago truncatula and Glycine max, a large number of additional candidate transport proteins have been identified.

In this study, the genetic variability of 22 genotypes of cvs. Oblačinska, Maraska and Cigančica, as well as standard cvs. Kelleris 14, Kelleris 16, Kereška, Rexelle and Heimann conserved were investigated. Two types of molecular markers were used: microsatellite markers (SSR) {{in order to identify}} intercultivar, and AFLP in order to identify intracultivar variabilities. A set of 12 SSR markers revealed small genetic distance between cvs. Maraska and Oblačinska while cv. Cigančica is affined to cv. Oblačinska. Furthermore, cvs. Oblačinska, Cigančica and Maraska were characterized compared to standard ones. AFLP markers didn`t confirm significant intracultivar variability of cv. Oblačinska although the variability has been approved at the morphological, chemical and pomological level. Significant corelation between SSR and AFLP markers was found. Identification of sour cherry cultivars tolerant to drought will enable the sustainability of fruit production with respect to the climate change in the future. For this purpose, the tolerance of seven sour cherry genotypes (cvs. Kelleris 16, Maraska, Cigančica and Oblačinska represented by 4 genotypes: OS, 18, D 6 and BOR) to drought conditions was tested in order to isolate genotypes with the desired properties. In the greenhouse experiment, cherry plants were exposed to drought stress. The leaf relative water content, OJIP test parameters which specify efficiency of the photosynthetic system based on measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence, and concentrations of photo-synthetic pigments during the experiment were measured as markers of drought tolerance.

40|$|Plants {{exposed to}} {{environmental}} stress factors, such as drought, chilling, high light intensity, heat, and nutrient limitations, suffer from oxidative damage catalyzed by {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS), e. g., superoxide radical (O 2 -), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and hydroxyl radical (OH). Reactive O 2 species {{are known to be}} primarily responsible for impairment of cellular function and growth depression under stress conditions. In plants, ROS are predominantly produced during the photosynthetic electron transport and activation of membrane-bound NAD(P) H oxidases. Increasing evidence suggests that improvement of potassium (K) -nutritional status of plants can greatly lower the ROS production by reducing activity of NAD(P) H oxidases and maintaining photosynthetic <b>electron</b> transport. Potassium <b>deficiency</b> causes severe reduction in photosynthetic CO 2 fixation and impairment in partitioning and utilization of photosynthates. Such disturbances result in excess of photosynthetically produced electrons and thus stimulation of ROS production by intensified transfer of electrons to O 2. Recently, it was shown that there is an impressive increase in capacity of bean root cells to oxidize NADPH when exposed to K deficiency. An increase in NADPH oxidation was up to 8 -fold higher in plants with low K supply than in K-sufficient plants. Accordingly, K deficiency also caused an increase in NADPH-dependent O 2 - generation in root cells. The results indicate that increases in ROS production during both photosynthetic electron transport and NADPH-oxidizing enzyme reactions may be involved in membrane damage and chlorophyll degradation in K-deficient plants. In good agreement with this suggestion, increases in severity of K deficiency were associated with enhanced activity of enzymes involved in detoxification of H 2 O 2 (ascorbate peroxidase) and utilization of H 2 O 2 in oxidative processes (guaiacol peroxidase). Moreover, K-deficient plants are highly light-sensitive and very rapidly become chlorotic and necrotic when exposed to high light intensity. In {{view of the fact that}} ROS production by photosynthetic electron transport and NADPH oxidases is especially high when plants are exposed to environmental stress conditions, it seems reasonable to suggest that the improvement of K-nutritional status of plants might be of great importance for the survival of crop plants under environmental stress conditions, such as drought, chilling, and high light intensity. Several examples are presented here emphasizing the roles of K in alleviating adverse effects of different abiotic stress factors on crop production...|$|R
