A total of 49 people (28 male, 21 female) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive and were included. The alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) and self-reported ethanol intake in the last 28 days were assessed. In addition to gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS) were determined in serum and urine (UEtG, UEtS, SEtG) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) with deuterated internal standards. Abstinence from alcohol was reported for the last 28 days by 13 participants and for the last 7 days by 22. AUDIT was 0. 001), with the direct ethanol metabolites and MCV. In this population, abstinence and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> are more common than in the general population. <b>Episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> is a significant cause of acute risk in this population.

40|$|Consuming harmful {{amounts of}} alcohol is {{considered}} a contributing factor in over 200 diseases. <b>Heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> is a particularly risky drinking pattern, with possible consequences such as acute alcohol intoxication, injuries and violence. GEDA 2014 / 2015 -EHIS defines <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> as the consumption of six or more alcoholic beverages on one occasion at least once per month. 24. 9 % of women and 42. 6 % of men show this drinking pattern at least once per month. Regular <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> is most common among 18 - to 29 -yearolds. The prevalence of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> among highly educated women (all age groups) and men (aged over 45) is lower than it is among those {{with lower levels of}} education.

This analysis identified correlates of typical week drunkenness and past 30 -day <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> within a sample of immigrant Latino men in rural North Carolina (n = 258). In the bivariate analyses, Mexican birth, entering the United States as an adult, and year-round employment were associated with increased odds of typical week drunkenness, and higher acculturation and affiliation with a religion with strict prohibitions against drinking alcohol were associated with lower odds of typical week drunkenness. Being older, Mexican birth, entering the United States as an adult, and lower acculturation were associated with increased odds of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and affiliation with a religion with strict prohibitions against drinking alcohol and completing high school were associated with decreased odds of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> In multivariable modeling, only religious affiliation was associated with typical week drunkenness.

40|$|Research has {{documented}} that <b>Episodic</b> <b>Heavy</b> <b>Drinking</b> (EHD), defined as consuming {{four or more}} and five or more alcoholic drinks per drinking episode among females and males, respectively, is a prevalent risk behavior among undergraduate college students throughout the United States. Moreover, {{studies have shown that}} EHD {{is the leading cause of}} preventable morbidity and mortality among college students as unintentional injuries, sexual assaults, and unsafe sexual behaviors among this population have been linked to this risk behavior. Illicit substance use, although often portrayed as a separate risk behavior, is also associated with EHD. Nationally, the most frequently used illicit substance among college students is marijuana. Research suggests that college students who engage in EHD are several times more likely to be current marijuana users or to have used marijuana during their lifetime. Furthermore, EHD has been identified as a predictor of marijuana use and other substances, illicit or otherwise. With regard to this particular investigation, three specific risk behaviors among undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University (WKU) were the primary foci: 1) the prevalence of alcohol use and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> (EHD), 2) the prevalence of illicit substance use, particularly marijuana use, and 3) concomitant EHD and marijuana use. In addition, WKU students 2 ̆ 7 personal characteristics and certain behaviors were examined to determine their association with alcohol and marijuana use. This study was a secondary analysis of data gathered through the Western Kentucky Student Health Assessment (WKU-SHA 2002) administered during the fall semester of 2002.

40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} {{and discuss the}} alcohol drinking patterns {{of the younger generation}} of hospital doctors in Norway and Germany – respectively the abstainers, frequent drinkers, episodic heavy drinkers and hazardous drinkers. Methods: Data were collected in nationwide postal surveys among doctors in Norway (2000) and Germany (2006). A representative sample of 1898 German and 602 Norwegian hospital doctors aged 27 – 65 years were included in the analyses (N= 2500). Alcohol drinking patterns were measured using the first three items of AUDIT in Norway and the AUDIT-C in Germany, scores of ≥ 5 (ranking from 0 to 12) indicating hazardous drinking. <b>Episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> was defined by the intake of ≥ 60 g of ethanol, on one occasion, at least once a week. Frequent drinkers were who drank alcoholic beverages at least twice a week. Abstainers were persons who drank no alcohol. The analyses were performed separately for age groups (27 – 44 years versus 45 – 65 years) and genders. Results: Compared to the age groups 45 to 65 years in the Norwegian and German samples, the younger age groups (27 – 44 years) tend to have higher rates of abstainers, higher rates of infrequent drinking of moderate amount of alcoholic drinks, lower rates of <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> and lower rates of hazardous drinking. Conclusion: The younger generation of hospital doctors in Norway and Germany showed tendencies to healthier drinking habits. Changes in professional life, and in the attitude towards alcohol consumption, may go some way towards explaining these findings...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{research}} has shown that residents of Dutch deprived neighbourhoods drink less alcohol than people in other areas. We aimed to assess the role of individual and neighbourhood characteristics in a cross-sectional, nationwide, multilevel study. Individual data of 30, 117 Dutch adults, living in 1722 neighbourhoods across the Netherlands, were obtained from the 2004 to 2009 national health survey (POLS). Chronic heavy alcohol consumption was measured as ≥ 14 drinks/week for women and ≥ 21 for men, and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> as ≥ 6 drinks/day at least once a week. Neighbourhood deprivation was dichotomous; deprived districts as selected by the Dutch government versus other areas. Multilevel logistic regression models of the association between deprivation and heavy drinking were corrected for age, gender, household composition, population density and potential predictors ethnicity, socioeconomic status (education, income), neighbourhood-level social cohesion and percentage Muslims. The prevalence of heavy drinking was lower in deprived neighbourhoods than {{in the rest of the}} Netherlands. This association was found for both chronic and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> (OR= 0. 58 (0. 47 to 0. 72) and OR= 0. 57 (0. 45 to 0. 72), respectively). Adding ethnicity to the model reduced these associations by approximately one half. Socioeconomic composition did not contribute to the relationship. The proportion of Muslims explained a small part, while social cohesion explained even less of the association. Stronger associations were observed for women and older adults than for men and younger adults. The lower prevalence of heavy drinking occurring in deprived areas is largely explained by the ethnicity of neighbourhood resident...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{examined}} alcohol use patterns among {{men and women}} with depression seeking outpatient psychiatric treatment, including factors associated with recent <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and motivation to reduce alcohol consumption. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1, 183 patients aged 18 and over who completed a self-administered, computerized intake questionnaire and who scored ≥ 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Additional measures included current and past alcohol questions based on the Addiction Severity Index, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> (≥ 5 drinks on 1 or more occasions in the past year), alcohol-related problems on the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST), and motivation to reduce drinking using the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES). RESULTS: Among those who consumed any alcohol in the past year (73. 9 % of the sample), <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> in the past year was reported by 47. 5 % of men and 32. 5 % of women. In logistic regression, prior-year <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> was associated with younger age (p = 0. 011), male gender (p = 0. 001), and cigarette smoking (p = 0. 002). Among patients reporting <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> motivation to reduce alcohol consumption was associated with older age (p = 0. 008), greater usual quantity of alcohol consumed (p < 0. 001), and higher SMAST score (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior clinical studies, we examined subdiagnostic alcohol use and related problems among psychiatric outpatients with depression. Patients reporting greater drinking quantities and alcohol-related problems also express more motivation to reduce drinking, providing intervention opportunities for mental health providers that should not be overlooked...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationships between male alcohol-related aggression (MARA) among young Australian men and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> trait aggression, masculinity, concerns about social honour and expected positive consequences of MARA. Design and Methods The total sample comprised 170 men aged 18 – 25 years who completed an online questionnaire exploring beliefs and attitudes towards MARA. Results Those who reported <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> were more likely to be involved in an incident of MARA. In addition, those who were involved in MARA had higher levels of trait aggression, concern for social honour and expected positive consequences of aggression in bars than did those without such involvement. The relationship between socially constructed masculinity factors (a combined variable reflecting masculinity, social honour and expected positive consequences) and MARA was mediated by <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Social honour accounted for almost all of the predictive power of masculinity factors. <b>Heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and trait aggression remained significant predictors of MARA in a multivariate model.

40|$|The {{evidence}} on alcohol use disorder among conflict-affected civilian populations remains extremely weak, despite {{a number of}} potential risk-factors. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine patterns of alcohol use disorder among conflict-affected persons in the Republic of Georgia. A cross-sectional survey of 3600 randomly selected internally displaced persons (IDPs) and former IDPs. Two alcohol use disorder outcomes were measured: (i) having at least hazardous alcohol use (AUDIT score ≥ 8); (ii) <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> (consuming > 60 grams of pure alcohol per drinking session at least once a week). Individual level demographic and socio-economic characteristics were also recorded, including mental disorders. Community level alcohol environment characteristics relating to alcohol availability, marketing and pricing were recorded in the respondents' communities and a factor analysis conducted to produce a summary alcohol environment factor score. Logistic regression analyses examined associations between individual and community level factors with the alcohol use disorder outcomes (among men only). Of the total sample, 71 % of men and 16 % of women were current drinkers. Of the current drinkers (N = 1386), 28 % of men and 1 % of women were classified as having at least hazardous alcohol use; and 12 % of men and 2 % of women as episodic heavy drinkers. Individual characteristics significantly associated with both outcomes were age and experiencing a serious injury, while cumulative trauma events and depression were also associated with having at least hazardous alcohol use. For the community level analysis, a one unit increase in the alcohol environment factor was associated with a 1. 27 fold increase in <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> among men (no significant association with hazardous alcohol use). The findings suggest potential synergies for treatment responses for alcohol use disorder and depression among conflict-affected populations in Georgia, as well as the need for stronger alcohol control policies in Georgia...|$|E

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} in post-communist Kazakhstan remains {{at high levels}} and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking,</b> characteristic of the spirits-drinking regions of the former USSR, is still the national drinking style. Reported levels of alcohol-related harm are rising but assessment of trends in levels of consumption and harm is hindered by the disruption to data collection in the post-independence period and the continuing poor availability of public information. There is evidence however that changes in the republic's ethnic profile are connected with a downward trend in overall consumption rates, though changes in lifestyles may be leading to more drinking amongst women and young people. The numbers undergoing treatment for alcohol problems are greater than ever before. Alcohol problems are still perceived as entrenched and non-urgent, but in the present climate of greater stability and prosperity {{they are beginning to}} attract more attention from government. Underlying policy trends will depend on the overall direction of Kazakhstan's political and cultural development.

40|$|Background Alcohol use, {{especially}} <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> at {{an early}} age has been associated with various problems (e. g. risky sexual behaviours, health problems, depression, and heavy alcohol consumption at a later age). Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} risk and protective factors that influence adolescent alcohol use is crucial to developing effective prevention strategies. The aim of this thesis is to examine the importance of risk and protective factors in the development of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and subsequent problems for adolescent boys and girls. In addition, the prevention paradox (most alcohol-related problems occur in the 90 % of the population with lowest alcohol consumption) was examined among adolescents in Sweden and Europe. Methods Data from three different questionnaire studies were analysed: (1) a longitudinal cohort study with 1222 adolescents from Stockholm, aged 13 to 19 years, (2) a cross-sectional study with 3000 adolescents aged 15 years and 17 years from random samples of school classes throughout the whole of Sweden, and (3) a cross-sectional study (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs, ESPAD) performed in 35 countries among students who turned 16 during the year of the data collection. Twenty-three countries with 38 370 alcohol-consuming adolescents were included. Results Smoking and peer alcohol use were strongly associated with <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> among both boys and girls, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Some gender differences were found; parental provision of alcohol in the 7 th grade increased the odds for heavy alcohol use in girls two years later, and truancy was associated with later heavy alcohol use in boys. For boys, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> at age 13 was one of the most distinct predictors of later <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> For girls, secure bonds to parents lowered the risk for <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> even if the girls had friends who drank alcohol, money to spend, or parents who offered them alcohol. For boys whose parents offered them alcohol, parental monitoring had a protective effect. Also, we found that adolescents on a consistent high alcohol use trajectory during early adolescence had higher levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and alcohol-related problems at age 19. Furthermore, the prevention paradox was valid for adolescent boys and girls in Sweden and in most European countries; despite differences in annual alcohol consumption, levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> and reported problems, the <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> drinkers in the bottom 90 % consumer group accounted for a majority of all reported problems. Conclusions Effective population strategies may have large potential to reduce risk drinking and the overall problem level. A comprehensive prevention strategy should nevertheless also include efforts to reach adolescent high consumers. Furthermore, our results lend support to prevention initiatives to strengthen the parent–child relationship, to focus on adolescents‟ ability to resist peer pressure, and to limit parental provision of alcohol...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{association}} {{of social capital}} and alcohol consumption {{is one of the}} most robust empirical findings in health economics of the past decade. However, the direction of the relationship between the two is heavily dependent on which dimension of social capital is studied and which alcohol measure is used. In this paper, we examine the effect of social interactions and generalised trust on drinking in the general Danish population survey. Methods: Participants (n = 2569) were recruited as part of a larger study. The double-hurdle model for the volume of alcohol consumption and the multivariate logistic model for <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> were estimated.

40|$|INTRODUCTION -The {{analyses}} (1) {{assessed the}} association between social status variables and aggression when controlling for volume of alcohol consumption and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> (EHD), (2) tested whether social status moderates {{the association between}} volume or EHD and verbal {{as well as physical}} aggression, and (3) investigated whether EHD moderates the effect of volume on aggression. METHODS - Swedish Alcohol Monitoring Survey (2003 to 2011); N= 104, 316 current drinkers; response rate: 51 to 38 %. Alcohol-related aggression was defined as involvement in a quarrel or physical fight while drinking. Social status was defined as the highest education, monthly income and marital status. RESULTS - The associations between social status variables and aggression showed mixed results. Verbal aggression was associated with education in males and with marital status in both genders. Physical aggression was associated with education in both genders. No associations with aggression were found for income. With few exceptions, these associations remained significant when controlling for drinking patterns; social status did not moderate the association between drinking and aggression; EHD moderated the effect of volume on physical aggression in males. CONCLUSIONS - Groups of lower educated and nonmarried individuals experience verbal or physical aggression over and above different levels of consumption. Individual differences in aggression vulnerability rather than differences in aggression predisposition account for higher risks of aggression in these groups...|$|E

Objectives: To quantify the effects of this complex intervention. Setting: A large public university campus and surrounding community in New Zealand. Design: A health promotion evaluation model was used, examining: (1) how the programme was developed, introduced and received by the community?

40|$|As it {{is still}} unclear to what extent parental {{drinking}} is a predictor of children's alcohol use, we tested the association of specific paternal and maternal drinking patterns with both initiation and development of adolescent alcohol use. Longitudinal data (four annual measurements) of parent-child dyads (N = 2319) have been used. Parental drinking patterns have been identified using latent class analysis. The association of parental drinking patterns with the initiation and development of 12 - 15 year olds' drinking have been examined with latent growth curve modeling. Only two out of six parental drinking patterns were related to adolescent drinking. That is, having a <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> father or two <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> parents particularly predicts early and <b>heavier</b> adolescent <b>drinking.</b> When controlled for parenting behaviors and background variables, such as adolescent gender, age and socioeconomic status (SES), these findings remained significant.

40|$|Objectives The {{current study}} had two aims. First, {{to develop a}} moral {{disengagement}} scale contextualized to underage drinking. Second, to investigate Bandura’s (1986) self-regulatory model {{within the context of}} underage drinking. Method Two different samples of students participated in the study. The first sample included 619 (362 females) adolescents (Mage = 15. 3 years, SD = 1. 09 years) and the second sample 636 (386 females) adolescents (Mage = 15. 3 years, SD = 1. 03 years). Students in the first sample completed the Underage Drinking Disengagement Scale (UDDS), and measures of engagement in underage <b>drinking</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Students in the second sample completed these measures as well as scales of general moral disengagement, personal standards and anticipatory guilt associated with underage drinking. Results For the UDDS, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses verified a single factor structure. The UDDS was more strongly associated with engagement in underage <b>drinking</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> than a general measure of moral disengagement. A moderated mediation analysis revealed that adolescents who negatively evaluated underage drinking reported more anticipatory guilt, and more anticipatory guilt was associated with less engagement in underage <b>drinking</b> and less <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> This relationship was weaker at high compared to low levels of underage drinking disengagement.

Cognitive tests included immediate and delayed word recall, semantic fluency (animal naming), and letter cancellation. Associations between alcohol indices and cognitive scores were analyzed cross-sectionally (all measures from 2006 to 2008) and prospectively (alcohol and covariates from 2002 to 2005 and cognition from 2006 to 2008). In cross-sectional analyses, nondrinkers had lower cognitive scores and female moderate drinkers had better cognitive performance than light drinkers. Heavy, binge, and problem drinking were not consistently associated with cognitive function. Few associations were replicated in prospective analyses. Participants who stopped drinking during follow-up had worse cognition than stable drinkers; in men, regression coefficients (95 % confidence interval) ranged from - 0. 26 (- 0. 36, - 0. 16) for immediate recall to - 0. 14 (- 0. 24, - 0. 04) for fluency. Regular and <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> were not consistently associated with cognitive function. Worse cognition in participants who stopped drinking during follow-up suggests that inclusion of less healthy ex-drinkers may partly explain poorer cognition in nondrinkers...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol use {{appears to}} {{negatively}} impact antiretroviral (ART) adherence, though conclusions about its effects are inconsistent, and {{the mechanisms of}} these effects are unclear. Accurate assessment of alcohol use is important for adherence counseling in HIV/AIDS. This secondary data analysis aimed to 1) determine if positive alcohol screening tests can predict ART adherence; 2) compare the effects of two ART adherence interventions with usual care across alcohol screening status; 3) explore mediation by self-efficacy {{in the relationship between}} adherence and several psychosocial variables; and 4) evaluate the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption (AUDIT-C). The sample included 310 HIV+ adults on ART. Over 25 % of the sample was AUDIT-C positive. Through sequential multiple linear regression analyses, AUDIT-C status (but not AUDIT- 3 status) significantly added to the prediction of dose adherence (p=. 005) and days under-dosing (p=. 021) after controlling for confounders and covariates. In repeated measures analysis to determine if alcohol use impacts the effect of the interventions on dose adherence over time, only main effects for time and alcohol screening status were significant. Adherence was significantly lower at Time 2 than at baseline, F (1, 236. 287) = 25. 595, p =. 000, and significantly lower for AUDIT-C positive individuals than for AUDIT-C negative individuals, F (1, 340. 338) = 12. 304, p =. 001. In path analysis, near-significant results suggest partial mediation of the relationship between adherence and conscientiousness by self-efficacy. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the AUDIT-C were high. Multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis revealed factor invariance for sex, but the best-fitting model for race allowed partial invariance where AUDIT-C item 3 (<b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking)</b> was free to vary across whites/nonwhites, X 2 (3, 310) = 1. 818, p =. 6111. Inconsistent AUDIT-C data and missing Time 2 adherence data were significantly related to baseline opioid use. In conclusion, positive AUDIT-C status may serve as an indirect indicator for ART nonadherence. The AUDIT-C appears to reliably assess alcohol use in PWHIV, but common modifications may risk compromising validity, particularly in drug users. Further attention to the cultural equivalence of the AUDIT-C across racial groups may be warranted...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{examined}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> in general practice attenders who were non-hazardous drinkers, the associated risk factors and the outcome over 6 months. Methods: Consecutive attenders aged 18 - 75 were recruited from the UK, Spain, Slovenia, Estonia, the Netherlands and Portugal and followed up after 6 months. Data were collected on alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification test (at recruitment and 6 months) and risk factors for <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> alcohol use at recruitment. Results: The prevalence of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> in non-hazardous drinkers was 4. 5 % across Europe [lowest in Portugal (1. 5 %); highest Netherlands (8. 4 %) ]. It was less frequent in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Portugal compared with the UK and Netherlands. It was higher in men [odd ratio (OR) 4. 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 3, 5. 9], people between 18 and 29 years of age, those employed (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3, 2. 6) and those using recreational drugs (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 4, 3. 3). It was lower in people with existing DSMIV major depression (OR 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 31, 0. 96). <b>Heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> drinkers {{were more likely to}} become hazardous drinkers at 6 months (male: OR 7. 2, 95 % CI 4. 1, 12. 7; female: OR 9. 4, 95 % CI 4. 3, 20. 6). Conclusion : Women and men in the UK, men in the Netherlands and younger people in all countries are at the greatest risk of exhibiting <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> behaviours {{even in the absence of}} hazardous alcohol use. There is hence an urgent need for general practitioners to consider early detection and management of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> behaviour in this population...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{explored}} {{the association between}} concurrent alcohol and cocaine use and its predictive probability of self-reported violent behaviour. Methods: A series of logistic regression models were run on a sample of 3098 young people (aged 16 - 25) from a national self-report study. Findings: Current cocaine use was identified as predictive of violent offending (Exp B= 2. 363, p≤ 0. 01). Cocaine use was also more likely in those reporting <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking.</b> Whilst findings suggested an additive risk for both <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and cocaine consumption, {{there was no evidence}} of a multiplicative risk associated with concurrent use on the probability of assault outcomes. Results also suggest that <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> alcohol <b>drinking</b> was mediated by experience of violent victimization and having been involved in anti-social behaviour. Conclusions: Findings suggest that whilst interventions aimed at reducing drinking or cocaine consumption are likely to have some effect in reducing offending behaviour, attention should also be given to other individual level factors such as prior violent victimization and wider involvement in anti-social behaviour as these may be confounded as part of a wider substance misusing lifestyle or associated with violence as part as a wider repertoire of anti-social behaviour...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Alcohol use and misuse {{and their}} {{relation}} to sociodemograhic factors are well studied among university students in Western European countries and the USA, but less is known about students in Eastern Europe. The historical past as communistic countries might have affected the social life among these populations, which is again {{one of the main}} factors determining the alcohol consumption among university students. The aim of our study was to assess the association of selected sociodemographic factors with different patterns of alcohol use among university students in Slovakia. METHODS: A sample of 813 young adults (mean age 21. 1 years, 63. 8 % females; response rate of 71 %) from four universities in Kosice answered questions about their sociodemographic background and about alcohol use. To obtain a detailed picture of different aspects, alcohol use was measured by four variables: frequency of alcohol use, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> frequency of drunkenness and problem drinking. Four separate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between sociodemographic and alcohol-related variables. To assess the potentially different effects in both genders, all two-way interactions with gender were tested. RESULTS: While 41 % of the students drank alcohol once a week or more often, 77 % reported <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and 49 % had been drunk more than once in the last month. Problem drinking existed in 23. 3 % of the sample. Gender was consistently associated with all four alcohol-related variables, with males being at higher risk. A higher study year was associated only with lower levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> but displayed no association with the other studied variables. Living with parents during the semester was consistently associated with less frequent <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> drunkenness episodes, and problem drinking while having an intimate relationship was associated with less problem drinking only. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for the university students from Slovakia are in line with previous studies in Western Europe. Additionally, it appears that frequent alcohol use, excessive alcohol use (<b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> and drunkenness) and problem drinking among university students represent a continuum and are influenced by the same sociodemographic factors. ...|$|R
40|$|Analyses {{of routine}} data have {{established}} that the extreme mortality fluctuations among young and middle-aged men {{are the most important}} single component of both temporal changes in Russian life expectancy at birth and in the gap between male and female life expectancy. It is also responsible for the largest share of the life expectancy gap between Russia and other industrialised countries. A case-control study has been used to identify factors associated with mortality among men aged 20 to 55 in the five major cities of the Udmurt Republic in 1998 - 99. Men dying from external causes and circulatory disease are taken as cases. Matched controls were selected from men of the same age living in the same neighbourhood of residence. Information about characteristics of cases and controls was obtained by interviewing proxies who were family members or friends of the subjects. After exclusion of those deaths for which proxy informant could not be identified, a total of 205 circulatory disease and 333 external cause cases were included together with the same number of controls. Educational level was significantly associated with mortality from circulatory diseases and external causes in a crude analysis. However, this could largely be explained by adjustment for employment, marital status, smoking and alcohol consumption. Smoking was associated with mortality from circulatory disease (crude OR= 2. 44, 95 % CI 1. 36 - 4. 36), this effect being slightly attenuated after adjustment for socio-economic factors and alcohol consumption. Unemployment was associated with a large increase in the risk of death from external causes (crude OR= 3. 63, 95 % CI 2. 17 - 6. 08), an effect that was still substantial after adjustment for other variables (adjusted OR= 2. 52, 95 % CI 1. 43 - 4. 43). A reported history of periods of heavy drinking was linked to both deaths from circulatory disease (crude OR= 4. 21, 95 % CI 2. 35 - 7. 55) and external cause mortality (crude OR= 2. 65, 95 % CI 1. 69 - 4. 17). Adjustment for other variables reduced the size of these odds ratios, but they remained strikingly large for circulatory disease (adjusted OR= 3. 54, 95 % CI 1. 76 - 7. 13) and considerable for external causes (adjusted OR 1. 75, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 3. 00). These may be underestimates of the true effects as nearly all of them increased when employment status (which can in part at least be seen as being on the causal pathway) was excluded from the final model. In summary, however, our key finding is that a history of heavy drinking in the recent past is strongly associated with risk of death from circulatory disease. This provides the first individual-level evidence in support of the hypothesis that <b>episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> is key to explaining the heavy burden of circulatory disease mortality among Russian men of working age. alcohol, case-control, mortality, Russia, smoking, socio-economic factors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Heavy alcohol {{consumption}} may accelerate {{the progression of}} hepatitis C (HCV) -related liver disease and/or limit efforts at antiviral treatment. As most of the patients in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) suffer from hepatitis C infection, {{this study was conducted}} to identify the alcohol intake among these patients at a Swiss Psychiatric University Clinic by self-reports and direct ethanol metabolites as biomarkers of ethanol consumption. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A convenience sample of 40 MMT patients (15 women, 25 men; median age 39 years) of the total 124 patients was asked and consented to participate in this study. This sample was not different in age, gender distribution, and rate of hepatitis C infection from the total sample. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and self-reported ethanol intake during the previous 7 days were assessed. In addition, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in urine, and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) and EtG in hair were determined using LC-MS/MS and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. The limit of quantitation for UEtG, HEtG, and FAEEs were 0. 1 mg/l, 2. 3 pg/mg, and 0. 1 ng/mg, respectively. RESULTS: Fourteen participants reported abstinence from alcohol for the previous 7 days. AUDIT scores were > or = 8 in 15 male and > 5 in 5 female participants. Direct ethanol metabolites were as follows (median, min, max, standard deviation) : UEtG (19 positives; 9. 91, 1. 38 to 251, 62. 39 mg/l); the values of HEtG were 17. 65, 0 to 513, 105. 62 pg/mg [in 2 cases no material, 8 abstinent (up to 7 pg/mg), 15 social drinkers (up to 50 g per day), and 15 excessive users (> 50 / 60 g/d) ]. For the 13 cases, where enough material for additional determination of HFAEEs was available, the values were 0. 32, 0 to 1. 32, 0. 44 ng/mg. Among the 30 HEtG-positive participants, 20 had not reported the corresponding ethanol intake using question 1 (frequency) and 2 (quantity) of the AUDIT. Of the 14 participants reporting no alcohol intake during the previous 7 days, 4 were UEtG-positive. HEtG and AUDIT correlated significantly (r = 0. 622, p < 0. 0001), but {{this was not the case}} for UEtG and self-reported ethanol intake during the previous 7 days. CONCLUSION: (1) HEtG identified 20 cases of daily ethanol intake of more than 20 g, that would have been missed by the sole use of question 1 (frequency) and 2 (quantity) of the AUDIT. (2) Using the total score of the AUDIT, HEtG confirmed 10 more cases positive for alcohol intake. (3) <b>Episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> is with 22. 5 % more frequent than in general population, and (4) of the 14 participants who reported no alcohol intake during the previous 7 days, 4 were UEtG positive. Improved detection of {{alcohol consumption}}, which is hazardous or harmful in the context of HCV and opiate dependence, would allow for earlier intervention in this population which is at particular risk of liver disease and fatal respiratory-depressed overdose. The combined use of self-reports and direct ethanol metabolites seems promising...|$|E
40|$|Beber se embriagando, beber pesado episódico ou “binge {{drinking}}” é definido como o consumo de 5 ou mais doses de bebidas em uma ocasião, sendo comum entre os jovens. Este padrão de consumo é freqüente e preocupante, uma vez que se associa a graves conseqüências negativas. Objetivo: avaliar todos os calouros de 2004 do Campus da Unesp de Botucatu que faziam “uso de risco” de álcool, comparando-os com um grupo sem risco, acompanhando-os em seus comportamentos e conseqüências com relação ao beber por 24 meses. Neste estudo de caso-controle foram entrevistados 457 calouros dos 533 matriculados em 2004 em qualquer dos 11 cursos oferecidos no campus. O uso de risco de álcool foi definido pelo escore do AUDIT maior ou igual a 8 e/ou RAPI maior ou igual a 7 nos últimos 12 meses. Foram identificados 139 alunos chamados de Grupo de Risco (GR), que foram pareados por sexo e curso com outros 139 estudantes, identificados como Grupo Sem Risco (GSR). O pareamento foi realizado através de sorteio aleatório. A amostra total na linha de base foi de 278 alunos. Foi realizado seguimento de 12 e 24 meses. Houve uma tendência significativa à diminuição do uso de bebidas no GR, bem como diminuição de conseqüências negativas. No GSR houve leve aumento no consumo de álcool, mas não das conseqüências negativas ao longo do tempo. No entanto, ambos permaneceram no mesmo padrão da linha de base, ou seja, de risco e sem risco. Os homens beberam mais que mulheres e as alunas do GR sofreram mais quedas e fraturas comparadas aos alunos. O GR teve, ainda, pior desempenho escolar. Os principais fatores de risco para o padrão de uso de álcool do tipo “beber se embriagando” para os estudantes de ambos os sexos foram ter amigos que também tinham tal padrão e ter usado drogas ilegais nos últimos 12 meses. Para as mulheres, foi fator de proteção morar sozinha. <b>Episodic</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>drinking</b> or {{binge drinking}} {{is defined as}} the consumption of 5 or more drinks in one occasion, and it is common among young people. This pattern of consumption is frequent and worrying as it is associated with serious negative consequences. Objective: evaluating all 2004 freshmen from the Unesp Campus of Botucatu which were risky users comparing them with a matched non-risky group on their behavior, consequences relative to drink in a 24 months follow-up. Methods: in this casecontrol study about 457 freshmen of the 533 enrolled were interviewed in all the 11 courses offered in the campus. The risky use of alcohol was defined by an AUDIT score {{greater than or equal to}} 8 and / or RAPI greater than or equal to 7 in the last 12 months. A hundred thirty nine students were identified and called Risky Group (GR) and matched by sex and course with other 139 students nonrisky alcohol use identified as Non-risky Group (GSR). The matching was carried through random drawing. The total sample at the baseline was 278 students. Persuing of 12 and 24 months was carried through. Results: The reduction of the drink use had a significant trend in the GR, as well as the reduction of negative consequences. In the GSR, there was increase of the alcohol consumption, but not of the negative consequences throughout the time. However, both had remained the same in standard of base line, that is, of risk or without risk. Men drank more than the women and girls of GR suffered more falls and fractures compared to men. The GR had, still, worse school performance. The main risk factors for “binge drinking for students of both sexes were to have friends who had such standard and to have used illegal drugs in the last 12 months. For women, to live alone was a protection factor. Conclusions: Although without intervention, the students had tended to diminish the alcohol use over the time, but the comsuption of alcohol remained at levels of concern and risk...|$|E

We also explored whether personal importance of religious faith {{as well as}} healthy lifestyle had any modifying roles in these relationships. During 2007 - 2008, 3, 220 students at seven UK universities completed a questionnaire containing questions on CAGE, frequency alcohol use, <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking,</b> modified Beck-Depression Inventory, physical activity and sleep, and importance of religious faith. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed separately for four alcohol consumption indicators, stratified by gender.

Religiosity was negatively associated with frequency of <b>drinking</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>episodic</b> <b>drinking</b> among both genders, while healthy lifestyle {{was not associated with}} any of the four measures of alcohol consumption among both genders. No evidence suggested that either religiosity or healthy lifestyle modified the relationships between depressive symptoms and any of the four measures of alcohol consumption.
