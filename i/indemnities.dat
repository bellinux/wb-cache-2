He was rewarded by Carol, {{becoming one of the}} first three statesmen received into the Order of the Star of Romania. The Minister also negotiated the terms under which the Romanian Land Forces were to join the war effort in Bulgaria, specifically demanding Russian reparations and <b>indemnities.</b>|$|E
5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay <b>indemnities</b> and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, were excluded from the North German Confederation.|$|E

The couple received a fine of $8.6 million. Both were also sentenced to five years imprisonment, but Bhutto could not be extradited back to Pakistan from her self-imposed exile. Zardari was already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges. The evidence used against them had been gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Bureau of Accountability.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia it is a {{mandatory}} requirement for registered healthcare practitioners to hold appropriate medical <b>indemnity</b> insurance cover for healthcare practice in Australia. Medical <b>indemnity</b> {{is a form}} of professional <b>indemnity</b> insurance cover defined by Australian legislation - the Medical <b>Indemnity</b> (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003. In the UK, this type of professional <b>indemnity</b> for healthcare practitioners is generally referred to as ‘professional indemnity’ and in the USA, as ‘medical negligence insurance’. In Australia, the term ‘medical indemnity’ can be used to refer to all healthcare <b>indemnity</b> (e.g. dental, allied health, medical), not just that provided for medical doctors. However, there are only six Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority (AHPRA) listed insurers that provide medical <b>indemnity</b> insurance cover to medical practitioners.Australian medical practitioner medical <b>indemnity</b> providers include: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Indemnity,</b> in {{the context}} of Unification Church beliefs, {{is a part of the}} process by which human beings and the world are {{restored}} to God's ideal. The concept of <b>indemnity</b> is explained at the start of the second half of the Divine Principle, [...] "Introduction to Restoration": What, then, is the meaning of restoration through <b>indemnity?</b> When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called <b>indemnity.</b> .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill <b>indemnity</b> conditions is called the providence of restoration through <b>indemnity.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{contract}} of <b>indemnity</b> insurance is to restore the insured to his position quo ante. Nothing more than patrimonial <b>indemnity</b> may be recovered, as {{is illustrated by the}} rules on over-insurance and double insurance. The insured is not entitled to make a profit out of his loss. It is accordingly said that the principle of <b>indemnity</b> governs <b>indemnity</b> insurance.|$|R
5|$|Lee gave strict {{orders for}} his army to {{minimize}} any negative {{impacts on the}} civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay <b>indemnities</b> in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.|$|E
5|$|Military clashes {{continued}} in Huainan and Sichuan, but Jin incursions after Caishi had no intent {{of reaching the}} Yangtze. The Jin had discovered that southern China's many lakes and rivers impeded their cavalry. They signed a peace treaty with the Song in 1165, ending hostilities. The Huai River border remained the same and the Song continued to pay annual <b>indemnities</b> to the Jin, but the Song no longer recognized their state as a Jin vassal.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large <b>indemnities</b> for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war <b>indemnities,</b> and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
25|$|The Twain–Ament <b>indemnities</b> {{controversy}} was a {{major cause}} célèbre in the United States of America in 1901 {{as a consequence of}} the published reactions of American humorist Mark Twain to reports of Rev.

50|$|After the Franco-Prussian War, {{according}} to conditions of Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871), France {{was obliged to}} pay a war <b>indemnity</b> of 5 billion gold francs in 5 years. The <b>indemnity</b> was proportioned, {{according to}} population, to be the exact equivalent to the <b>indemnity</b> imposed by Napoleon on Prussia in 1807. German troops remained in parts of France until the last installment of the <b>indemnity</b> was paid in September 1873, ahead of schedule.|$|R
5000|$|The Divine Principle goes on {{to explain}} three types of <b>indemnity</b> {{conditions}}. Equal conditions of <b>indemnity</b> pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse [...] "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted {{as an example of}} an equal <b>indemnity</b> condition. Lesser conditions of <b>indemnity</b> provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples of lesser <b>indemnity</b> conditions. Greater conditions of <b>indemnity</b> come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid {{to make up for the}} earlier failure. Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-18) and the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater <b>indemnity</b> conditions. The Divine Principle then explains that an <b>indemnity</b> condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. <b>Indemnity,</b> at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a [...] "just and righteous" [...] God to work through mankind. Jesus' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity's history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The Divine Principle then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making <b>indemnity</b> conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen major changes to the medical <b>indemnity</b> system in Australia, the number and size of claims has soared, cover type has been restricted, {{premiums}} have become risk-rated {{and there has been}} a move from an unregulated system of mutual organisations offering discretionary cover to a regulated insurance market offering contractual agreements. Whilst medical <b>indemnity</b> is not mandatory for doctors, all physicians treating public patients in public hospitals have an <b>indemnity</b> policy covered by their employer. This paper provides a synopsis of the medical <b>indemnity</b> system; however, in light of events in 2003, with the resignations of more than 100 NSW and Queensland doctors being submitted, the paper will also attempt to provide an explanation as to why this medical <b>indemnity</b> crisis has come about.

25|$|Besides {{the payment}} of <b>indemnities</b> to soldiers, former combatants {{received}} 20 francs for each month spent on the front. Prisoners received 15 francs and were not recognised as veterans. Thus, prisoners united to try to claim their rights. The Fédération Nationale des Anciens Prisonniers de Guerre included 60,000 former prisoners. One of these wrote, “Our glory is to have had, instead of citations, ribbons and stripes, the honours of the post, the hot room, the cold room, the reprisal prison”. Politically, they managed to secure several rights, notably the ability to repatriate the bodies of soldiers {{who had died in}} captivity and especially to have them benefit from the distinction Mort pour la France, which they obtained in 1922. The Sarrebourg Necropolis was dedicated to them. However, the ex-prisoners did not manage to lay hold of the 1.26 billion francs in <b>indemnities</b> that they had claimed.|$|E
