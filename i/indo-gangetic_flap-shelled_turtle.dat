50|$|Large water birds such as spot-billed pelican {{and lesser}} {{adjutant}} visit the Kaudulla tank. Fish {{species in the}} tank include the freshwater Oreochromis mossambicus. Fejervarya pulla is an endemic amphibian to Sri Lanka that inhabits the National Park. Freshwater <b>turtles,</b> Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> and Indian black turtle are the noteworthy reptiles.|$|R
50|$|The faunal {{study by}} UNDP covered the herpetofaunal group. 14 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles have been recorded here; the list includes Indian python (Python molurus) an endangered species, Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lissemys punctata) of vulnerable category and muggar (Crocodylus palustris) and Varanus (Varanus bengalensis) of endangered category. Threats faced by these species have been noted as water shortage, traffic, and hunting by snake charmers.|$|R
50|$|Tilapia and mullet are the {{commonly}} fished varieties {{in the area}} while Channa spp. are also caught occasionally. Mugger crocodile, Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> and Indian black turtle are the common reptiles inhabiting the park. Mammals such as golden jackal, wild boar, Sri Lankan elephant, European otter, and fishing cat also visit the swamp to feed. The number of elephants roaming in the Kumana is estimated at 30-40.|$|R
40|$|Soft shell turtles {{are among}} the most {{threatened}} groups of freshwater animals that are in need of urgent conservation attention. In Kerala (South India), two species of freshwater turtles, the Indian black turtle or Indian pond terrapin, Melanochelys trijuga coronata (Schweigger, 1812) and the Indian <b>Flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> Lissemys punctata punctata (Lacépède, 1788) are exploited from Vembanad lake and associated wetlands in Punnamada to meet the demand from local restaurants and toddy shops. Eight hundred and forty three individuals belonging to the two species (499 pond terrapins and 344 <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle)</b> were observed during a field survey conducted in 2007 at Punnamada. Despite being listed at the highest level in the Indian wildlife protection act, very little law enforcement takes place and turtles are exploited and traded regularly. Collection and trade have also become {{an important component of the}} local livelihoods in Punnamada, with the involvement of around five full-time and 25 part-time collectors. Details of the collection, marketing, economics and management of the freshwater turtles in Punnamada are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Park {{reptiles}} {{include the}} Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans), common monitor (Varanus bengalensis), water monitor (Varanus salvator), black-tailed python (Python molurus), krait (Bungarus spp.), common cobra (Naja naja), mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), and estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). Other reptiles associated with aquatic habits are Indian black turtle (Melanochelys trijuga) and Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lissemys punctata). Of fishes barbs (Barbus spp.), giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy), snakeheads (Channa spp.), catfish (Siluriformes) and exotic tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) are predominant in the reservoirs.|$|R
25|$|The Sundarbans National Park houses an {{excellent}} number of reptiles as well. Some common ones are olive ridley turtles, sea snakes, dog-faced water snakes, green turtles, estuarine crocodiles, chameleons, king cobras, Russell's vipers, house geckos, monitor lizards, hawksbill turtles, pythons, common kraits, green vine snake, checkered keelbacks and rat snakes. The river terrapin (Batagur baska), Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> (Lissemys punctata), peacock soft-shelled turtles (Trionyx hurum), yellow monitors (Varanus flavescens), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator), and Indian pythons (Python molurus) are some resident species.|$|R
50|$|The {{freshwater}} fish {{are dominated by}} exotic species (i.e. Oreochromis spp., Osphronemus goramy) and also endemic species such as Esomus thermoicos, Garra ceylonensis, Schistura notostigma also have been recorded from the park. Important fish species of the villus are climbing perch Anabas testudineus, snakeheads Ophiocephalus stratus and O. parulius, Labeo sp., branded etroplus Etroplus suratensis, butter catfish Ompok bimaculatus and the introduced tilapia Tilapia mossambica. The marshy habitat harbors a large population of reptiles including natricine watersnakes, mugger crocodile Crocodylus palustris, and estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus. Indian black turtle Melanochelys trijuga and Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> Lissemys punctata are the other aquatic reptiles reported.|$|R
50|$|The largest wild {{breeding}} {{population of}} crocodiles in South India {{live in the}} reservoir, and in the Chinnar, Thennar and Pambar rivers that drain into it. These broad-snouted mugger crocodiles, also known as marsh crocodiles and Persian crocodiles, {{are the most common}} and widespread of the three species of crocodiles found in India. They eat fish, other reptiles, small and large mammals and are sometimes dangerous to humans. Their total wild population here is currently estimated to be 60 adults and 37 sub-adults. Other fish predators here include: Oriental small-clawed otters, Indian cormorants and Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Illegal {{wildlife}} {{trade is}} a great threat to the conservation efforts made worldwide to save wildlife species and their parts. Use of molecular methods, including DNA barcoding, is gaining acceptance to detect cross-border movement of endangered species. Here we report the utility of DNA barcoding in the detection of smuggling of an endangered turtle species from Pakistan. The consignment labeled as “fish meat” was intercepted at a Pakistani port and was tested for its source using DNA Barcoding with fish-specific primers. Sequences from the samples from this consignment matched (99 %) with those from Lissemys punctata (Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle),</b> a species listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This report highlights the problem of smuggling protected species under false pretenses {{and the importance of}} DNA barcoding in stopping such illegal trade...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 3528 {{specimens}} of freshwater turtles belonging to two families viz., Geoemydidae (brown river turtle, Kachuga smithi; Indian saw-backed turtle, K. tecta; Brahminy river turtle, Hardella thurgi; spotted pond turtle, Geoclemys hamiltonii) and Trionychidae (Indian soft-shell turtle, Aspederates gangeticus; peacock soft-shell turtle, A. hurum; narrow-headed soft-shell turtle, Chitra indica; Indian <b>flap-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Lissemys punciata) were identified. Kachuga smithi (43. 62 %) and K. tecta (42. 06 %) had abundant population status, whereas, Hardella thurgi (0. 88 %) and Chitra indica (0. 54 %) were rare. Capturing of turtles for supply to foreigners and export {{is a major}} threat to these animals. Fishermen also kill them during fishing. Canal closure and de-silting is also harmful to turtles. It is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} provide immediate legal protection/coverage to all turtle species under the Punjab Wildlife Act, 1974, Pakistan; otherwise turtle species will become extinct...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the brief {{introduction}} of Turtle Rescue and Conservation Centre (TRCC) and description of some rescued turtles. Nine specimens of turtles belonging to five genera were rescued and trans-located to the centre till date including 9. 3 kg male Indian Peacock soft-shelled turtle (Nilssonia hurum) {{for the first time}} from Jhapa district. The rescue operations were conducted for the translocation of turtles confiscated from the local market, censorial collectors, fisherman and public residence. The high resolution photographs of captured specimens, their necessary biometry and GPS coordinates of location were taken. Species identification was done with the help of and pictorial field guide and relevant literatures. Climatic data of study area were recorded from Gainde Irrigation Project, Maidhar, Jhapa. Interviews were taken during field visits with the help of structured questionnaire. Preliminary rescue data showed that the Indian <b>flap-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lissemys punctata) and Yellow bellied roofed turtle (Pangshura flaviventer) were the most overexploited species in the vicinities of the study area. The climatic condition of the rescue centre and water quality found suitable to support terrestrial and freshwater turtles and other various wetland flora and fauna. However, the rapid population growth and habitat destruction due to deforestation, unmanaged urbanization and expansion of agricultural land are found as the major threats to th...|$|R
