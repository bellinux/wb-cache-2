25|$|Alzheimer's {{disease and}} other types of {{dementia}} are among the disorders most commonly treated with music therapy. Like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of the most common significant effects are seen in social behaviors, leading to improvements in interaction, conversation, and other such skills. A meta-study of over 330 subjects showed music therapy produces highly significant improvements to social behaviors, overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and <b>face</b> <b>recognition</b> tests. As with many studies of MT's effectiveness, these positive effects on Alzheimer's and other dementias are not homogeneous among all studies. The effectiveness of the treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the patient, the quality and length of treatment, and other similar factors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Face</b> <b>recognition</b> {{technology}} {{can be used to}} gain access to a person's private data, according to a new study. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University combined image scanning, cloud computing and public profiles from social network sites to identify individuals in the offline world. Data captured even included a user's social security number. Experts have warned of the privacy risks faced by the increased merging of our online and offline identities. The researchers have also developed an 'augmented reality' mobile app that can display personal data over a person's image captured on a smartphone screen. Since these technologies are widely available, our future identities may become exposed to anyone with a smartphone and an Internet connection. Researchers believe this could force us to reconsider our future attitudes to privacy.|$|E

25|$|As it {{was said}} in the {{previous}} section, for specific case of translations and scaling, localization condition can be satisfied by use of generic Gabor templates. However, for general case (non-group) transformation, localization condition can be satisfied only for specific class of objects. More specifically, {{in order to satisfy}} the condition, templates must be similar to the objects one would like to recognize. For instance, if one would like to build a system to recognize 3D rotated faces, one need to use other 3D rotated faces as templates. This may explain the existence of such specialized modules in the brain as one responsible for <b>face</b> <b>recognition.</b> Even with custom templates, a noise-like encoding of images and templates is necessary for localization. It can be naturally achieved if the non-group transformation is processed on any layer other than the first in hierarchical recognition architecture.|$|E

Second, we use CS to extract local features of these five parts. Then, we respectively train five single SVM classifiers to achieve one to one feature recognition for local features. Finally, decision information fusion is used to achieve the final classification. Because SVM were successfully used to solve numerous pattern recognition problems and is mainly used to solve two-classification problem, selecting SVM to do gender recognition in our method has the obvious superiority.

Due to the non-rigid properties of faces, it is computationally expensive and difficult to achieve good recognition accuracy and robustness in <b>face</b> orientation <b>recognition.</b> In this paper, we propose an image mapping technique for face analysis in smart camera networks with a feature extraction and data from the facial feature.

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that face and object recognition are accomplished by distinct systems. For example, prosopagnosic patients show deficits in face, but not object processing, while object agnosic patients (most notably, patient C.K.) show deficits in object processing with spared face processing. Behaviorally, {{it has been}} shown that faces, but not objects, are subject to inversion effects, leading to the claim that faces are [...] "special". Further, face and object processing recruit distinct neural systems. Notably, some have argued that the apparent specialization of the human brain for face processing does not reflect true domain specificity, but rather a more general process of expert-level discrimination within a given class of stimulus, though this latter claim is the subject of substantial debate. Using fMRI and electrophysiology Doris Tsao and colleagues described brain regions and a mechanism for <b>face</b> <b>recognition</b> in macaque monkeys.|$|E
