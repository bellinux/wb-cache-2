After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and took it for the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to <b>just</b> <b>eat</b> it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{remained}} the company's symbol after selling it, traveling 200,000 {{miles a year}} on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what The New Yorker described as [...] "the force and variety of his swearing" [...] when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as [...] "the Colonel's chicken". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that [...] "it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and <b>just</b> <b>eat</b> the gravy" [...] but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him, he denounced it to the franchisee as [...] "God-damned slop" [...] or pushed it onto the floor. In 1973, Sanders sued Heublein Inc.—the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken—over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as being [...] "sludge" [...] with a [...] "wall-paper taste".|$|E

In February 2011, following Kat's return to EastEnders, Wallace was nominated for Best Actress at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards for her portrayal of Kat, and was also nominated alongside Richie for Best Comeback.

In September 2011, Kat and Andy's wedding was voted as a [...] "wedding from hell" [...] by Yahoo!. After the announcement that Kat is to have a miscarriage, Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said that after the baby swap storyline, this is perhaps [...] "too much agony for Kat to bear". An EastEnders source added that [...] "It is a cruel thing to happen to them after everything that they've already been through this year".|$|E

2500|$|In summer 2006, Brown started hosting The Contrarians, a 30-minute weekly show on CBC Radio One {{devoted to}} {{discussion}} of unpopular {{ideas in the}} Canadian context [...] "that just might be right". It consisted of Brown championing a controversial argument each episode {{to see if it}} had merit. The topics covered included a thesis that [...] "multiculturalism doesn't work, we <b>just</b> <b>eat</b> each other's sandwiches", a claim that feminism had basically achieved all its goals, a rejection of the widely held view that Canada is a 'good guy' on the global scene, etc. It aired Tuesdays at 9:30a.m. with a repeat the following day at 7:30p.m. The show ended once the new season began in the fall. According to Brown, the CBC brass didn't cancel the show due to being unhappy with its content, but because of catching wind of how difficult its production process was. Brown described his experience on the show as [...] "very difficult" [...] because the management wanted the show to be edgy and really push buttons while the different producers he was being paired with were uncomfortable with the subject matter because it often contradicted their personal convictions. He talked of the show's executive producer Lynda Shorten who simultaneously ran The Sunday Edition facing a near mutiny from her colleagues over the feminism episode and {{the relationship between the two}} souring as a result as he no longer enjoyed her support within the building.|$|E
