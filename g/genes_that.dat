5|$|In 2008, AML {{became the}} first cancer genome to be fully sequenced. DNA {{extracted}} from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin. The leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> had not previously {{been associated with the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|The human TBR1 gene {{is located}} on the q arm of the {{positive}} strand of chromosome 2. It is 8,954 base pairs in length. TBR1 is one of the three <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> make up the TBR1 subfamily of T-box genes. The two other <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> form the TBR1 subfamily are EOMES (also known as TBR2) and TBX21 (also known as T-BET). TBR1 is also known as T-box Brain Protein, T-Brain 1, and TES-56. The encoded protein consists of 682 amino acid residues and has a predicted molecular weight of 74,053 Da. It is composed of 6 exons.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> regulate a complex cluster of linked <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, GAPDH is encoded by {{a single}} <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> {{produces}} a single mRNA transcript with no known splice variants, though an isoform does exist as a separate <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> is expressed only in spermatozoa.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E
5|$|Bill McGinnis quickly {{discovered}} homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later {{also found in}} fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> controlled development across all the eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations in the <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> decide plumage colour are very common and {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of nosocomial ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae {{was correlated with}} production of a ceftazidime-hydrolyzing enzyme with an isoelectric point of 5. 6 (BMH- 1). BMH- 1 was encoded on a large transferable plasmid conferring multiple antibiotic resistance. The <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> encodes BMH- 1 was identical to the <b>gene</b> <b>that</b> encodes the TEM- 26 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase...|$|R
5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E
5|$|Essential genes include Housekeeping genes (critical {{for basic}} cell functions) {{as well as}} <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> are {{expressed}} at different times in the organisms development or life cycle. Housekeeping genes are used as experimental controls when analysing gene expression, since they are constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level.|$|E
5|$|In {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important {{groups of}} developmental genes {{show the same}} variety in cnidarians as in chordates.

5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs.

5|$|Mitochondria {{have their}} own genetic material, and the {{machinery}} to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins (see: protein biosynthesis). A published human mitochondrial DNA sequence revealed 16,569base pairs encoding 37 genes: 22tRNA, 2 rRNA, and 13peptide genes. The 13 mitochondrial peptides in humans are integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane, along with proteins encoded by <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> reside in the host cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost.

5|$|Some noncoding DNA {{sequences}} play structural {{roles in}} chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but {{are important for}} the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material {{for the creation of}} new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence.|$|E
5|$|Some {{traits are}} governed by only a single gene, but most traits are {{influenced}} by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes can produce a continuum of possible phenotypic values.|$|E

50|$|K-12 is a mutant form of E-coli that over-expresses {{the enzyme}} Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).

5|$|The DNA repair {{ability of}} a cell {{is vital to the}} {{integrity}} of its genome and thus to the normal functionality of that organism. Many <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> were initially shown to influence life span {{have turned out to be}} involved in DNA damage repair and protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{believed}} to occur when there is susceptibility, {{or a lack of}} immune system resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several <b>genes</b> <b>that</b> are found predominantly in individuals of East Asian descent.
