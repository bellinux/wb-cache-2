5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music <b>is</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> ambient.|$|E

5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 <b>is</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon <b>is</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of neural classifier outputs shows that, {{in case of}} MLP, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will be far to be the identified fault class. In case of RBF, the outputs are distances from RBF centers. In this case with a new scale of outputs it is easily to make output class values varying between [0, c], where c is a constant to be determined (e.g., see Sect.  5.1, Fig.  7 a–c). Then, more the output which is a distance <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> c and more this output will be far {{to be identified as}} fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. From this purpose, one interesting way to built efficient decision-making from two neural classifiers is fuzzy logic [18, 19].|$|R
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption <b>is</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Capella <b>is</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> {{the north}} {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile {{as well as the}} Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Extant bats of Puerto Rico {{belong to}} five {{families}} (Noctilionidae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae) {{and include a}} total of 13 species, of which six subspecies are endemic to the archipelago. Seven of the 13 species are insectivores, four can be considered frugivores, one species feeds on nectar and another on fish. The species total is a relatively low number {{in comparison to the}} other Greater Antilles. Jamaica, for example, with an area approximately 1.2 times that of Puerto Rico, has 21 species (1.6 times that of Puerto Rico). A possible explanation for this is the comparatively large distance between the archipelago and the mainland dispersion areas. Jamaica, for example, <b>is</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Cuba and Hispaniola which are themselves closer to the mainland dispersion areas of North and Central America.|$|E
