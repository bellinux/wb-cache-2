5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

By September, however, {{he was back}} in the south of England at Buckingham, where Constantine witnessed a charter as subregulus, that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan's overlordship. In 935 a charter was attested by Constantine, Owain of Strathclyde, Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and Morgan ap Owain. At Christmas of the same year Owain of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> circumstances.|$|E

50|$|The idea {{of using}} the travel of an {{elephant}} across different countries {{as the focus of}} a historical novel was also taken up by the well-known Portuguese writer José Saramago, in the 2008 novel A Viagem do Elefante (The Voyage of the Elephant), though <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> literary style from de Camp's and set <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> time (16th Century Europe) (see http://blog.josesaramago.org/indexeng.php).|$|R
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> styles: Alessandro acts {{in a formal}} manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is awkward and difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> ways. Various mostly {{unofficial}} memorials {{were set up}} on the western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E

25|$|This {{shows that}} at least some {{clusters}} consist of functionally related genes. However, there are great exceptions. Spellman and Rubin have shown that there are clusters of co-expressed genes that are not functionally related. It seems like that clusters appear <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> forms.|$|E
25|$|Outlined {{below are}} the leading lines of {{evidence}} on how different aspects of mycorrhizal fungi may alter soil carbon decomposition and storage.

25|$|In practice, {{matching}} the Reynolds number {{is not on}} its own sufficient to guarantee similitude. Fluid flow is generally chaotic, and very small changes to shape and surface roughness can result <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> flows.

These include deep-sea sedimentation, effusive volcanic lava flows, explosive volcanism, an intrusion of granite, mineralisation and finally glacial sculpting. To understand the geology of Clough Head is to understand much of the geology of the Lake District.|$|E
25|$|An {{archaeology}} of the senses, including archaeological optics, {{emphasizes that}} the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This acknowledges that the senses were {{likely to have been}} used and understood <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> ways by people through time.|$|E
25|$|However, names {{similar to}} Alan (e.g. Aryan and Iron) were clearly used by distantly-related Iranian tribes <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{historical}} contexts and {{the identification of}} the Alans with the Asii requires them to have migrated more than 2,800 kilometres (1,750 miles) in the space of several decades.

25|$|Wild {{pollinator}}s often visit a {{large number}} of plant species and plants are visited by {{a large number}} of pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators.

This structure was found to be similar <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.|$|E

25|$|Paynter was {{a member}} of the Federalist Party like the {{majority}} in Sussex County. While elsewhere the Federalists were declining as an effective political force, in lower Delaware they organized themselves well, and were far more acceptable to the agrarian, Anglican and Methodist establishment, than the Irish Presbyterians who dominated the majority Democratic-Republican Party <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> New Castle County. Statewide elections were competitive, but the three counties were similar in population, and so the Federalists almost always won, both in the General Assembly and governorship.|$|E

25|$|Famous {{players and}} {{football}} figures often give their {{opinion on the}} Maradona and Pelé rivalry, sometimes choosing one over the other. Others prefer not to compare them, as they played <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> times. Perhaps {{one of the most}} reliable comparisons available is that by the Ballon d'Or winners (elected since 1956 by voters of several countries, and arguably greatest ones to properly appreciate both players). Pelé was elected Best Player of the Century for Ballon d'Or winners and Maradona was the runner-up.|$|E
25|$|Business-oriented {{observers}} {{explained the}} recession and recovery <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> terms from the Keynesian economists. They argued the New Deal had been very hostile to business expansion in 1935–37. They said it had encouraged massive strikes which had {{a negative impact on}} major industries and had threatened anti-trust attacks on big corporations. But all those threats diminished sharply after 1938. For example, the antitrust efforts fizzled out without major cases. The CIO and AFL unions started battling each other more than corporations, and tax policy became more favorable to long-term growth.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{language}} learning in classrooms {{focused more on}} reading and writing than on speaking.

One approach is use a video-call technology such as Skype to pair off two students who wish to learn each other's native language. One obvious advantage of using such technology {{is that there is}} no need for the two students to be geographically close. Though if they are <b>in</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> time-zones, finding a suitable time can be a challenge.|$|E
