50|$|ATI {{entered the}} mobile {{computing}} sector by introducing 3D-graphics acceleration to laptops in 1996. The Mobility product line {{had to meet}} requirements {{different from those of}} desktop PCs, such as minimized power usage, reduced heat output, TMDS output capabilities for laptop screens, and maximized integration. In 1997, ATI acquired Tseng Labs's <b>graphics</b> <b>assets,</b> which included 40 engineers.|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} parts of the gameworld all had their own specific <b>graphics</b> <b>assets.</b> The vegetation such as ground texture, trees, bushes and such were all different for the separate parts of the world.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of 3 D <b>graphics</b> <b>assets</b> and applications standards. The authors analyzed the three main open standards dealing with three-dimensional (3 -D) graphics content and applications, X 3 D, COLLADA, and MPEG 4, to clarify the role of each {{with respect to the}} following criteria: ability to describe only the <b>graphics</b> <b>assets</b> in a synthetic 3 -D scene or also its behavior as an application, compression capacities, and appropriateness for authoring, transmission, and publishing. COLLADA could become the interchange format for authoring tools; MPEG 4 on top of it (as specified in MPEG- 4 Part 25), the publishing format for graphics assets; and X 3 D, the standard for interactive applications, enriched by MPEG- 4 compression in the case of online ones. The authors also mentioned that in order to build a mobile application, a developer has to consider different hardware configurations and performances, different operating systems, different screen sizes, and input controls...|$|R

50|$|JavaFX Mobile was the {{implementation}} of the JavaFX platform for rich Internet applications aimed at mobile devices. JavaFX Mobile 1.x applications can be developed in the same language, JavaFX Script, as JavaFX 1.x applications for browser or desktop, and using the same tools: JavaFX SDK and the JavaFX Production Suite. This concept makes it possible to share code-base and <b>graphics</b> <b>assets</b> for desktop and mobile applications. Through integration with Java ME, the JavaFX applications have access to capabilities of the underlying handset, such as the filesystem, camera, GPS, bluetooth or accelerometer.|$|R
5000|$|JavaFX 1.1 {{was based}} on the concept of a [...] "common profile" [...] that is {{intended}} to span across all devices supported by JavaFX. This approach makes it possible for developers to use a common programming model while building an application targeted for both desktop and mobile devices and to share much of the code, <b>graphics</b> <b>assets</b> and content between desktop and mobile versions. To address the need for tuning applications on a specific class of devices, the JavaFX 1.1 platform includes API that are desktop or mobile-specific. For example JavaFX Desktop profile includes Swing and advanced visual effects.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} is {{that initial}} cloning of a repository is slower {{as compared to}} centralized checkout, because all branches and revision history are copied to your local machine. This may be significant if access speed is slow and the repository size is large enough. For instance, {{the size of the}} cloned git repository (all history, branches, tags, etc.) for the Linux kernel is approximately the size of the checked-out uncompressed HEAD, whereas the equivalent checkout of a single branch in a centralized checkout would be the compressed size of the contents of HEAD (except without any history, branches, tags, etc.). Another problem with DVCS is the lack of locking mechanisms that is part of most centralized VCS and still plays an important role when it comes to non-mergeable binary files such as <b>graphic</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|R
500|$|The game uses an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the Dinosaur Hunter engine, which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real-time. The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they could in the original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises. As Dienstbier explained, [...] "That's something that we learned from Miyamoto: Start things off simple and gradually add to it as you progress. Later objectives will make far more use of the dynamic environments." [...] Unlike the original game, where levels shared <b>graphic</b> <b>assets,</b> Seeds of Evil features unique levels with different geometry, textures and enemies.|$|R

40|$|International audienceObjective {{visual quality}} {{assessment}} of 3 D models {{is a fundamental}} issue in computer graphics. Quality assessment metrics may allow {{a wide range of}} processes to be guided and evaluated, such as level of detail creation, compression, filtering and so on. Most computer <b>graphics</b> <b>assets</b> are composed of geometric surfaces on which several texture images can be mapped to make the rendering more realistic. While some quality assessment metrics exist for geometric surfaces, almost no research has been conducted on the evaluation of texture-mapped 3 D models. In this context, we present a new subjective study to evaluate the perceptual quality of textured meshes, based on a paired comparison protocol. We introduce both texture and geometry distortions on a set of 5 reference models to produce a database of 136 distorted models, evaluated using two rendering protocols. Based on analysis of the results, we propose two new metrics for visual quality assessment of textured mesh, as optimized linear combinations of accurate geometry and texture quality measurements. These proposed perceptual metrics outperform their counterparts in terms of correlation with human opinion. The database, along with the associated subjective scores, will be made publicly available on-line...|$|R
40|$|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is {{reported}} to be caused by traumatic events that are outside the range of usual human experiences including (but not limited to) military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped or taken hostage and terrorist attacks. Initial data suggests that 1 out of 6 Iraq War veterans are exhibiting symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Virtual Reality (VR) exposure treatment has been used in previous treatments of PTSD patients with reports of positive outcomes. The aim of the current paper is to present the rationale, technical specifications, application features and user-centered design process {{for the development of a}} Virtual Iraq PTSD VR therapy application. The VR treatment environment is being created via the recycling of virtual <b>graphic</b> <b>assets</b> that were initially built for the U. S. Army-funded combat tactical simulation scenario and commercially successful X-Box game, Full Spectrum Warrior, in addition to other available and newly created assets. Thus far we have created a series of customizable virtual scenarios designed to represent relevant contexts for exposure therapy to be conducted in VR, including a city and desert road convoy environment. User-Centered tests with the application are currently underway at the Naval Medical Center–San Diego and within an Army Combat Stress Control Team in Iraq with clinical trials scheduled to commence in February 2006...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the game}} was {{unavailable}} commercially for many years it was re-released as freeware around 2003 to promote {{the development of the}} successor Ironseed II / Ironseed Reborn. As progress {{on the development of the}} successor and further patching of Ironseed was unlikely, the source code of [...] "Ironseed 1" [...] was released by the developers to the public under the GPL in March 2013. A final patch (v1.20.0016) was released with the source code, but also the forum was shut down. Later version 1.30.0001 was put on GitHub, for the first time including the <b>graphic</b> <b>assets</b> and sound effects under GPL, but the commercial DMP sound module stripped out to comply with its license. From the source code release missing is also the soundtrack, while it seems the rights on the soundtrack still belong to the developers. For instance, Morgan redistributes the soundtrack on his personal website and also the freeware release included the soundtrack. On September 2013, due to availability of the source code, a FreePascal and SDL based port for Linux became available on GitHub. In August 2015 the Ironseed.com mainsite went offline without warnings, but came back online in January 2016 under a new ironseed.net domain. In April 2016 {{the game was}} ported to the ARM-based Pandora handheld, based on the previous Linux port.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first stage}} of Atlus' {{localization}} process is familiarization with the game. The time the developers can access the game varies, with this stage beginning after completion of the master version for in-house products and after release for third-party titles.

This approach is vital as, from the main scenario to potential side quests or other smaller narrative elements, {{it was important to}} know context and point-of-view so they could be accurately localized. The localization process begins after this, taking varying lengths of time depending on the project: some took a very short time, while others required several months work. If there is voiced dialogue, the English voice recording can further extend the process. The programming stage, where the localized assets are inserted into the game, is given to the original developers as Atlus USA have no in-house programmers. After this comes the quality assurance (QA) testing, necessary to find and correct any bugs or text typos that occurred during the programming stage. Finally the game is sent for manufacturer approval, before moving to manufacturing. Further programming and QA work may be needed if the manufacturer is unsatisfied, and the manufacturing process can take varying amounts of time based on the game's medium. Their QA process was reassessed following the release of [...] in 2016, which had unlocalized text which appeared under certain circumstances.

[...] A year later, seven employees from Axis Digital Print and Imaging joined Gilson Graphics, adding short run color, variable data printing, and large format capabilities. In late 2002, Gilson Graphics opened its educational composition and quality control department in Atlantic, Iowa, working mainly on standardized testing material. In early 2003, Chris Gilson started North Star Teacher Resources to design, produce, and distribute its {{own line of}} educational material. [...] In 2006, Gilson <b>Graphics</b> acquired <b>assets</b> of two companies - Photolith, Inc. (which increased sales and prepress capabilities) and Commercial Printing Co.

Acquiring assets of Commercial Printing Co., a former winner of the national Addy Awards, led to the addition of Ignition, a division within Gilson Graphics that offers multimedia services. In early 2009, Gilson Graphics also purchased selected assets of Integra Printing, Inc., adding about 70 employees {{as well as a}} new headquarters. This move expanded the company's capabilities with offset and digital printing and created a Fulfillment and Mailing Services department, altogether nearly doubling sales revenue.
