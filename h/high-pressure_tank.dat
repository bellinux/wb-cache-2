A contract to develop an ACES testbed was placed with Marquardt and General Dynamics, with Garrett AiResearch building the heat exchanger for cooling the air. The original ACES design was fairly complex; the air was first liquified in the heat exchanger cooled by liquid hydrogen fuel, then pumped into a low-pressure tank for short-term storage. From there it was then pumped into a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tank,</b> where the oxygen was separated and the rest (mostly nitrogen) was dumped overboard.

50|$|A {{resuscitator}} is {{a device}} using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an unconscious {{person who is}} not breathing, {{in order to keep}} them oxygenated and alive. There are three basic types: a manual version (also known as a bag valve mask) consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tank.</b> The second type is the Expired Air or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an oxygen powered resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.|$|E

A locally isolated air pocket creates distinct amplitude, shape {{and timing of}} pressure pulses. This paper investigates dynamic behaviour of a single trapped air pocket. The air pocket is incorporated as a boundary condition into the discrete gas cavity model (DGCM).

40|$|Cold-gas {{propulsion}} systems are {{well suited for}} some applications because they are simple to design and build, have low operating costs, and are non-toxic. The inherent tradeoff, however, is their relatively low impulse density. Nevertheless, a modest propulsion system, sized for Cubesats and designed for affordability, presents an attractive system solution for some missions, such as an on-orbit inspection free-flyer. NASA has a long-standing effort to develop {{propulsion systems}} appropriate for very high delta-V cubesat missions, such as geo transfer orbits, and there are commercially available Cubesat propulsion systems with considerably more impulse capability, but, these are both prohibitively expensive for some development customers and face compatibility constraints for crewed applications, such as operation within ISS. A relatively conventional cold-gas system has been developed at NASA/JSC taking advantage of existing miniature industrial components, additive manufacturing techniques and in-house qualification of the system. The result is a nearly modular system with a 1 U form factor. Compressed nitrogen is stored in a small <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tank,</b> then regulated and distributed to 12 thrusters.

40|$|In a laboratory-based test series, seven {{experiments}} along {{a simulated}} Pacific hydrotherm at 152 °W, 40 °N {{were carried out}} to measure the rise velocities of liquefied CO 2 droplets under (clathrate) hydrate forming conditions. The impact of a hydrate skin on the rising behavior was investigated {{by comparing the results}} with those from outside the field of hydrate stability at matching buoyancy. A thermostatted <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tank</b> was used to establish conditions along the natural oceanic hydrotherm. Under P-/T-conditions allowing hydrate formation, the majority of the droplets quickly developed a skin of CO 2 hydrate upon contact with seawater. Rise rates of these droplets support the parametrization by Chen et al. (Tellus 2003, 55 B, 723 − 730), which is based on empirical equations developed to match momentum of hydrate covered, deformed droplets. Our data do not support other parametrizations recently suggested in the literature. In the experiments from 5. 7 MPa, 4. 8 °C to 11. 9 MPa, 2. 8 °C positive and negative deviations from predicted rise rates occurred, which we propose were caused by lacking hydrate formation and reflect intact droplet surface mobility and droplet shape oscillations, respectively. This interpretation is supported by rise rates measured at P-/T-conditions outside the hydrate stability field at the same liquid CO 2 -seawater density difference (Δρ) matching the rise rates of the deviating data within the stability field. The results also show that droplets without a hydrate skin ascend up to 50 % faster than equally buoyant droplets with a hydrate skin. This feature has {{a significant impact on the}} vertical pattern of dissolution of liquid CO 2 released into the ocean. The experiments and data presented considerably reduce the uncertainty of the parametrization of CO 2 droplet rise velocity, which in the past emerged partly from their scarcity and contradictions in constraints of earlier experiments...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Metal surfaces, and particularly steels, may be modified by processes which include; plastic-deformation, chemical changes and heating. These layers are often characterised by high hardness and a pronounced resistance to chemical etching. This latter characteristic giving rise to the generically descriptive term "White Layer", which is often applied to such features. Processes which may result {{in the formation of}} "White Layer" can be broadly separated into three groups; thermal, chemical and mechanical. In practice, "White Layers" observed on materials removed from service environments have generally experienced a combination of these processes. In this work white-etching layers formed on engineering steels have been characterised, using a variety of electron beam and X-ray analytical techniques, to establish the chemical nature and structural properties of "white layer" material. Specimens drawn from such diverse service applications as; <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tank</b> gun barrels, digger-teeth from gravel extraction plant and adiabatically-sheared armour steel have been compared with samples produced in the laboratory by conventional pin-on-disc wear testing apparatus, specialised machining techniques and laser surface-hardening heat-treatment. The presence of a hard white-etching layer on each of the samples was first established using metallographic examination by light microscopy and microhardness testing to confirm the etch-resistance and high hardness of the white-layer. The chemical composition of the whiteetching layer was then compared with the bulk steel composition using scanning electron microscopy and conventional microprobe analysis (Z > 11), and no significant differences were observed. Light element microprobe analysis and SIMS showed an increase in H, C, N, 0 in the white-etching layers formed within gun barrels, and on abusively turned steel. The levels detected were not considered to be significant in terms of white-layer formation but may well have an influence on strain aging and embrittlement phenomena. A technique for the preparation of cross-sectional thin foils was developed which allowed the structure of the white-etching layers to be compared with the underlying matrix by TEM and electron diffraction. The results of this study showed clear similarities between white-etching layers formed by wear and abusive machining and those formed by adiabatic shear. From these results it is concluded that " white layer " is a fine grain martensite which forms on steel as a result of thermo-mechanical transformation...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{relatively}} safe, compact, efficient recharging of a high-pressure room-temperature gas supply has been proposed. In this method, the gas would be liquefied {{at the source}} for transport as a cryogenic fluid at or slightly above atmospheric pressure. Upon reaching the destination, a simple heating/expansion process {{would be used to}} (1) convert the transported cryogenic fluid to the room-temperature, high-pressure gaseous form in which it is intended to be utilized and (2) transfer the resulting gas to the storage tank of the system to be recharged. In conventional practice for recharging high-pressure-gas systems, gases are transported at room temperature in high-pressure tanks. For recharging a given system to a specified pressure, a transport tank must contain the recharge gas at a much higher pressure. At the destination, the transport tank is connected to the system storage tank to be recharged, and the pressures in the transport tank and the system storage tank are allowed to equalize. One major disadvantage of the conventional approach is that the high transport pressure poses a hazard. Another disadvantage is the waste of a significant amount of recharge gas. Because the transport tank is disconnected from the system storage tank when it is at the specified system recharge pressure, the transport tank still contains a significant amount of recharge gas (typically on the order of half of the amount transported) that cannot be used. In the proposed method, the cryogenic fluid would be transported in a suitably thermally insulated tank that would be capable of withstanding the recharge pressure of the destination tank. The tank would be equipped with quick-disconnect fluid-transfer fittings and with a low-power electric heater (which would not be used during transport). In preparation for transport, a relief valve would be attached via one of the quick-disconnect fittings (see figure). During transport, the interior of the tank would be kept at a near-ambient pressure far below the recharge pressure. As leakage of heat into the tank caused vaporization of the cryogenic fluid, the resulting gas would be vented through the relief valve, which would be set to maintain the pressure in the tank at the transport value. Inasmuch as the density of a cryogenic fluid at atmospheric pressure greatly exceeds that of the corresponding gas in a practical <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tank</b> at room temperature, a tank for transporting a given mass of gas according to the proposed method could be smaller (and, hence, less massive) than is a tank needed for transporting the same mass of gas according to the conventional method...|$|E

30|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{recognized}} for some time as providing a potential foundation for a clean, flexible, and secure energy future. The {{fact that it is}} accessible in the form of water makes hydrogen highly attractive. When hydrogen is used as a fuel, either by combustion or electrochemically in a fuel cell, the only byproduct is water—a feature that promises an emission-free environment. While the combustion of hydrogen produces more energy on a mass basis (39.5  kWh/kg) 6 than the combustion of any other fuel—e.g., 2.4 and 2.8 times the energy of methane and gasoline combustion, respectively [29]—hydrogen has low energy density by volume.

Since liquefying hydrogen is highly energy intensive, and thus not practical, hydrogen is most effectively stored as a gas in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>tanks.</b> Given its simple chemical structure, it is one of a very small group of fuels capable of being used in low-temperature fuel cells, thereby making it the fuel of choice for fuel cell-powered vehicles [30].|$|R
