50|$|These aspects {{together}} {{make up the}} speaker's model number. For example: a Jensen C8R {{speaker is}} eight inches in size, and has a 10 Oz ceramic magnet. All Jensen speakers also include a date and manufacturer's code. Jensen's source code is 220. Accompanying the company specific (EIA) code (220) is the last digit {{of the year and}} the 2 digits of the week manufactured, creating a 6 digit code usually imprinted on the speaker edge or the magnet housing. Thus a code of 220534 would denote a Jensen speaker manufactured in either 1955 or 1965 on the 34th week of that year. Most speaker (and other <b>electronic</b> <b>component)</b> <b>manufacturers</b> began adding the last 2 digits {{of the year in the}} 1970s, so the 6 digit code became a 7-digit code.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> <b>manufacturers</b> convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat Packages (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|R

40|$|This {{descriptive}} study explores {{the reasons for}} integration of the personal selling function, i. e., the use of employee (“direct”) salespeople rather than manufacturers' representatives (“reps”). A hypothesized model is developed based on both transaction cost analysis and the sales force management literature. Data from 13 <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> <b>manufacturers</b> covering 159 U. S. sales districts are used to estimate a logistic model of the probability of “going direct” in a given district. Results are shown to be stable across specification and estimation methods and to fit the data well. The transaction cost model is generally supported. The principal finding is that the greater the difficulty of evaluating a salesperson's performance, the more likely the firm to substitute surveillance for commission as a control mechanism, i. e., to use a direct sales force. Among other findings, direct sales forces are also associated with complex, hard-to-learn product lines and with districts that demand considerable nonselling activities. Several factors prove unrelated, including company size, the amount of travel a district requires, {{and the importance of}} key accounts. organizational design, organization control, sales force management, vertical integration...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the thermal regulation of electronic circuits confined in a closed cubical air-filled cavity. The hot active wall, which represents the electronic equipment, is composed of three parallel discrete heat source bands subjected to a constant heat flux, separated by two adiabatic bands. The second active wall is an isothermal cold plate and is facing the hot wall. The cavity channel is considered adiabatic. Transient heat exchanges through 2 D natural convection are analysed for several configurations obtained through varying the inclination angle of the active wall with respect to gravity. The numerical approach conducted with the finite volumes method allowed the derivation of the thermal and dynamic characteristics of the cavity. The thermal evolution of the sources does not show any local temperature peaks that could exceed the maximum allowable temperature set by the <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> This guarantees the normal operation of the equipment. The numerical analysis is complemented by experimental measurements that validate the used model and allow the correct sizing of the airborne electronic circuits.

40|$|NASA {{technology}} has made commercially available a new, inexpensive, conveniently-carried device for protection, of people exposed to potentially dangerous levels of microwave radiation. Microwaves are radio emissions of extremely high frequency. They can be hazardous but {{the degree of}} hazard is not yet well understood. Generally, {{it is believed that}} low intensity radiation of short duration is not harmful but that exposure to high levels can induce deep internal burns, affecting the circulatory and nervous systems, and particularly the eyes. The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established an allowable safe threshold of exposure. However, people working near high intensity sources of microwave energy-for example, radar antennas and television transmitters-may be unknowingly exposed to radiation levels beyond the safe limit. This poses not only a personal safety problem but also a problem for employers in terms of productivity loss, workman's compensation claims and possible liability litigation. Earlier-developed monitoring devices which warn personnel of dangerous radiation levels have their shortcomings. They can be cumbersome and awkward to use while working. They also require continual visual monitoring to determine if a person is in a dangerous area of radiation, and they are relatively expensive, another deterrent to their widespread adoption. In response to the need for a cheaper and more effective warning system, Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed, under NASA auspices, a new, battery-powered Microwave Radiation Hazard Detector. To bring the product to the commercial market, California Institute Research Foundation, the patent holder, granted an exclusive license to Cicoil Corporation, Chatsworth, California, an <b>electronic</b> <b>components</b> <b>manufacturer...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, a global {{effort has been}} started towards the {{implementation}} of energy efficient electronics. Silicon carbide (SiC), a wide band-gap semiconductor {{is one of the}} potential candidates to replace the widespread silicon (Si) which enabled and dominates today’s world of electronics. It has been demonstrated that devices based on SiC lead to a drastic reduction of energy losses in electronic systems. This will help to limit the global energy consumption and the introduction of renewable energy generation systems to a competitive price. Active research has been dedicated to SiC since the 1980 ’s. As a result, a mature SiC growth technology has been developed and 4  inch SiC wafers are today commercially available. Research and development activities on the fabrication of SiC devices have also been carried out and resulted in the commercialization of SiC devices. In 2011, Schottky barrier diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and junction field effect transistors can be purchased from several <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> However, the device mostly used in electronics, the metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is only recently commercially available in SiC. This delay is due to critical technology issues related to reliability and stability of the device, which still challenge many researchers all over the world. This thesis summarizes the main challenges of the SiC MOSFET fabrication process. State of the art technology modules like the gate stack formation, the drain/source ohmic contact formation, and the passivation layer deposition are considered and contributions of this work to the development of these technology modules is reported.

40|$|Most managers, {{when confronted}} with a {{difficult}} strategic decision, {{would like to know}} what is the prevailing practice in their industry. Prevailing practice interests managers, in part, because it may indicate which decisions are good, even "best. " The rationale is "Darwinian economics," which proposes that competitive markets operate to force at least an approximation of optimal behavior, because "wrong" decisions are extinguished by the market mechanism. If so, the bulk of survivors make good business decisions and their collective practice is worth knowing, meaning it should be difficult to improve upon. This paper tests whether prevailing practice represents "good" decisions. The context is the decision whether to fill a sales district with a company (integrated) sales force or with outside agents (independents). The outcome of the choice is the ratio of sales to the cost of running the sales force, i. e., selling efficiency. A model is described which summarizes industry decisions, and two propositions are developed. Proposition 1, a simple version, states that efficiency declines as firms depart from the industry rule as to when they should integrate. Proposition 2, a contingent version, states that efficiency declines as firms depart from the industry rule in unpredictable selling environments but that conforming to the rule has no impact in predictable environments. The rationale is that firms learn the environment well enough to know when to depart from the rule in predictable settings but not otherwise. The relationship between efficiency and conformity to prevailing practice is examined for 93 sales districts of 11 recognized <b>electronic</b> <b>component</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> The results support proposition 2 : the most efficient sales forces conform to prevailing practice and the least efficient deviate, but only in uncertain environments. In more certain environments, conformity and efficiency are unrelated. Implications (such as when it pays to be different) and suggestions for future research are discussed. sales force management, organization effectiveness, organization design, organization economics...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of a global {{movement}} away from using lead (Pb) in <b>electronic</b> assemblies, <b>component</b> <b>manufacturers</b> are increasingly applying Tin-rich finishes to the leads of their devices. Unfortunately, this can create a risk of Tin whisker formation that can result in electrical failures if the gap between two adjacent component leads is bridged by a whisker. If bridging occurs, the effects can range from no effect to parametric system deviations to catastrophic circuit failure. Tin whisker risk management typically involves an evaluation of Tin plating attributes, base material of the component leads, underplating, lead-gap spacing, conformal coating, system use environment, and system reliability requirements. As an integral part of this management, a computational framework capable of quantifying the risk associated with Tin whisker-bridging failures is needed so that appropriate design, maintenance, and warranty decisions can be made. In the present work, a probabilistic model based on measured whisker observations is constructed. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation methods and quantifies the risk of Tin whiskers bridging the gap between two adjacent component leads. A dual-tail constraint strategy for constructing the whisker length probability density functions was established and applied to long and short-term bright Tin whisker length measurements. A bridging risk map also was developed to illustrate the relationship between lead-gap spacing, years of service life, and bridging risk. It was found that forming non-dimensional lead-gap spacing parameters provided useful insight into the risk posed by Tin whiskers...|$|R
40|$|Motivation There is a {{critical}} need to obtain accurate and reliable crash data suitable for accident reconstruction to improve vehicle and highway safety.
