5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is <b>introduced</b> species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by <b>introduced</b> house mice. <b>Introduced</b> species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands <b>introduced</b> plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E

Failed flash guards result in the player character taking extra damage compared to failing to defend at all. Memories of Celceta <b>introduces</b> a flash dodge where a player character dodges just before a hit. A successful flash dodge results in time slowing down for the enemy whose attack was just avoided.|$|R

5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were <b>introduced</b> in the 20th century; the coypu was <b>introduced</b> for farming in the 1990s, and the muskrat was <b>introduced</b> in the early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965. The Siberian tiger and Japanese sea lion have probably been extirpated from Korea, but are still included in standard lists of Korean mammals.|$|E
5|$|Around twenty {{non-native}} {{species of}} flora have been <b>introduced</b> to Caroline Island via human contact. Among {{these are the}} vine Ipomoea violacea, which has begun to proliferate.

5|$|Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland noted it {{occurring}} under larch (Larix), oak, pine, birch {{and other}} <b>introduced</b> trees in South Australia in 1934, {{and it has}} subsequently been recorded in New South Wales, Victoria (where it was found near Betula and Populus) and Western Australia. It has been recorded under <b>introduced</b> birch (Betula) and hazel (Corylus) in New Zealand. Mycologist Rolf Singer reported a similar situation in South America, with the species recorded under <b>introduced</b> trees in Chile. It {{is likely to have}} been transported to those countries in the soil of imported European trees.|$|E
5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies were <b>introduced</b> to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, {{where it}} was <b>introduced</b> on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, {{there appears to be}} a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by <b>introduced</b> bird species, and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an <b>introduced</b> species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E

China is the major importer, purchasing 65,000 tonnes in 1999, followed by Singapore with 40,000 tonnes and Taiwan with 5,000 tonnes.

5|$|Early games {{did not use}} any on-field {{officials}} but {{disputes between}} the players would be referred to a committee member. Umpires were <b>introduced</b> {{by the end of}} 1862. Two umpires were used; one from each club. The off-field referee was <b>introduced</b> for the Youdan Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871. The umpires would then appeal to the referee on behalf of their team. The concept was later <b>introduced</b> to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the referee moved onto the pitch and the umpires became linesmen. The umpire's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874.|$|E
