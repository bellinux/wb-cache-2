5|$|On July 6, 2013, Fernández was {{selected}} to represent the Miami Marlins for the National League All Star team. He pitched a perfect 6th inning in the 2013 All-Star Game in which he struck out Dustin Pedroia, induced Miguel Cabrera to pop up for a <b>flyout</b> and struck Chris Davis out. With this performance, Fernández {{is one of only}} three pitchers {{in the history of the}} All-Star Game who struck out two batters prior to their 21st birthday for their All-Star debut, the other two being Dwight Gooden and Bob Feller.|$|E
25|$|NCAC resumed its advance late in 1944, {{although}} it was progressively weakened by the <b>flyout</b> of Chinese troops to the main front in China. On 10 December 1944, the 36th British Infantry Division on NCAC's right flank made contact with units of Fourteenth Army near Indaw in Northern Burma. Five days later, Chinese troops on the command's left flank captured the city of Bhamo.|$|E

5|$|Humber {{finished}} {{the game with}} nine strikeouts; the other batters were retired with five groundouts and 13 <b>flyouts.</b> Humber threw only 96 pitches, making this the first perfect game thrown in under 100 pitches since David Cone's perfect game on July 18, 1999. Humber had only started 29 Major League games prior to throwing his perfect game, making him the pitcher with the second fewest starts prior to throwing a perfect game, behind fellow White Sox player Charlie Robertson. MLB.com has made available the video of the last out.|$|R

25|$|He {{returned}} to the Rangers on February 7, 1984, but lasted only two months into the regular season as he pitched in eight games out of the bullpen without a decision. His final major league appearance was in a 51 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium on May 26, 1984. After replacing Dave Tobik to start the ninth inning, Bibby allowed a single to Joel Skinner, a double to Rudy Law and an intentional walk to Jerry Hairston, Sr. to load the bases with one out. He managed to not surrender any runs by getting a groundout from Mike Squires and a <b>flyout</b> from Greg Walker. Bibby was released six days later on June 1.|$|E
5000|$|Small ball is a {{contrast}} to a style sometimes called the [...] "big inning", where batters focus more on drawing walks or getting extra-base hits and home runs. This may produce many innings with little but strikeouts and <b>flyouts,</b> but occasionally innings with several runs. By playing small ball, the team trades the longer odds of a big inning for the increased chances of scoring a single run. Specifically, small ball often requires the trading of an out to advance a runner and therefore usually reduces the number of batting opportunities that a team will have in a given inning.|$|R
5000|$|Blake started 59 of the 60 games she {{appeared}} in. She started 58 at catcher {{and one at}} first base. Her batting average was [...]249. Alicia finished the season with 42 hits, six doubles, one triple, and one home run. She had 29 RBI and scored 16 of Washington's runs. Blake held a [...]991 fielding percentage her sophomore season and caught 15 baserunners stealing, ranking third in the Pac-10. She held a tie for the conference lead in sacrifice <b>flyouts,</b> ranking fifth on Washington's single-season charts. Alicia had eight multi-hit games and seven multi-RBI games. Blake helped lead her team to the 2007 Women's College World Series.|$|R
50|$|A pickoff move is {{the motion}} the pitcher goes through {{in making this}} attempt; some {{pitchers}} have better pickoff moves than others. Pitchers in professional baseball use the pickoff move often, perhaps several times per game or even per inning if speedy baserunners reach base. Pitchers with more {{confidence in their ability}} to eliminate batters directly via strikeouts or <b>flyouts</b> use fewer pickoff attempts. In lower-skilled amateur games, the pickoff move is less common due to the potential for an error if the pitcher throws wild or the fielder fails to make the catch. In youth leagues that don't allow leading off, such as Little League and Cal Ripken League, the need for a pickoff move is eliminated.|$|R
25|$|Scherzer {{started the}} All-Star Game at Marlins Park for the National League on July 11, {{allowing}} a single and striking out two, including Home Run Derby champion Aaron Judge, in one inning of work. Harper started {{in right field}} and went 1-for-1 with a walk, while making a diving catch on defense to rob American League catcher Salvador Pérez in the second inning. Murphy, the starting second baseman, went 1-for-2, grounding out in his second at-bat {{with the bases loaded}} to waste the National League's best chance of the evening to take the lead. Zimmerman went 0-for-2 while hitting into two double plays, one on a groundball and one on a <b>flyout</b> to center field. Kintzler pitched a perfect fifth inning for the American League. Strasburg did not appear in the game, an eventual 2–1 victory for the American League in 10 innings.|$|E
500|$|The game went {{scoreless}} in {{the third}} inning, but Neal led off {{the bottom of the}} fourth with a home run to make the score 3–2. The Dodgers threatened further that inning, getting runners on first and second base, though did not score additional runs. Dodgers' starter Don Drysdale recorded the first out of the top of the fifth but then gave up a solo home run to Mathews and walked Aaron before being relieved by Johnny Podres. Podres escaped without further scoring, putting out Torre and Andy Pafko who pinch hit for Lee Maye. The sixth inning was uneventful, though the Braves then threatened {{in the top of the}} seventh. After the first out Mathews singled to start the offense. Aaron followed that with a single, Mathews was put out trying to advance to third base on a [...] "brilliant throw" [...] by Moon, and Aaron moved to second on the throw. Then Podres threw a wild pitch as Torre batted, allowing Aaron to move to third. Finally, Podres walked Torre and was replaced by Chuck Churn. Enos Slaughter pinch hit for Pafko but hit a <b>flyout</b> to end the threat and the inning. John DeMerit then replaced Slaughter defensively in the bottom of the seventh and Norm Larker singled leading off. However, John Roseboro hit into a ground ball double play to end that threat. Roseboro crashed into Logan, the Braves' shortstop, trying to break up the double play and Logan had to be carried from the field on a stretcher. Félix Mantilla, the second baseman, moved to play shortstop and Red Schoendienst entered to play second. Finally Churn struck out Burdette to end the seventh.|$|E
2500|$|In Game 3, Curt Schilling {{brought back}} the {{dominant}} pitching, scattering six hits and striking out four in seven innings of shutout work. [...] He had plenty of run support as well, with Ortiz and Ramírez hitting back-to-back solo home runs in the fourth, and a progression of hits that scored seven more in the eighth inning. [...] Éric Gagné gave up the only run, giving up a ground-rule double to Maicer Izturis {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, then advancing Izturis to third on a wild pitch before giving up a sacrifice fly to Howie Kendrick that scored Izturis. [...] After that, a strikeout and a <b>flyout</b> ended the game with a 9–1 Red Sox victory to clinch a series sweep.|$|E
5000|$|DiMaggio {{might have}} had better power-hitting {{statistics}} had his home park not been Yankee Stadium. As [...] "The House That Ruth Built", its nearby right field favored the Babe's left-handed power. For right-handed hitters, its deep left and center fields made home runs almost impossible. Mickey Mantle recalled that he and Whitey Ford witnessed many DiMaggio blasts {{that would have been}} home runs anywhere other than Yankee Stadium (Ruth himself fell victim to that problem, as he also hit many long <b>flyouts</b> to center). Bill James calculated that DiMaggio lost more home runs due to his home park than any other player in history. Left-center field went as far back as 457 ft m, where left-center rarely reaches 380 ft m in today's ballparks. Al Gionfriddo's famous catch in the 1947 World Series, which was close to the 415-foot mark m in left-center, would have been a home run in the Yankees' current ballpark. DiMaggio hit 148 home runs in 3,360 at-bats at home versus 213 home runs in 3,461 at-bats on the road. His slugging percentage at home was [...]546, and on the road, it was [...]610.

40|$|Matching the {{magnitude}} of frictional wage dispersion has been difficult for most frictional search models of the labor market; only 1 / 30 – 1 / 4 of the frictional wage dispersion observed in the data can be accounted for using realistic calibrations. In this paper, I develop a general equilibrium model with ex ante homogeneous workers but heterogeneous firm productivities that accounts much better for {{the magnitude}} of frictional wage dispersion. The key ingredient that makes this model different from wage posting mod-els is the bargaining and the wage determination structure. When a firm meets an employed worker, the new firm and the incumbent firm engage in Bertrand competition in the worker’s share of the match surplus; consequently the cur-rent wage of the worker depends {{not only on the}} firm’s productivity, but also on the history of previous offers. I demonstrate that the latter generates about 3 / 4 of the frictional wage dispersion, and that standard wage posting models cannot achieve similar magnitudes of frictional wage dispersion with the cali-bration used in the paper. In contrast to the structural estimation literature, the parametrization of the model is very parsimonious. The model is calibrated to match the worker flows, the standard deviation of log productivity and the replacement ratio, and it delivers frictional wage dispersion that matches the data very closely. ∗I would like to thank Per Krusell for advising me in this work. Marc Melitz, Nobu Kiyotaki, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg and Christopher Sims also deserve special recognition.

5000|$|Ramsey {{moved on}} to the Kinston Indians in the Carolina League for 2004. While in Kinston, Ramsey had a big hand in helping the K-Tribe capture the league {{championship}} with a 10-4 record, 2 complete games, and a 3.85 ERA despite also leading the league with 19 home runs allowed. On September 6, Ramsey threw a 6-0 perfect game against the Myrtle Beach Pelicans in the last game of the season with his sister Allie in the stands at Coastal Federal Field. It was just the fourth nine-inning perfect game in Carolina League history and the first since a 1978 gem by Marty Bystrom for the Peninsula Pilots. Keith threw just 97 pitches in the contest, two changeups, two splitters, 35 curveballs, and 58 fastballs in the 82-84 mph range. He recorded five strikeouts, seven groundouts, and fifteen <b>flyouts.</b> The closest that the Pelicans came to a hit was a line drive to right center that Jonathan Van Every made a [...] "highlight-reel catch" [...] of for the second out in the ninth inning. Keith reached a full count just twice. The game itself almost did not happen due to a steady mist that delayed the start nearly a half-hour. The weather along with {{the fact that it was}} technically a meaningless game since the playoff spots had already been decided, led to some pregame discussion of a cancellation. Ramsey has called the game [...] "a gift from God ... my shining moment." [...] It also uplifted his team. The K-Tribe had lost seven of ten games going into the game. The excitement of the perfect game was credited with picking up the team's spirits and giving them the momentum they needed going into the playoffs. Teammate Dennis Malave was quoted as saying that the game [...] "set us free from negative thinking." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{its first}} three seasons in existence, Citi Field {{was known to}} play as a [...] "pitcher's park", and has been cited {{as the cause of}} the {{decreased}} offensive production of David Wright and Jason Bay. Wright hit only 10 home runs in 2009 after hitting at least 30 in the previous two seasons, while Bay had the worst offensive production of his career in his first season with the Mets in 2010, only hitting 6 home runs, 47 RBIs, and OBP of just [...]347, and a slugging percentage of a career low [...]402. Jeff Francoeur, who played with the Mets during their first two years at Citi Field, criticized the ballpark's dimensions, calling it [...] "a damn joke." [...] During the 2011 season, Citi Field allowed 1.33 home runs per game, the third lowest total out of the 16 National League ballparks. The team responded by altering the ballpark dimensions for the 2012 season, creating a more neutral ballpark. Wright's 2012 offensive numbers have improved due to the alterations. [...] "It's a huge difference", Wright said. [...] "It allows you to relax and know you don’t have to try to hit the ball a mile to see results. And at the same time, if you do hit the ball well and you see results, instead of a 400-foot <b>flyout,</b> you’re 1-for-1 and feeling good about yourself." ...|$|E
