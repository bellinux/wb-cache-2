40|$|Highway bridges {{are exposed}} to {{numerous}} elemental and loading issues that are extremely difficult for a designer to anticipate and account for during design. The current state of practice is to design a bridge deck for a certain life span and then turn the bridge over to maintenance personnel who attempt to prolong {{the life of the}} deck through a variety of repair and rehabilitation measures. These repair measures are rarely, if ever, considered during the design process of the bridge deck. Numerous researchers have looked at making bridges, specifically decks, more repairable. The majority of these research efforts have focused on the bridge deck system as a whole. Other researchers have looked at individual elements of the bridge deck to <b>girder</b> <b>connection</b> to see if the required strength could be achieved while making the connections easier to take apart. One of the main components in the bridge deck to girder system is the steel shear stud connection, which is used to create composite action between the deck and the girder. Numerous researchers have studied this connection from a strength perspective, and the strength equations for the shear connection have been codified. Shear connections using headless studs have been researched as well, but always {{as a part of a}} larger deck to <b>girder</b> <b>connection</b> system. The headless stud has never been researched to see how it responds to a shear loading. This study looks at headless studs with varying levels of debonding along the stud shaft to analyze the impact on the load resistance that the levels of debonding would have. Granular materials for the shear transfer of load are also looked at. The results show that, as expected, the headless, debonded shear studs can carry less load than a bonded stud, but the difference in load carrying capacity is within the suggested over-estimation range of the codes that other researchers have suggested. These results suggest that the use of headless, debonded shear studs in a deck to <b>girder</b> <b>connection</b> is a feasible way to make that connection more repairable. by Berndt F.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{nonlinear}} response of a ten-story steel structure with semirigid <b>girder</b> <b>connections</b> is studied {{under conditions of}} dynamic loading. The dynamic loading {{used in this study}} is the North-South component of the May 18, 1940 El Centro, California earthquake. To deal with the complexity of the problem the structure is idealized by a series of equivalent masses, lumped at the floor levels and restrained by weightless members. The physical model used to represent individual members consists of a flexible central beam with springs attached at both ends. All connections have the capability of exhibiting bilinear hysteresis curves. A numerical procedure is used to integrate the governing differential equations. The analysis is accomplished by a step-by-step procedure in which the structure is assumed to respond linearly during each time increment. However, the member properties may be changed from one interval to the next. Thus the {{nonlinear response}} is obtained as a sequence of linear responses of successively differing systems. Semirigid <b>girder</b> <b>connections</b> affect the properties of a structure in three ways: (a) by altering the relative girder to column stiffness (b) by changing the strength or yield deformation characteristics, and (c) by decreasing the stiffness of the structure. The effects that these variables have on structural response are determined. The ground motion characteristics, intensity and duration, are also investigated...|$|R

40|$|Some of the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) continuous, steel, welded {{plate girder}} bridges have {{developed}} web cracking in the negative moment regions at the diaphragm connection plates. The cracks are due to out-of-plane bending of the web near the top flange of the girder. The out-of-plane bending occurs in the "web-gap", which is {{the portion of the}} girder web between (1) the top of the fillet welds attaching the diaphragm connection plate to the web and (2) the fillet welds attaching the flange to the web. A literature search indicated that four retrofit techniques have been suggested by other researchers to prevent or control this type of cracking. To eliminate the problem in new bridges, AASHTO specifications require a positive attachment between the connection plate and the top (tension) flange. Applying this requirement to existing bridges is expensive and difficult. The Iowa DOT has relied primarily on the hole-drilling technique to prevent crack extension once cracking has occurred; however, the literature indicates that hole-drilling alone may not be entirely effective in preventing crack extension. The objective of this research was to investigate experimentally a method proposed by the Iowa DOT to prevent cracking at the diaphragm/plate <b>girder</b> <b>connection</b> in steel bridges with X-type or K-type diaphragms. The method consists of loosening the bolts at some connections between the diaphragm diagonals and the connection plates. The investigation included selecting and testing five bridges: three with X-type diaphragms and two with K-type diaphragms. During 1996 and 1997, these bridges were instrumented using strain gages and displacement transducers to obtain the response at various locations before and after implementing the method. Bridges were subjected to loaded test trucks traveling in different lanes with speeds varying from crawl speed to 65 mph (104 km/h) to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the study show that the effect of out-of-plane loading was confined to widths of approximately 4 in. (100 mm) {{on either side of the}} connection plates. Further, they demonstrate that the stresses in gaps with drilled holes were higher than those in gaps without cracks, implying that the drilling hole technique is not sufficient to prevent crack extension. The behavior of the web gaps in X-type diaphragm bridges was greatly enhanced by the proposed method as the stress range and out-of-plane distortion were reduced by at least 42 % at the exterior girders. For bridges with K-type diaphragms, a similar trend was obtained. However, the stress range increased in one of the web gaps after implementing the proposed method. Other design aspects (wind, stability of compression flange, and lateral distribution of loads) must be considered when deciding whether to adopt the proposed method. Considering the results of this investigation, the proposed method can be implemented for X-type diaphragm bridges. Further research is recommended for K-type diaphragm bridges...|$|E
40|$|Gravity frames {{in steel}} {{buildings}} are inherently simple systems, with beam-to-column connections designed only to resist shear, and composite slab with ribbed metal decking designed for bending or diaphragm action. This simplicity {{has led to}} questions regarding the structural integrity or robustness of these systems. This {{research is part of}} a collaborative research project studying the structural integrity of steel gravity framing systems composed of steel beams and girders with composite slab on metal deck. ^ For the portion of the research conducted at Purdue University, investigation focuses on the composite slab. The concept of structural integrity is often tied {{to the idea of a}} column removal scenario, where the structure would be required to develop alternate load paths. The mobilization of the composite slab as a part of this behavior, theorized to be via membrane or catenary action, shifts the loading in the slab from bending to primarily tension. An initial phase of component tests on the concrete slab on metal deck includes uniaxial tests to evaluate behavior in both orthogonal directions with respect to the deck corrugations, and shear and tension tests of the sidelap splices. Parameters include metal deck thickness and type of sidelap (e. g., button punch, screw, weld). A second phase includes uniaxial tests of the slab transverse to the deck corrugations with additional reinforcement and tension tests of the support fastener connections between the metal deck and beams and girders. An effort is made to apply forces to the specimens in such a way as to be consistent with loading expected in a column removal scenario. ^ The results from the component tests provide important information regarding the response of the composite slab to expected column removal forces. The composite slab is shown to be weak in the transverse direction regardless of sidelap engagement and strong but susceptible to debonding in the longitudinal direction. The experimental results also cast doubt on the ability of the support fasteners to develop the longitudinal strength. These results both support and conflict with various assumptions that have been previously made regarding composite slabs in computational column removal simulations. ^ The acquired experimental data is evaluated from a computational perspective, building on previous work. Subassembly models are created to validate against the component level tests, and the lessons learned are extended to system level modeling. Further model refinement at the system level is accomplished through special consideration of the composite slab to <b>girder</b> <b>connection.</b> Additional parametric studies are carried out to establish the effects of these new adjustments on previously established parametric relationships. These refinements, especially the explicit realistic consideration of the support fastener connection, reduce the capacity of the system below expected gravity loading levels. Some suggestions for improvement are provided. ^ This research provides an important update to knowledge regarding the contribution of the composite slab to structural integrity in steel gravity framing systems, both in terms of experimental data and computational representation. It is expected that this work will lead to improved evaluation of both new and existing structures. ...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) {{utilizing}} precast components {{continues to}} be used as an effective tool for bridge construction due to time and cost saving techniques as well as the reduction of environmental impacts. However, in seismic regions, the use of precast members and ABC methods are limited due to concerns about poor performance of connections primarily between cap beam and girders. With sponsorship from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), two alternative connections between precast bulb tee girders and bridge cap were designed utilizing extended girder prestressed strands. The connections were designed to resist positive moments at the <b>girder</b> to cap <b>connection.</b> Positive moments occur at the connection when seismic forces cause upward deflection of the precast girders resulting in tension forces along the bottom of the <b>girder</b> to cap <b>connection.</b> The tension forces cause damage to the connection and can also unseat or disconnect the girders from the cap beam resulting in span collapse. The two connections were designed to minimized connection damage and prevent unseating of the <b>girders.</b> In one <b>connection</b> the extended strands were curved and relied on bond strength for anchorage along the 60 in. embedment length. The other connection consisted of spliced strands with anchor plates and chucks which relied on the transfer of forces through strand splices. Both connections also included three grouted dowel bars placed through the <b>girder</b> web. The <b>connections</b> were designed to provide adequate seismic moment resistance up to a combined load of gravity, horizontal ground acceleration corresponding to the column overstrength moment, as well as shear and moment values up to 0. 5 g vertical acceleration. A 40 % scale test unit was constructed in the Iowa State University structures laboratory and the two connections were tested. An analytical model was formulated to analytically quantify the behavior of each connection. The results of the tests showed that both connections had adequate capacity to resist horizontal and vertical ground acceleration forces as specified in current Caltrans seismic design criteria. Adjustments were made to the analytical model based on results of the test to improve the accuracy of the model. The overall results of the test demonstrate that ABC methods can be safely implemented in high seismic regions and be relied upon for dependable performance...|$|R

40|$|Progressive or disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} localized structural damage leads to widespread collapse {{or failure of}} a structure. Although the loss of any structural component in a building {{has the potential to}} initiate progressive collapse, structural columns in steel buildings are particularly susceptible to initiating this behavior if their load-carrying capacity is compromised. Steel-framed buildings can possess the capacity to bridge over a single lost column and arrest collapse, but the dynamic and three-dimensional nature of this event prevents simple design-based analysis approaches from providing accurate assessments of collapse resistance. This research employed a set of two prototype steel moment-framed buildings to study dynamic ground-level column-loss scenarios for a variety of column locations within the structures. One building contained three stories while the other had ten. Both were intended to be representative of typical perimeter moment-frame office buildings built in a low-seismic region of the United States. Three-dimensional finite element models were constructed to model the buildings using shell elements and incorporating the steel deck and composite concrete slab floor system. Nonlinear material models were used along with simplified component models for beam and <b>girder</b> <b>connections.</b> Accurate structural and non-structural masses were used to capture realistic inertial effects. The models were then analyzed using the Abaqus/Explicit finite element analysis engine to simulate instantaneous structural loss of a single ground-level column. This analysis was carried out for twelve individual columns in the three-story building and four individual columns in the ten-story building. Analysis was conducted for a sufficient time following column loss to assess structural collapse or obtain the peak vertical displacement if collapse was arrested. The output was then post-processed to obtain stresses in the steel deck and concrete slab as well as resultant connection forces and load-redistribution behavior. The three and ten-story building were found to be capable of arresting collapse following the loss of an individual ground-level supporting column for most column locations. Demands were the least severe for perimeter columns within a moment frame, but the structures were also able to bridge over lost interior columns that had no moment connectivity. Connection demands were significant in most column-loss scenarios and adequate moment connection strength and ductility was found to be necessary to ensure successful collapse arrest...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{buckling}} of {{hollow section}} members in tubular trusses. The existing codes and instructions {{do not take}} into account several factors that have been indicated to affect buckling lengths in tubular trusses. Furthermore, the existing formulae give -in many cases- buckling length factors that are excessively conservative or even underestimated results. Thus, buckling length of the bracing and chord members is investigated. The emphasis is on the in-plane buckling of K-joints. The influence of dimensional properties of truss members to the joint stiffness is examined. In general, obtaining buckling length is simple in the cases of fully rigid or hinged connections. Since braces are usually welded to the chords in steel <b>girders,</b> the <b>connections</b> can be semi-rigid. This makes the calculation of buckling challenging, because the stiffness of the connection needs to be determined. In this thesis, the the joint stiffness is determined by FE-modeling. The aim of this thesis is to confirm a wider applicability range for recently developed formulae. FE models are validated and verified, after which joint stiffnesses of new joints are derived. The validation is done with high strength steel, grade S 500, joints. Buckling length factors are analytically calculated with the obtained joint stiffnesses...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend to use highly skewed bridges. There are also many {{advantages}} to making all bridges integral, even highly skewed bridges. Many agencies have set limits on maximum skew on integral bridges to avoid translation and wingwall damage. Many designers in Utah have incorporated “finwalls ” into the design. These finwalls can minimize translation and are sized for full seismic loads and can handle significant loads. It appears that the problems seen are “restraint problems ” with the system not moving as expected and forcing large loads back into the superstructure. The resultant forces in skewed or skewed curved bridge are offset and appear to be forming a force couple which is putting moment into the superstructure system. This moment is damaging the girders and the <b>girder</b> abutment <b>connection.</b> This research is unique in that it {{will focus on the}} restraint effects of the abutments and the impacts of the restraint on the superstructure and superstructure abutment connection. Research Objectives: The main object of this research is to investigate the cause of cracking in integral abutment bridges in the State of Utah. Obtaining this objective will involve an extensive literature review of previous research, documenting the experiences encountered with integral abutment bridges. Once the cause of cracking is identified, design guides will be developed to eliminate the problem in future designs in addition to development of repair strategies to fix structures exhibiting these types of problems...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{composite}} floor {{systems is}} a common practice {{in the construction of}} steel structures due to structural and economic advantages. Research performed abroad into the behavior of these systems under fire loading within a complete structure has indicated a potential for cost savings in construction by leaving secondary steel beams without fire protection. The goal of this research was to determine the structural behavior of U. S. designed composite beam floor systems subjected to both gravity and thermal loading through experimental testing, specifically focusing on the failure mechanisms of the components of the system (the connection, composite beam, and composite girder). This document presents the response of these systems with both protected and unprotected beams under both standard and realistic fire loading and considers two different types of beam-to-girder shear connections. Three specimens were tested, each 3. 96 m by 4. 57 m in plan with beam-to-girder shear connections. Composite beams were W 10 X 15 (W 250 X 25. 3) with W 12 X 16 (W 310 X 23. 8) supporting girders. Beams and girders acted compositely with a 38 mm deep ribbed steel deck composite with 64 mm of lightweight concrete. Specimens were tested with two different shear connection types, under design and realistic fires, and with and without fire-protection on the interior beams. Through testing, no failure was observed in the shear studs. The removal of fire-protection from the interior beam increased deflections at the beam mid-span, but only nominally affected the temperatures in the protected <b>girders</b> and <b>connections.</b> The replacement of the design fire conditions with slower cooling conditions caused slower cooling of all elements in the system and increased permanent deformations in the girders. Although the slab transferred {{a significant portion of the}} shear from the beam to the girders, it was not able to support the steel members once they had lost their stiffness, indicating that membrane action was not at play in the behavior of these slab systems. ...|$|R

Some of these connections will experience excessively high demand in regions that are susceptible to high seismic load.

40|$|The {{need for}} reduced {{construction}} times of highway bridges {{has become more}} important recently. Precast concrete panels used for the bridge deck replacements are being used more frequently {{in order to achieve}} this reduced construction time and to also reduce the cost of the construction. Bridges can also be repaired quickly and with less cost if individual panels can be replaced when needed instead of replacing the entire bridge deck. The problem at hand is the structural integrity of these individual precast bridge deck panels. The joints in-between these panels often crack due to service stresses. These cracks expose the steel in the deck and lead to corrosion of the <b>girders.</b> Various transverse <b>connections</b> have been tested at Utah State University to address this problem. These tested connections supply post-tensioning of the panels along the joints to reduce cracking and increase flexural and shear capacity. Among these tested connections include the standard Utah Department of Transportation connections. Also several variations of a curved bolt connection have been tested. To further analyze these connections and compare with the laboratory test results, finite element models were created using the finite element software ANSYS. The finite element models were used to create load-deflection curves and figures to show failure. These were compared with the results from the laboratory testing. The finite element analyses and laboratory testing produced similar results.

40|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by the ASCE Committee on Fatigue and Fracture Reliability, 80 – 90 % of failures in steel structures are related to fatigue and fracture. Therefore, fatigue and fracture reliability is an important concern for steel bridges. In this study, the finite strip method is coupled with either the fatigue approach proposed by Wirsching, or the linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approach as proposed by Harris (In: Sundararajan C, Ed. Probabilistic structural mechanics handbook [chapter 7]. New York: Chapman & Hall Ltd.; 1995. p 106 – 45.), for fatigue reliability analysis of steel highway bridges. The flat shell strips are employed to model the concrete slab and steel <b>girders,</b> while a <b>connection</b> strip is developed by means of the penalty function method in order {{to take into account the}} eccentricity of the top flange of girder.

At each sampling point with given values of slab thickness and modulus ratio, a finite strip analysis of the bridge under fatigue truck is carried out, and the stress ranges at the fatigue-prone detail are calculated.

40|$|The current {{edition of}} the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) {{provides}} limited guidance {{for the design of}} composite bridges with precast concrete deck panels and steel <b>girders.</b> The shear <b>connection</b> is critical in determining the overall performance of the composite superstructure and is commonly achieved with a grout blockout in a precast concrete deck panel, which accepts a cluster of tightly spaced steel shear studs. No specific equations are found in the CHBDC for the design of shear studs used in this system. Furthermore, the current longitudinal spacing limitation of 600 mm for shear studs in the CHBDC is not conducive to the construction of precast concrete decks where an increased spacing of the stud cluster is desirable. An experimental testing regime was conducted using push-test specimens constructed with precast concrete panels connected to steel flanges with steel studs within a circular grout pocket. Specimens were tested to failure to determine the ultimate capacity of a stud cluster and to investigate the reduction in ultimate strength after cyclic loading. A 36 m simple span composite superstructure was designed to the CHBDC. A parametric study is being conducted on the spacing of stud clusters to investigate the serviceability limit state of the composite superstructure using data captured from the push test specimens. Results from the study indicate that clustered shear studs embedded in high strength grout for construction using precast deck panels are suitable for CHBDC requirements and preliminary investigations show that exceeding the code maximum stud spacing of 600 mm can be acceptable...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bridge decks have been {{increasingly}} used as a competitive alternative for wood, concrete and orthotropic steel decks, due to their various advantages: light-weight, good corrosion resistance, low maintenance cost and rapid installation for minimizing the traffic disturbing time. These advantages meet critical needs for rehabilitation and new construction of pedestrian and highway bridges. To be cost effective, FRP decks are usually supported by steel <b>girders.</b> For the <b>connection</b> between FRP decks and steel girders, adhesive bonding technique is usually considered as a preferable connecting method, which can reduce construction time, save weight by eliminating fasteners, allow more uniform load transfer, achieve better adaption to the brittle and anisotropic nature of FRP materials and provide higher joint efficiency. Despite the fact that FRP bridge decks and adhesive joints are already in service in many FRP-steel composite bridges, mechanical behaviour and long-term performance are still not clearly understood, which results in more conservative designs of the FRP-steel composite bridges. To compensate this lack, the overall aim of this project is to investigate mechanical behaviours (in terms of strength and stiffness) of adhesively-bonded joints between FRP bridge decks and steel girders, as well as durability of these adhesively-bonded joints. As to the first aspect, considering the distribution of traffic loads in the longitudinal and transverse directions of bridges, the adhesive-bonded joints have been experimentally studied under six loading conditions, including tensile loading, shear loading and four combining ratios of tensile and shear loading. A specific tensile-shear loading device was designed and then employed to offer six different angle loading conditions. Different surface pretreatment methods (acetone (AC), sand paper (SP) and sand blasting (SB)) were compared with regard to influences on the stiffness, load-bearing capacity, failure mode and interfacial bonding quality of adhesive joints. A Finite Element (FE) model was developed to simulate the stress distribution throughout the adhesive joints under different loading conditions, which proved that the failure of joints was induced by combination of both tensile and shear stress peaks. The edge zone (approximately 10 mm from {{the ends of the}} adhesive layer) was the most sensitive area to initiate the failure, where both the shear stress peak and the tensile stress singularity were located. Another critical aspect of this research is to characterize the durability of FRP-to-steel adhesively-bonded joints under both temperature and moisture effects. The influence of hydrothermal environmental aging on the mechanical behaviours of adhesive joints has been studied and compared with the un-aged adhesive joints. The shear-tensile failure criterions of hydrothermal aged and un-aged adhesive joints were addressed. To better understand the moisture effects, the moisture diffusion process in FRP composite materials was characterized. Subsequently, the hydrothermal degradation on the flexural and interlaminar properties of FRP laminates was addressed. A coupled hygro-mechanical FE model was developed to analyse the enviroment-dependent mechanical behaviours of FRP lanimates. This FE model was first validated by test results of flexural tests and subsequently employed in an inverse parameter identification method to determine the elastic interlaminar shear modulus of FRP laminates. Predictive equations for environment-dependent mechanical properties (flexural and interlaminar) of FRP laminates were sustained by using the least square method for the curve fitting. Results of this research can {{contribute to the development of}} a design code of FRP-steel composite bridges. They can also be used as a reference information for understanding mechanical behaviours and durability of FRP-to-steel adhesively bonded joints for other applications in civil engineering field, such as strengthening of steel structures using FRP composite materials.

40|$|In This Master s Thesis, {{a bridge}} {{design for the}} {{crossing}} of Bjørnafjorden have been investigated. The design was developed in a cooperation between COWI, Aas Jakobsen, Johs Holte As and Global Maritime, {{as a part of}} The Norwegian Public Roads Administrations (NPRA) project ferry free E 39. The project is still in the early stages, where the feasibility of different bridge designs are being evaluated. The design analyzed in this project is a curved floating bridge, with a cable-stayed section near land in the south end, to allow for ship traffic to pass under the bridge. It is floating freely without moorings, and the curved design help to carry shear forces through membrane stresses. The bridges global strength against ship collisions have been investigated throughout this Thesis. Theoretical background is presented initially, before different analyses are conducted in the software USFOS. An initial suggestion of a bridge model used in the USFOS analyses, were developed by Post. doc Yanyan Sha. During the work with this Master's Thesis, this much time were spent to improve this model, for the analyses to give realistic results, despite the significant number of uncertainties being present in this early stages of the project. An eigenvalue analysis was conducted, and large period deflection modes were observed for horizontal bending of the bridge girder. The maximum eigenvalue was found to be 62. 66 seconds. The results of the eigenvalue analysis were compared with the results obtained by COWI et al., through the software Orcaflex, and were found to correspond well. This gave gave confidence for the mode being able to represent thes structural response of the bridge fairly well. No information were obtained for the damping level of the bridge, and to reduce the uncertainties this would introduce for the final results, a separate damping assessment were performed. An analysis, where the pontoon closest to the navigational channel, was exposed to a ship impact with collision energy of 1250 MJ, was run several times with different damping levels. By comparing the results from these analyses, it was found that even for large changes in the level of damping introduced to the model, the change in the final results were only in the order of a few percent. This is most likely because the most critical response occur shortly after impact, and little energy have had the time to be lost to damping. In the main ship collision analysis three different collision scenarios were investigated, and due to uncertainties with respect to the what collision energies the bridge should be designed against, a range of different collision energies were introduced. In Collision scenario 1, the ship hits the short end of the pontoon closest to the navigational channel. The maximum collision energy of 900 MJ, gives a maximum plastic utilization factor of 0. 905, occurring third cross-beam {{to the north of the}} struck pontoon. Due to difficulties in modeling the pre-tension in the wires of the cable stayed section, false stresses occur due to the permanent loads of the bridge. Because of this, the value of the plastic utilization is not used for the bridge girder of this part of the bridge. Instead, the increase in the plastic utilization is found. For the maximum collision energy, the increase in the plastic utilization is found to have a maximum value of 0. 486, in the <b>girder</b> above the <b>connection</b> to the column of the struck pontoon. From this it is concluded that the bridge will survive the impact, as long as the plastic utilization factor due to the permanent loads do not exceed 0. 5. From the analyses of collision scenario 2, where the pontoon closest to the navigational channel is struck in the transverse direction, very high plastic utilization factors were observed in the column of the struck pontoon. At the top of the column, in the connection to the bridge girder, the plastic utilization factor was found to be 0. 992 for the lowest collision energy investigated of 500 MJ. For the maximum collision energy of 900 MJ, large plastic deformations are observed, and it is thus advised to strengthen the upper part of the pontoon columns. In collision scenario 3, the plastic utilization factors observed, are low, with a maximum value of 0. 763 in one of the cross beams. The global strength of the bridge thus seem to be sufficient for a collision like this, into the bridge girder, and no strengthening are advised. The collision energies used for this collision scenario are much lower than for collision scenario one and two, with a maximum value of 450 MJ. This is a result of it being further away from the navigational channel, and thus was found to be less prone to collisions in the analysis performed by the SSP...|$|R
