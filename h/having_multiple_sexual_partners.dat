25|$|Both {{male and}} female D. melanogaster act polygamously (<b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> at the same time). In both males and females, {{polygamy}} results in a decrease in evening activity compared to virgin flies, more so in males than females. Evening activity consists of the activities that the flies participate in other than mating and finding partners, such as finding food. The reproductive success {{of males and females}} varies, {{due to the fact that}} a female only needs to mate once to reach maximum fertility. Mating with multiple partners provides no advantage over mating with one partner, and therefore females exhibit no difference in evening activity between polygamous and monogamous individuals. For males, however, mating with multiple partners increases their reproductive success by increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring. This benefit of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage because it increases the chance that some of the offspring will have traits that increase their fitness in their environment.|$|E

50|$|Several factors within Caribbean {{cultures}} {{play a role}} in HIV transmission. Firstly, sexual patterns {{exist in}} several countries that foster the spread of the disease. There is a high level of sexual activity among the youth, as evidenced by the 22 to 32 percent of persons in six eastern Caribbean states reporting having sex before age 15. Furthermore, <b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> within the past year is relatively common throughout the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|Subculture {{can affect}} gender roles and sexuality, and youth subcultures are {{particularly}} susceptible to peer pressure.

50|$|Aside from {{polygynous}} relationships, {{which can}} be quite prevalent in parts of Africa, there are also widespread practices of sexual networking that involve multiple overlapping or concurrent sexual partners.

Along with <b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> unemployment and population displacements resulting from drought and conflict {{have contributed to the}} spread of HIV/AIDS.. According to Susser and Stein (2000), men refuse to use condoms during intercourse with girls or women performing sex work (p. 1043-1044). Unfortunately, the girls and women are in desperate need of money and do not have a choice. This leads to multiple sex partners, which increases the likelihood of their infection with HIV/AIDS.|$|E

50|$|Social {{embodiment}} {{calls for}} a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behavior emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or <b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations. The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Transmission of HIV from intra-venous {{drug users}} (IDUs) to the {{community}} occurs predominantly through high-risk sexual behaviors. Limited information exists regarding the high-risk sexual behaviors of IDUs in Iran. Aim. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with <b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among Iranian IDUs. Methods. This is a national survey on drug-dependent adults. Participants were sampled from medical centers, prisons, and streets of capitals of 29 provinces in Iran, between May 2007 and February 2008. We analyzed data of 1, 416 current IDUs. Socio-demographics and drug use characteristics were entered into a binary logistic regression model to determine predictors of <b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners.</b> Results. <b>Having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> in the past or at the time of survey was reported by 56. 4 % of Iranian IDUs. Multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> in IDUs decreased by being married (odds ratio [OR], 0. 38; P <. 001) and increased by female gender (OR, 13. 44; P =. 02), having illegal income (OR, 1. 72; P =. 003), higher monthly family income (OR, 1. 01; P =. 003), pleasure, curiosity, and recreation as cause of first drug use (OR, 1. 37; P =. 04), ruins as usual place for injection (OR, 1. 89; P =. 001), and history of syringe sharing (OR, 1. 50; P =. 02). Conclusions. <b>Having</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> was reported by majority of Iranian IDUs, and this was linked to socio-demographics, initiation data, and other risk behaviors. This information should be considered in prevention efforts to reduce sexual transmission of HIV infection in Iran...|$|E
