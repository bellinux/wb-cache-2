A predictive method of calculating the lower flammability limits in air, at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature, is proposed {{as a result of}} a statistical study which involved 216 combustible compounds of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. CHETAH’s fourth energy hazard criterion was found to be the most reliable flammability criterion. The standard deviation of the predicted lower flammability limits is 0. 28 mole percent.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} investigations aimed at altering "nature-prescribed" hydrocarbon combustion are described; the basic {{intention is to}} anchor combustion zones in supersonic streams. The well-known free-radicals augmented combustion is studied, but with a novel innovation of donor injection, rather than free-radicals themselves. Standard methane/air combustion is explored in an open jet geometry in the turbulent regime. A new <b>flammability</b> <b>criterion</b> is established {{in the light of}} the Kolmogorov microscale mixing. The diagnostics are non-intrusive through infrared thermograms and acoustic emissions. Fifty percent extension of the lean flammability limit is experimentally demonstrated. Unambiguous differences in acoustic power spectra indicate a great increase of the reaction rate. Possible reductions of pollutants observed from thermochemical calculations are further confirmed by infrared imaging processing. Numerical simulations of high-speed turbulent combustion are studied. A new method: Large Eddy Probability-density Simulation (LEPS), has been proposed based on both the large eddy simulation and the probability density function method. In this approach, a mixed finite-spectral method is employed to solve for the velocity field, while the probability density function method is used to solve for the energy and species equations. In the PDF solver, a modified composition joint PDF equation is derived, in which the mean velocity field from the κ-ε model in the traditional PDF equation is replaced by the resolved velocity field from the LES so that the large-scale effect is explicitly represented. The solution algorithms are discussed in full detail. This new method is highly perspective in simulating turbulent reacting flows because both advantages of the LES and PDF approach have been taken, whereas both disadvantages have been offset! Initial simulation results are presented. Future work is outlined...|$|R
40|$|To {{prepare the}} {{eco-friendly}} fire retardant wood, Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora), Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) {{were treated with}} inorganic chemicals, such as sodium sili-cate, boric acid, ammonium phosphate, and ammonium borate. Different combination and concentration of those chemicals were impregnated by vacuum/pressure treatment methods. The electron-beam treatment was used to increase the chemical penetration into the wood. The fire performance of the fire retardant treated wood was investigated. The penetration of chemicals into the wood was enhanced after electron beam treatment. Ignition time of the treated wood was the most effectively retarded by sodium silicate, ammonium phosphate, and ammonium borate. The most effective chemical combination was found at 50 % sodium silicate and 3 % ammonium borate, which satisfied <b>flammability</b> <b>criteria</b> for a fire retardant material in the KS F ISO 5660 - 1 standards...|$|E
40|$|Increased human spaceflight {{operations}} utilize oxygen concentrations {{that are}} frequently varied {{with use of}} concentrations up to 100 percent oxygen. Even after exiting a higher percentage oxygen environment, high oxygen concentrations can still be maintained due to material saturation and oxygen entrapment between barrier materials. This paper examines the material flammability concerns that arise from changing oxygen environments during spaceflight operations. We examine the time required for common spacecraft and spacesuit materials exposed to oxygen to return to reduced ignitability and flammability once removed from the increased concentration. Various common spacecraft materials were considered: spacecraft cabin environment foams, Extra Vehicular Mobility Unit materials and foams, Advanced Crew Escape Suit materials, and other materials of interest such as Cotton, Nomex^ HT 90 - 40, and Tiburon Surgical Drape. This paper presents calculated diffusion coefficients derived from experimentally obtained oxygen transmission rates for the tested materials and the analytically derived times necessary for reduced flammability to be achieved based on NASA <b>flammability</b> <b>criteria.</b> Oxygen material saturation and entrapment scenarios are examined. Experimental verification data on oxygen diffusion in saturation scenarios are also presented and discussed. We examine how to use obtained data to address flammability concerns during operational planning to {{reduce the likelihood of}} fires while improving efficiency for procedures...|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} {{method to}} avoid explosions from occurring inside industrial process plants in which mixtures of a combustible gas and air are present is {{working outside the}} flammable range of these mixtures. To this end, the flammability limits must be known at the process conditions. The determination of these limits might seem straightforward. However, going through the literature reveals {{the richness of the}} subject. First, the published flammability limit data were obtained using nearly as many different experimental methods as there were studies. To complicate matters even further, significant differences exist between the results of different studies. Normally, standardisation is expected to reduce these discrepancies. Nevertheless, it was found by various authors that even the results obtained with the two methods adopted by the European standard EN 1839 differ significantly. Next, a number of empirical laws are in widespread use, such as the modified law of Burgess and Wheeler to calculate the temperature dependence of the flammability limits and Le Chatelier's mixing rule to calculate the flammability limits of a combustible mixture based upon the flammability limits of the composing combustibles. Finally, a variety of numerical methods exists to calculate estimates for the flammability limits. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a review of some of the existing methods to determine the flammability limits. First, the discrepancy between the experimental results obtained with the two methods adopted by EN 1839 will be explained and some new <b>flammability</b> <b>criteria</b> will be presented that might eliminate this discrepancy. Next, the value of the modified law of Burgess and Wheeler and of Le Chatelier’s mixing rule will be discussed. Finally, the potential of calculating the flammability limits by using numerical methods will be explored. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|All {{relevant}} {{international standards}} for determining if a metallic rod is flammable in oxygen utilize {{some form of}} “promoted ignition” test. In this test, for a given pressure, an overwhelming ignition source is coupled {{to the end of}} the test sample and the designation flammable or nonflammable is based upon the amount burned, that is, a burn criteria. It is documented that (1) the initial temperature of the test sample affects the burning of the test sample both (a) in regards to the pressure at which the sample will support burning (threshold pressure) and (b) the rate at which the sample is melted (regression rate of the melting interface); and, (2) the igniter used affects the test sample by heating it adjacent to the igniter as ignition occurs. Together, these facts make it necessary to ensure, if a metallic material is to be considered flammable at the conditions tested, that the burn criteria will exclude any region of the test sample that may have undergone preheating during the ignition process. A two-dimensional theoretical model was developed to describe the transient heat transfer occurring and resultant temperatures produced within this system. Several metals (copper, aluminum, iron, and stainless steel) and ignition promoters (magnesium, aluminum, and Pyrofuze®) were evaluated for a range of oxygen pressures between 0. 69 MPa (100 psia) and 34. 5 MPa (5, 000 psia). A MATLAB® program was utilized to solve the developed model that was validated against (1) a published solution for a similar system and (2) against experimental data obtained during actual tests at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration White Sands Test Facility. The validated model successfully predicts temperatures within the test samples with agreement between model and experiment increasing as test pressure increases and/or distance from the promoter increases. Oxygen pressure and test sample thermal diffusivity were shown to have the largest effect on the results. In all cases evaluated, there is no significant preheating (above about 38 °C/ 100 °F) occurring at distances greater than 30 mm (1. 18 in.) during the time the ignition source is attached to the test sample. This validates a distance of 30 mm (1. 18 in.) above the ignition promoter as a burn length upon which a definition of flammable can be based for inclusion in relevant international standards (that is, burning past this length will always be independent of the ignition event for the ignition promoters considered here.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} data on {{the limiting}} (minimum) oxygen concentration (LOC), {{in the presence of}} added N 2, of methane (CH 4), propane (C 3 H 8), ethylene (C 2 H 4), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H 2), and some of their binary mixtures. It also addresses the issue of the flammable concentration (flammability) limits of these pure gases in air. The study is based on spark ignited explosions in large, spherical laboratory vessels (120 -L and 20 -L) using a 7 % pressure-rise criterion for explosion propagation. The results of the study are compared with the older values which used long flammability tubes with a diameter > 5 cm together with visual evidence of substantial upward propagation. They are also compared to results reported recently using a 12 -L spherical flask with a visual flame propagation criterion. Finally, they are compared to results reported in Europe using more modest <b>flammability</b> <b>criteria</b> and smaller chambers. The findings reported here show excellent agreement between the 120 -L and 12 -L results, good agreement with the 20 -L results, and reasonable agreement with the earlier flammability tube values for the lower flammability limits. They disagree, however, with the more conservative European values. These results and those from the 12 -L experiments also feature lower LOCs than are given by traditional flammability tubes. A model for the LOCs of such fuel mixtures based on the Le Chatelier mixture rule for lower flammable limits is seen to reasonably fit the observed results on binary mixtures and can accommodate more complex mixtures as well. One such set of ternary mixtures containing CH 4 and 1 : 1 CO:H 2 is well fitted by the model...|$|E
40|$|The Smoke Point In Co-flow Experiment (SPICE) {{determines the}} point at which gas-jet flames (similar to a butane-lighter flame) begin to emit soot (dark {{carbonaceous}} particulate formed inside the flame) in microgravity. Studying a soot emitting flame is important in understanding the ability of fires to spread and in control of soot in practical combustion systems space. Previous experiments show that soot dominates the heat emitted from flames in normal gravity and microgravity fires. Control of this heat emission is critical for prevention of the spread of fires on Earth and in space for the design of efficient combustion systems (jet engines and power generation boilers). The onset of soot emission from small gas jet flames (similar to a butane-lighter flame) will be studied to provide a database {{that can be used to}} assess the interaction between fuel chemistry and flow conditions on soot formation. These results will be used to support combustion theories and to assess fire behavior in microgravity. The Smoke Point In Co-flow Experiment (SPICE) will lead to a o improved design of practical combustors through improved control of soot formation; o improved understanding of and ability to predict heat release, soot production and emission in microgravity fires; o improved <b>flammability</b> <b>criteria</b> for selection of materials for use in the next generation of spacecraft. The Smoke Point In Co-flow Experiment (SPICE) will continue the study of fundamental phenomena related to understanding the mechanisms controlling the stability and extinction of jet diffusion flames begun with the Laminar Soot Processes (LSP) on STS- 94. SPICE will stabilize an enclosed laminar flame in a co-flowing oxidizer, measure the overall flame shape to validate the theoretical and numerical predictions, measure the flame stabilization heights, and measure the temperature field to verify flame structure predictions. SPICE will determine the laminar smoke point properties of non-buoyant jet diffusion flames (i. e., the properties of the largest laminar jet diffusion flames that do not emit soot) for several fuels under different nozzle diameter/co-flow velocity configurations. Luminous flame shape measurements would also be made to verify models of the flame shapes under co-flow conditions. The smoke point is a simple measurement that has been found useful to study the influence of flow and fuel properties on the sooting propensity of flames. This information would help support current understanding of soot processes in laminar flames and by analogy in turbulent flames of practical interest...|$|E
