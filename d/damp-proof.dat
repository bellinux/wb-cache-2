60|$|Then {{something}} flashed {{into his}} mind. In his hand he still held the revolver. He pressed it upwards against {{the thing that}} was smothering him, and pulled the trigger. Again he pulled it, and again, for it was a self-cocking weapon, and even there deep down in the water he heard the thud of the explosion of the <b>damp-proof</b> copper cartridges. His lungs were bursting, his senses reeled, only enough of them remained to tell him that he was free of that strangling grip and floating upwards. His head rose above the surface, and through the mouth of his mask he drew in the sweet air with quick gasps. Down below him in the clear water he saw the yellow head of Big Bonsa rocking and quivering like a great reflected moon, saw too that it was beginning to rise. Yet he could not swim away from it, the fetish seemed to have hypnotized him. He heard Jeekie calling to him from the shallow water near the further bank, but still he floated there like a log and stared down at Big Bonsa wallowing beneath.|$|E
60|$|Above {{the house}} to the back was a dense plantation, the roots of whose trees were above the level of the chimneys. The {{corresponding}} high ground on which Grace stood was richly grassed, with only an old tree here and there. A few sheep lay about, which, as they ruminated, looked quietly into the bedroom windows. The situation of the house, prejudicial to humanity, was a stimulus to vegetation, on which account an endless shearing of the heavy-armed ivy was necessary, and a continual lopping of trees and shrubs. It was an edifice built in times when human constitutions were <b>damp-proof,</b> when shelter from the boisterous was all that men thought of in choosing a dwelling-place, the insidious being beneath their notice; and its hollow site was an ocular reminder, by its unfitness for modern lives, of the fragility to which these have declined. The highest architectural cunning could have done nothing to make Hintock House dry and salubrious; and ruthless ignorance could have done little to make it unpicturesque. It was vegetable nature's own home; a spot to inspire the painter and poet of still life--if they did not suffer too much from the relaxing atmosphere--and to draw groans from the gregariously disposed. Grace descended the green escarpment by a zigzag path into the drive, which swept round beneath the slope. The exterior of the house had been familiar to her from her childhood, but she had never been inside, and the approach to knowing an old thing in a new way was a lively experience. It was with a little flutter that she was shown in; but she recollected that Mrs. Charmond would probably be alone. Up to a few days before this time that lady had been accompanied in her comings, stayings, and goings by a relative believed to be her aunt; latterly, however, these two ladies had separated, owing, it was supposed, to a quarrel, and Mrs. Charmond had been left desolate. Being presumably a woman who did not care for solitude, this deprivation might possibly account for her sudden interest in Grace.|$|E
50|$|A {{benefit of}} <b>damp-proofing</b> rods {{compared}} with <b>damp-proofing</b> creams and liquids {{is that it}} is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course - i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes.|$|R

50|$|<b>Damp-proofing</b> rods use similar active {{ingredients}} {{to those found}} in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. <b>Damp-proofing</b> rods are available with BBA approval.|$|R
5000|$|Where {{a rising}} damp problem {{is caused by}} a lack of a <b>damp-proof</b> course (common in {{buildings}} over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed <b>damp-proof</b> course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include: ...|$|E

50|$|Truscon Laboratories was a {{research}} and development chemical laboratory of the Trussed Concrete Steel Company ("Truscon") of Detroit, Michigan. It made waterproofing liquid chemical products that went into or on cement and plaster. The products goals were to provide <b>damp-proofing</b> and waterproofing finishing for concrete and Truscon steel to guard against disintegrating action of water and air.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{repairs and}} <b>damp-proofing</b> {{have been carried}} out since the church was completed: the {{decision}} to build around the remains of the 13th-century walls meant that damp was able to permeate and the new walls cracked. The roof also caused problems: in 1961 the timberwork had to be renewed after a woodworm infestation. Internal reorganisation and renewal was carried out throughout the 1960s and 1970s as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{assessing}} damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, {{the next step is}} to look for the presence of a <b>damp-proof</b> course. If a <b>damp-proof</b> course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} purpose of wainscoting was {{to cover the}} lower part of walls, which, in houses constructed with poor or non-existent <b>damp-proof</b> courses, are often affected by rising dampness. Its purpose is now decorative.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>damp-proof</b> {{membrane}} (DPM) is a {{membrane material}} applied to prevent moisture transmission. A common example is polyethylene sheeting laid under a concrete slab {{to prevent the}} concrete from gaining moisture through capillary action. A DPM {{may be used for}} the DPC.|$|E

The machine was also known by the names Samurai, Oscar, Elan and Flan before the Enterprise name was finally chosen.|$|E
5000|$|Konrad Fisher's article [...] "The Fraud of Rising Damp" [...] {{points out}} that the {{historic}} city hall in Bamberg stands in the river Regnitz and its bridge remains dry without any chemical, mechanical or electronic <b>damp-proof</b> course. However, evidence suggests that not all walls are capable of supporting rising damp, so merely observing that rising damp does not occur in a particular wall does not disprove its existence in other walls.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, {{significant}} number of residential structures contains basements that are frequently habitable. The energy consumption to heat and/or dehumidify the below- -the-grade spaces is significantly affected by {{the ability of the}} envelope to resist moisture infiltration. Clearly, the energy consumption is directly impacting the sustainability of such systems. This study investigates the performance of three different types of insulation installed in the interior of a basement wall system in a below-grade situation. All boundary conditions were simulated in a controlled environment with the testing of nine segments simultaneously. Damage to the <b>damp-proofing</b> layer on the exterior surface of the wall was introduced and moisture was present to simulate saturated soil. Three tests were conducted in order to represent a winter, summer, and artificial condition. Data was analyzed to determine the response of the systems to an imperfect environment. No condensatio n was detected throughout each experiment, leading to the conclusion that each insulation type performed as intended by the manufacturer in a moist environment. The insulation with the highest permeability showed evidence of a higher drying capacity in the artificial test. The damage to the <b>damp-proofing</b> layer did not {{have a significant effect on}} the performance of the wall system...|$|R
50|$|From Truscon {{laboratories}} viewpoint waterproofing {{was considered}} methods {{and means of}} protecting underground construction like foundations and footings. It also pertains to structures intended for retaining water like water tanks and containing water under hydrostatic conditions like in water pipes, tunnels, reservoirs, and cisterns. <b>Damp-proofing</b> was considered the methods of keeping dampness out of {{the main part of}} concrete buildings. It involves the methods of treating exposed walls above ground level to avoid the entrance of moisture into the building. These definitions then qualified their various products as servicing particular needs.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>damp-proof</b> course (DPC) is {{a barrier}} through the {{structure}} {{designed to prevent}} moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp.

5000|$|Most {{forms of}} {{dampness}} {{can be prevented}} by thoughtful building design and careful construction.

50|$|Old farm {{buildings}} may show the following signs of deterioration: rotting in timber-framed constructions due to damp, {{cracks in the}} masonry from movement of the walls, e.g. ground movement, roofing problems (e.g. outward thrust of it, deterioration of purlins and gable ends), foundation problems, penetration of tree roots; lime mortar being washed away due to inadequate weather-protection. Walls made of cob, earth mortars or walls with rubble cores are all highly vulnerable to water penetration, and replacement or covering of breathable materials with cement or <b>damp-proofing</b> materials may trap moisture within the walls.|$|R
5000|$|BRE Digest 245 {{suggests}} {{that with the}} exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. British Board of Agrement Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp.

50|$|From {{the initial}} idea of {{protecting}} against water damage developed {{the science of}} integral waterproofing—the introduction of some element into the wet cement {{during the process of}} making causing a high degree of impermeability and imperviousness. Water in masonry does harm structurally because of its solvent properties and because it expands when frozen breaking concrete. Water is observed into concrete walls like a sponge absorbs water through capillary action. A wet wall produces damp and clammy conditions that promote and spread disease. While structural <b>damp-proofing</b> and waterproofing to prevent decay was a motive of the Truscon laboratories chemicals, the side benefit was that it provided better hygienic conditions.|$|R
