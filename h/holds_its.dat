The step b := a mod b is equivalent to the above recursion formula r'k ≡ r'k−2 mod r'k−1. The temporary variable t holds the value of r'k−1 while the next remainder r'k is being calculated. At the end of the loop iteration, the variable b holds the remainder r'k, whereas the variable a <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> predecessor, r'k−1.|$|E

5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{there was}} a {{religious}} revival (known by some as the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw {{large numbers of people}} converting to nonconformist and Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church.

5|$|By a {{decision}} of the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council has its seat in Brussels but in April, June, and October, it <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> meetings in Luxembourg. Between 1952 and 1967 the ECSC Council held its Luxembourg meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved on numerous occasions but between 1955 and 1967 it was housed in the Verlorenkost district of the city. In 1957 {{with the creation of}} two new Communities with their own Councils, discretion on location was given to the current President. In practice this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it moved to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Amarillo {{became the}} first Texas city and the fifth in United States to use the council-manager form of {{municipal}} government, with all governmental powers resting in a legislative body, called a council (before 2014, it was called a commission). Amarillo's commission is composed of five elected commissioners, {{one of whom is}} the mayor of the city. The mayor and each commissioner serves a two-year term. The role of the commission is to pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations, and appoint city officials, including the city manager. While the mayor serves as a presiding officer of the commission, the city manager is the administrative head of the municipal government and is responsible for the administration of all departments. The city commission <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> regular meetings on Tuesday of each week.|$|E

5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|The Morris Performing Arts Center, {{built in}} 1922, {{included}} the Palace Theater, {{a venue for}} vaudeville. The theatre's heyday was in 1940 with the premiere of Knute Rockne, All American, starring Ronald Reagan. A crowd estimated at 24,000 gathered outside. The theater was scheduled for demolition in 1959, when E. M. Morris purchased the facility and sold it to the city for one dollar, after which it was renamed the Morris Civic Auditorium. A total renovation was completed in 2000. The Morris Performing Arts Center also includes the Palais Royale Ballroom, on which restoration was recently completed. The center houses the Broadway Theater League and the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's Shanghai-born conductor, Tsung Yeh, was the first conductor ever to hold music directorships of both a western symphony orchestra and a major Chinese orchestra. Marian High School <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> graduation ceremony at the theater.|$|E

Known as the Ducks, Oregon's first track and field team was fielded in 1895. The team <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> home meets at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.

5|$|The rebooted 1975 {{version of}} Philaletheis, as a {{committee}} of the SGA, was governed by the SGA's president. Membership was by application for all positions. Once the organization split from student government, it was run by a seven-member board and accepted proposals for shows, ranging from musicals to one-act plays. Recently, the Society has accepted proposals for shows {{at the beginning of}} every semester, then the production board has voted on which shows to produce. Each production then <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> own auditions for actors, with no experience required. Directors seeking to produce a full-length show must first direct a shorter directing workshop, usually a scene running 15 minutes or shorter. Directing workshops occur twice a year, early in fall and spring semesters. For the 2015 fiscal year, the group's budget was $12,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} {{call of the}} Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah {{with the}} last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes <b>holds</b> <b>its</b> beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species {{are very difficult to}} tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.|$|E

Additionally, the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of Emergency Medicine, develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino.
