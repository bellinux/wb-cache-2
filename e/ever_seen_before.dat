5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E

25|$|Tasked with {{securing}} Pyrrhus {{against the}} fierce {{resistance of the}} Helghan Second Army, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are well prepared for an invasion. Using Helghan's harsh environment to their advantage, they have developed new weapons and equipment, none of which the ISA has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> Furthermore, the planet's fog-like atmosphere, gritty deserts, and constant storms pose almost {{as much of a}} threat to the invaders as the enemy themselves.|$|E
25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} artifact-rich archaeological sites in the Middle East. Archaeological {{excavations}} in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the 4th millennium BC. There is a large quantity of objects decorated with highly distinctive engravings of animals, mythological figures, and architectural motifs. The objects and their iconography are unlike anything <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> by archeologists. Many are made from chlorite, a gray-green soft stone; others are in copper, bronze, terracotta, and even lapis lazuli. Recent excavations at the sites have produced the world's earliest inscription which pre-dates Mesopotamian inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|Second in {{line was}} {{undoubtedly}} the cool, methodical Sutcliffe, Hobbs's trusted opening partner for England, whose average of 66.85 in Ashes matches is the second-highest amongst batsmen with 1,000 runs, 23 points behind Bradman's and 12 ahead of Hobbs's. In his first series against Australia, in 1924–25, Sutcliffe outscored Hobbs, but Hobbs returned home and reaffirmed his position with a record-breaking season in England. Sutcliffe, {{who began his}} days as a stylist, later made the most of his abilities with powers of defence and concentration rarely, if <b>ever,</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> (Bradman said Sutcliffe had the best temperament of any cricketer he saw). But Sutcliffe himself conceded that he did not possess the gifts of Hobbs, Hammond or Hutton.|$|E
25|$|Polanski later stated that, in {{the months}} {{following}} the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before.</b> People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral. In 1994, the Tate/Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.|$|E
25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make him a little fortune. It promises {{to become one of the}} greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, so we did our own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E
500|$|Ivalice {{is a world}} {{created by}} four {{ordinary}} children: Marche Radiuju, a new student and resident of St. Ivalice and its school; Mewt Randell, a shy boy still attached {{to the memory of}} his late mother; Ritz Malheur, an assertive and outspoken classmate of Marche and Mewt; and Doned Radiuju, Marche's younger, handicapped brother and a big fan of fantasy novels and video games. [...] Mewt comes across a dusty old tome in a local used bookstore and eagerly wishes to show it to his friends. Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire, Mewt brings the book over to Marche's house along with Ritz. The old book is written in a language none of them have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and a single inscription reads: [...] "Alta oron, Sondus kameela". The next morning, Marche wakes up in the world of Ivalice. The fantasy Ivalice is supposedly a reincarnation of Mewt's memories from a Final Fantasy game.|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{seems to}} have yearned for a more {{cosmopolitan}} community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was [...] "seemingly almost out of the world" [...] and complaining {{that he had to}} wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E

500|$|The Pong arcade games {{manufactured}} by Atari {{were a great}} success. The prototype was well received by Andy Capp's Tavern patrons; people came to the bar solely to play the game. Following its release, Pong consistently earned four times more revenue than other coin-operated machines. Bushnell estimated that the game earned US$35–40 per day, which he described as nothing he'd <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> in the coin-operated entertainment industry at the time. The game's earning power resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of orders Atari received. This provided Atari with a steady source of income; the company sold the machines at three times the cost of production. By 1973, the company had filled 2,500orders, and, at the end of 1974, sold more than 8,000units. The arcade cabinets have since become collector's items with the cocktail-table version being the rarest. Soon after the game's successful testing at Andy Capp's Tavern, other companies began visiting the bar to inspect it. Similar games appeared on the market three months later, produced by companies like Ramtek and Nutting Associates. Atari could do little against the competitors as they had not initially filed for patents on the solid state technology used in the game. When the company did file for patents, complications delayed the process. As a result, the market consisted primarily of [...] "Pong clones"; author Steven Kent estimated that Atari had produced less than a third of the machines. Bushnell referred to the competitors as [...] "Jackals" [...] because he felt they had an unfair advantage. His solution to competing against them was to produce more innovative games and concepts.|$|E
500|$|Lagaan was {{met with}} high {{critical}} acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before,</b> and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Hell Bent", the TARDIS {{gives the}} Doctor {{a brand new}} sonic {{screwdriver}}. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with high-pitched sound, green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show Class, where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>before</b> in a cup on his desk in [...] "The Pilot."
