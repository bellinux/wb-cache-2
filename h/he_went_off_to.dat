True to her word that she would leave him if <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart.

5|$|Seamer {{graduated}} in 1935, but returned to Oxford {{for a further}} year to study Arabic. In his final year of cricket at Oxford, he only appeared in three matches: he was not required to bat in either innings against the Free Foresters, and only batted once against Leicestershire, scoring 5 runs. Out of form and not required for the university team, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> play for Somerset in the match against Cambridge University and scored 68. He followed that with a further game for Somerset {{in which he was}} not successful and travelled with the Somerset side for the next match against Glamorgan at Llanelli, but Mitchell-Innes, as Oxford captain, called him up as cover for the injured Roger Kimpton; {{on the morning of the}} match, The Times reported that Kimpton was likely to play and Seamer would be stood down. In the event, Kimpton failed his fitness test and Seamer's final match for the university team was the University match against Cambridge, and as in the previous year, Oxford suffered a heavy defeat. Seamer scored 11 runs in the first innings, and then when Oxford were asked to follow on, he batted tenaciously to reach 43 runs, which forced Cambridge to bat again. Requiring 17 runs to win, Cambridge chased the total down in 5.4 overs with eight wickets to spare. In total, Seamer played 21 matches for Oxford, scoring 1,059 runs at an average of 35.30.|$|E

He then went to Madison Academy, and later Madison College. At age 17, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.

25|$|Ignjat Job {{was born}} in Dubrovnik, on 28 March 1895. His father died when young Ignjat was only 5 years old. He {{attended}} school in Dubrovnik until 1910. An important influence on his early intellectual and artistic development was his older brother Cvijeto (1892–1915), whose art studies in Belgrade and Munich {{came to an end}} when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> fight in the First World War. As an active supporter for independence from Austria-Hungary, the young Ignjat Job was arrested in 1912 along with other young nationalists and sentenced to one month in prison. In 1913, while Job was only 18, his first daughter, Marija was born. Arrested again in 1914, he spent time in Šibenik prison, then removed to a mental hospital, thanks to good connections, until September 1916. Traumatic experiences from his two-year stay in the mental hospital oppressed Job in the years that followed, and left a mark on his work, most notably on Madmen in the Yard, a drawing thought to have been made between 1916 and 1919.|$|E

Kassa lost his inheritance upon the death of Kinfu {{while he was still}} a young boy. After receiving a traditional education in a local monastery, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> lead a band of bandits that roved the country in a Robin Hood-like existence. His exploits became widely known, and his band of followers grew steadily until he led a formidable army. He came to the notice of the ruling Regent, Ras Ali, and his mother Empress Menen Liben Amede (wife of the Emperor Yohannes III). In order to bind him to them, the Empress arranged for Kassa to marry Ali's daughter. He turned his attention to conquering the remaining chief divisions of the country, Gojjam, Tigray and Shewa, which still remained unsubdued. His relations with his father-in-law and grandmother-in-law deteriorated however, and he soon took up arms against them and their vassals, and was successful.|$|E

Poirot learns that Hugh's mother died when he was ten years old in a boating accident when she was out with the Admiral, and that she was previously engaged to Frobisher before <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> India with the British Army. When he came home he learned she had married Admiral Chandler, however this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men.

The draft they shot with had 163 pages with 135 speaking parts and featured seven cities. The film shortens the storyline of the original mini-series; a major character arc, that of a farmer, is taken out, and the Pakistani plotline is replaced with one set in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have you got the cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{surviving}} anecdote from Hephaestion’s youth comes {{courtesy of}} the Alexander Romance. According to this tale, “...one day when Alexander was 15 years old [...] sailing with Hephaestion, his friend, he easily reached Pisa [...] and <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> stroll with Hephaestion.” That Alexander’s exact age is given provides another clue to Hephaestion’s upbringing because at fifteen Alexander and his companions were at Mieza studying under Aristotle. Hephaestion has never been named among those who attended the lectures at Mieza, but his close friendship with Alexander at that age suggests strongly that he was numbered among them. More telling is Hephaestion’s name being found in a catalogue of Aristotle’s correspondences. The letters themselves no longer exist, but {{for them to have}} found their way into an official catalogue, their content must have been of some significance. It implies that Hephaestion received a good education and shows that Aristotle was impressed enough by his pupil to send letters throughout Alexander's expanding empire to converse with him.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternate}} tradition {{holds that}} Llancarvan monastery or [...] "Church of the Stags", in Glamorganshire, and {{not far from}} the Bristol Channel, was founded {{in the latter part of}} the fifth century by Cadoc.

The spot at first seemed an impossible one, an almost inaccessible marsh, but he and his monks drained and cultivated it, transforming it into one of the most famous and attractive religious homes in South Wales. The plan of the building included a monastery, a college, and a hospital. Having got the community established, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Ireland to study and teach. When he returned three years later, he found the monastery in ruins. Furious, he forced the monks back to manual labour, dragging timber from the woods to begin the work of reconstruction.
