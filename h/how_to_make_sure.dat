2500|$|Craven {{chose to}} give Iliadis his freedom while filming the remake, {{partially}} because Craven {{was in the}} process of working on a new film for himself, but also because he likes to allow the directors the chance to make their own film. For the 2009 remake, Iliadis wanted to keep a consistency among the scenes of his film, as compared to the 1972 original. Iliadis stated that he felt the intercutting of comedic scenes with the rape scene in the 1972 film had the tendency to take one out of the moment. Iliadis wanted to [...] "cut those diversions out", as a way of [...] " [...] into this scene with no place to cut away to". For Iliadis, taking this approach helped to create more drama for the event. The producers brought in a medical technician to provide insight, based on his job experience witnessing the people's deaths, and lend realism to the actors' portrayals. Lindhome states that the technician would explain how someone would react given a particular event, like getting shot or stabbed. Iliadis also felt that his work on Hardcore helped to train him for this film. As the director points out, Hardcore contained [...] "very difficult scenes", like a sixteen-year-old girl having an [...] "existential breakdown during an orgy", and Iliadis sees those scenes as training for him to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the actors are still being respected, as well as making sure that the scene is focused on the characters instead of simply going for [...] "titillation".|$|E

Did she think they kept too sharp an eye on her, so {{that the idea of}} their {{standing}} in a still closer relation wouldn't be enticing? Her conduct up to this time had not worn such an appearance, unless perhaps a little, just a very little, in the matter of her ways with poor Grace. Lady Agnes knew she wasn't particularly fond of poor Grace, and could even sufficiently guess the reason--the manner in which Grace betrayed most <b>how</b> they wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> of her. She remembered how long the girl had stayed the last time she had been at Harsh--going for an acceptable week and dragging out her visit to a month. She took a private heroic vow that Grace shouldn't go near the place again for a year; not, that is, unless Nick and Julia were married within the time. If that were to happen she shouldn't care. She recognised that it wasn't absolutely everything Julia should be in love with Nick; it was also better she should dislike his mother and sisters after a probable pursuit of him than before. Lady Agnes did justice to the natural rule in virtue of which it usually comes to pass that a woman doesn't get on with her husband's female belongings, and was even willing to be sacrificed to it in her disciplined degree. But she desired not to be sacrificed for nothing: if she was to be objected to as a mother-in-law she wished to be the mother-in-law first.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been <b>to</b> find out <b>how</b> Kenyan journalists look at their own role in the {{development}} of the Somalia conflict and <b>how</b> they work <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that they have a positive impact on the situation. The empirical material consists of seven semi-structured interviews with journalists who work in print- or broadcast media in the Kenyan capital Nairobi and who specialises in conflict reporting in general and Somalia more specifically. The interviews were summarised, analysed and presented in a thematic order, based on the initial research questions stated below:    Do Kenyan journalists believe that they can help bring peace and stability in Somalia and if so, how? How do Kenyan journalists look at their own role in reporting about the Somalia conflict? How do Kenyan journalists reason when choosing subjects to report about, angles and sources? The result of the study is very clear: all journalists interviewed believe that they can help bring peace and stability in Somalia. Some even believe that without the media, there won’t be peace in Somalia. However, they look slightly different at their individual roles as reporters covering a conflict in a neighbouring country where their own nation is militarily involved. Some look at themselves as objective messengers that report the truth no matter the implications. Others are sensitive when it comes to showing pictures of dead people or publishing the number of casualties, afraid that it might stir up emotions and cause retaliatory attacks. One journalist stands out as the only one openly supporting a patriotic line that he believes is needed for the Kenyan military to defeat the enemy and in the end achieve peace and stability in the region. They all consider it difficult to remain objective when reporting from Somalia, since they most often need to work embedded with the troops for security reasons. African journalists need to highlight the plight of the Somali people and also report about the positive sides of the region, all journalists believe. It is important to paint a brighter picture of Somalia in order to bring new investments to the poor country. Also, they all emphasise the need to talk to the people of Somalia, to let them speak for themselves, because in the end, only Somalis can bring peace to their country. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{reason the}} War Office wanted such a {{lightweight}} motorcycle {{was to establish}} communications between troops that had been dropped by parachute and the front line forces, who could be some distance away or out of radio contact. The problem was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the Enfield landed without too much damage. In the summer of 1942 experimentation therefore began to develop a protective cradle that would go right round the motorcycle. A number of different versions were tested by dropping them from the bomb racks of aircraft such as the Halifax and Lancaster bombers. As well as surviving the drop, the cradles also had {{to be easy to}} remove on landing. The prototypes met neither requirement as they were too light and bent the wheels on impact but eventually a design was developed that worked with heavier tubing and increased bracing and in December 1942, went into production at the Enfield's Calton Hill factory in Edinburgh.|$|E

His contributions to aeronautics education at M.I.T. were legendary, and it was during his tenure as director when the future president of India, Abdul Kalam, studied at the institute. President Kalam recollects an experience in his design class taught by Professor Srinivasan in his book. Professor Srinivasan had rejected his design and asked him to submit a new one within three days - an impossible deadline. Kalam recalls toiling over the project and was delighted when Professor Srinivasan was pleased with his revised project. In his memoir, President Kalam says, [...] "That day I learnt two lessons: a teacher who has his or her student's progress in mind is the best possible friend, because the teacher knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that you excel. And second, {{there is no such thing}} as an impossible deadline. I have worked on many tough assignments, some of which had the country's top leaders watching over my work, but the assurance I gained in my capabilities at MIT thanks to Professor Srinivasan helped me later in life too." ...|$|E
