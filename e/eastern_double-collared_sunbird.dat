50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>double-collared</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{is a small}} species. The {{adult male}} has upper parts a {{metallic}} green, dark wings and tail, and a red breast band and olive belly. The beak is strongly curved and used to sip nectar from flowers. The adult female is olive above, with brown on the wings and yellowish-green underparts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>double-collared</b> <b>sunbird</b> feeds {{alone or}} in pairs, or may join small flocks of mixed species, which are often led by the white-headed wood hoopoe (Phoeniculus bollei). It feeds on nectar, insects, spiders and small molluscs; the insects include flies, neuropterans and hymenopterans. Flying ants may be caught on the wing, prey {{invertebrates}} are picked off the backs of leaves, and inflorescences are explored acrobatically to extract nectar.|$|E
40|$|Social trait {{evolution}} {{can play}} a critical role in diversification and speciation. In birds, and especially oscine songbirds, the lability, species-specificity, and behavioral functions of song suggest that song divergence may lead or sustain the speciation process. This series of studies focuses on the evolution of song and its consequences in the Eastern Afromontane sky island sunbird species complex, which comprises the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Double-collared</b> <b>Sunbird</b> Nectarinia mediocris and its close relatives. In Chapter 1, I examine the structure of one vocalization type, here termed perched song, for the members of the species complex. I show that song divergence matches molecular phylogenetic reconstructions for six major lineages of the species complex, and that song divergence is multi-dimensional. I use both unsupervised and supervised grouping techniques to assess the distinctness of song phenotypes as measured, with similar results. Model selection after unsupervised clustering analysis suggests that six clusters exist, and these correspond to a priori species distinctions at 92. 8 %. Model-based discriminant function analysis also correctly identifies songs to the six species designated a priori at 92. 8 %. The discovery and characterization of the contact zone between Nectarinia moreaui and N. fuelleborni are detailed in Chapter 2. Molecular analyses reveal that there is hybridization, with little or no introgression, between the two species where they meet. The absence of an apparent ecological gradient closely corresponding with the abrupt spatial replacement of one species with the other suggested that interactions between the two species play a strong role in limiting each others' distribution. To test whether bioclimatic niche divergence is evident between species, I used ecological niche models developed from climate variables associated with species occurrence points. I show that the niches of the two species as characterized are conserved relative to a null distribution as generated by sampling the space within which each species' distribution is embedded. This test supports the hypothesis that the presence of each species inhibits the expansion of the others' distribution. Further, I characterize individual genotypes and song and bill length phenotypes sampled in a transect across the contact zone to estimate and compare the width of character clines. Cline analyses show that the genotype and song phenotype clines are roughly coincident and concordant, and very narrow, with the estimated cline width for these two characters ~ 1. 5 km. The bill length cline is offset from the other two clines, and wider. I discuss the many processes that could contribute to the stability and narrowness of the genotype and song clines, including conspecific clumping. In Chapter 3, I present the results of two playback experiments performed to examine male territorial responses to divergent signals in the parapatrically distributed N. moreaui and N. fuelleborni. These two species have diverged greatly in song phenotype, and subtly in morphometric and plumage traits. The first of the two experiments examines responses to multimodal signaling by assessing reactions to mount/song playback combinations, which are crossed for the two species. This experiment resulted in asymmetric heterospecific response between the two species, with N. moreaui responding consistent with predictions based on the species recognition hypothesis, and N. fuelleborni failing to respond more frequently to its own song than to N. moreaui song. Duration of response by treatment did not correspond to expectations based on species recognition, as there was a trend for individuals to respond longer to heterospecific mounts. In the second experiment, I investigated geographic variation in territorial response to the sibling species compared to own species' song and an ecologically relevant control stimulus, in the form of the song of a sunbird that co-occurs with both species for all tested populations. Responses to the control species were infrequent. Geographic variation in response differences to heterospecific (sibling taxon) and conspecific songs occurs. Strong responses to heterospecifics were not limited to the area of contact in N. fuelleborni, suggesting a role for stochastic processes in the evolutionary loss of response to the sibling taxon's song. To conclude, song divergence accompanies molecular divergence in the Eastern Afromontane sky island sunbird species complex. Its role in the speciation process might be quite complex, and not as simple as the correlated evolution of female preference with male phenotype as in a Fisherian runaway process. I suggest that one role of song divergence during allopatric or parapatric speciation may be to reduce co-occurrence of individuals with dissimilar song phenotypes through anisotropic dispersal...|$|E

5000|$|The {{flowers are}} fed at by {{a range of}} {{nectarivorous}} birds, mainly sunbirds and sugarbirds, including the orange-breasted sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea), southern <b>double-collared</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris chalybeus), malachite sunbird (Nectarinia famosa), and the Cape sugarbird (Promerops cafer). In order to reach the nectar, the bird must push its bill into the inflorescence. As it does so, its bill and face gets brushed with pollen, thereby allowing for possible pollination.|$|R
50|$|Flowers produce copious {{amounts of}} nectar which attract birds, {{especially}} the Lesser <b>Double-collared</b> <b>Sunbird</b> and Malachite Sunbird. The butterfly Dantalis breeds in the tree. Flowers {{are followed by}} attractive, large, lime green to pink seedpods which turn brown when ripe. The seed is dispersed through an explosive seedpod, which when dry, catapults the seeds great distances from the parent plant. Seeds are produced in May and June of each year. Under normal circumstancesmstances the seeds would germinate in moist soil in late spring after the winter rains.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>double-collared</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{is usually}} seen singly {{or in small}} groups. Its flight is fast and direct on short wings. It lives mainly on nectar from flowers, but takes some fruit, and, especially when feeding young, insects and spiders. It can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perches to feed most of the time. The call is a hard chee-chee, and the song is high pitched jumble of tinkling notes, rising and falling in pitch and tempo for 3-5 seconds or more.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>double-collared</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{is often}} found in small mixed-species flocks and often associates with the black-capped speirops (Zosterops lugubris) and the oriole finch (Linurgus olivaceus).

It is aggressive throughout the year and attacks con-specific males, sometimes resulting in mid-air fights which may continue on the ground. It also does battle with the Cameroon sunbird (Cyanomitra oritis) and the olive-bellied sunbird (Cinnyris chloropygia).|$|R

40|$|Substantial {{amounts of}} {{maternal}} androgens {{are found in}} birds' eggs and {{have been shown to}} benefit offspring development. Within-clutch patterns of increasing androgen concentrations over the laying sequence are often hypothesized to compensate for the negative effects of hatching asynchrony. However, detrimental effects to offspring fitness of exposure to high yolk androgen levels have also been demonstrated. This suggests that mothers should forego these costs to their offspring when the need for compensation for hatching asynchrony is low or when alternative compensatory strategies, e. g. in terms of increasing egg mass, are available. Here we show that in the south-temperate lesser <b>double-collared</b> <b>sunbird</b> Nectarinia chalybea, a species with hatching asynchrony but also with high survival of last-hatched chicks, mothers do not deposit resources differentially in terms of either yolk androgen concentration or egg mass across the laying sequence.

40|$|Using {{the point}} count method, linear mixed models, Shannonâ€™s {{diversity}} index, and Bray-Curtis cluster analysis, {{we conducted a}} study of the effect of urban fabric layout on bird diversity and distribution in northern Rwanda. The results showed a significant effect of city landscapes on bird richness and relative abundance; residential neighborhoods, institutional grounds, and informal settlements had the highest species diversity in comparison to other microlandscape types. Riversides were characterized by specialized bird species, commonly known to be restricted to wetland environments. Built-up areas and open field landscapes had comparable results.
