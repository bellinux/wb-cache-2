50|$|The {{winner of}} the Wood Memorial has not won the Kentucky Derby since 2000, in part because several became injured in the weeks between the two races. For example, Toby's Corner missed the Derby with {{lameness}} in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hind <b>leg</b> (2011), Eskendereya with a soft tissue injury in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> front <b>leg</b> (2010), I Want Revenge with a ligament injury to his right front ankle (2009) and Buddha with separation of the hoof wall from the laminae of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> front <b>leg</b> (2002).|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} few months of his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg,</b> and chronic nausea; by the summer of 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood.

5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an {{economic}} collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E

Following the examinations, it was reported that Malaj had injured <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg's</b> ligament which requires surgery, ending thus his season. He successfully underwent surgery on 13 May.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Tour de France, Ag2r {{had one of}} their better single-day {{finishes}} {{of the season with}} Chérel taking fifth place at Polynormande. Ravard had a string of top-ten placings in the later season, coming third at Paris–Brussels, eighth at the Grand Prix d'Isbergues, and seventh at Paris–Bourges. Ravard was also the rider responsible for the team's lone single-day victory of the season at the Châteauroux Classic, where he raced as the defending champion and took his third career win in the event. Ravard won a large field sprint, a victory which he felt validated his career. He had been considering retirement due to a medical abnormality, as a muscle in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> is twice the size of the same muscle in his right.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{had serious}} health {{problems}} in his later life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Keenor {{was badly}} wounded when {{a piece of}} {{artillery}} shrapnel struck <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> above the knee on 28 July, leaving him unable to walk. An unknown soldier saw Keenor attempting to crawl away from the incoming fire and managed to assist {{him back to the}} nearby medical facilities where doctors were able to tend to his injury. The wound was so severe that army doctors debated the idea of amputating the leg but decided against the idea. He was removed from the Western Front, being transported to an army hospital in Dublin where he spent six months undergoing rehabilitation on his injured leg. Following his return to service, Keenor was stationed in Chatham, Kent as a fitness instructor for the 5th Reserve Brigade. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Victory Medal, the 1914–15 Star and the British War Medal for his service during the war. Between 1915 and 1919, Keenor appeared as a guest for Brentford in the London Combination.|$|E

5|$|General Sir Ian Hamilton {{presided over}} the memorial's {{unveiling}} on Sunday, 9 October 1927, at a ceremony attended by Lutyens. The unveiling itself was performed by a local veteran, Bertie Withers. Withers was selected at random after candidates were solicited from the city's ex-servicemen who met four criteria: that they were natives of Norwich; had enlisted prior {{to the implementation of}} conscription in 1916; had served overseas; and had been permanently disabled {{as a result of their}} service. Withers enlisted on 1 September 1914 and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915; after a bout of illness he rejoined his unit to fight in the First Battle of Gaza, where his battalion suffered heavy casualties. Withers himself was injured and, after his evacuation, <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated below the knee.

5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} game of the 2012–13 season, Nash {{suffered}} a non-displaced fracture in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> after a collision with Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers.
