25|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{predicted that the}} system would have a practical detection range {{on the order of}} , but never managed to stretch this much beyond 3 miles. Much of this was due to the inefficient system being used to blank out the receiver during the transmission pulse, which wasted most of the radio energy. This final piece of the puzzle was provided by Arthur Cooke, who suggested using the Sutton tube filled with a dilute gas as a switch, replacing the spark gap system. During transmission, the power of the magnetron would cause the gas to ionise, presenting an almost perfect radio mirror that would prevent the signal from reaching the output. When the pulse ended the gas would rapidly <b>de-ionise,</b> allowing signals to flow across (or around) the cavity and reach the output. Skinner took up development of the concept with Ward and Starr, initially trying helium and hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. The resulting design, known as a soft Sutton tube, went into production as the CV43 and the first examples arrived in the summer of 1941.|$|R

After drying and further chemical cleaning and treatment to prevent corrosion, the arm-ring was returned to the body for display.|$|E

50|$|Air ionisers {{are used}} in air purifiers to remove {{particles}} from air. Airborne particles are attracted to the electrode in an effect similar to static electricity. These ions are <b>de-ionised</b> by seeking earthed conductors, such as walls and ceilings. To increase the efficiency of this process, some commercial products provide such surfaces within the device. The frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service (NHS) to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne acinetobacter infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser—the infection rate fell to zero, an unexpected result. Positive and negative ions produced by air conditioning systems have also been found by a manufacturer to inactivate viruses including influenza.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{fundamental}} science underpinning {{the interaction of}} saline water and clay minerals was studied under flotation contexts to address important problems confronting the coal industry. For the first time, the beneficial effect of clay minerals in some flotation scenarios was revealed after testing a typical coal sample having a low content of clay minerals and its mixture with another coal sample having a high content of clay minerals in <b>de-ionised</b> water and saline water with medium conductivity. Equipped {{with a range of}} techniques including froth stability measurements, modelling true flotation, settling tests and Cryo-SEM analyses, it was found that froth stability was higher in the flotation with a higher concentration of clay minerals in both <b>de-ionised</b> water and saline water, corresponding to increased combustible matter recovery and ash recovery. A synergistic interaction was evident between saline water and clay minerals in stabilising the froth and recovering combustible matter by true flotation. This is because saline water promoted the formation of association of clay platelets that sustained in the dynamic flotation condition, entered the flotation concentrate and altered the froth property and coarse coal flotation behaviour...|$|E

40|$|A specially-designed {{vertical}} {{wind tunnel}} {{was used to}} freely suspend individual liquid drops of 5 mm initial diameter to investigate drop dynamics, terminal velocity and heat and mass transfer rates. Droplets of distilled, <b>de-ionised</b> water, n-propanol, iso-butanol, monoethanolamine and heptane were studied over a temperature range of 50 oC to 82 oC. The effects of substances that may provide drop surface rigidity (e. g. surface active agents, binders and polymers) on mass transfer rates were investigated by doping distilled <b>de-ionised</b> water drops with sodium di-octyl sulfo-succinate surfactant. Mass transfer rates decreased with reduced drop oscillation {{as a result of}} surfactant addition, confirming the importance of droplet surface instability. Rigid naphthalene spheres and drops which formed a skin were also studied; the results confirmed the reduced transfer rates in the absence of drop fluidity. Following consideration of fundamental drop dynamics in air and experimental results from this study, a novel dimensionless group, the Oteng-Attakora, (OT), number was included in the mass transfer equation to account for droplet surface behaviour and for prediction of heat and mass transfer rates from single drops which exhibit surface instability at Re>= 500.

Significant decreases in specific K-hstem and K-hxylem values were observed with increasing stem maturity from M 1 to M 4 and over time during vase life evaluation. Neither specific K-hstem nor K-hxylem was consistently improved with 10 mM KCl as the perfusion solution.

40|$|The rapid {{depletion}} of finite {{fossil fuel resources}} {{and the increase in}} greenhouse gasses due to fossil fuel use has led to greater efforts into the search for alternative fuels for transportation. Many studies of alternative fuels have shown that hydrogen is one of the clean and inexhaustible fuels that can {{become a part of the}} overall solution to the transportation fuel debate. This thesis covers the research of a totally closed loop system of producing hydrogen from electrolysis as well as the use of hydrogen as a fuel in a converted standard gasoline internal combustion engine car. Due to the increase in use and application of hydrogen as an energy carrier for stationary and mobile applications, there is increasing pressure to ensure the safe handling and monitoring of this highly combustible gas. The associated equipment to monitor and measure the explosion limit of any leakage together with the pressure and flow rate is very expensive. Any reliable mathematical or empirical means to estimate and predict those safety features of hydrogen will greatly assist in avoiding expensive instrumentation. In this thesis, Artificial Intelligent predictive models including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are presented as virtual sensors for the accurate estimation of hydrogen parameters such as the percentage lower explosive limit, hydrogen pressure and hydrogen flow rate. These parameters are shown as a function of different input conditions of the power supplied (voltage and current), the feed of <b>de-ionised</b> water and various system parameters of a proton exchange membrane electrolyser.
