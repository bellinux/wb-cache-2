40|$|Abstract—A new ocean {{wind vector}} {{retrieval}} method is {{proposed that the}} wind speed and direction are estimated simultaneously using the normalized radar cross sections detected from different angles and geophysical model function according to the sounding characteristics of airborne SAR. The wind direction ambiguity is removed by using the odd symmetry property of polarimetric correlation coefficient with the changes in wind direction. To evaluate the ocean wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval</b> errors and effects, the C band airborne SAR data are used to obtain the wind speed and direction by the proposed method. Estimated wind vector are compared with wind measurements from buoys. We show that the wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval</b> method is suited to retrieve high precision wind speed and direction from airborne SAR sounding data without other background sources.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a wrapped-data-switching model and a corresponding regional unwrapping algorithm for 2 D phase <b>fields</b> <b>retrieval.</b> In contrast to earlier techniques, which only produce successive frames of transient unwrapping, the proposed method can produce correct unwrapping in quasi-one frames. The approach tolerates isolated phase inconsistencies, {{and thus is}} quite effective for unwrapping speckle-coded contour map with numerous discrete inconsistencies. Since the analysis {{is based on a}} wrapped-data-switching model, the proposed criterion is path independent and error-propagation free. Additionally, the criteria are simple, concise, efficient, and easily implemented. The criteria and characteristics of the algorithm are demonstrated by simulating ideal and problematic cases, as well as by conducting experiments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Two {{different}} concepts for {{noise filtering}} in a DOPPLER radar wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval</b> are compared. The first technique is a smoothing on the raw radar data. The second method uses a smoothness constraint within a variational technique {{in which a}} model wind field is adjusted to radar data by minimizing a cost function. The wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval</b> algorithm is described by PROTAT and ZAWADZKI (1999) and is further extended here by adding a topography constraint for its application in mountainous terrain. The experiments are carried out with analytic wind fields artificially affected by noise. In a first step only the horizontal wind is retrieved. In a second step the continuity equation serves to calculate the three-dimensional wind field. Power spectra and an error analysis of the retrieved wind fields {{as well as the}} performance of the algorithm lead to the following results. An efficient noise filtering by a mere data smoothing is accompanied by a lack of accuracy in the retrieved wind components. The smoothness constraint eliminates the noise more efficiently than smoothing of raw data while producing an accurate wind field. For the retrieval of the vertical velocity wind field, the smoothness constraint is indispensable...|$|E

Based on the C-band GMF CMOD_IFR 2, an updated empirical retrieval model of the sea surface wind field called SIRX-MOD is derived. In situ buoy measurements and the scatterometer data of ERS- 1 /SCAT are used to validate the retrieved sea surface wind speeds from the X-SAR data with SIRX-MOD, which respectively yield biases of 0. 13 m/s and 0. 16 m/s and root mean square (RMS) errors of 1. 83 m/s and 1. 63 m/s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRetrieval of sea {{wind vector}} from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data {{is one of}} the most widely used methods, since it can give high wind {{resolution}} cell.

40|$|The {{retrieval}} of wind fields from scatterometer observations has traditional been separated into two phases; local wind vector retrieval and ambiguity removal. Operationally, a forward model relating wind vector to backscatter is inverted, typically using look up tables, to retrieve {{up to four}} local wind vector solutions. A heuristic procedure, using numerical weather prediction forecast wind vectors and often some ‘buddy checking ’ is then used to select the correct solution. In this paper we develop a Bayesian method for wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval,</b> and show how a direct local inverse model, relating backscatter to wind vector, improves the wind vector retrieval accuracy. We compare these results with the operational U. K. Meteorological Office retrievals, our own Cmod 4 retrievals and a neural network based local forward model retrieval. We suggest that the neural network based inverse model, which is extremely fast to use, improves upon current forward models when used in a variational data assimilation scheme.

40|$|Dual-polarization and Doppler radar {{observations}} {{allow for}} the detailed analysis of microphysical and dynamic processes in clouds and precipitation. The dual-polarization Doppler C-band weather radar POLDIRAD (polarization diversity Doppler radar) was installed at the DLR site Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich in Southern Germany in 1986. It was the first fully C-band polarimetric weather radar in Europe and {{has been used for}} various research projects and is operated for research only (Schroth et al., 1988). Meanwhile a number of upgrades of the system have been performed. Research applications and field campaigns showed the value of modern weather radars for the understanding of the microphysics and dynamics of meso-scale systems like thunderstorms and cold-fronts. In the presentation we will first introduce principles of dual-polarization and Doppler techniques and then present some examples of observations from a number of field campaigns performed in Southern Germany. To investigate the influence of the Alps on cold-frontal systems a single-Doppler wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval</b> system was developed and applied during the German Front Experiment. A cold front with a narrow rain-band was observed in the morning of 19 Dec. 1987. As the front approaches the Alps from the North-West, the narrow rain-bands were deformed and finally the rain-bands were dissolved. With the wind <b>field</b> <b>retrieval</b> technique it was possible to show that the warm conveyor-belt preceding the cold front was degraded when the front reached the Alps and thus preventing the front to cross the Alps (Hagen, 1992). The influence of mountains on the initiation of convection was the focus of the COPS campaign in 2007 (Wulfmeyer et al., 2008). The initiation of convection depends not only on the available convective energy and humidity, but also on the flow over and around a mountain. A study of numerous events {{in the vicinity of the}} Vosges Mountains in Eastern France showed that the Froude number of the flow controls whether convection is initiated over the mountain ridge or on the lee side of the mountain (Hagen et al., 2011). During the COPS campaign an outstanding isolated single-cell thunderstorm was observed. This storm developed over the Black-Forest Mountains when a convergence line crossed the mountain ridge. Almost no other convection was observed during that day. With the help of dual-polarization observations and multiple-Doppler analysis the life-cycle was analyzed in detail. Additional observations by satellite and lighting detection system provided further understanding of the initiation and life-cycle of system (Schmidt et al., 2012) ...|$|E

In this paper we analyze Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) measurement obtained over Thar desert during 1992 - 1996. The vegetation intensity over land is reflected in the incidence angle diversity of the ERS scatterometer. Temporal variations in the NRCS in relation to rainfall and vegetation cover are compared.

The evaluation of continental hydrology is therefore a crucial task that requires offline simulations driven by realistic atmospheric forcing to avoid the systematic biases commonly found in global atmospheric models. Generally, this evaluation is done mainly by comparison with in situ river discharge data, which does not guarantee that the spatiotemporal distribution of water storage and evapotranspiration is correctly simulated. In this context, the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere–Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (ISBA-TRIP) continental hydrological system of the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques is evaluated by using the addi-tional constraint of terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations derived from three independent gravity <b>field</b> <b>retrievals</b> (datasets) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE).
