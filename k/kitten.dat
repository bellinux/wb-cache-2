5|$|On 7 April 1986, {{a healthy}} hybrid <b>kitten</b> between a male serval {{and a female}} {{domestic}} cat was born; this <b>kitten</b> was larger than a typical domestic <b>kitten</b> and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to have inherited a few domestic traits, such as tameness, from its mother. The hybrid cat may have a doglike habit of following its owner about, and {{can be a good}} swimmer. Over the years, savannah cats have gained popularity as pets.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a <b>kitten.</b> The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word <b>kitten</b> was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed narrator, while gazing {{upon his}} pet cat, begins to reminisce about {{a law in}} the town of Ulthar which forbids the killing of cats and relates the story of how this law came to be. The tale begins with the {{introduction}} of an old cotter and his wife who delight in trapping and violently killing any cats who venture onto their property. The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter's house. One night a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They bring with them an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a small, black <b>kitten</b> to keep him company. After being unable to find his <b>kitten</b> on the third day of his stay, Menes hears the stories of the old cotter and his wife, and decides to take action.|$|E

Mm munchkin <b>kittens</b> {{will be able to}} pass on the munchkin gene to their own offspring. Normal mm <b>kittens</b> will not, as {{they do not have a}} copy of the munchkin gene.|$|R
50|$|Pluto {{carries the}} basket inside and discovers it {{is loaded with}} <b>kittens,</b> evidentially orphaned. Mickey and Minnie are at first charmed by the <b>kittens,</b> but the <b>kittens</b> soon {{prove to be a}} nuisance. Nevertheless, Mickey and Minnie are {{determined}} to make the <b>kittens</b> welcome. Mickey leaves the room momentarily and soon returns dressed as Santa Claus with a bag full of toys. The <b>kittens</b> remove the contents, the majority of which are various implements of destruction such as saws, hammers, and toy weapons. The <b>kittens</b> go to work and destroy the piano and other furniture. Finally Mickey and Minnie reveal their Christmas tree, but the <b>kittens</b> remove all the decorations and foliage.|$|R
40|$|Twenty <b>kittens</b> were vaccinated with a Giardia lamblia vaccine {{prepared}} on {{a commercial}} scale on day 0 and boosted on day 21 (group 1); while 10 <b>kittens</b> received only saline (group 2). These <b>kittens</b> were challenged on day 35 with 10 (6) Giardia lamblia trophozoites by a surgical intraduodenal injection. Three control <b>kittens</b> were not vaccinated and not challenged (group 3). Following challenge, Giardia vaccinated <b>kittens</b> had significantly fewer days in which abnormal stools were observed and reduced food intake occurred compared to saline injected animals. The rate of weight gain between group 1 and group 2 animals was not different in the prechallenge period (day 0 to day 35), but vaccinated animals had a significantly higher weight gain in the postchallenge period (P < 0. 05). On day 56, all vaccinated animals were not passing cysts in their feces, while 40 % of saline injected <b>kittens</b> had Giardia cysts in their feces. In vaccinated <b>kittens,</b> cysts were never demonstrated in 45 % of the animals, while cysts were detected in 90 % of the saline injected <b>kittens.</b> Viability of the cysts in vaccinated <b>kittens</b> was 38 % while the cysts viability in saline injected <b>kittens</b> was 99 %. On postmortem examination, trophozoites could be detected in 5 % of vaccinated <b>kittens</b> and 60 % of saline injected <b>kittens.</b> Vaccination produced an elevated Giardia specific serum IgG and IgA response prior to challenge and throughout the postinfection period. The Giardia infection in the saline injected group did not induce an elevated specific serum response. Giardia vaccination of <b>kittens</b> provides protection in <b>kittens</b> from an experimental challenge by reducing or eliminating intestinal trophozoites and fecal cyst excretion...|$|R
5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray <b>kitten</b> home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The <b>kitten</b> was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E
5|$|The Rise of Scourge was {{released}} on 24 June 2008 and, unlike the other manga which form trilogies, is a standalone volume. The story details the early life of BloodClan leader Scourge, one of the antagonists in The Darkest Hour, who is bullied in his youth for being small.

50|$|Colors and {{patterns}} in any litter depend both on statistical chance {{and the color}} genetics {{and patterns}} of the parents. Breeding between two mink-patterned cats will, on average, produce half mink <b>kittens</b> and one quarter each pointed and solid <b>kittens.</b> A pointed and a solid bred together will always produce all mink patterned <b>kittens.</b> A pointed bred to a mink will produce half pointed and half mink <b>kittens,</b> and a solid bred to a mink will produce half solid and half mink <b>kittens.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1986, Sindy {{manufacturers}} {{took advantage}} of new colour-changing technology and released Magic Moments Sindy, a doll whose hair and swimming costume changed colour when immersed in warm water. Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included <b>kitten</b> heels, sandals, knee-high boots, ankle boots, trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|E
5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray <b>kitten</b> had made its way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hemograms, {{erythrocyte}} volume distribution curves, {{serum iron}} and percent transferrin saturation determinations were done on samples from 50 <b>kittens</b> to characterize feline erythrocytic responses {{between one and}} ten weeks of age. At one week of age, all <b>kittens</b> had marked macrocytosis and anisocytosis. Most of the macrocytic cells no longer were present by five weeks. Macrocytes were replaced by erythrocytes of normal volume in 30 % of the <b>kittens.</b> At five weeks of age, 70 %of the <b>kittens</b> had produced microcytic cells which correlated with significantly lower packed cell volume values (p < 0. 02) and mean corpuscular volume values (p < 0. 00 I). Byseven weeks of age, <b>kittens</b> with microcytosis were producing normocytic erythrocytes. Between two and four weeks of age, <b>kittens</b> with microcytosis had significantly lower serum iron and percent transferrin saturation values (p < 0. 01) compared to <b>kittens</b> without microcytosis. Between five and seven weeks of age, all <b>kittens</b> had very high iron values which were significantly greater than those of healthy adult cats (p < 0. 0 I). Six <b>kittens</b> with low iron values received an iron dextran injection at {{two to three weeks}} of age.

5|$|On January 18, 1988, Vicki Myron, a {{librarian}} at the Spencer Public Library, discovered an eight-week-old male <b>kitten</b> {{that had been}} left in the library's drop box the previous night. Myron nursed the cat, who was suffering from frostbite, back to health and named him Dewey, after Melvil Dewey, inventor of the Dewey Decimal library classification system. The library decided to keep him as a library cat and his story first received publicity in the Spencer Daily Reporter a week after his discovery.|$|E
5|$|The Singapura was {{accepted}} for registration by the CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. In between this period, breeders {{found that the}} occasional litter would have a solid colored <b>kitten,</b> caused by the recessive gene for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the recessive gene. It was discovered {{that two of the}} three foundation cats carried this gene.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} with Aya {{returning}} home from a rough day at work. After relaxing on her bed, she receives {{a phone call from}} her father, who wants to have dinner with her; however, she declines by lying about still being at work. The narrator then reminisces about Aya's childhood and family life, particularly dwelling upon how her maturity and independence had created distance between her and her father, who is increasingly lonely yet happy for her. Later that night, Aya awakes to another phone call from her father. Having learned of Mii's death, she visits her father and has lunch with him, an experience that brings the two closer together. Aya later visits her father to see the new <b>kitten</b> he buys. At the same time, her mother rings the doorbell and the family is reunited, their happiness renewed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kittens</b> {{require a}} high-calorie diet that {{contains}} more protein than the diet of adult cats. Young orphaned <b>kittens</b> require cat milk {{every two to}} four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate. Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young <b>kittens,</b> because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients. Human-reared <b>kittens</b> {{tend to be very}} affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than <b>kittens</b> reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression. Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these <b>kittens</b> may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned <b>kittens</b> (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rare}} {{instance}} {{where there are}} more cats than fit {{in the range of}} numbers, the next class starts with the first available number. For example, if there are 55 longhair <b>kittens,</b> then those <b>kittens</b> are 1-55, the shorthair <b>kittens</b> would start at 56.|$|R

5|$|MD 170 {{continues}} {{north as}} Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets {{the eastern end}} of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad {{on its way to the}} BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses <b>Kitten</b> Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of I-195 and the northern terminus of MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with the Baltimore Light Rail. Access to the rail line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection.

50|$|At 24h after birth, <b>kittens</b> can {{discriminate}} between their mothers teat and a foreign teat.Studies indicate that <b>kittens</b> have different preferences when being weaned {{and this is}} based on specific prenatal and postnatal exposure to various flavours.For example, <b>kittens</b> exposed to cheese flavor during pregnancy and the first week after birth oriented preferentially toward cheese-flavored chicken.The weaning process normally begins when <b>kittens</b> are around four weeks old, and is usually completed when they reach 8-10 weeks. {{it is important to remember}} that abrupt removal from the mother cat can have a negative effect on the kitten’s health and socialization skills.Weaning <b>kittens</b> should be done when the <b>kittens</b> reach 4 weeks old. They should be placed in a separate area for a few hours at a time to reduce their dependence on the mother’s milk and her overall presence. The <b>kittens</b> should be put in their own special area with a litter box, food and water bowls.|$|R

Eventually because of strained relationship between Mammoth Records and Atlantic Records, Mammoth cut Chainsaw <b>Kittens</b> loose.Because the Smashing Pumpkins and Chainsaw <b>Kittens</b> had shared producers and toured together in the early 1990s, members of both bands had become friends. So when James Iha and D'arcy Wretzky of Smashing Pumpkins started their own independent label Scratchie Records, the available Chainsaw <b>Kittens</b> were the perfect place to start. In 1996, the Chainsaw <b>Kittens</b> released their self-titled album, Chainsaw <b>Kittens,</b> under Scratchie Records. Later, the band released a fifth full-length album, The All American, on Four Alarm Records.

2500|$|For {{the first}} several weeks, <b>kittens</b> are unable to urinate or defecate without being stimulated by their mother. They are also unable to {{regulate}} their body temperature {{for the first three}} weeks, so <b>kittens</b> born in temperatures less than [...] can die from hypothermia if their mother does not keep them warm. The mother's milk is very important for the kittens' nutrition and proper growth. This milk transfers antibodies to the <b>kittens,</b> which helps protect them against infectious disease. Newborn <b>kittens</b> are unable to produce concentrated urine, and so have a very high requirement for fluids. <b>Kittens</b> open their eyes about seven to ten days after birth.
