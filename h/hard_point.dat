5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited <b>hard</b> <b>point</b> weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single <b>hard</b> <b>point</b> under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited {{the possibilities for}} handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and <b>hard</b> <b>point</b> for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E

25|$|According to {{aerospace}} publication Flight International, the Alpha Jet {{was more}} complex than competing second generation trainer aircraft, required seven man hours of maintenance for every flight hour. Nearly 5,000lb of munitions and equipment may be carried upon {{a total of five}} hardpoints, four of these being located upon the wings and a single one at the centerline on the lower fuselage. In an armed configuration, a gun pod containing a 30mm DEFA cannon (as installed on French aircraft) or 27mm Mauser BK-27 cannon (as installed on German aircraft) would be typically be installed upon the centerline <b>hard</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The F6F series were {{designed}} to take damage and get the pilot safely back to base. A bullet-resistant windshield {{and a total of}} 212lb (96kg) of cockpit armor was fitted, along with armor around the oil tank and oil cooler. A 250gal (946l) self-sealing fuel tank was fitted in the fuselage. Standard armament on the F6F-3 consisted of six [...]50in (12.7mm) M2/AN Browning air-cooled machine guns with 400 rounds per gun. A center-section hardpoint under the fuselage could carry a single 150gal (568l) disposable drop tank, while later aircraft had single bomb racks installed under each wing, inboard of the undercarriage bays; with these and the center-section <b>hard</b> <b>point</b> late model F6F-3s could carry a total bomb-load in excess of 2,000lb (900kg). Six 5in (127mm) HVARs (High Velocity Aircraft Rocket) could be carried; three under each wing on [...] "zero-length" [...] launchers.|$|E
60|$|Annatock now {{advanced}} more cautiously, {{and when}} within {{a hundred yards}} of the huge monster, lay down at full length on his breast, and began to work his way towards it after {{the manner of a}} seal. He was so like a seal in his hairy garments that he might easily have been mistaken for one by a more intellectual animal than a walrus. But the walrus did not awake, and he approached to within ten yards. Then, rising suddenly to his feet, Annatock poised the heavy weapon, and threw it with full force against the animal's side. It struck, and, as if it had fallen on an adamantine rock, it bounded off and fell upon the ice, with its <b>hard</b> <b>point</b> shattered and its handle broken in two.|$|E

5000|$|After 270, the {{maintenance}} of an impenetrable solid frontier was abandoned by Constantine I {{in favor of a}} policy, whether deliberate or forced by circumstance, of [...] "defense in depth". This called for {{the maintenance}} of a softer, deeper perimeter area of defense, with concentrated <b>hard</b> <b>points</b> throughout its depth. The idea was that any invading force of a sufficient size could penetrate the initial perimeter but in doing so with any element of surprise or rapid movement would be forced to leave several defended <b>hard</b> <b>points</b> (fortresses) to its rear, hampering its lines of supply and communications, and threatening surrounding of the force.|$|R

50|$|The final {{simplification}} {{made to the}} Luscombe 8 {{design was}} the introduction in 1948 of the Silflex landing gear. This was a cantilever tubular-steel gear attached to a spring-oleo unit. It was four inches (102 mm) wider than the original wire-braced gear, simpler to manufacture, and stronger in side-load. It also reduced the incidence of ground-looping, and was less prone to damage when ground loops did occur. While the gear usually survived ground incidents, its strength often resulted in serious fuselage damage at the <b>hard</b> <b>point</b> attachments which was difficult to repair without jigging.|$|E
