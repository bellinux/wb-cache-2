5|$|In 2009, Company C, 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment was {{deployed}} to the Horn of Africa and stationed at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, after completing a 14-month deployment at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Company C carried the crew-served weapons {{to protect the}} camp. It also operated the <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> checkpoints, protected U.S. and allied ships at the massive Djibouti Port, and guarded the U.S. Embassy there. By mid-2009, {{the rest of the}} battalion deployed there in case a larger combat maneuver element was needed to operate from the base. The area is considered to be the most unstable part of Africa, and the Somali border is less than 10 miles from Camp Lemonnier.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} Theater Immersion Training, TTB is {{designed}} to rapidly build combat-ready units by simulating military environments encountered during missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Balkans. Soldiers live in tents with modular units provided for shower and sink facilities, and the base is surrounded by barriers filled with dirt and barbed wire, <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> points and guard towers. The base is {{named in honor of}} Sgt. Michael J. Kelley of Scituate, Mass. Kelley, a member of E Battery (Target Acquisition) of the 101st Field Artillery, was killed in action in Afghanistan on June 8, 2005.|$|E
25|$|Crown gall disease {{caused by}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be {{controlled}} via {{a variety of different}} methods. The best means of control for this disease is by taking preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools if these tools are used on infected trees and shrubs, performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields. Another useful practice is to avoid wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation, such as budding and not grafting plants, since wounds are the main means of bacterial <b>entry.</b> <b>Control</b> of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.|$|E

40|$|Most {{brokerage}} {{problems are}} traceable to the troubled history of freight brokers, {{which has been}} a constant struggle between regulation and deregulation. Arguably, brokers have been subjected to more extremist regulation than any other industry during the last fifty years. The pattern of extremism began when Congress imposed massive regulations on freight brokers as part of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. The 1935 regulations completely stifled the U. S. brokerage industry. Forty-five years later, Congress moved to the other regulatory extreme when it passed the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 6 which virtually deregulated the brokerage industry The eased <b>entry</b> <b>controls</b> of the 1980 Act have led to considerable broker abuse. 8 Since deregulation, the industry has been inundated with undercapitalized, fly-by-night brokers who are preying on unsuspecting carriers and shippers. 9 While the strict <b>entry</b> <b>controls</b> of the 1935 Act stifled the brokerage industry 2 ̆ 7 s development, the eased <b>entry</b> <b>controls</b> of the 1980 Act resulted in higher prices, financial instability, protracted litigation 12 ̆ 7 and an increase in bankruptcies. 2 ̆ 21 Due to this regulatorypandemonium, brokers present an exemplary microcosm of the intrinsic struggle between the forces of regulation and deregulation...|$|R

25|$|The 4th Infantry Division's Support Brigade held a Casing of the Colors {{ceremony}} for the brigade and Support Battalion colors during retreat at Cameron Field on 8 September 2005. The event signified the unit's deployment to Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 470 soldiers of the Support Brigade were the first personnel from the division to deploy to Iraq. They left in late September 2005. The brigade made two stops {{along the way to}} Camp Taji, one at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, and the other at Camp Anaconda, Iraq. Soldiers trained for two weeks at Camp Beuhring. The training went from basic firing skills like confirming their zero to more quick individual training at the close-quarters marksmanship course and reacting to a suspicious vehicle at an <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> point. The soldiers' training reached its peak with live-fire convoy exercises, where soldiers moved vehicles into defensive and offensive positions, moved disabled vehicles and requested medical evacuations for injured personnel.|$|E
25|$|Once inside, {{the attackers}} {{set fire to}} the base, burning down most of the barracks. Within the first hour, the American and Latvian {{defenders}} had collapsed to a tight internal perimeter, centered on the two buildings that were not burning. Regrouping there, they pushed out teams to retake much of the outpost. They expanded the perimeter {{all the way back to}} the <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> point and to the buildings on the western edge of the outpost, which became their final fighting position. U.S. air support directed by Sgt. Armando Avalos and Sgt. Jayson Souter, including attack helicopters, A-10s, a B-1 bomber, and F-15 fighters, destroyed the local mosque, where much of the insurgents' heaviest fire originated. Once OP Fritsche soldiers gained control of their mortar pit, Sgt. Avalos began directing indirect support to help the defense of COP Keating. Two USAF F-15E fighter bombers circled overhead, led by Captain Mike Polidor and his wingman, 1st Lt. Justin Pavoni, for almost eight hours, helping coordinate airstrikes by 19 other aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{battalion}} {{was originally}} {{scheduled to be}} relieved of responsibility for patrolling the area of operations around Camp Taji by the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment (2–7 CAV) on 9 April 2004, but the relief had to be delayed until 12 April 2004 {{due to the fact}} that the Heavy Equipment Transport System (HETS) transporting the M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles belonging to 2–7 CAV were delayed in transit by attacks against the 39th IBCT main body convoys south of Baghdad. After the arrival of the 2–7 CAV and the remainder of the 39th BCT main body, 1–206th FA provided fires in support of 39th Brigade Combat Team operations; served as the base defense operations center (BDOC); manned the main <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> point, Gunner Gate; provided the camp's quick reaction force (QRF); conducted convoy and VIP escorts; and, trained, equipped and organized the 307th Iraqi National Guard Battalion. The battalion's AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar section was located at Camp Taji to provide early warning and detection of insurgent fires against the 1st Cavalry Division. The 1–206th was augmented with one AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar from C Battery (Target Acquisition) 1–21st FA, 1st Cavalry Division Artillery.|$|E

The exercise consisted of three events: a table top exercise (TTX) focused on pandemic influenza response, senior manager disaster response, and multinational involvement; a field training exercise (FTX) consisting of area security, <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> point, vehicle control point, convoy security, non lethal weapons, and weapons training; and a humanitarian civic action (HCA) focused on providing medical and dental assistance to the local population. During the exercise, the BFSB – as part of Task Force Kitgum – performed command and control operations in Kitgum, Uganda, in order to synchronize multinational forces conducting field training exercises and humanitarian civic assistance operations to enhance interoperability among participating forces. the 560 BFSB served as a joint and multinational task force headquarters of over 1000 army, navy, air force, marines and personnel from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This was the largest exercise of its kind in East Africa and the first test of a BFSB as a joint and multinational HQs.|$|E

2500|$|Wee1 {{protein is}} a {{tyrosine}} kinase that normally phosphorylates the Cdc2 cell cycle regulatory protein (the homolog of CDK1 in humans), a cyclin-dependent kinase, on a tyrosine residue. [...] Cdc2 drives entry into mitosis by phosphorylating {{a wide range}} of targets. [...] This covalent [...] modification of the molecular structure of Cdc2 inhibits the enzymatic activity of Cdc2 and prevents cell division. Wee1 acts to keep Cdc2 inactive during early G2 when cells are still small. [...] When cells have reached sufficient size during G2, the phosphatase Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphorylation, and thus activates Cdc2 to allow mitotic entry. [...] A balance of Wee1 and Cdc25 activity with changes in cell size is coordinated by the mitotic <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> system. [...] It has been shown in Wee1 mutants, cells with weakened Wee1 activity, that Cdc2 becomes active when the cell is smaller. [...] Thus, mitosis occurs before the yeast reach their normal size. [...] This suggests that cell division may be regulated in part by dilution of Wee1 protein in cells as they grow larger.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1949, all Irish {{citizens}} were considered under British law to be British subjects. After Ireland declared itself a republic in that year, a consequent British law gave Irish citizens a similar status to Commonwealth {{citizens in the}} United Kingdom, notwithstanding that they had ceased to be such. Thus, much like British citizens in Ireland, Irish citizens in the United Kingdom have never been treated as foreigners. Irish citizens have, however, like Commonwealth citizens, been subject to immigration control in Britain since {{the enactment of the}} Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. Unlike Commonwealth citizens, Irish citizens have generally not been subject to <b>entry</b> <b>control</b> in the United Kingdom and, if they move to the UK, are considered to have 'settled status' (a status that goes beyond indefinite leave to remain). They may be subject to deportation from the UK upon the same basis as other European Economic Area nationals. In February 2007 the British government announced that a specially lenient procedure would apply to the deportation of Irish citizens compared to the procedure for other European Economic Area nationals. [...] As a result, Irish nationals are not routinely considered for deportation from the UK when they are released from prison.|$|E
