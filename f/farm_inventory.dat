40|$|Based on a swine producer's profit {{maximization}} {{model in which}} manure value and packers' live market weight pricing systems are considered, the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>inventory</b> and optimal hog market weight are simultaneously solved for scenarios generated from the combination of two crop rotations, two forms of manure storage, two levels of manure incorporation, and two nutrient application standards. First, our results suggest that manure value has {{a significant impact on}} the optimal <b>farm</b> <b>inventory</b> as well as on the profitability of an operation. The optimal size of operation identified is quite large and varies considerably among the scenarios. Our results indicate that shallow pit buildings with lagoons can support a larger operation scale and require less acreage for manure dispersion than systems with slurry basins. For slurry basin systems, manure applications with immediate incorporation are more profitable than applications with no incorporation. Second, our results show that the optimal hog market weight is insensitive to benefits and costs of manure handling and application, reflecting a dominant influence of the pricing system on a producer's hog marketing decision. Finally, our results show that though more acres are needed for manure application when a P standard is applied in a corn-soybean rotation, still a P standard is economically advantageous to swine farmers and this standard also makes better use of manure nutrients.

40|$|For Statistics Canada, {{there has}} been a {{substantial}} difference in the calculation of the value of physical change (VPC) of <b>farm</b> <b>inventories</b> by different divisions within the agency at current prices.

More specifically, Agriculture Division has used the annual approach to estimate VPC as a component of agricultural value added, Input-Output Division has used the same approach in its own calculations of gross output and value added for the Input-Output Tables, while the Industry Measures and Analysis Division has necessarily used the same approach, since the Input-Output estimates of gross output and value added at current prices are its benchmarks, from which it calculates gross output and value added in volume terms.

40|$|This study {{quantified}} {{interactions between}} animal welfare and farm profitability in British extensive sheep farming systems. Qualitative welfare assessment methodology {{was used to}} assess welfare from the animal's perspective in 20 commercial extensive sheep farms and to estimate labour demand for welfare, based on the assessed welfare scores using data collected from <b>farm</b> <b>inventories.</b> The estimated labour demand was then used as a coefficient in a linear program based model to establish the gross margin maximising farm management strategy for given farm situations, subject to constraints that reflected current resource limitations including labour supply. Regression analysis showed a significant relationship between the qualitative welfare assessment scores and labour supply on the <b>inventoried</b> <b>farms</b> but there was no significant relationship between current gross margin and assessed welfare scores. However, to meet the labour demand of the best welfare score, a reduction in flock size and in the average maximum farm gross margin was often required. These findings supported the hypothesis that trade-offs between animal welfare and farm profitability are necessary in providing maximum animal welfare via on-farm labour and sustainable British extensive sheep farming systems.

40|$|Beyond staple foods, {{agriculture}} needs {{a stronger}} focus on nutrient-dense foods (vegetables, fruits, legumes and animal source foods), suggesting the diversification of smallholder production, such as integrated farming systems. To understand {{the availability of}} agricultural biodiversity, working with partners that included the community members themselves, a <b>farm</b> <b>inventory</b> of cultivated and wild foods was carried out on 60 farms in four different districts in Western Kenya. In addition, surveys were undertaken in 15 local markets identifying the sources of food farmers were depending on for the different food groups. While the survey took place only during one point in time, seasonal availability of foods was also considered and surveyed through focus group discussions with farmers. Results showed that food availability is highly seasonal, especially in semi-arid regions, and foods are largely sourced from the own farm with the market playing {{an important role in}} closing food and preference gaps. Stronger communication/information for and by agriculture extension workers on nutrition and the importance of dietary diversity is needed.

40|$|In Sri Lanka the {{agricultural}} structure of smallholder production has changed with {{population growth and}} land reforms. In former days a farm family could life from the production of their home garden through subsistence farming and barter economy. Additional income was achieved by selling surplus products like spices on the local markets. Today living standards and life style have changed and monetary needs for housing, schooling, electricity, telephone, household goods and transport facilities are much higher. Many smallholders are involved in single cash crop cultivation and outside employment for income generation. Lack of available arable land and infrastructure are main reasons for the limited economical success of many smallholders in Sri Lanka. This study investigated whether the formation of farmer groups under patronage of an organisation and private company next to adoption of organic agriculture practices can be recommended as an economical viable and ecological sound alternative. Hence a survey was conducted in Kandy District of Sri Lanka, as well as field and laboratory experiments carried out in co-operation with the Tea Research Institute, Talawakele and the Post Graduate Institute of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya.

40|$|For American {{aquaculture}} to prosper, farmers need {{access to}} technologies that can lower {{the costs of}} raising fish to marketable size. Water, energy and feed costs are all examples of expenses that today significantly constrain where and which species are reared. The viability of a business like Kent SeaTech, a large hybrid striped sea bass farm east of San Diego, is greatly enhanced by its ability to use geothermally heated water to grow its fish. As with many species, sea bass grow faster in warmer water. Even with this boon, however, the farm must constantly optimize how fish are distributed among its 97 tanks to maximize feed-conversion rates, minimize losses from disease, and maintain {{a steady supply of}} harvestable fish.

40|$|During {{the years}} 1982 - 1987 the Dept. of Agricultural Engineering at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences {{has run a}} project about farm {{machinery}} costs. The project consisted of four subprojects. 1. Pilot-study of maintenance costs for farm machinery (1982 - 1983) 2. Detailed and continuous survey of maintenance costs (1984 - 1986) 3. Depreciation of common farm machinery (1986) 4. Simulation of reliability costs caused by breakdowns (1986 - 1987) The pilot-study (Larsson, 1983) and the depreciation study (Erikson, 1986) is completed and published. The simulation model is preliminary accounted for. This work is the account for subproject 2 above. Extent The survey includes 218 farms located all over Sweden. These farms represents 0. 6 % of the acreage of arable land and 0. 8 % of the machinery capital in Sweden (1985). During 1984 - 1986 data from 11 509 machine-years were collected. The survey included all field machinery on the farms. Inhouse machinery was not within {{the aim of the}} work. The survey was restricted to farms bigger than 20 hectare. The mean acreage was 75. 1 hectars. Method At the start of the project a thorough inventory of each farm was done. Information about acreage, crops, workshop equipment, main produce, machine handling etc was registered. In addition to the <b>farm</b> <b>inventory</b> an identity for each field machine was created. Type of machine, make, age, size and equipment was noted. At the end of the years 1984 - 1986 the participating farmers reported the following for each machine: * The years usage (hectars, hours or tons) * Costs of spare parts (SEK) * Costs for hired help with maintenance work (SEK) * The farmers own maintenance work (hours) * Costs for breakdown insurance (mostly tractors and combines, SEK) All data was stored and processed with the help of computers. Results All results has been derived with computer aid. This is due to the vast material. Computer languages used is SAS (Statistical Analysis System) and MIMER database system. The results is divided into two groups. The first one contains results specific for each type of machinery. The second group contains trends and trend descriptions of the whole material from different viewpoints. Machine specific results For each group of machines three different graphs is presented. Examples of machine groups is combine, harrow, 2 WD and 4 WD tractors. The first graph shows the maintenance cost as a function of machine age. The graph is an expression of a mathematical function derived on basis of collected data. The assumption is that the maintenance cost is a negative exponential function depending on machine type, machine age and machine replacement value. The replacement value is a description of the machine size and equipment standard. Furthermore, by multiplying the value of the cost equation with the replacement value, effects of inflation are surpressed. The second graph shows mean values of the maintenance cost for different age groups. Compared to the first graph, which is a smooth regression line, this one shows the range of the values in the material. The third graph shows the components of the maintenance cost. Examples of components is cost of workshop and billed costs. Graph no 1 and 3 is for calculations. Graph no 1 gives the total maintenance cost for the machine. With the help of graph no 3 the cost can be divided to different subcosts. Graph no 2 is only for information, not for calculation. Machine specific results is also presented in tables. These tables contains mean values of age, yearly use, maintenance costs (3 different kinds) and the mathematical expressions of graph no 1. Results based on the complete material The following results is based on the complete material as a unity, wagons excepted. The results hints the state of the Swedish farms as a group. The mean age of the machinery has during the years 1984 to 1986 increased from 9. 0 to 9. 9 years. This mean age exceeds the agricultural engineering consultants recommendations with 50 %. The maintenance cost has increased with 15 % during the same time. The figure is compensated for inflation. This is expected when the mean age increases. The maintenance cost for the northern part of Sweden exceeds {{the rest of the country}} with approximately 17 %. Part of the difference can be explained with different type of main produce. Another explanation is the great distances in these parts of Sweden. There is no geographical difference in machine age. Small farms tend to have higher maintenance costs then bigger ones. This is probably due to less effective use of labour and machinery. Big farms have a higher yearly use than small ones. Still, the mean age differs only for farms > 100 hectars. These farms have a slightly less mean age than the rest. A conclusion of the results presented above is that the Swedish farm machinery is aging with increased maintenance costs as a result. The most probable explanation is the very tough economical climate for agricultural production. The farmers halt their investment plans to cut costs. Implementation of new technology that economizes production resources and diminish the stress of the environment will thereby be delayed...|$|E

In 2007, total fish production was estimated to be 4, 245 mt valued at US 6. 6 million but has since grown exponentially. In Western Kenya, initiatives by cluster fish farmers have realized significant increases in the production of catfish fingerlings (Clarias gariepinus) for bait to Lake Victoria long-line fisheries. Some cluster farmers have diversified into fish feed production, extension services on pond construction and training other farmer on artificial propagation of the African catfish at a fee. The biggest challenge to many of these fish farmers is the lack of a marketing information system for farmed fish and fish products. Fortunately, Kenya is now widely covered by mobile phone networks, which offers a potential to map markets and demand with supply.

Cattle waste was characterised and energy {{consumption in the}} <b>farms</b> was <b>inventoried.</b> Methane emissions due to slurry/manure management and fuel consumption on the farms were calculated. The possibility of applying anaerobic digestion to the slurry to minimise emissions and of using the biogas produced to replace fossil fuels on the farm was considered. Methane emissions due to slurry management (storage and use as fertiliser) ranged from 34 to 66 kg CH 4 cow? 1 year? 1 for dairy cows and from 13 to 25 kg CH 4 cow? 1 year? 1 for suckler calves. Cattle on these farms are housed {{for most of the}} year, and the contribution from emissions from manure dropped in pastures is insignificant due to the very low methane conversion factors. If anaerobic digestion were implemented on the farms, the potential GHG emissions savings per livestock unit would range from 978 to 1776 kg CO 2 eq year? 1, with the main savings due to avoided methane emissions during slurry management. The methane produced would be sufficient to supply digester heating needs (35 – 55 % of the total methane produced) and on-farm fuel energy requirements. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the non-standardization of manual Navy fuel <b>farm</b> recordskeeping <b>inventory</b> procedures.

The errors in calculations lead to inventory inaccuracies which increase {{the possibility of}} the following: running out of fuel, spills due to overfilling or not being able to detect fuel loss due to leakage in a timely manner. A computerized spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel(TM) has been developed that will incorporate the formulas and tables used in these calculations in order to eliminate errors. A Users Guide was developed to familiarize the user with the versatility of Microsoft Excel(TM) to keep track of fuel inventories. This guide provides step- by-step instructions on how to construct the databases and models as discussed in the thesis. In summary, this thesis provides a quick accurate fuel inventory system. This system warrants the possibility of standardization throughout the Navy without an increase in government spending. Also, this system is simple, user-friendly and saves time. By reducing man-hours and labor, it also saves the government money. Information can be downloaded and e-mailed to higher commands as needed for strategic planning and allocation usage. NAU. S.

40|$|Six {{agricultural}} landscapes in Poland (PL), the Netherlands (NL), France (FR), Italy (IT), Scotland (UK) and Denmark (DK) were studied, and {{a common}} method was developed for undertaking <b>farm</b> <b>inventories</b> and the derivation of farm nitrogen (N) balances and N surplus from the in total 222 farms and 11 440 ha of farmland. In all landscapes, a large variation in the farm N surplus was found, and thereby a large potential for reductions. The highest average N surpluses {{were found in the}} most livestock-intensive landscapes of IT, FR, and NL; on average 202 ± 28, 179 ± 63 and 178 ± 20 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively. However, all landscapes showed hotspots, especially from livestock farms, including a special UK case with landless large-scale poultry farming. So, whereas the average N surplus from the land-based UK farms dominated by extensive sheep grazing was only 31 ± 10 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, the landscape average was similar to those of PL and DK (122 ± 20 and 146 ± 55 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively) when landless poultry were included. However, the challenge remains how to account for indirect N surpluses and emissions from such farms with a large export of manure out of the landscape. We conclude that farm N balances are a useful indicator for N losses and the potential for improving N management. Significant correlations to N surplus were found, both with ammonia air concentrations and nitrate levels in soils and groundwater, measured during the landscape data collection campaign from 2007 – 2009. This indicates that farm N surpluses may be used as an independent dataset for validation of measured and modelled N emissions in agricultural landscapes. However, no significant correlation was found to N measured in surface waters, probably because of the short time horizon of the study. A case study of the development in N surplus from the landscape in DK from 1998 – 2008 showed a 22 % reduction, related to statistically significant effects (p < 0. 01) of measures targeted at reducing N emissions from livestock farms. Based on the large differences between the average and the most modern and N-efficient farms, it was concluded that N-surplus reductions of 25 – 50 % as compared to the present level were realistic in all landscapes. The implemented N-surplus method was thus effective at comparing and synthesizing results on farm N emissions and the potentials of mitigation options, and is recommended for use in combination with other methods for the assessment of landscape N emissions and farm N efficiency, including more detailed N sink and N source hotspot mapping, measurements and modelling...|$|R

5000|$|The name [...] "Walworth" [...] means Welsh settlement, and {{it used to}} {{be known}} as Waleberge after the Saxons claimed it. It is thought that Walworth was planned as a village with the {{previous}} castle around 1150 by the Hansard family as part of their 1100 acre estate. There is a legend that Malcolm III of Scotland destroyed the village on his way along the River Tees. Following the Black Death there was a change of ownership of the manor to the Neville family by 1367, but in 1391 Robert Hansard claimed it back. The Ayscough family acquired the manor by marriage in 1539, then Thomas Jenison bought it in 1579 when the Ayscough family had no heirs. At the death of Elizabeth Jenison in 1605, the <b>farm</b> stock <b>inventory</b> included 50 oxen besides cattle, sheep, pigs, horses and corn. In 1759 the estate left the hands of the Jenisons due to the death and debts of Ralph Jenison. From 1759 to 1831 the estate belonged to Matthew Stephenson, and then it was sold to the Aylmer family who owned it until 1931. Their descendants Neville and Charles Eade owned it from 1931 to 1950, and then it was sold in 1950 to Durham County Council. The estate was broken up and sold into private ownership in 1981, and present ownership of the village is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gas {{emissions}} from enteric fermentation {{of the domestic}} livestock contribute to greenhouse gas <b>inventories.</b> <b>Farming</b> activities in Bolivia have nearly doubled methane emissions during the past decade. Methane was {{the second most important}} greenhouse gas emitted from human activities in Bolivia according the 1990 – 2000 GHG inventory. Emissions of methane from enteric fermentation of three regions of Bolivia, highland, valley and lowland, were studied. Atmospheric methane concentrations have increased by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 3 in response to this increase and continue to rise. The projection of fermentation enteric gas emissions depends on the increase of the livestock, which was assumed for this study to be linear for 2001 – 2015 with an increment of 2. 27 %. In this overview, we examine past trends in the emission of methane due to the enteric fermentation and the sources and sinks that determine its growth rate...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{management}} of nitrogen (N) in agriculture {{is necessary to}} achieve a sustainable balance between the production of food and other biomass, and the unwanted effects of N on water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity deterioration and human health. To analyse farm N-losses and the complex interactions within farming systems, efficient methods for identifying emissions hotspots and evaluating mitigation measures are therefore needed. The present paper aims to fill this gap at the farm and landscape scales. Six agricultural landscapes in Poland (PL), the Netherlands (NL), France (FR), Italy (IT), Scotland (UK) and Denmark (DK) were studied, and a common method was developed for undertaking <b>farm</b> <b>inventories</b> and the derivation of farm N balances, N surpluses and for evaluating uncertainty for the 222 farms and 11 440 ha of farmland included in the study. In all landscapes, a large variation in the farm N surplus was found, and thereby a large potential for reductions. The highest average N surpluses {{were found in the}} most livestock-intensive landscapes of IT, FR, and NL; on average 202 ± 28, 179 ± 63 and 178 ± 20 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 , respectively. All landscapes showed hotspots, especially from livestock farms, including a special UK case with large-scale landless poultry farming. Overall, the average N surplus from the land-based UK farms dominated by extensive sheep and cattle grazing was only 31 ± 10 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 , but was similar to the N surplus of PL and DK (122 ± 20 and 146 ± 55 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 , respectively) when landless poultry farming was included. We found farm N balances to be a useful indicator for N losses and the potential for improving N management. Significant correlations to N surplus were found, both with ammonia air concentrations and nitrate concentrations in soils and groundwater, measured during the period of N management data collection in the landscapes from 2007 – 2009. This indicates that farm N surpluses may be used as an independent dataset for validation of measured and modelled N emissions in agricultural landscapes. No significant correlation was found with N measured in surface waters, probably because of spatial and temporal variations in groundwater buffering and biogeochemical reactions affecting N flows from farm to surface waters. A case study of the development in N surplus from the landscape in DK from 1998 – 2008 showed a 22 % reduction related to measures targeted at N emissions from livestock farms. Based on the large differences in N surplus between average N management farms and the most modern and N-efficient farms, it was concluded that additional N-surplus reductions of 25 – 50 %, as compared to the present level, were realistic in all landscapes. The implemented N-surplus method was thus effective for comparing and synthesizing results on farm N emissions and the potentials of mitigation options. It is recommended for use in combination with other methods for the assessment of landscape N emissions and farm N efficiency, including more detailed N source and N sink hotspot mapping, measurements and modelling...|$|R
40|$|Plants are {{of great}} {{importance}} in the environment. They help in conserving soil fertility, prevention of erosion, recycling of oxygen and water. They also provide shade, seeds, fruits, timber, vegetables and medicines for man and his livestock. The Redemption Camp falls within the moist equatorial/tropical rainforest belt of Nigeria known for its rich reserve of economic and medicinal plants. This forest has been over exploited and {{the rate at which}} the vegetation around the Camp is being destroyed is alarming. Going by the UN declaration of 2010 as the year of biodiversity, there arose an urgent need to document the available plant species in the Redemption City, noting their different uses and promoting ample action towards their conservation through awareness programmes, housing in herbarium and cultivation of a medicinal plant <b>farm.</b> An <b>inventory</b> of the vegetation around the Camp was undertaken between March and November 2010. A total of 472 plants species belonging to one hundred and thirteen (113) families majority of which have previously been documented as medicinal plants were recorded. Herbs, trees and shrubs dominated the flora. The records of herbs and grasses could have possibly arisen as pioneer species of formerly forested areas cleared for housing and other development projects. The most diverse families were Poaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Leguminosae, Moraceae and Cyperaceae, while the commonest trees were Ficus capensis, F. polita, F. exasperata, Elaeis guineensis, Morinda lucida, Albizia lebbeck, Anthocleista vogelii, Maragaritaria discoides, Bridelia micrantha, Carica papaya, Spondias mombin, Blighia sapida, Antiaris africana, Alstonia boonei, Sterculia trigacantha, Rauvolfia vomitora, Ceiba pentandra, Albizia zygia, Newbouldia laevis, Anthocleista djalonensis and Bombax bounopozense. The numerous climbers characteristic of the tropical rainforest indicated the presence of forests in the recent past. This listing of the medicinal plants will pave way for other researchers as th search for new drugs continues...|$|R
40|$|Measuring the {{emissions}} {{of thousands of}} animal houses is needed to obtain representative emission factors and relevant categories of animal <b>farms</b> for emission <b>inventories.</b> This scale is also necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of all facotrs that influence ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions at the farm scale. A robust and low-cost method was developed in France to measure emissions from poultry, bovine and swine houses. A database and associated software is presented here that helps to apply this method to {{a large number of}} houses, while protecting the data when the database is used by different companies or institutions. It is based on freeware: an Ubuntu system, OpenOffice for testing equations, PostgreSQL and PgAdmin for database management with “user-only” or “project-only” restricted access to data, and C++ with CodeBlocks and wxWidgets for the calculation and interface modules developed. As for typical Ubuntu software, all messages in the interfaces developed can be translated into several languages using PoEdit. All systems, software and data can be stored on a bootable USB flash drive or SD card with at least two partitions, one for the system (FAT 32) compressed into a squashfs file, and one for the modified files (EXT 2). The data are divided into three categories: national references (e. g. manure composition), farm references (e. g. specific house characteristics), and observations (e. g. gas concentrations). Training is recommended to begin using the software more quickly. Further development is required to adapt this tool to monitor the results of mitigation strategies and improve their efficiency...|$|R
