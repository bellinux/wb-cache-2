Specifically, the authors test 16 hypotheses that examine the relationships among <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> management control, <b>export</b> territory, psychic distance, <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> performance, and <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> organization effectiveness. Using a mail-survey approach, {{data were collected from}} U. K. -based <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> managers in 146 direct exporters of industrial products. Though certain anomalies are observed, the research findings support many of the hypothesized associations, confirming the robustness of existing {{sales management}} concepts and theories in an export-marketing context...|$|R

40|$|The authors use punctuated {{equilibrium}} theory {{as a framework}} to help explain potential differences in the <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> management arrangements between firms that adopt an export market expansion strategy of either market concentration or market spreading. On {{the basis of a}} thorough review of the extant literature, the authors identify certain <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> managers' characteristics and behavior, <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> behavioral control, and satisfaction with <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> territory design as potential discriminators between these two groups of direct exporting firms. Consistent with the hypotheses, in general, the authors find that the tenets of {{punctuated equilibrium}} theory hold for the sample of small and medium-sized U. K. exporters. In addition, the results indicate that export market expansion strategy has important implications for a firm's <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> management arrangements.

The method {{used in the study}} was qualitative method, that is, the research method the data source of which constitutes the statement or sentences only. One way used to evaluate this <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system was by comparing the existing system with the theoretical foundation of system used, so that we can find out the strength and weakness of system applied in the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system by PT.

Items evaluated include the related functions, used documents, used accounting records, and procedure links creating the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system as well as the internal control system applied in the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system of PT.

From the result of evaluation on <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system, it can be found out that: the company has separated the functions well, has a good authorization system and recording procedure and had used the printed sequence number-document as well as had applied the healthy practices. Nevertheless, there is still a little weakness in the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system applied, that is, there is still dualistic function and the company had not used yet the accounting recording constituting the warehouse card and inventory card.

40|$|The spatial {{availability}} of information as a determinant of consumer choice and <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> is analyzed along with other spatial-economic determinants of export competition. A spatial interaction framework is applied to two alternative specifications; a pair-wise model of information dominance and a spatially dispersed information model for consumers located in different market areas. Model estimates {{of the role of}} spatial {{availability of}} information, market power, distance, and populati on demand thresholds on <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> are based on national data from The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. The regional application is for Medicare health exports from the Seattle hospital market to markets throughout the state of Washington. Information availability increases <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> of hospital Medicare services with the strongest impact occurring for the pair-wise model of information dominance. The spatially dispersed information model shows a smaller and less significant impact of information availa bility on <b>export</b> <b>sales.</b> Distance between Seattle and export markets has a strong, negative effect on <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> and on intra-regional patient mobility.

40|$|Despite {{the plethora}} of studies {{examining}} the influence of behavior-based sales management control on salesperson characteristics and performance, limited empirical evidence exists with respect to its relevance and importance in an <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> context. This study expands the existing literature by investigating the influence of behavior-based control and job-related characteristics {{on the performance of}} <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> managers. The article offers a conceptual model and an empirical test using data from 210 UK exporters. The findings support the positive influence of behavior-based control on certain <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> managers' characteristics and behavioral performance. The results also indicate that: specific <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> managers' characteristics enhance behavioral performance; behavioral performance is positively related to outcome performance; psychic distance moderates the relationship between behavior-based control and behavioral performance. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for export executives and suggestions for future research in the field. Sales management control Job-related characteristics Exporting...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a model that}} explains <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> volume by destination based on a company's export marketing strategy. A seemingly unrelated regression model (SURE) simultaneously estimates the explanatory value of the different elements of the marketing strategy, as well as company characteristics, such as experience, size and motivation to export, on entry decisions to six different regional markets made by exporting companies in a southern European country. The {{data were collected from}} a sample size of 2, 264 exporting companies. Findings confirm the importance of exporting experience and proactiveness in determining high <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> volumes in every regional market except for those psychologically close. Nevertheless, different marketing strategies depending on the region lead to high <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> volumes. For example, low price strategies in the case of Latin America or differentiation strategies based on the augmented product {{in the case of the}} USA generate high <b>export</b> <b>sales.</b> Promotional expenditures are of higher importance for distant markets, but for closer markets channel development is the key.

As certification is not randomly assigned but there is 'self-selection into treatment', we use propensity matching methods to estimate the causal effect of certification on the change in the firms' value of <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> between 2000 and 2004. The results show that export performance is positively correlated with ISO 9000 certification. standards, trade, Pakistan, developing countries, exports,...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to elaborate}} existing literature by investigating {{the impact of}} the organizational factors that affect the <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> effectiveness within sales force control systems; behaviour- and outcome-based sales control, reward and compensation schemes for salespeople, territory design satisfaction, firm size, <b>export</b> orientation of <b>sales</b> strategy and sales management experience in exports. A theoretical framework is proposed and tested on a sample of 160 Greek exporting SMEs. Research results provide supportive evidence of the positive contribution of (1) behaviour-based sales control; (2) outcome-based sales control; (3) reward and compensation schemes for salespeople; (4) territory design satisfaction, and (5) firm size in export performance. On the contrary, <b>export</b> orientation of <b>sales</b> strategy was found to have no significant correlation with export effectiveness. It appears that high-performing <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> units seem to make higher use of outcome-based sales control attributes compared to low performing ones. A positive association between reward and compensation schemes and (1) behaviour-based and (2) outcome-based sales control for high performing <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> units is identified. The effect of reward and compensation schemes for salespeople on <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> effectiveness is significantly higher when the intensity of export performance is lower. The influence of sales territory design satisfaction with <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> effectiveness is significantly higher when the intensity of export performance is lower. The findings suggest a significant positive relationship between sales territory design satisfaction and outcome-based control. They also indicate that the effect of firm size is stronger when the intensity of export performance is higher. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation between firm size and (1) behaviour-based, and (2) outcomebased sales control seems to appear...|$|R
