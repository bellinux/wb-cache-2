50|$|By the 1950s, {{interferometry}} {{had become}} the method of choice for precise measurements of length, but there remained a practical problem imposed by the system of units used. The natural unit for expressing a length measured by interferometry was the ångström, but this result then had to be converted into metres using an experimental conversion factor - the wavelength of light used, but measured in metres rather than in ångströms. This added an additional measurement uncertainty to any length result in metres, {{over and above the}} uncertainty of the actual <b>interferometric</b> <b>measurement.</b> The solution was to define the metre {{in the same manner as}} the ångström had been defined in 1907, that is in terms of the best interferometric wavelength available.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{introduction}} to a workshop on superluminal radio sources, Pearson and Zensus reported"The first indications {{of changes in the}} structure of some sources were obtained by an American-Australian team in a series of transpacific VLBI observations between 1968 and 1970 (Gubbay et al. 1969). Following the early experiments, they had realised the potential of the NASA tracking antennas for VLBI measurements and set up an interferometer operating between California and Australia. The change in the source visibility that they measured for 3C 279, combined with changes in total flux density, indicated that a component first seen in 1969 had reached a diameter of about 1 milliarcsecond, implying expansion at an apparent velocity of at least twice the speed of light. Aware of Rees's model, (Moffet et al. 1972) concluded that their measurement presented evidence for relativistic expansion of this component. This interpretation, although by no means unique, was later confirmed, and in hindsight it seems fair to say that their experiment was the first <b>interferometric</b> <b>measurement</b> of superluminal expansion." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{phase is}} very {{important}} for SAR interferometry, and similar to satellite survey, GBSAR has three contributions to phase measurement including (1) phase derived by the distance between targets and radar; (2) phase due to atmospheric effects; and (3) phase caused by noise. The latter two phases should be removed in the data processing, but atmospheric phase reduction is more critical than noise phase reduction in terms of their contributions to the observed phase.

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{microwave}} remote-sensing {{of the ocean}} surface for current detection is well established. However, the advent of along-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar has provided a new, potentially powerful technique for current mapping. Although <b>interferometric</b> velocity <b>measurements</b> {{can be used to}} derive surface currents, the relationship between these two quantities is not always clearly defined. In response, this thesis presents comparisons between interferometric data collected by an X-band phased-array radar and in situ data, thereby demonstrating the relationship of <b>interferometric</b> velocity <b>measurements</b> to surface and subsurface currents. To develop a precise method of estimating the surface current from the <b>interferometric</b> <b>measurements,</b> the wave-orbital velocities and Bragg phase-speed are characterized. ^ This analysis is extended to compare surface and subsurface water currents. Case studies are presented under varying environmental conditions for which the vertical current structure alters considerably. In these examples, analysis of the radar imagery yields both interferometric surface currents and subsurface current estimates derived from long-wave dispersion characteristics. A vertical profile of current in the water column is generated from the radar-derived velocities combined with coincident Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler measurements, revealing the sensitivity of X-band <b>interferometric</b> <b>measurements</b> to wind-drift and the near-surface current structure. ...|$|R
