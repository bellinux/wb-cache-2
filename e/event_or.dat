5|$|Adam used several leitmotifs in the ballet. This {{is a short}} musical {{phrase that}} is {{associated}} with a certain character, <b>event,</b> <b>or</b> idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Petero Okotai participated on the Cook Islands' behalf in the men's 100meters breaststroke. He was {{the only}} Cook Islander {{participating}} in the <b>event,</b> <b>or</b> in any swimming event in general in Beijing. Okotai was 27 {{years old at the}} time of his participation at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and had not previously participated in any Olympic games. During the preliminary rounds, which took place on 9 August, the Cook Islander participated in the first heat, which included three people. Of those three, Okotai ranked third after finishing the event in 1:20.20. Oman's Mohammed Al-Habsi ranked ahead of Okotai (1:12.28), while Qatar's Osama Mohammed Ye Alarag took first in the heat (1:10.83). Of the 63 athletes who finished the qualification heats, Okotai ranked last. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Some of Chopin's {{well-known}} pieces {{have acquired}} descriptive titles, {{such as the}} Revolutionary Étude (Op.10,No.12), and the Minute Waltz (Op.64,No.1). However, {{with the exception of}} his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific <b>event</b> <b>or</b> death is known to have inspired it.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} section of Eusebius' Historia on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's {{visit to a}} church on Easter Eve when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until he confessed his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the Chronicon Paschale which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor. Given the parallels between the accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to the same <b>event</b> (<b>or</b> legend).|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} {{at the tail end}} of the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused by the collapse of a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption <b>event</b> <b>or</b> a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} events {{are divided into}} three broad categories: track events, field events, and {{combined}} events. The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one <b>event</b> (<b>or</b> event type) {{with the aim of}} perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may be placed on the track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team member {{at the end of a}} certain distance.|$|E

During the August 17 preliminary round, Dixon {{participated in the}} second heat alongside seven other hurdlers. Dixon finished the race in 12.69seconds, placing first ahead of Canada's Priscilla Lopes-Schliep (12.75seconds) and the United States' Damu Cherry (12.92seconds). Of the 39 athletes who finished the preliminary round, Dixon tied Jamaica's Bridgitte Foster-Hylton for third place. She advanced to the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Aerosmith {{commenced}} {{recording a}} new album on Armed Forces Day 2006. Tyler and Perry performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra for their annual concert of July 4 on the Esplanade in 2006, a milestone {{as it was the}} first major <b>event</b> <b>or</b> performance since Steven Tyler's throat surgery. Around this time, the band also announced that they would embark on the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in late 2006. On August 24, 2006 it was announced that Tom Hamilton was undergoing treatment for throat cancer. In order to make a full recovery, he sat out much of the Route of All Evil Tour until he was well again. Former Joe Perry Project bassist David Hull substituted for Hamilton until his return. On September 5, 2006, Aerosmith kicked off the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in Columbus, Ohio. The co-headlining tour took both bands to amphitheaters across North America through November 24. After that, a select few arena dates were added, some of which were with Mötley Crüe. The tour ended December 17.|$|E
5|$|The Yamato {{tradition}} is the oldest, originating {{as early as}} the 4th century with the introduction of ironworking techniques from the mainland. According to legend, the smith Amakuni forged the first single-edged long swords with curvature (tachi) around 700. Even though there is no authentication of this <b>event</b> <b>or</b> date, the earliest Japanese swords were probably forged in Yamato Province. During the Nara period, many good smiths were located around the capital in Nara. They moved to Kyoto when it became capital {{at the beginning of the}} Heian period, but about 1200 smiths gathered again in Nara when the various sects centered in Nara rose to power during the Kamakura period and needed weapons to arm their monks. Thus, the Yamato {{tradition is}} associated closely with the warrior monks of Nara. Yamato tradition sugata is characterized by a deep torii-zori, high shinogi, and slightly extended kissaki. The jihada is mostly masame-hada, and the hamon is suguha, with rough nie. The bōshi is mainly ko-maru. Generally the style of Yamato blades is considered to be restrained, conservative and static. Five major schools or branches of the Yamato tradition are distinguished: Senjuin, Shikkake, Taima, Tegai and Hōshō. Four of the five schools are represented by national treasure swords.|$|E
