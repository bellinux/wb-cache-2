The instrument known today as the flugelhorn is a descendant of the valved bugle, which had been developed from a valveless hunting horn known in eighteenth-century Germany as a Flügelhorn. [...] The valved bugle provided Adolphe Sax (creator of the saxophone family) with the inspiration for his B soprano (contralto) saxhorns, on which the modern-day flugelhorn is modeled.|$|E

5|$|Italian opera became {{immensely popular}} in the 19th century and was known across even the most rural {{sections}} of the country. Most villages had occasional opera productions, and the techniques used in opera influenced rural folk musics. Opera spread through itinerant ensembles and brass bands, focused in a local village. These civic bands (banda communale) used instruments to perform operatic arias, with trombones or <b>fluegelhorns</b> for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.|$|R

5000|$|Martin Committee was the {{trademark}} {{name of the}} Martin Band Instrument Company's premier lines of trumpets and saxophones starting in the mid-1930s. The firm produced band instruments, including trumpets, cornets, <b>fluegelhorns,</b> trombones, and saxophones from 1908 to the 1960s. The Martin Committee trumpets and saxophones were favorites of jazz musicians. All were produced in Elkhart, Indiana. In the postwar era the Martin Committee saxophones were branded [...] "The Martin (saxophone type)," [...] with the [...] "Committee" [...] designation eventually discontinued.|$|R

5000|$|A 1988 {{reviewer}} {{commented that}} [...] "Sandke, using both trumpet and <b>fluegelhorn,</b> is rich-toned and mellow at one moment or crisply biting at another." [...] With the Widespread Depression Orchestra, he played [...] "gloriously growling full-bodied Cootie Williams solos".|$|E

5000|$|The flugelhorn (—also spelled <b>fluegelhorn,</b> flugel horn, or Flügelhorn—from German, wing horn, or flank horn [...] ) is a brass {{instrument}} {{pitched in}} B, and resembles a trumpet, {{but has a}} wider, conical bore.

50|$|Wayland {{told the}} Santa Barbara News-Press, “as {{for my own}} musical style, you could say I am Bartokian, Hindemithian -with a {{considerable}} dose of jazz.” In the 1960s, Wayland formed a performing group called “The Great All-American Music Machine.” The group consisted of Wayland on keyboards, Frank Nizzari (alto, soprano, baritone saxophone), Ken Wenzwll (electric bass, trumpet, trombone, <b>fluegelhorn,</b> flute), John Chiodini (guitar, bass, banjo), Fred Budda (percussion), Jan Curtis (Mezzo-soprano), and David Evitts (Baritone). They performed and recorded ragtime, opera, folk, pop, jazz, classical, musical comedy and even rock music, as well as Wayland’s original compositions.|$|E
50|$|The section also {{developed}} a unique approach to ballads. Davis and Harris doubled on the <b>fluegelhorn,</b> an instrument with roughly the same range as the trumpet but with a considerably softer, warmer timbre (the flugel was a favorite texture of many jazz trumpeters, notably Clark Terry, Art Farmer and Freddie Hubbard). The softer palette created by the blend of the two fluegels with Myrick's tenor sax and Satterfield's trombone allowed the section to still play interesting countermelodies and staccato jabs (listen to the post-chorus instrumental breaks of Reasons for a prime example) without being obtrusive or overbearing.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{recorded}} between world tours with Yanni and Sheena Easton, and Joseph invited {{most of the}} Yanni band to contribute. [...] They include Charlie Adams (drums, percussion); Ric Fierabracci (fretless bass); Jeanette Clinger (vocals), and Grammy-winning violinist Charlie Bisharat. Other guest artists include Larry Preston (guitar), and Terry Brau — featured on numerous Bradley Joseph recordings — playing trumpet, saxophone, and <b>fluegelhorn.</b> [...] "It's Bisharat's virtuostic violin that immediately attracts the listener's attention in the opening of 'Rose Colored Glasses' ...an upbeat song that has driving, forward momentum", states Music Outfitters. The [...] "Gift" [...] begins as a slow, dour march with vocal expressions by Joseph and Jeanette Clinger, but the tune quickly develops into a [...] "buoyant" [...] piano solo by Joseph. [...] "Friday's Child" [...] is a [...] "dynamic blend of piano and sax".|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, the foursome joined Genesis drummer Phil Collins and {{producer}} Hugh Padgham {{in the studio}} for the recording of Collins's debut solo album, Face Value. Five of the musically diverse album's 12 tracks featured horns, with a sixth (a rendition of the Beatles's Tomorrow Never Knows) featuring electronically manipulated samples of the section. The group's (and in particular Harris's) extreme precision was {{put to good use}} in up-tempo numbers like [...] "Behind the Lines" [...] and the mostly instrumental [...] "Hand In Hand". Myrick's lyrical alto playing is featured prominently on [...] "If Leaving Me Is Easy", as are Harris's and Davis's signature <b>fluegelhorn</b> lines. The section also joined Collins's band Genesis at Fisher Lane Farm Studios, in Surrey, England, on the song [...] "No Reply at All" [...] on their album Abacab, as well as on [...] "Paperlate", a song from the band's EP 3×3 which was also included on the U.S. release of the album Three Sides Live.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there was}} no [...] "clear vision" [...] behind Pretty. Odd., the band knew that they [...] "wanted to write songs {{differently}} {{in the sense that}} not all the songs sounded the same or were part of one set genre, you know, just doing something different. With this record, we listened to a bunch of different stuff, too, so that kind of helped broaden our musical taste." [...] Thanks to the new collaborative relationship with producer Rob Mathes, the roles within the band became blurred. Although most songs on the record are attributed to Ryan Ross, the entire band collaborated on each track, with Urie writing two tracks himself and Walker and Smith adding additional lyrics to several tracks. The Washington Post reviewed the new sound of Panic positively: [...] "Everything is new, if old, from the baroque instrumentation (the use of a <b>fluegelhorn),</b> songwriting (less wordy, more obtuse) and vocal phrasing (streamlined) to the Beatlesque chord progressions, melodies, hooks and stacked vocal harmonies, which also owe a minor debt to Brian Wilson." [...] The lyrics mingle ruined romances and neo-psychedelic aphorisms.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, {{contributed to}} the debut albums by Positive Noise - Heart of Darkness, Stray Cats and In Trance as Mission by Simple Minds plus [...] "Power and the Passion" [...] by Midnight Oil and also {{performed}} saxophone on Rick Wakeman's 1984, a solo concept album based on the classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. That year he also played saxophone on the Black Snake Diamond Röle debut solo album by former Soft Boys frontman Robyn Hitchcock. But, one of Barnacle's longest associations has been with Level 42, {{with whom he has}} played on several albums, including the band's 1981 debut, the 1984 True Colours, the 1985 World Machine, and the 1987 Running in the Family. From 1990 to 1994 Barnacle toured with Level 42 and recorded two of the band's albums, Guaranteed and Forever Now. The horn section he formed with British trumpet and <b>fluegelhorn</b> player, John Thirkell, for Level 42 is known as The Hen Pecked Horns. Since then, Barnacle and Thirkell provided the horn section to many recordings, and, along with trombonist Peter Thoms, they formed The Phantom Horns, one of the UK's most respected horn sections that appears on a number of recordings from 1987 on. They also recorded a widely acclaimed brass-sample CD Phantom Horns, which was re-issued by Zero-G as a double CD-rom in 2011. Equally impressive, and more comprehensive, was Brit Horns brass-sample CD featuring Gary Barnacle, Peter Thoms and Stuart Brooks, which was re-issued as a double audio/WAV CD by AMG in 2010. Both of these sample CDs have, and continue to be, widely used on commercial recordings worldwide.|$|E
