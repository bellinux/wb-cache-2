25|$|In the woods, David, Hook and Robin {{are ready}} to confront Arthur at his tent, and they brought weapons along, just in case. Robin and Hook secure the area while David goes inside the tent. As Arthur greets David cordially, David demands to know why Arthur lied and tried to burn the Crimson Crown, and tells him about they message they {{received}} from Merlin, which detailed that only Nimue could destroy that Darkness. David demands to know who Nimue is and points his gun at Arthur. Arthur, however, decides to throw the threesome off with a table, then escapes into the wood with, the three in pursuit. After Arthur trips, he sees Hook and kicks him down and draws his sword on him, but just before he can kill Hook, Emma suddenly shows up and uses the now-reunited Excalibur stop Arthur's attack, telling a stunned Arthur that the sword no longer controls anyone, before sending him flying into a tree. Hook thanks Emma, but Emma says that there's no need to. Hook apologizes for what he said on his ship, and when Emma asks if he meant his saying that he didn't love her, or refusing to accept who she now was, {{he says that he}} still did and will always love her. When Emma asks Hook what he wants, he says that he wants to help her, and asks who Nimue is. She says that Nimue doesn't matter anymore, and that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> over tomorrow. Hook asks why she needs the sword. Emma walks away and Hook says he knows she has reasons for doing this, and Emma tells Hook that she does, and that she’s doing all of this for him, before disappearing.|$|E

[...] In June 2009, Moisés Naím wrote in Newsweek: [...] "The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Award-winning {{composer}} Jeremy Soule {{was signed}} to compose the game's score. [...] "It {{will be a}} Star Wars score, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> original, and probably the things that will remain will be the Force themes and things like that," [...] Gallo said. Soule was unable to write a full orchestral score for Knights of the Old Republic due to technical limitations: [...] "At the time we only had an 8 megabit per second MIDI system. That was state of the art... I had to fool people into thinking they were hearing a full orchestra. I’d write woodwinds and drums, or woodwinds, horns and drums, or strings and drums and brass. I couldn’t run the whole orchestra at once, it was impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Norway's Dagbladet {{reported}} that Doncaster Belles favoured a typically English style: [...] "heavy, solid and with many long balls." [...] Although the Belles were a completely amateur outfit, the BBC {{reported that}} they would present {{a much more difficult}} challenge than Fulham had been accustomed to that season. In the 2001–02 National Division Doncaster Belles had finished as runners-up for the third season in succession. In the Premier League Cup they suffered a shock semi final defeat by Birmingham City, collapsing from 31 ahead to lose 43 to the Northern Division leaders. In April 2002 they had [...] "stunningly" [...] inflicted a 40 defeat on Arsenal, the eventual champions' first league defeat in over two and a half years. Manager Julie Chipchase accepted that Fulham were favourites but noted the strength of her own squad: [...] "It's an unusual situation for us to go into a match as the underdogs and I am hoping it will work in our favour. The pressure will be on Fulham but they have some excellent international class players just as we do and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> down to who performs on the day." ...|$|E
