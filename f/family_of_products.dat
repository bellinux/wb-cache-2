Takeda described the Nvidia chipset critical to bring similar performance for games as they have on personal computers, helping to achieve [...] "high performance but low power consumption" [...] for the Switch. Prerelease reports, unconfirmed by either Nintendo or Nvidia, stated that the SoC would be an Nvidia Tegra X1 SoC [...] with 4 ARM Cortex-A57 CPU cores and 4 ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores along with 256 Maxwell based CUDA GPU cores. This was later corroborated by an analysis on the console done by Tech Insights in March 2017. The CPU cores are clocked at 1.020GHz, as revealed by DigitalFoundry. The GPU cores vary between 768MHz and 307.2MHz depending upon whether the device is docked; however, they can be boosted to 921MHz and 384MHz, [...] respectively.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of companies design a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> variants simultaneously in order to introduce adequate product variety in the competitive market in a cost-effective way while shortening <b>product</b> lead-times, instead <b>of</b> designing one <b>product</b> at a time. The key to using this approach successfully is to achieve the right trade-off between product family commonality and performance <b>of</b> individual <b>product</b> variants. This paper considers multi-level commonality in product family design {{in the sense that}} the feature or component can be common only among some product variants. This differs from the two extremes of being totally common throughout the family or being completely different from one product variant to another. A product family design model is proposed as a multi-objective optimisation. A commonality index is introduced to evaluate the family commonality in the presence of multiple levels. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is developed for simultaneous design <b>of</b> a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> variants. Optimal decisions include which design variables should be common among which product variants. Computational experiments are conducted using the design <b>of</b> a <b>family</b> <b>of</b> welded beams to demonstrate the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>family</b> design method proposed in this paper. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
