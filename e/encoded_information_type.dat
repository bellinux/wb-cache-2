The {{aim of this}} project is text-based knowledge harvesting for support to information extraction and text mining in the biomedical domain. The BioLexicon is a large-scale lexical-terminological resource <b>encoding</b> different <b>information</b> <b>types</b> in one single integrated resource. In {{the design of the}} resource we follow the ISO/DIS 24613 ?Lexical Mark-up Framework? standard, which ensures reusability of the <b>information</b> <b>encoded</b> and easy exchange of both data and architecture. The design of the resource also takes into account the needs of our text mining partners who automatically extract syntactic and semantic information from texts and feed it to the lexicon. The present contribution first describes in detail the model of the BioLexicon along its three main layers: morphology, syntax and semantics; then, it briefly {{describes the}} database implementation of the model and the population strategy followed within the project, together with an example.

I claim that evidential agreement paradigms encode the same restricted set of syntax-discourse relations as standard nominal agreement, but the argument specified by evidential agreement is a “world argument” rather than a nominal argument. The presence of a world argument in syntax will be supported by showing that worlds have syntactic properties parallel to those of entities (pronouns) and times (tenses) ...|$|R

It {{is the basis for}} a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine to quantum information. Currently, experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms are revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics. Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap. Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory.

40|$|International audienceAccording to {{most current}} theories, {{one of the}} main {{differences}} between human speech and animal vocal communication concerns syntax. In searching for the origins of syntactic communication, we analysed the loud call behaviour of free-ranging Campbell's monkey males. Using two years of naturalistic observations and predator-simulation experiments, we were able to distinguish six basic alarm call types. Acoustic variation to discriminate between the different calls was achieved by frequency modulation (Boom, Krak, Hok) and affixation, i. e., the facultative addition of an acoustic suffix (Krak-oo, Hok-oo, Wak-oo). Moreover, when responding to a disturbance, males rarely produce signle calls, but usually generated sequences of 2 to 40 calls. From the analysis of 250 calling events, we identified six contextually-determined calling sequences, which varied in terms of call type composition, order of succession, and rhythm of delivery. These levels of organization appear to <b>encode</b> <b>information</b> about the <b>type</b> and urgency of the danger, as well as the caller's associated behaviour. Preliminary playback experiments confirmed that affixation and call combination were discriminated by females. Our findings suggest that early precursors of syntactic communication may already have been present in the common ancestor of modern non-human primates and humans...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the firing}} pattern of {{midbrain}} dopamine neurons {{are thought to}} <b>encode</b> <b>information</b> for certain <b>types</b> of reward-related learning. In particular, the burst pattern of firing is predicted to result in more efficient dopamine release at target loci, which could underlie changes in synaptic plasticity. In this study, the effects of dopamine on the firing patterns of dopaminergic neurons in vivo and their electrophysiological characteristics in vitro were examined by using a genetic dopamine-deficient (DD) mouse model. Extracellular recordings in vivo showed that, although the firing pattern of dopamine neurons in normal mice included bursting activity, DD mice recordings showed only a single-spike pattern of activity with no bursts. Bursting was restored in DD mice after systemic administration of the dopamine precursor, l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa). Whole-cell recordings in vitro demonstrated that the basic electrophysiology and pharmacology of dopamine neurons were identical between DD and control mice, except that amphetamine did not elicit a hyperpolarizing current in slices from DD mice. These data suggest that endogenously released dopamine plays {{a critical role in}} the afferent control of dopamine neuron bursting activity and that this control is exerted via a network feedback mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} closed form {{solution}} for segmenting mixtures of 2 -D translational and 2 -D affine motion models {{directly from the}} image intensities. Our approach exploits {{the fact that the}} spatial-temporal image derivatives generated by a mixture of these motion models must satisfy a bi-homogeneous polynomial called the multibody brightness constancy constraint (MBCC). We show that the degrees of the MBCC are related to the number of motions models of each kind. Such degrees can be automatically computed using a one-dimensional search. We then demonstrate that a sub-matrix of the Hessian of the MBCC <b>encodes</b> <b>information</b> about the <b>type</b> of motion models. For instance, the matrix is rank- 1 for 2 -D translational models and rank- 3 for 2 -D affine models. Once the type of motion model has been identified, one can obtain the parameters of each type of motion model at every image measurement from the cross products of the derivatives of the MBCC. We then demonstrate that accounting for a 2 -D translational motion model as a 2 -D affine one would result in erroneous estimation of the motion models, thus motivating our aim to account for different types of motion models. We apply our method to segmenting various dynamic scenes. ...|$|R

Ten deaf native signers viewed line drawings depicting a spatial relation between two ob-jects (e. g., a cup on a table) and were asked either to produce a classifier construction or an American Sign Language (ASL) preposition that described the spatial relation or to name the figure object (colored red). Compared to naming objects, describing spatial rela-tionshipswith classifier constructions engaged the su-pramarginal gyrus (SMG) within both hemispheres. Compared to naming objects, naming spatial relations with ASL prepositions engaged only the right SMG. Previous research indicates that retrieval of English prepositions engages both right and left SMG, but more inferiorly than for ASL classifier constructions. Compared to ASL prepositions, naming spatial rela-tions with classifier constructions engaged left infe-rior temporal (IT) cortex, a region activated when naming concrete objects in either ASL or English. Left IT may be engaged because the handshapes in classi-fier constructions <b>encode</b> <b>information</b> about object <b>type</b> (e. g., flat surface). Overall, the results suggest more right hemisphere involvement when expressing spatial relations in ASL, perhaps because signing space is used to encode the spatial relationship be-tween objects. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Functional {{programming}} (FP) {{is regularly}} {{touted as the}} way forward for bringing parallel, concurrent, and distributed programming to the mainstream. The popularity of the rationale behind this viewpoint (immutable data transformed by function application) has even lead {{to a number of}} object-oriented (OO) pro-gramming languages adopting functional features such as lambdas (functions) and thereby function closures. However, despite this established viewpoint of FP as an enabler, reliably distributing function closures over a network, or using them in concurrent environments nonetheless remains a challenge across FP and OO lan-guages. This paper takes a step towards more principled distributed and concurrent programming by introducing a new closure-like abstraction and type system, called spores, that can guarantee closures to be serializable, thread-safe, or even have gen-eral, custom user-defined properties. Crucially, our system is based on the principle of <b>encoding</b> <b>type</b> <b>information</b> corresponding to captured variables in the type of a spore. We prove our type system sound, implement our approach for Scala 1, eval-uate its practicality through an small empirical study, and show the power of these guarantees through a case analysis of real-world distributed and concurrent frame-works that this safe foundation for migratable closures facilitates...|$|R
