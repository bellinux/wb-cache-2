40|$|AbstractThe {{gigantic}} earthquake on March 11, 2011, caused {{significant damage}} {{in and around}} river levees over a vast area. Because the amount of damage was on such a huge scale, <b>emergency</b> <b>restoration</b> was difficult and many lessons were learnt. The cause of the damage in most cases was liquefaction either in the foundation or in the levee body, and the latter was recognized as a new technical problem. Many levees in the coastal area experienced the combined effects of the tsunami with the co-seismic subsidence of the earth's crust. Among the many examples of damage, one positive issue was that damage mitigation measures such as drainage and soil improvement {{were found to be}} effective. The present text addresses the findings and lessons learnt from the authors' emergency activities after the quake...|$|E

Low-cost {{unmanned}} aerial {{systems have}} been underutilized in mapping damage to coral reefs due to recreational boating activities.

Images were taken at relatively low altitudes from an unmanned aerial vehicle and then mosaicked together using commercially available software. The image orthomosaics were georeferenced and digitized into vector files for further analysis. The vector files can reveal patterns and concentrations of vessel related damage to coral reefs in the bay.

40|$|This paper {{takes the}} {{perspective}} that recovery from disaster {{is not merely}} concerned with the reestablishment of the physical or built environment; that is, community recovery should not be conceptualized as an outcome, {{but rather as a}} social process that begins before a disaster occurs and encompasses decision-making concerning <b>emergency</b> response, <b>restoration,</b> and reconstruction activities following the disaster. Put another way, reconstruction is less a technical problem than it is a social one. In order for successful post-disaster decisions to be made, however, there must be an awareness of the pre-disaster conditions that create situations of social and structural vulnerability, putting some segments of the society at greater risk {{in the event of an}} earthquake than others. From this perspective, what becomes important is how those decisions are made, who is involved in the decision-making, what consequences those decisions have on the social groups within the disaster-stricken communities, and who benefits from these decisions and who does not...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of an archaeological site has always evoked cultural and scientific interests. Unfortunately, {{after a period}} of study, the attention paid to good often tends to decrease, underestimating the interactions between the material and the new surrounding environment, totally different from that in which the good were placed before. This variation cause new balances that inevitably create modifications into the materials making them susceptible to decay. This aspect, together with a planned preventative maintenance, is generally neglected until an <b>emergency</b> <b>restoration</b> becomes necessary to guarantee good’s survival. The following papersets outthecase studyoftheso-called “Small Thermal Baths”, a thermal structure located in the Roman archaeological site of Nora, on the southern coast of Sardinia. In this case, the real essence of the structure is threatened by the intrinsic vulnerability of the building materials and by the action of the agents of decay. The disaggregation of stones is certainly one of the aspects that make it very difficult to preserve. Although its location is undoubtedly an added value from the historical, cultural and environmental point of view, this fact puts the materials in exposure classes particularly severe.

The study of these nations is approached from an institutional/structural perspective in which demographic, economic, political, communication, family, and religious variables are examined as they affect the warning, emergency preparedness, evacuation, inventory, victim care, security, welfare, and <b>emergency</b> <b>restoration</b> of services functions of disaster response. The general nature of the study is exploratory, and, while some attention is given to all the institutional/structural variables listed, there is particular emphasis placed on the degree of political centralization as an independent variable. In terms of the relationships between institutional/structural variables and the performance of disaster functions, the following questions were asked: How were the functions carried out? Where did the functions take place, i. e., the geographical location of the activity? Who were the individuals, groups, and organizations involved in the activities? What difficulties were encountered? The following questions about the impact of political centralization on disaster response, guided the research: At what levels of government are key decisions made? Does the level of decision making vary according to normal times versus disaster periods and/or the area, subject and content of matters being decided, and/or policy decisions versus operational decisions? Is there a different pattern of decision making in disaster response functions in a decentralized nation as contrasted to a centralized nation...|$|E
40|$|Before {{the advent}} of state {{estimation}} the power system operator had responsibility for many real-time control center functions, including scheduling generation and interchange, monitoring outages and scheduling alternatives, supervising scheduled outages, scheduling frequency and time corrections, coordinating bias settings, and <b>emergency</b> <b>restoration</b> of the system. All of this was done with operating guides produced by the planning department after running {{a large number of}} load flows. As is always the case, the actual events faced by the operator were occasionally unexpected and had not been included in the planning cases. The solution was to supply the operator with a load flow program installed in the control center. The operator could manually enter data describing the current situation and get a load flow corresponding to the real world. Unexpectedly, the operator’s load flow did not work well. The problems were caused by insufficient data, nonuniform data, and errors in the data and in the model. It was important that the operator’s load flow be accurate so that the outage relief would be accurate. It was also recognized that the planning load flow was not exactly what the operator needed. What was required in the control center was a process of using a large number of imprecise measurements to estimate the existing state of the system. Early state estimation algorithms [1] used measurements of line flows, both real and reactive power, to estimate the bus voltage angles and magnitudes. The complex bus voltages are the state of the system since given an accurate model of the network the bus voltages determine the complex power flows in the lines and all the complex power injections. Unfortunately prior to synchronized phasor measurements, the state could not be measured directly but only inferred from the unsynchronized power flow measurements. This fact and the process of getting large numbers of measurements into the control center forced the first state estimators to make compromises whic...|$|E
