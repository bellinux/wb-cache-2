2500|$|Sperm whales {{can produce}} three {{specific}} vocalisations: creaks, codas, and slow clicks. A creak is a rapid series of high-frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky <b>door</b> <b>hinge.</b> It is typically used when homing in on prey. A coda {{is a short}} pattern of 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations to identify one another (like a signature whistle), {{but it is still}} unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates. Slow clicks are heard only in the presence of males (it is not certain whether females occasionally make them). [...] Males make a lot of slow clicks in breeding grounds (74% of the time), both near the surface and at depth, which suggests they are primarily mating signals. [...] Outside breeding grounds, slow clicks are rarely heard, and usually near the surface.|$|E
2500|$|The Post Office {{commissioned}} a new design of pillar box in 1980 from {{a panel of}} three competing designers. The competition was won by Tony Gibbs and his design, which {{was thought to be}} ultra-modern at the time, was designated Type K by the Post Office. Made in traditional cast iron, it stayed in production until 2000. Notable features included: replaceable lifting ring screwed into the dome of the box, body and roof of box cast as one piece, large easy-to-read collection time plate, all surface details and collection plate window recessed to give a perfect cylindrical outline, integral restrictor plate, know colloquially as a [...] "Belfast Flap" [...] to restrict posting to letters only and a flanged shallow base suitable for installation in modern buildings, shopping centres and other urban areas. These boxes were thus much easier to move and handle as they could be rolled over level ground or lifted by crane into position. The design had one major flaw {{in the area of the}} <b>door</b> <b>hinge,</b> which is prone to snap under stress and the K type pillar boxes are no longer being installed.|$|E

50|$|The two shell valves {{are held}} {{together}} at the animal's dorsum by the ligament, which is composed of the tensilium and resilium. In life the ligament opens the shell (like a bent eraser in a <b>door</b> <b>hinge),</b> and the adductor muscle or muscles close the shell (like a person pulling the door closed by the handle). When a bivalve dies, its adductor muscle(s) relax and the resilium pushes the valves open.|$|E
