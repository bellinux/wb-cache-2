5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>old</b> as the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated {{that it was a}} predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>old</b> as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E

25|$|At {{the centre}} of all Nambassa festivals lay the village marketplaces. These {{consisted}} of dozens of hand craft outlets and health food eateries. Here the hustle and bustle, the exuberant colour and relaxed atmosphere, prevalent at the various Nambassa village marketplaces, was a feature. These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of bartering for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place of fun and entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, {{as a method of}} doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>old</b> as civilization itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ice-rafted sediments in deep-sea cores recovered from northeast Greenland, in the Fram Strait, {{and south of}} Greenland indicated the more or less continuous {{presence of}} either an ice sheet or ice sheets covering significant parts of Greenland for the last 18 million years. From about 11 million years ago to 10 million years ago, the Greenland Ice Sheet was greatly reduced in size. The Greenland Ice Sheet formed in the middle Miocene by coalescence of ice caps and glaciers. There was an intensification of glaciation during the Late Pliocene. Ice sheet formation occurred in connection to uplift of the West Greenland and East Greenland uplands. The Western and Easter Greenland mountains constitute passive continental margins that were uplifted in two phases, 10 and 5 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch. Computer modelling shows that the uplift would have enabled glaciation by producing increased orographic precipitation and cooling the surface temperatures. The oldest known ice in the current ice sheet <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>old</b> as 110,000 years.|$|E

500|$|A basic {{derivation}} of the Newtonian {{limit of}} general relativity <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>old</b> as the theory itself. Einstein used it to derive predictions such as the anomalous perihelion precession of the planet Mercury. Later work by Élie Cartan, Kurt Friedrichs and others showed more concretely how a geometrical generalization of Newton's theory of gravity known as Newton–Cartan theory could {{be understood as a}} (degenerate) limit {{of general relativity}}. This required letting a specific parameter [...] go to zero. Ehlers extended this work by developing a frame theory that allowed for constructing the Newton–Cartan limit, and in a mathematically precise way, not only for the physical laws, but for any spacetime obeying those laws (that is, solutions of Einstein's equations). This allowed physicists to explore what the Newtonian limit meant in specific physical situations. For example, the frame theory can be used to show that the Newtonian limit of a Schwarzschild black hole is a simple point particle. Also, it allows Newtonian versions of exact solutions such as the Friedmann–Lemaître models or the Gödel universe to be constructed. Since its inception, ideas Ehlers introduced in the context of his frame theory have found important applications in the study of both the Newtonian limit of general relativity and of the Post-Newtonian expansion, where Newtonian gravity is complemented by terms of ever higher order in [...] in order to accommodate relativistic effects.|$|E
