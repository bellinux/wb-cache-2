40|$|This paper explores whether within job {{and between}} <b>job</b> <b>wage</b> growth is lower for less-educated workers. While a simple model of {{heterogeneous}} learning ability predicts {{that individuals with}} low learning ability will have flatter wage profiles, this prediction has been largely ignored in the recent welfare reform debates. The key econometric problem in estimating returns to tenure and experience is that wages depend on the unobservable job match component, which is endogenous. We depart from the standard method for dealing with this problem in one important way. We show that this alternative implies that wages grow {{with the number of}} previous successful job matches. In our empirical work we show that this source of between <b>job</b> <b>wage</b> growth is large. Furthermore, we show that this source of wage growth, as well as the standard returns to tenure and experience, are substantially smaller for the least educated. ...|$|E

The countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Moreover, {{there is some evidence}} that among immigrant men, the permanent job premium is especially high for those who migrated from outside the European Union. These findings all suggest that the gain to promotion into permanent jobs is indeed higher for those with less experience in the domestic labor market. In contrast to the effects for the young and immigrants, the permanent job pay premium is slightly smaller on average for women than for men, even though on average women have less experience in the labor market than men do. It is possible that women even in permanent jobs are in segregated labor markets.

In the fixed effects models, the odds correspondingly change by a factor of   0.7 (Germany) and   0.4 (UK).

30|$|The second {{representation}} {{method is}} by defining <b>job</b> <b>wage</b> percentile. 15 In this particular case, smoothing regressions are displayed {{rather than the}} actual data point (the previous case). Therefore, changes in employment share are plotted against the percentile of the initial earnings distribution. A U-shaped curve is detected and shown in Fig.  2. The main advantage of this method is that the biggest increases and losses are observable. For Spain, the biggest losses are between the 20 th and the 40 th percentile of the initial mean wage distribution. Overall, the shape of employment changes in the EPA data confirms other studies with Spanish data and suggests that job polarisation is a robust phenomenon in Spain.|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{provides}} an interpretation {{for the recent}} rise in residual wage inequality {{which is consistent with}} the empirical observation that a sizeable part of this increase has a transitory nature, a feature that eludes standard models based on ex-ante heterogeneity in ability. In the model an acceleration in the rate of quality-improvement of equipment, like the one observed from the early 70 's, reduces workers’ capacity to transfer skills from old to new machines. This force generates a rise in the cross-sectional variance of skills, and therefore of wages. Through calibration, the Paper shows that this mechanism can account for 30 % of the surge in residual inequality in the US economy (or for most of its transitory component).

We show that a framework that integrates these familiar ideas captures {{a number of recent}} empirical findings concerning wage and promotion dynamics in internal labor markets, including the following. First, real wage decreases are a minority of the observations, but are not rare, while demotions are very rare. Second, there is significant serial correlation in wage increases. Third, promotions are associated with particularly large wage increases, but these wage increases are small relative to the difference between average wages across levels of a job ladder. Fourth, on average, workers who receive large wage increases early in their stay at one level of a job ladder are promoted more quickly to the next level.

30|$|Focusing on the Spanish case, {{this paper}} makes several {{contributions}} {{to the understanding of}} the evolution of the employment and wage structure in four complementary ways. First, I shed some light on the literature on employment polarisation in Spain, providing evidence of job polarisation in our sample; between 1994 and 2014, employment share in Spain increased at the two extremes of the <b>job</b> <b>wage</b> distribution, while it decreased for middle-income earners. My study adds to the literature on job polarisation, offering two new ways of representing the phenomenon and enlarging the period of analysis. 1 I also contribute to widening the literature on employment remuneration in line with employment trends. In the US, Autor and Dorn (2013) find a clear correspondence between employment and wages. However, the polarisation of wages does not seem to be common in Spain, as there is no evidence that changes in pay followed the same pattern as changes in occupations. This contrasts with standard labour markets models, predicting that a positive demand shock increases both employment and earnings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a new way}} of analyzing tenure profiles in wages, by modelling simultaneously the evolution of wages and the distribution of tenures. Starting point is the observation that within-job log wages for an individual can be described by random walk. We develop a theoretical model based on efficient bargaining, where both log outside wage and log wage in the current job follow a random walk. This setting allows the application of real option theory. We derive the efficient separation rule, which stipulates that workers switch jobs when the difference between the outside wage and the wage in the current job reaches a threshold. The model fits well the observed distribution of job tenures. Since we observe outside wages only at job start and job separation, our empirical analysis of with <b>job</b> <b>wage</b> growth is based on expected wage growth conditional on the outside wages at both dates. Our modelling allows testing of the efficient bargaining hypothesis. The model is estimated on the PSID. random productivity growth; efficient bargaining; job tenure; wage growth; wage-tenure profiles; option theory...|$|E
