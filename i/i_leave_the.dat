I owe so much to him it's {{impossible}} to express"; and has (years after Taylor's book) published an autobiographical account Red and Me the subject of which is his lifelong friendship with Auerbach. Bill Bradley for the New York Times Book Review wrote of Red and Me [...] "Bill Russell is a private, complex man, but {{on the subject of}} his love of Red Auerbach and his Celtic teammates, he’s loud and clear." [...] In the book itself Russell wrote [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> Celtics locker room, even Heaven wouldn't be good enough because anywhere else is a step down... With Red [...] and Walter Brown, I was the freest athlete on the planet. I could always be myself with them and they were always there for me." [...] Describing the Celtics organization (as distinguished from Boston sports fans in the 1950s and 1960s) as very progressive racially, Russell in 2010 recalled a list of the organization’s accomplishments on racial progress both in terms of objective milestones and his own subjective experience {{as a member of the}} organization: ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{commented on}} others' comments. [...] “I found {{several of the}} {{political}} commentaries thought provoking (e.g., {{the reading of the}} woman’s position in The Captive). [...] Others seem less convincing, as in the commentary about {{the presence or absence of}} Native Americans. [...] Painters are condemned for omitting the Native Americans (as in The Grayson Family). [...] But they are also condemned for portraying them.

2500|$|In April 1835, {{misled by}} {{inaccurate}} press reports, O'Connell thought Disraeli had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him [...] "His name {{shows that he}} is of Jewish origin. I do not {{use it as a}} term of reproach; there are many most respectable Jews. But there are, as in every other people, some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude; and of those I look upon Mr. Disraeli as the worst. He has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the Cross, and I verily believe, if Mr. Disraeli's family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced, the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom I allude. I forgive Mr. Disraeli now, and as the lineal descendant of the blasphemous robber, who ended his career beside the Founder of the Christian Faith, <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> gentleman to the enjoyment of his infamous distinction and family honours." [...] Disraeli sought satisfaction by challenging [...] O'Connell's son Morgan to a duel, Daniel having sworn never to duel again after previously killing a man. Morgan declined replying he was not responsible for his father's words.|$|E
