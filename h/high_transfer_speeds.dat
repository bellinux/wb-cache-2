40|$|In {{a modern}} {{environment}} users are more dependant {{on their ability}} to use their mobile phone for nearly everything. They communicate with almost any device and those devices provide nearly limitless access to for instance a watch or in new applications, a lock. Issues encountered with these devices are the almost always lack the ability to keep functioning for extended periods of time while having <b>high</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> and not a lot of space to store batteries. We present a means to keep a device operating for years with <b>high</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> in Bluetooth low energy connections, while functioning for year on end while connecting to a smartphone for access to the internet. To keep the solution working, <b>high</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> and minimal delays are needed as people are not willing to wait for extensive periods for a lock to open. This has to be done while operating for years with minimal space requirements. Our design uses the the Bluetooth low energy (LE) specification to keep the device connected to the mobile phone. The phone is connected to both the device (a lock) via Bluetooth LE and the internet. While the Bluetooth LE specification is low power, it is still considerably wasteful if <b>high</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> are used. As the internet connections of mobile phones are still considerably slow (even HSDPA) in response time, we can use this in our advantage to save power. The delays in these connections can be used to put the device to sleep. We also maintain full compatibility with the Bluetooth LE standard and keep high transfer speed when needed. Our solution provides the best transfer speed combined with the lower power consumption of low transfer rates. This is done by dynamically throttling the delays between each radio wakeup event. The method is tested for different delays expected in connection types like GPRS, UMTS and HSDPA. As a result device is able to operate for over 35 % longer and save 144 % power per message exchange without significant additional delays and without compromising the Bluetooth specification. It is also possible to use the technique without any low level access to the link layer which is preferable since it is not always possible to get access to the Bluetooth stack.

40|$|Abstract—To {{allow the}} Internet {{to provide a}} wide variety of {{communication}} services, <b>high</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> and high control speeds are essential. Developing such technologies for the future network will increase the power consumption of networks; a problem that is now is becoming an important issue. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, called the cloud control plane (Cloud C-plane), to reduce the power consumption of networks. Unlike conventional architectures, the forwarding functions and control functions are divided in the Cloud C-plane network architecture, and the control functions are placed in the cloud. Network equipment such as routers or switches are controlled and managed in the Cloud C-plane. In addition, the physical network topology is modified by activating deactivating network equipment so as to improve overall energy efficiency in response to changes in the traffic patterns. Implementing the routing engine on a dynamically reconfigurable processor (DRP) is one key to realizing the Cloud C-plane architecture. We also propose a traffic engineering method for reducing power consumption based on the new network. In, performance evolution, our method can reduce by 20 %~ 50 % power-on link. We also implement proposed method on an actual DRP...|$|E

Doing so allows us to access the surface electromagnetic wave excitations that arise at a metal/dielectric interface, a feature which both confines and enhances light in subwavelength dimensions - two promising characteristics for the development of integrated chip technology. This platform is known as plasmonics, and it allows us to design a broad range of complex metal/dielectric systems, all having different nanophotonic responses, but all originating from our ability to engineer the system surface plasmon resonances and interactions. In this thesis, we demonstrate how plasmonics can be used to develop coupled metal-dielectric systems to function as tunable plasmonic hole array color filters for CMOS image sensing, visible metamaterials composed of coupled negative-index plasmonic coaxial waveguides, and programmable plasmonic waveguide network systems to serve as color routers and logic devices at telecommunication wavelengths...|$|E
