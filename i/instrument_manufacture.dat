50|$|The {{first man}} to {{describe}} {{the use of an}} arthroscope to see inside a joint was Severin Nordentoft, from Denmark, in 1912. Since that time, the field of arthroscopy has evolved to encompass diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to many joints. Technical advances in <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture</b> and optical technologies have, in part, made it possible for the surgeon to gain access to reliable views of increasingly smaller joint spaces. Now, there is an International Society for Hip Arthroscopy (ISHA), comprising some of the leading hip arthroscopy specialists in the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, Anthony James (T.J.) Getzen {{founded the}} Getzen Company, in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Getzen had trained in {{instrument}} repair with the C.G.

Initially opened as a repair shop, the company expanded after World War II to <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture.</b> In 1946, Getzen produced its first trombones. In 1947, Getzen started producing trumpets and cornets as well. In 1949, J. Robert Getzen, T.J.'s son, assumed the position of plant superintendent and Getzen started to produce piston bugles. These bugles became popular with Drum and Bugle Corps.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, Harold Knowlton sold Getzen to Charles F. Andrews and {{the same}} year, J. Robert Getzen sold Allied Music to his sons Thomas and Edward. Edward {{concurrently}} founded Edwards Trombones. Charles Andrews {{lost control of the}} company in bankruptcy in 1991 and the Getzen brothers purchased the firm's assets. Transitioning Allied Music to the original role of the Getzen Company, instrument repair only, the family focused on the Getzen name for brass <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture</b> with Edwards as a subsidiary. In 1999, Thomas Getzen bought out his brother to become sole owner of the Getzen Company. In 2003 J. Robert Getzen died. In 2009, two of Thomas Getzen's sons were working for the company maintaining the family business model under the leadership of their father.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{specific}} {{treatment of the}} clarinet family in selected nineteenth-century treatises that were written in Paris, or were influenced by their author's experience in Paris. Four works by Georges Kastner, Hector Berlioz, and Francois Gevaert have been selected. These influential treatises were written and revised between the years 1836 and 1885. The primary purpose of these treatises was to serve as instruction manuals for students of musical composition. Demonstrating a strong unity in information they also diverge on various points, reflecting the changing state of <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture,</b> performance abilities and aesthetic requirements demanded by composers...|$|E
40|$|Xylophone {{belongs to}} the idiophone group of {{instruments}} which is very present in the African traditional and popular music. Its sound percussion quality {{is related to the}} resonance and the intrinsic properties of used wood. In spite of numerous studies of the acoustic properties of wood, very few works are available on Pterocarpus species in general and notably on Pterocarpus erinaceus. In this study, the variability of acoustic properties of vène (Pterocarpus erinaceus Poir), used for xylophone <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture</b> in Mali and the relationships between these properties and the basic density and extractive content were investigated in order to provide information about its overall suitability for xylophone making. A free-free flexural method, known as “Bing”, was used to determine the main mechanical properties for the xylophone <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture</b> i. e. the damping coefficient and the specific dynamic modulus while the basic density and the extractives (EC) content were determined according to international standards ISO 3129 and ASTM D 1105 (1996), respectively. The results showed that the dynamic specific modulus, the basic density and the extractive content are significantly higher for wood from Guinean area than for wood from Soudanian area. For all provenances the values determined for these properties have been significantly higher for wood from external (EHW) and median heartwood (MHW) than for wood from internal heartwood (IHW). The damping coefficient, the loss factor is significantly greater for wood from Soudanian area than for wood from Guinean area, and regardless of provenance, the loss factor was significantly greater for wood from IWH than in MHW and EHW...|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} {{consider}} the alignment of scientific and media practice {{at the beginning of}} the nineteenth century. Over several decades after 1817 certain instrument makers began to specialise in the domestic entertainment market, transferring skills from optical <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture</b> to the design of fashionable novelty devices. The instrument trade was expanding into a new middle-class market to exploit an increasing popular trade in optical novelties, exemplified by the 1817 Kaleidoscope craze and new interest among the middle classes for microscopes, telescopes, and magic lanterns. This paper will address this shift towards more popular uses of scientific instruments and optical toys. In particular it will address the involvement of the Birmingham and London optician Philip Carpenter in three popular media formats of the 1810 s and 1820 s — the 1817 patent Kaleidoscope, 1821 Improved Phantasmagoria Lantern and 1827 Microcosm...|$|E
40|$|In {{attempting}} to identify human intention {{in the use}} of acoustic features of the environment, it is important that consideration be given to the potential forms and purposes of the activities that may have been carried out in the space under investigation. The significance of the acoustic properties of spaces, and their possible modification, may depend upon the activities practised there. This study describes the types of instruments used traditionally by four groups of modern hunter-gatherers from around the world, {{and the nature of the}} musical activities in which they are employed. Legitimate parallels to past auditory behaviours can be based on the pattern of shared constraints; the tools and materials available to these peoples for <b>instrument</b> <b>manufacture</b> often resemble those available to past human groups. Attention is drawn to the diversities and similarities of musical behaviours and instrumentation, and highlights some of the implications that these hold for the use of acoustical space in the past...|$|E
