5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what he was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E

5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E
25|$|Born in Moussayah Loumbaya (Dubréka), {{a member}} of the Susu people, he {{estimated}} his birthdate to be 1934, although he never <b>knew</b> <b>exactly.</b> Conté was educated at a local Quranic school and attended Dubréka primary school. He then went on to study at military preparatory schools in Bingerville, Côte d'Ivoire and Saint Louis, Senegal.|$|E
25|$|Newspaper columnists {{subsequently}} exchanged mixed {{views about}} The Jeremy Kyle Show. Fiona Phillips, {{writing in the}} Daily Mirror, accused Judge Berg of being out of touch and claimed those appearing on the programme <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what they were letting themselves in for. However, Carole Malone at sister publication the Sunday Mirror claimed Kyle was only interested in helping his own ego.|$|E

25|$|On 15 December, a huge Japanese fleet was amassed in Sach'on Bay, on {{the east}} end of the Noryang Strait. Shimazu was not sure whether the allied fleet was {{continuing}} the blockade of Konishi's wajō, on its way to attack an abandoned wajō further east or blocking their way on the western end of Noryang Strait. Yi, meanwhile, <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where Shimazu was after receiving reports from scouts and local fishermen.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, Asharq Al-Awsat {{reported}} that a senior Israeli defense official had told the newspaper that Israel <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where Shalit was being held, and was keeping the location under constant surveillance. The newspaper {{reported that}} Hamas was aware that Israel knew Shalit's location, and responded by booby-trapping the area, surrounding it with explosives in a 400–500-meter radius, and issuing a directive to kill Shalit if Israel mounted a military rescue operation.|$|E

25|$|Barry's {{second term}} {{was much more}} {{troublesome}} than his first. Though Washington experienced a massive real estate boom that helped alleviate the city's fiscal problems for a time, government spending skyrocketed; the administration posted a fifth straight budget surplus, but the next year struggled with a $110 million deficit. Much of the disparity was caused by Barry's policy of combatting unemployment by creating government jobs; the city government's payrolls swelled so greatly that by 1986, nobody in the administration <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how many employees it had.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016 Roy's mother Lynn {{reportedly}} {{said she}} was not sure {{what she wanted to}} happen to Carter, referring to an interaction between two unwell people and that Carter could have saved him. After the guilty verdict Roy's father stated publicly that the family were pleased with the verdict but that they wanted privacy and time to process the events they have experienced; Lynn Roy appeared on the CBS '48 Hours' show saying she didn't believe Carter had a conscience and that she <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what she was doing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probably}} {{fair to say}} that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{calculation}} of glass properties {{is directly related to}} the founding of glass science. At the end of the 19th century the physicist Ernst Abbe developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized optical microscopes in Jena, Germany, stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of Carl Zeiss. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of microscopes was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive optical microscopes with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required lenses and prisms with specific ratios of refractive index and dispersion did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.|$|E
25|$|Ellis {{started out}} in {{department}} store retailing in the Richmond, Virginia, area to gain experience in the fashion industry as a buyer and merchandiser at the department store Miller & Rhoads. While there, he was co-founder of Richmond retail shop A Sunny Day. He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer of Norwich in New York City. Eventually, in the mid-1970s, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976. Although he could not sketch, he <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how the industry worked and proved a master of innovative ideas who created 'new classics' that American women longed for at the time.|$|E
25|$|The police further {{speculated that}} the victims did not {{initially}} realize the danger they were facing, {{the location of the}} bodies in the estate's second floor indicated that they did not consider escaping when they faced their intruder, and in spite of the unexpected and dramatic break-in nobody made any effort to alert the police or others. One explanation may be that the victims initially did not feel the intruder to be threatening or did not see it necessary to contact the police. The fact that Kristian Orderud was killed while lying in his bed, indicated that the perpetrator was not a random predator without intimate knowledge of the family, but rather <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> who his victims were. This was backed up by the fact that nothing was missing from the house, ruling out a robbery.|$|E

25|$|The Littorio {{was held}} in reserve behind the Infantry {{divisions}} {{to the rear of}} Miteirya Ridge on the 25 October the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and Littorio divisions. The Panzerarmee was probing for a weakness, but found none. When the sun set the Allied infantry went on the attack and around midnight 51st (Highland) Division launched three attacks, but no one <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting in the loss of over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces. By this time the Trento Division had lost half its infantry and most of its artillery, 164th Light Afrika Division had lost two battalions and although the 15th Panzer and Littorio Divisions had held off the Allied armour, this had proved costly and most units were under strength.|$|E
