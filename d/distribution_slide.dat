The authors define a novel parameter z as a kinematic index, which includes the effects of wafer size, distance between the rotation centers, and the rotation ratio of wafer and pad. The analysis result suggests that the shape of velocity distribution, direction of friction force, uniformity of velocity <b>distribution,</b> <b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding</b> distance, and the uniformity of <b>sliding</b> distance <b>distribution</b> could be consistently expressed in terms of the kinematic index z.

40|$|The {{normal stress}} {{distribution}} across a slip plane {{has the effect}} of reducing the critical loading required for dislocation emission from a crack tip. The reduction by normal stresses was found to be very significant for Si, based on properties estimated for it using density functional theory, to be large for Fe as modeled by the embedded atom method (EAM), and to be smaller in AI, Ni and ordered Ni 3 A 1, estimated using the EAM. The general dependence over a wide range on parameters characterizing the tension-shear coupling was also determined. In the context of a Peierls model for dislocation nucleation at a crack tip (J. R. Rice, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 40 (1992) 239), our approach was to search for onset of the dislocation nucleation instability based on the numerical solution of the system of non-linear integral equations describing an incipient dislocation. The incipient dislocation consists of a <b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding</b> and opening displacements along a slip plane emanating from the crack tip; these displacements are related to the shear and tensile stresses across the slip plane by constitutive relations based on the atomic models mentioned. Results from the atomic models are used to parametrize constitutive relations involving a Frenkel sinusoidal dependence of shear stress on sliding displacement at any fixed opening displacement, and a Rose-Ferrante-Smith universal binding form of dependence of tensile stress on opening displacement at any fixed shear displacement. These relations then enter the system of integral equations, solved numerically, which describe the elasticity solution for a non-uniform <b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding</b> and opening along the sli...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although the {{existing}} performance-based design method for the vertical breakwater evaluates an average sliding distance during an arbitrary time, {{it does not}} calculate the probability of the first occurrence of an event exceeding an allowable sliding distance(i. e. the first-passage probability). Designers need information about {{the probability that the}} structure is damaged for the first time for not only design but also maintenance and operation of the structure. Therefore, in this study, a time-dependent reliability design method based on a stochastic process is developed to evaluate the first-passage probability of caisson sliding. Caisson sliding can be formulated by the Poisson spike process because both occurrence time and intensity of severe waves causing caisson sliding are random processes. The occurrence rate of severe waves is expressed {{as a function of the}} <b>distribution</b> function of <b>sliding</b> distance and mean occurrence rate of severe waves. These values simulated by a performance-based design method are expressed as multivariate regression functions of design variables. As a result, because the <b>distribution</b> function of <b>sliding</b> distance and the mean occurrence rate of severe waves are expressed as functions of significan...|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} in high {{seismicity}} areas {{is the need}} for flexural strengthening of the weak reinforced concrete elements. A popular technique for increasing the flexural capacity of reinforced concrete elements involves the casting of a new concrete layer, reinforced or not, on the tensile or the compressive side of the element. Slip at the interface between {{the old and the new}} concrete affects the behaviour of the composite element. However, it is common practice in design to ignore slip and consider the strengthened element as monolithic. In the present paper, an approximate estimation of the maximum values of sliding, slip strain and shear stress of the strengthened element is presented. In addition, an analytical procedure for prediction of the <b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding</b> and slip strain along the interface between the initial beam and the new layer of concrete is presented.

40|$|Cytoplasmic dynein is a multisubunit, microtubule-dependent mechanochemical {{enzyme that}} has been {{proposed}} to function {{in a variety of}} intracellular movements, including minus-end-directed transport of organelles. Dynein-mediated vesicle transport is stimulated in vitro by addition of the Glued/dynactin complex raising the possibility that these two complexes interact in vivo. We report here that a class of phenotypically identical mutants of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa are defective in genes encoding subunits of either cytoplasmic dynein or the Glued/dynactin complex. These mutants, defined as ropy, have curled hyphae with abnormal nuclear distribution. ro- 1 encodes the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein, while ro- 4 encodes an actin-related protein that is a probable homologue of the actin-related protein Arpl (formerly referred to as actin-RPV or centractin), the major component of the glued/dynactin complex. The phenotypes of ro- 1 and ro- 4 mutants suggest that cytoplasmic dynein, as well as the Glued/dynactin complex, are required to maintain uniform nuclear distribution in fungal hyphae. We propose that cytoplasmic dynein maintains nuclear <b>distribution</b> through <b>sliding</b> of antiparallel microtubules emanating from neighboring spindle pole bodies...|$|R

Balance velocities are used as coefficients in the age equation and in the heat equation. Solution of the heat equation allows prediction of sliding areas and computation of basal melt rates. Vertical distributions of velocity are parameterized using shape functions. These can be set uniformly, or allowed to vary in space according to the <b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding.</b> The vertical coordinate can either be uniformly distributed within {{the thickness of the}} ice, or be uniformly distributed within the flux. The finite-difference scheme results in a large set of linear equations. These are solved using a nested factorization preconditioned conjugate gradient scheme.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to assess and {{communicate}} hazards associated with landslides in the Badlands National Park using geological mapping and innovative GIS data gathering and display techniques. The current geological map of the Badlands National Park (1 : 62, 500 scale) was published in 1976. While an excellent map, it gives little information useful for hazard assessment other than <b>distribution</b> of <b>slide</b> deposits. The goal here is to create a detailed map of <b>slide</b> <b>distribution</b> together with information on slide mechanisms, timing, and bedrock geologic factors that contribute to hazards. These data are displayed in GIS formats that are interactive, can be quickly updated, and useful for analysis. Landslide zones in the Badlands are especially hazardous to park infrastructure; the main road through the park crosses three of the largest slide zones. At these crossings, road stabilization has been ongoing and expensive. Creep rates of 50 to 125 mm/week were recorded by geotechnical investigators at Cedar Pass prior to stabilization efforts in 2000. In addition to creep, there is significant danger of catastrophic slumping and rock toppling in these zones. Geologic conditions that contribute to slide formation include loosely consolidated strata, precipitation events, the presence of swelling clays, vertical jointing, and a structural dip towards the river valley. In addition to assessing hazards, we are attempting to use GIS techniques in innovative ways. In this first phase of the project, using data gathered in three field seasons, we created a digital base map of the project area in ESRI’s ArcGIS Software. Point, line and polygon vector data were gathered with the use of both sub-meter Trimble GeoXT and Garmin GPS units. Together with field notes, drawings and hyperlinked digital images at specific landslide locations, data was checked into the project Geodatabase and specific feature classes were created/updated and overlaid on high-resolution imagery. Analysis was then performed on the layers to create distinct spatial and temporal boundaries based on geologic beds and historic activity.

40|$|Glacier basal sliding is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} aspect of glacier mechanics, and its {{spatial and temporal}} distribution affects glacier change {{and the evolution of}} alpine landscapes. In these studies, we use on-glacier GPS, moderate- and high-resolution optical satellite imagery, and numerical ice flow modeling to investigate the mechanics of glacier sliding across a variety of scales. First, we employ on-glacier GPS to investigate the intimate link between subglacial water pressure and the rate of glacier sliding in response to the onset of spring melting on Kennicott Glacier, Alaska. We find large diurnal glacier velocity fluctuations during times of high and rising water level on a well-connected ice-marginal lake. The ice surface speedup at an up-glacier station is first driven by longitudinal coupling to down-glacier ice, but then evolves to respond to local basal conditions. We then utilize high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery to document the spatial pattern of the seasonal evolution of ice surface velocity over the 45 km 2 terminal reach of Kennicott Glacier. We develop a numerical ice flow model to explore the <b>distribution</b> of basal <b>sliding</b> required to explain the observed surface speedup. We find the ice surface speedup is insensitive to the exact <b>distribution</b> of basal <b>sliding,</b> which may allow for simpler sliding parameterizations in glacier models. Finally, we employ Landsat 8 satellite imagery to characterize the spatial patterns of glacier sliding over a 45, 000 km 2 area covering 64 glacier longitudinal profiles from ice divide to terminus. We find the entire ablation area of glaciers speeds up in a uniform manner, with the speedup magnitude insensitive to winter surface speeds. These patterns of sliding may drive patterns of glacier erosion that leads to the formation of icefalls...|$|R

Due to the increase of the vehicle speed {{and the presence of}} roughness, contact geometry perturbations induce a variation of forces in the vertical and tangential direction, and the torsional vibration of the wheelset axle may, therefore, be excited at high frequency. These vibrations directly affect the contact dynamic action of wheel/rail, and then influence on the wheel profile wear. Therefore, in the prediction of wheel profile wear, wheelset should be considered as flexible body.|$|R

Here we focus attention only on the geometry of the superhelix and present two distinct mathematical expressions that rely on the DNA helical parameters (Shift, Slide, Rise, Tilt, Roll, Twist). One representation requires torsion for superhelix formation; the other requires shear. To compare these mathematical expressions to experimental data we develop a strategy for Fourier-filtering the helical parameters that identifies necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve a high-resolution model of the nucleosome superhelix. We apply this filtering strategy to 24 high-resolution structures of the nucleosome and demonstrate that all structures have a highly conserved <b>distribution</b> of Roll, <b>Slide</b> and Twist that involves two length scales. One length scale spans the entire length of nucleosomal DNA. The other is associated with the helix repeat.

The spatial distribution of soil microorganisms was studied using a modified glass slide technique of Kholodny-Rossi. Analysis of the microbial <b>distribution</b> on glass <b>slides</b> placed in soil showed an interaction between azobenzene and microbial spatial distribution. A specific microflora developed on the surface of azobenzene particles and caused the degradation of azobenzene crystals into amorphous mass. Accumulation of azobenzene in the microbial colonies was observed. It was shown that the bacteria isolated from the glass slides and soil were able to assimilate azobenzene in the presence of carbohydrates.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of the wider author’s {{research}} on the development of the new mathematical model for description of the viscosity changes of the lubrication oil in the exploitation time. Pressure of the oil is a variable parameter in the combustion engine and depends on many design parameters such as oil pump efficiency, geometry of the channels and lubricated element. It depends also on the exploitation parameters, such as rotational speed of the engine or contamination degree of the oil filter. So big amount of the factors, which have an influence on the pressure, resulted in the decision to examine, how big influence has a pressure in the oil viscosity. For the researches, the oil samples from the different combustion engines, both petrol and diesel, with different capacities, were taken into account. In each case, for the examination were taken samples both for the fresh oil and used oil from the change. Results of this research are shown in the tabular in correlation to the engines specification. In the next researches, after collecting all the oil ageing data, author will examine the pressure <b>distribution</b> in the <b>slide</b> bearing. After that it will be will possible to estimate the importance of the pressure changes for the proper work of the engine...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of ice {{deformation}} at {{the surface}} and at depth in the Athabasca Glacier, Canada, reveal {{for the first time}} the pattern of flow in a nearly complete cross section of a valley glacier, and make it possible to test the applicability of experimental and theoretical concepts in the analysis of glacier flow. Tilting in nine boreholes (depth about 300 m, eight holes essentially to the bottom) was measured with a newly developed electrical inclinometer, which allows a great increase in the speed and accuracy with which borehole configurations can be determined, in comparison with earlier methods. The measurements define the distribution of the velocity vector and the strain-rate tensor over 70 % of the area of the glacier cross section. The main longitudinal component of flow has the following general features: (1) basal sliding velocity which exceeds 70 % of the surface velocity over half of the width of the glacier, (2) marginal sliding velocity (not more than a few meters per year) much less than basal sliding velocity at the centerline (about 40 m yr(- 1)), (3) marginal shear strain rate near the valley walls two to three times larger than the basal shear strain rate near the centerline (0. 1 yr(- 1)). The observed longitudinal flow is significantly different from that expected from theoretical analysis of flow in cylindrical channels (Nye, 1965). The relative strength of marginal and basal shear strain rate is opposite to that expected from theory. In addition, the longitudinal flow velocity averaged over the glacier cross section (which determines the flux of ice transported) is larger by 11 % than the average flow velocity seen at the glacier surface, whereas it would be 2 % smaller if the theoretical prediction were correct. These differences are caused to a large extent by the constant sliding velocity assumed in the theoretical analysis, which contrasts strongly with the actual <b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding.</b> The observed relation between marginal and basal sliding velocity is probably a general flow feature in valley glaciers, and may be caused by lateral variation of water pressure at the ice-rock contact. The observed pattern of longitudinal velocity over the section also shows in detail certain additional features incompatible with the theoretical treatment, even after the difference in boundary conditions (<b>distribution</b> of <b>sliding</b> velocity) is taken into account. Longitudinal strain rate (a compression of about 0. 02 yr(- 1) {{at the surface}}) decreases with depth, becoming nearly 0 at the bed in the center of the glacier. The depth variation cannot be explained completely by overall bending of the ice mass as a result of a longitudinal gradient in the curvature of the bed, and is at variance with existing theories, which require the longitudinal strain rate to be constant with depth. Motion transverse to the longitudinal flow occurs in a roughly symmetric pattern of diverging marginward flow, with most of the lateral transport occurring at depth in a fashion reminiscent of extrusion flow. The observed lateral velocities averaged over depth (up to 1. 9 m yr(- 1)) are compatible with the lateral flux required to maintain equilibrium of the marginal portions of the glacier surface under ablation (3. 7 m yr(- 1)) and are driven by the convex transverse profile of the ice surface. When the measured strain-rate field is analyzed on the basis of the standard assumption that the shear stress parallel to the glacier surface varies linearly with depth, the rheological behavior in the lower one-half to two-thirds of the glacier is found compatible with a power-type flow law with n = 5. 3. However, the upper one-third to one-half of the glacier constitutes an anomalous zone in which this treatment gives physically unreasonable rheological behavior. In a new method of analysis, rheological parameters are chosen so as to minimize the fictitious body forces that appear as residuals in the equilibirum equations when evaluated for the measured strain-rate field. This new method requires no a priori assumptions about the stress distribution, although for simplicity in application, the mean stress is assumed constant longitudinally. This treatment shows that the anomalies in the near-surface zone are due to significant departures from linear dependence of shear stress on depth, and gives a flow-law exponent of n = 3. 6, which is closer than n = 5. 3 to values determined by laboratory experiments on ice...|$|R
30|$|During the {{triaxial}} compression tests, {{the failure}} mechanism of shale {{can be explained}} using the sliding crack model of brittle heterogeneous material (Ashby et al. 1990; Li et al. 2015). Figure  9 shows the initial pre-existing micro-cracks <b>distribution</b> and the <b>sliding</b> crack model of shale samples under triaxial compression. As shown in Fig.  9 a, it can be assumed {{that there are a}} large number of natural micro-cracks and secondary thermal micro-cracks after LN 2 cooling inside shale samples; these micro-cracks can be regarded as the pre-existing micro-cracks (see Fig.  9 b). When the shear stress in the pre-existing micro-cracks exceeds the frictional force between crack interfaces, the wing cracks will be created from the tips of the pre-existing micro-cracks. Subsequently, a large number of micro-cracks inside the shale began to expand and connect, and the connection and growth of micro-cracks will lead to a large area of local failure. If the shale samples contain more pre-existing micro-cracks, these cracks will more easily connect, grow and interpenetrate. As observed in Figs.  6, 7, 8, the ultimate stress levels of all LN 2 -treated specimens are significantly lower than those of original and untreated ones, indicating that all LN 2 -treated specimens contain more the pre-existing micro-cracks than those of the original and untreated samples, resulting in the decrease in its effective bearing area and bearing capacity.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} a new method for analyzing and visualizing friction force measurements of meso-scale stick–slip motion, and introduce {{a method for}} extracting two separate dissipative energy components. Using a microelectromechanical system tribometer, we execute 2 million reciprocating sliding cycles, during which we measure the static friction force with a resolution of 0. 6 nN and the displacement with a resolution of 0. 2 nm. We plot the lateral force {{as a function of}} the real contact position by compensating for the values of the spring constants of the system. This allows all friction loops to be combined in a single hexagonal bin plot, which clearly shows the evolution of the friction force magnitude and its <b>distribution</b> across the <b>sliding</b> track. We identify all individual slip events in the entire experiment using a thresholding algorithm. This allows us to show the evolution of the slip event count, the static friction force, and the coefficient of friction. Crucially, it allows us to disentangle the dissipated energy into two components: the dynamically dissipated energy, which is associated with slip motions, and the semi-statically dissipated energy, which is related to small contact deformations, plastic yield and other non-elastic behavior. Our technique provides new insight into the mechanics of stick–slip motion in multi-asperity contact systems, and paves the way towards a better understanding of the physics of meso-scale friction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of sliding, adhering contact between a rigid parabolic indenter and a multi-layered elastic solid, which is assumed to comprise of a homogeneous coating bonded through a functionally-graded transitional layer to a homogeneous substrate. The adhesive forces in this investigation are modelled using Lennard-Jones potential and an iterative algorithm is proposed that solves for the contact pressure, surface displacement and sub-surface stresses resultant within the layered solid. The effects of surface adhesion and different material properties such as varying coating/transition layer thickness and coating hardness on {{the solution of the}} contact problem are subsequently investigated in detail. The numerical approach presented in this paper demonstrates the significance of having a suitable mathematical representation for the traction <b>distribution</b> along the <b>sliding,</b> adhering contact. It is found that under weakly adhering conditions, the assumption of only Coulombic traction suffices to determine the displacements and subsurface stresses within the multi-layered solid. However, it is noted that stress concentrations within the material begin to propagate through all three layers of the elastic solid with increased surface adhesion, which could potentially induce plasticity and lead to material ploughing under sliding. The proposed model allows us to further investigate and improve our understanding of the combined effects of traction and boundary adhesion in sliding contacts, which can be used to inform the design of materials needed in such conditions...|$|R
