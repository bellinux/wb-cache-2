25|$|A railway {{inspector}} authorised by the Office of Rail Regulation {{inspected the}} section between Dereham and Hoe {{prior to the}} first passenger train using the track, the inspector set out rules governing the frequency of use and the necessary inspection regime that should be used on this section {{as well as the}} maximum speed permitted. The inspector limited the use of the line north of Dereham to 12 days per year for passenger trains {{due to the lack of}} operational signalling equipment in the Dereham station area and the absence of a <b>Facing</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Lock</b> on the points immediately north of Norwich Road level crossing, this legally means they must be clipped and locked manually prior to use by passenger trains. The speed limit north of Dereham is 15mph due to the condition of the track, the speed limit could be increased by adding additional ballast.|$|E
50|$|Variations on a treadle {{that can}} be {{carriage}} long include <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> bars, clearance bars, and train bars, depending how they are located on a track layout.|$|E
50|$|Since the accident, a new {{signal box}} has been opened at Ropley, with full interlocking, which will prevent {{a repeat of}} this incident. Also, fouling bars have been {{installed}} to prevent points being moved (when the <b>Facing</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Lock</b> is not in use).|$|E
50|$|In 1907 {{the section}} was singled {{when the second}} platform, waiting-room, {{footbridge}} and signal box were all removed. Entrance lines to the siding are provided for each direction from the single line, with <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
50|$|However the {{inspection}} by Col F M Rich of the Board of Trade was disappointing; this {{was necessary to}} permit passenger operation, but permission was refused. A number of signalling alterations were required, chiefly <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> and signal repeaters; in addition the Company had no passenger rolling stock yet.|$|R
50|$|By the {{movement}} of individual levers, signals, points, level crossing gates or barriers and sometimes movable bridges over waterways are operated via wires and rods. The signaller chooses the correct combination of <b>points,</b> <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> and signals to operate, which will control {{the movement}} of each train through his or her area of control.|$|R
50|$|In Autumn 2010 {{changes were}} made to allow Cambrian and Welsh Marches line trains to depart in a southerly {{direction}} from Platform 3. An upper quadrant signal replaced the previous shunting disc and a <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> {{was added to the}} points. Though the track layout could already accommodate this, until the lock was added only non-passenger movements southbound from Platform 3 could be made.|$|E
50|$|North Thoresby {{signal box}} is a 7 lever Eastern region ground frame {{that has been}} {{installed}} to operate the track and signalling layout at North Thoresby. It operates two main line signals, two shunting signal for access {{to and from the}} siding, a <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> and a facing point for access {{in and out of the}} siding. With No.1 lever being released by the annetts key making up the final lever in the frame. North Thoresby signal box was commissioned on 7 August 2009.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> FPL or {{point lock}} is a device which, {{as the name}} implies, locks a set of points in position, as well as proving {{that they are in}} the correct position. The [...] "facing point" [...] part of the name refers {{to the fact that they}} are to prevent {{movement}} of the points during facing moves, where a train could potentially split the points (end up going down both tracks) if the points were to move underneath the train - during trailing moves, the wheels of a train will force the points into the correct position if they attempt to move.|$|E
50|$|The long {{wheelbase}} {{meant that the}} <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>locking</b> bars on the line had to be lengthened. It went into service in April or May 1907, and the rail motor gradually took {{up the majority of}} the passenger traffic, and by July 1907 was working the ordinary passenger trains four days per week, at a daily saving of Â£3 6s 6d.|$|R
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the two request halts (Country Park and Northwood), all intermediate stations have the ability to pass trains on the single line. However, Highley's passing loop lacks a platform and <b>Facing</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Locks</b> on <b>points</b> to attached sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not use this loop. However, it is frequently used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and empty stock workings. Despite this, the Severn Valley Railway offers, possibly, the most intensive service on any single line heritage railway.|$|R

50|$|To {{assist the}} {{operator}} in determining their functions, each lever in a frame will generally be uniquely labelled, one common method being to number the levers in order {{from left to}} right. A lever's identification may be painted on its side or engraved on a badge or plate fitted either to the lever or behind it. This may {{be accompanied by a}} description of the lever's function. Usually, a large track diagram is positioned within easy view of the operator, which clearly shows each lever number adjacent to symbols representing the items of equipment that they operate. Levers are commonly coloured according to the type of equipment they control, the code of colours varying between different railway administrations. For example, in British practice, the following code generally applies: a red lever controls a stop signal or shunt signal, a yellow lever controls a distant signal, a black lever controls a set of points, a blue lever controls a <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> and a white lever is spare. Brown levers are used to lock level crossing gates.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{signalling}} installation, {{believed to}} be the first in the world to include electronic interlocking equipment, was brought into use recently at Henley-on Thames... The branch was reduced to single track, with a passing loop at Shiplake in 1961. The line is continuously track circuited, and there are acceptance switches or levers at Twyford, Shiplake, and Henley. The equipment is designed to perform the basic functions of railway signalling apparatus by controlling the interlocking of signals, so that correct distances are maintained between trains that follow or cross or approach each other. This is done by means of computor sic techniques using arrangements of plug-in electronic [...] "bogie" [...] units, in which transistors and magnetic cores perform [...] "logical" [...] switching operations. There are no magnetic relays of conventional type... The installation at Henley is operated from a mosaic-type signalling panel, of the pattern already standard on the Western Region, controlling 36 routes on the [...] "entrance-exit" [...] principle with a switch at the entrance point of the route and a pushbutton at its exit. Track, signal, point, and other miscellaneous indications are also shown on the panel in the usual way. For reasons of economy, all <b>points</b> and <b>facing</b> <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> are worked manually from the existing lever frame, from which all the mechanical interlocking has been removed.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, FPLs {{were common}} {{from an early}} date, due to laws being passed which forced the {{provision}} of FPLs for any routes travelled by passenger trains - it was, and still is, illegal for a passenger train to make a <b>facing</b> move over <b>points</b> without them being locked, either by a <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> or temporarily clamped in one position or another.|$|R
50|$|The points {{failure was}} caused by the {{extremely}} cold weather that day freezing the point mechanisms. When the signalman had accepted the fish train from the previous signalbox to the North, he needed to swing the <b>facing</b> <b>points</b> (that allowed entry into the Up Platform Loop from the Up line) from reverse to normal. When he pushed the lever back into the frame he was able to engage the <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> and thus clear the signal. Unbeknown to him, the point rods had actually bent due to the mechanisms freezing up, which allowed him to place the point lever in the normal position, but actually left the points in reverse. This accident is one of the very rare occasions where mechanical interlocking has failed to work correctly.|$|R

40|$|Utilizing the {{subdivision}} for bicubic uniform B-spline surfaces, Ed Catmull and Jim Clark, following {{the methodology of}} Doo and Sabin noted that {{the subdivision}} rules expressed for the cubic B-spline surface not only work for arbitrary rectangular meshes, but can also be extended to meshes of an arbitrary topology. This extension was accomplished by generalizing {{the definition of a}} <b>face</b> <b>point,</b> by modifying the method for calculating vertex points (which extends that of the uniform B-spline case), and by specifying a method for reconnecting the points into a mesh. Specifying the Refinement Procedure Given a mesh of control points with an arbitrary topology, we can generalize the <b>face</b> <b>point,</b> edge point, vertex point specification from the uniform B-spline surface calculations to obtain â¢ For each face of the mesh, generate the new <b>face</b> <b>points</b> â which are the average of all the original <b>points</b> defining the <b>face</b> (We note that faces may have 3, 4, 5, or many points now defining them). â¢ Generate the new edge points â which are calculated as the average of the midpoints of the original edge with the two new <b>face</b> <b>points</b> of the <b>faces</b> adjacent to the edge. â¢ Calculate the new vertex points â which are calculated as the average of Q, 2 R and (nâ 3) S n, where Q is the average of the new <b>face</b> <b>points</b> of all <b>faces</b> adjacent to the original <b>face</b> <b>point,</b> R is the average of the midpoints of all original edges incident on the original vertex point, and S is the original vertex point. The mesh is reconnected by the following method. â¢ Each new <b>face</b> <b>point</b> is connected to the new edge points of the edges defining the original face. â¢ Each new vertex point is connected to the new edge points of all original edges incident on the original Example vertex point. For an example of this process consider the mesh consisting of four triangles in a diamond pattern, as is illustrated below. First, we construct the <b>face</b> <b>points,</b> which are calculated as the average of the points that make up each of the original <b>faces.</b> These <b>points</b> are shown in the figure below, labeled with an F...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm which generates three-dimensional <b>face</b> <b>point</b> trajectories {{for a given}} speech file with or without its text. The proposed algorithm first employs an off-line training phase.

These codebooks consist of both acoustic and visual features. Acoustics are represented by line spectral frequencies (LSF), and <b>face</b> <b>points</b> are represented with their principal components (PC). During the synthesis stage, speech input is rated {{in terms of its}} similarity to the codebook entries. Based on the similarity, each codebook entry is assigned a weighting coefficient. If the phonetic information about the test speech is available, this is utilized in restricting the codebook search to only several codebook entries which are visually closest to the current phoneme (a visual phoneme similarity matrix is generated for this purpose).
