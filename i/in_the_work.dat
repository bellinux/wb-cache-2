5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E

5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on {{the contents of the}} human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.|$|E
5|$|In music, birdsong has {{influenced}} composers and musicians in several ways: {{they can be}} inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi and Beethoven did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Ottorino Respighi; or as Beatrice Harrison did in 1924 with a nightingale, and David Rothenberg did in 2000 with a laughingthrush, they can duet with birds.|$|E

5|$|Military {{camouflage}} patterns {{have been}} popular in fashion and art from {{as early as}} 1915. Camouflage patterns have appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of artists such as Andy Warhol and Ian Hamilton Finlay, sometimes with an anti-war message. In fashion, many major designers have exploited camouflage's style and symbolism, and military clothing or imitations of it have been used both as street wear and {{as a symbol of}} political protest.|$|E

5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian {{countries have been}} creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> force. Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> {{force in the world}} and salary differences are among the lowest. Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E
