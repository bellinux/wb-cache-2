25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} arrangements to build a deposition chamber for PLD. The target material which is evaporated by the laser is normally found as a rotating disc attached to a support. However, {{it can also be}} sintered into a cylindrical rod with rotational motion and a translational up and <b>down</b> <b>movement</b> along its axis. This special configuration allows not only the utilization of a synchronized reactive gas pulse but also of a multicomponent target rod with which films of different multilayers can be created.|$|E
25|$|Nest {{building}} in India commences {{during the peak}} of the monsoon with most of the nests initiated during September – November, with few new nests built afterwards until January. They nest in large and isolated trees on which they build a platform. The nest is large, as much as 3 to 6 feet across and made up of sticks, branches and lined with rushes, water-plants and sometimes with a mud plaster on the edges. Nests may be reused year after year. The usual clutch is four eggs which are dull white in colour and broad oval in shape, but varies from one to five eggs. The exact incubation period is not known but is expected to be about 30 days. The chicks hatch with white down which is replaced by a darker grey down on the neck within a week. The scapular feathers emerge first followed by the primaries. The young birds make a chack sound followed by a repeated wee-wee-wee calls. Adult birds take turns at the nest and when one returns to relieve the other, they perform a greeting display with open wings and an up and <b>down</b> <b>movement</b> of the head. Food is brought for the young chicks by the adults and regurgitated onto the nest platform. Adults stop feeding the young at the nest and begin to show aggression towards the chicks after they are about 3 or 4 months old. The young birds may stay on nearby for about a year but disperse soon. Typically one to three chicks fledge from successful nests, but up to five chicks fledge in years with high rainfall. The number of stork pairs that succeed in raising chicks, and the average size of fledged broods, are related to monsoonal and post-monsoon rainfall, improving in years with higher rainfall.|$|E

500|$|Sides of {{the part}} that appear {{parallel}} with the direction of draw (the axis of the cored position (hole) or insert {{is parallel to the}} up and <b>down</b> <b>movement</b> of the mould as it opens and closes) are typically angled slightly, called draft, to ease release {{of the part}} from the mould. [...] Insufficient draft can cause deformation or damage. The draft required for mould release is primarily dependent on the depth of the cavity; the deeper the cavity, the more draft necessary. Shrinkage must also be taken into account when determining the draft required. If the skin is too thin, then the moulded part will tend to shrink onto the cores that form while cooling and cling to those cores, or the part may warp, twist, blister or crack when the cavity is pulled away.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-300 {{registered}} VH-QPA, travelling from Singapore Changi Airport to Perth, Western Australia as Qantas Flight 72, {{suffered a}} rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded pitch down manoeuvres causing serious injuries while [...] from Learmonth. The aircraft safely landed in Learmonth, with 14 people requiring transportation by air ambulance to Perth. Another 30 people also required hospital treatment, while an additional 30 people had injuries not requiring hospital treatment. Initial investigations identified an {{inertial reference system}} fault in the Number-1 Air Data Inertial Reference Unit as the likely origin of the event.

Conversely, in a slovenly setting {{the tendency is}} for the page to appear as a grey and muddled pattern of isolated spats, this effect being caused by the over-widely separated words. The normal, easy, left-to-right movement of the eye is slowed down simply because of this separation; further, the short letters and serifs are unable to discharge an important function – that of keeping the eye on [...] "the line". The eye also tends to be confused by a feeling of vertical emphasis, that is, an up & <b>down</b> <b>movement,</b> induced by the relative isolation of the words & consequent insistence of the ascending and descending letters. This movement is further emphasized by those [...] "rivers" [...] of white which are the inseparable & ugly accompaniment of all carelessly set text matter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{subject of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of the housing system on quality of welfare of dairy cattle in Serbia. Study was realized on six farms, capacity of 30 to 900 cows, with loose and tie housing system. Assessment of the welfare quality parameters was done by using the Welfare Quality ® Assessment Protocol for Cattle, 2009. Results of the research show that the welfare quality of dairy animals is under the significant effect of housing system, and that loose system has the advantage when it comes to comfort around resting, easy of movements and health condition of cows. Share of not lame cows (81 %) and cows with no lesion (86 %) was significantly higher (p< 0. 01) in loose system. Indicator values: duration of lying <b>down</b> <b>movements</b> (6. 53 sec), lying <b>down</b> <b>movements</b> with collisions (18. 7 %) and lying outside lying area (28. 4 %) in tie system were significantly higher (p< 0. 01) compared to loose system indicating the inadequacy of the housing and lack of comfort. Analysis of indicators associated with cow hygiene (dirty legs and udder) and diseases (dystocia) points to significant gaps in management in both housing systems which represent significant threat to cow welfare quality...|$|R
