5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>help.</b> There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

2500|$|The site, [...] {{north of}} Don Mueang International Airport, was {{originally}} called [...] "Sun Phutthachak-patipattham" [...] (...) [...] At the time Patum Thani was well outside Bangkok's northern suburbs. From acidic paddy fields, a woodland {{was created to}} be a park for meditation practitioners. The initial budget for construction was very low (3,200 Baht), but despite these economical constraints, {{the construction of the}} buildings on the land was able to continue. A book about the initiative was compiled, to inspire people to join <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>help.</b> In the accounts of the temple, it is told that the construction happened with great attention for detail. For example, the outside of the wall of the Ubosot was made of gravel that was selected manually. Because the land at first was very acid, only wattle could be planted. Later on, the soil improved. Though originally the intention was simply to build a center—as a satellite meditation center of Wat Paknam—eventually, this was changed to building a full-fledged temple, under pressure of authorities. The foundation stone for the Ubosot was laid by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on behalf of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in December 1977. The following year it was officially recognized as a temple by the Thai government, as [...] "Wat Voranee Dhammakayaram", named after the daughter of Khunying Prayat, Voranee.
