40|$|Physical {{design for}} {{testability}} (PDFT) is a strategy to design circuits {{in a way to}} avoid or reduce realistic physical <b>faults.</b> <b>The</b> goal of this work is to define and establish a specific methodology for PDFT. The proposed design methodology includes techniques to reduce potential bridging faults in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. To compare <b>faults,</b> <b>the</b> design process utilizes a new parameter called <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> index. <b>The</b> <b>fault</b> index for a particular <b>fault</b> is <b>the</b> probability of occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> divided by <b>the</b> testability of <b>the</b> <b>fault.</b> <b>Faults</b> with <b>the</b> highest <b>fault</b> indices are considered <b>the</b> worst <b>faults</b> and are targeted by the PDFT design process to eliminate them or reduce their probability of occurrence. An implementation of the PDFT design process is constructed using several new tools in addition to other “off-the-shelf ” tools. The first tool developed in this work is a testability measure tool for bridging faults. Two other tools are developed to eliminate or reduce the probability of occurrence of bridging faults with high <b>fault</b> indices. <b>The</b> row enhancer targets <b>faults</b> inside <b>the</b> logic elements of the circuit, while the channel enhancer targets <b>faults</b> inside <b>the</b> routing part of the circuit.

Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto <b>Fault,</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of the San Andreas Fault during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnitude}} 6.3 ML earthquake occurred inland on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST, (02:20 UTC) at {{a shallow}} depth of 6.0km (4mi), about 10km (6mi) to the east-southeast of Christchurch, New Zealand. Owing to {{the interaction of}} the major Pacific and Australia Plates, much of the regional plate boundary along central South Island is characterised by land deformation. The earthquake was a direct result of strike-slip faulting at the eastern end of the rupture zone of another strong magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake, which occurred on 22 February 2011 along the Port Hills <b>Fault.</b> <b>The</b> June earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor with a similar focal mechanism that struck 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. Experts believe the quakes were triggered by a previously undiscovered fault in the region, located several kilometres south of the Port Hills <b>Fault.</b> <b>The</b> United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a focal depth of 9km (5.6mi) for the earthquake, while the precursor tremor was assigned a magnitude of 5.2 Mw at a similar depth.|$|E

The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
