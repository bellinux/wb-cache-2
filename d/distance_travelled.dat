40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> is a {{critical}} component of American life, generating immense impacts on a variety of aspects of the society. In 1995, American households took about 656 million long distance domestic trips (100 + miles, one way), which totaled 1 billion person trips. Compared to the well-studied intra-urban <b>travel,</b> long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> needs further in-depth analysis and modeling efforts, for which the long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> data serve as a substantial basis. While MPOs periodically collect both supply and demand data to support the development of regional models, supply-side data reflecting transportation service and costs at corridor, interregional, and national level are scarce. To merge the gap, {{there is a need to}} establish a national data framework, with available datasets integrated to support implementing quantitative methods on a national highway network to resolve network loading issues for long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> This research intends to address this imperative. The research scope embraces the long <b>distance</b> passenger <b>travel</b> on national highways within the contiguous United States. The framework developed comprises not only a data warehouse where a plethora of datasets reside and interact, but also a complete modeling methodology to infer network loading conditions of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> Applying the national data framework approach, this research answers a pivotal question: how can we gain knowledge and insights of distributive patterns of long <b>distance</b> passenger <b>travel</b> at interregional level given existing data resources? This research elaborates the methodologies for the framework design and addresses the technical and theoretical challenges particularly in issues of travel impedance estimation and long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> network loading. Findings from this research lay a solid foundation for building the fundamental theoretical framework urgently needed for long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> studies and contribute significantly to the understanding of the supply side of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel,</b> from available infrastructure capacity and networks loading conditions to the induced environment challenges, infrastructure congestion, and investment costs, as well as facilitating policy making and evaluation pertain to long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> at national level...|$|R
50|$|Long <b>Distance</b> <b>Travel</b> - In 2010 the ITC {{published}} {{the results of}} a three-year project developing a model to forecast long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> demand in Britain. The study indicated that economic growth remained the single biggest factor affecting long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> demand in Britain, and noted that in the absence of major policy measures the demand for air travel would accelerate. The findings have recently been seized by the opposition to High Speed 2 to show that passenger growth arising from High Speed Rail could be limited.|$|R

5|$|Supporters of Newcastle United {{are drawn}} {{from all over the}} North East and beyond, with supporters' clubs in some {{countries}} across the world. The club's nickname is 'The Magpies', while the club's supporters are also known as the Geordies or the Toon Army. The name Toon originates from the Geordie pronunciation of town. In a 2004 survey by Co-operative Financial Services, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league table for the cost incurred and <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by Newcastle-based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The total <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip. In the 2009–10 season, when the club were playing in English football's second tier, the Football League Championship, the average attendance at St James' Park was 43,388, the fourth-highest for an English club that season. At the end of the 2011–12 Premier league season, Newcastle United held the third-highest average attendance for the season, at 49,935. This figure was only surpassed by Arsenal and Manchester United, the only two clubs in the Premier League with larger stadiums.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E
5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E
40|$|The Ohio Statewide Travel Demand Model is a {{state-of-the-art}} economic, {{land use and}} transport model. The person transport component of this model is a tour-based, micro-simulation model of {{the entire population of}} the State of Ohio. A special feature of the person transport models is the inclusion of a long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model designed to capture the unique behavior associated with individual’s trips longer than 50 miles. This paper will focus on the calibration and application of the long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model. The Ohio long <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model includes six primary components: binary choice of travel, pattern choice, scheduling, internal-external choice, destination choice, and mode choice. In application, each of these choices is simulated for the same synthetic population used by the short <b>distance</b> <b>travel</b> model. Both short and long distance trips are assigned to the same networks, competing for transportation capacity. Previous work (1) described the design and estimation of the long distance model in further detail. This paper will describe the calibration of each of the long distance model. It compares the model’s performance to observed data, primarily from the 2002 - 2003 Ohio Long <b>Distance</b> <b>Travel</b> Survey. It includes discussion of changes to model parameters and model structure made as part of the calibration process. This paper seeks to provide several benefits to future practitioners. First, by reporting the model calibration targets it illustrates the magnitude and characteristics of long <b>distance</b> <b>travel.</b> This information is not as readily available as information about short <b>distance</b> <b>travel,</b> and provides context to those considering which model components to prioritize when investing limited resources. Second, the paper compares the performance of an innovative new approach to modeling long <b>distance</b> <b>travel,</b> allowing future model developers to build upon the work with full knowledge of their starting point...|$|R

5|$|The A3 is a {{partially}} tolled motorway {{based on the}} vehicle classification in Croatia. The westernmost section of the motorway, spanning the Bobovica interchange and the Bregana border crossing, is tolled at Bregana toll plaza using an open toll collection system; the motorway sections east of Ivanja Reka interchange are tolled using a closed toll collection system, integrated with the A5 motorway as the two connect at the Sredanci interchange, forming a unified toll collection system. As of October 2010, Bregana toll plaza charges 5.00kuna (0.68euro) to passenger cars and 20.00kuna (2.74euro) to semi-trailer trucks. The toll charged along the A3 route between Ivanja Reka and Lipovac varies depending on the <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> and ranges from 3.00kuna (0.41euro) to 105.00kuna (14.38euro) for passenger cars and 10.00kuna (1.37euro) to 350.00kuna (47.95euro) for semi-trailer trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit cards, debit cards {{and a number of}} prepaid toll collection systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENCan electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is shared at most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{factors such}} as time spent outside and <b>distance</b> <b>travelled</b> by workers has been {{correlated}} to colony size. Workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less time outside, whereas those in larger colonies spend more time outside and at greater distances from their nest. Such results have also {{been seen in the}} western honey bee (Apis mellifera), but, unlike the honey bees, workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads. The decreased foraging time may reduce the risk of predation and save energy; for example, the limited energy in R.aurata is a result of time spent looking for food sources, rather than the collection of food items. The shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic. Group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources. As these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates, the chance of a worker encountering others is improved by marking the ground with trail pheromones. This behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates. Marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items, which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise the encounter rate with nestmates. However, when workers are transporting small to large crickets, marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower the retrieval time for other ants. Workers can quickly readjust their foraging activity in accordance with food quality.|$|E
