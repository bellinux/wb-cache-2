5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

I rail against the idea that pop television is a political medium. I am political in my life. But I am making serialized melodrama. I'm not a cultural missionary.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. The quartet did not receive the customary congratulations from Fraser, who initially resisted complaints the next day from the media and government members at his failure to applaud the Australian victory. In a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram indirectly, through the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to shun the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the Olympic Village fence. Fraser's telegram said: [...] "You know I did not and do not approve of Australia being represented at these Olympic Games. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say however that your performance in the relay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations." [...] The swimmers tore up the message.|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. Oh, I daresay it's vulgar; {{but theres}} no other word for it. I'm {{fed up with}} nice things: with respectability, with propriety! When a woman has nothing to do, money and respectability mean that nothing is ever allowed to happen <b>to</b> her. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be good; and <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be bad: <b>I</b> just <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be bothered about either good or bad: I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be an active verb.|$|R

2500|$|Wall's {{approach}} to business has sometimes caused conflict. He reportedly admitted, [...] "I {{have been a}} bit impulsive at times and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be more respectful of my fellow man". On occasion, he has been impulsively generous. According to an anecdote reported in The Vancouver Sun, in 2002 he gave a [...] Rolls Royce convertible to a friend to save him from having to walk to a meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{talk to you about}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Today, a senior member of Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing at a time when the United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E

2500|$|A November 8, 2004, cartoon {{depicted}} {{mentally disabled}} children as classroom teachers {{in an attempt}} to make an analogy to American voters who reelected Bush, drawing complaints from advocates for the disabled and led to his cartoons being dropped from The Washington Posts website. Rall responded in his blog saying: [...] "I regret hurting people who I have nothing against. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, and I think I failed in that with this cartoon. Not to mention that the cartoon failed—too many people got bogged down in the analogy and the main point got lost." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} that Steven Moffat would leave the show in December 2017 and be replaced by new showrunner Chris Chibnall, this decision led to speculation over whether Capaldi would remain in the role or leave alongside Moffat. A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This could be my final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I knew that when I started. I was thinking about my regeneration scene from the outset, that’s my terrible melancholic nature, when you accept the job you know there’ll come a day, inevitably, when you’ll be saying goodbye.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first thing that came to my mind, as a father of two little boys, was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is the key here, that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway {{are going to be in}} there. Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E
