5000|$|The {{purpose of}} heat {{treating}} carbon steel {{is to change}} the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young's modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) to precipitate leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature (about 727°C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A <b>eutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Eutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> {{present a}} wide range of {{interesting}} mechanical properties (high strength, wear resistance, ductility and toughness) and could be a cheaper alternative to high strength low-alloyed steels (HSLA) in applications where weldability is not a critical requirement. The mechanical properties of pearlite are mainly dictated by the interlamellar spacing and the spheroidization of cementite. In this work, the spheroidization kinetics during annealing of a fully pearlitic steel produced in an electric arc furnace (EAF) is investigated. More specifically, the influence of a prior cold deformation and of the interlamellar spacing is studied using image analysis and hardness tests. It is shown that spheroidization is faster in fine pearlite than in coarse pearlite. Prior cold deformation strongly accelerates the spheroidization kinetics in fine and coarse pearlite.

Simulations of growth of pearlite colonies based on this model reveal that for the volume carbon diffusion mechanism usually-supposed such growth is always unstable, and the steady-state growth can be realized only via the interfacial carbon diffusion mechanism. A model of formation of pearlite colonies based on the assumption of a strong enhancement of carbon diffusion near grain boundaries is also suggested. The model can be applicable to the plastically deformed steels, and the results of simulations based on this model qualitatively agree with some microstructural features of formation of pearlite colonies observed in such steels.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Progressive {{cold drawing}} in <b>eutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> {{produces}} a preferential {{orientation of the}} pearlitic micorstructure in the wire axis or drawing direction. This affects the posterior behaviour of the steels under environmentally assisted cracking (EAC) conditions. The experimental results show that cold drawing induces strength anisotropy in the steel, and thus the resistance to EAC is a directional property {{that depends on the}} angle in relation to the drawing direction. Therefore, an initial transverse crack changes its propagation direction to approach that of the wire axis, thus producing mixed mode propagation, the deflection angle being an increasing function of the cold drawing degree. This experimental result may be explained by micro-mechanical considerations {{on the basis of the}} lamellar microstructure of the steels. A relationship is established between the microstructural angles and the deflection angles of the macroscopic crack in EAC, thus providing a materials science type relationship between the microstructure and the macroscopic crack paths...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue tests}} were {{conducted}} for cold-drawn <b>eutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> having different activation energies and microstructures to investigate the mechanism of fatigue strength degradation by irreversible hydrogen. The fatigue strength of a sample with low activation energy was decreased by irreversible hydrogen, whereas the fatigue strength of a sample with high activation energy was not. When the activation energy for irreversible hydrogen becomes small, the desorption of irreversible hydrogen from its trap site is easily induced by cyclic loading, which results in a decrease in fatigue strength. When a sample having high activation energy was annealed at 473 K, the fatigue strength was decreased by irreversible hydrogen although the activation energy barely changed. This is because the precipitation of fine carbides due to annealing causes higher sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement. High sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement was concluded to induce the fatigue strength degradation by irreversible hydrogen. Therefore, the degradation of fatigue strength by irreversible hydrogen depends on the activation energy and sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement...|$|R
