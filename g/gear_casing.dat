40|$|Hydraulic {{machines}} {{are faced with}} increasingly severe performance requirements. The need to design smaller and more powerful machines rotating at higher speeds {{in order to provide}} increasing efficiencies, has to face a major limitation: cavitation. A two-dimensional numerical approach, by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), has been developed for studying the effect of cavitation in the volumetric efficiency of external gear pumps. Several cavitation models and grid deformation algorithms have been studied, and a method for simulating the contact between solid boundaries has been developed. The velocity field in the inlet chamber has also been experimentally measured by means of Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TRPIV) and results have been compared to the numerical ones in order to validate the accuracy of the model. Our two-dimensional model is not able to predict the real volumetric efficiency of the pump, since several simplifications are involved in it. Nevertheless, this model shows to be valid to understand the complex flow patterns that take place inside the pump and to study the influence of cavitation on volumetric efficiency. The influence of the rotational speed of the pump has been analyzed, as well as the effect of the geometry of the inlet chamber, the working pressure, the inlet pressure loss factor, and the flow leakage through the radial clearances of the pump between <b>gears</b> and <b>casing.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} analysis of an external gear pump with cavitation effects has been validated with experimental {{data obtained by}} applying Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. The effect of inlet and outlet pressure on volumetric efficiency has been studied numerically. First, the Particle Image Velocimetry method was {{used to analyze the}} two-dimensional velocity field in the middle plane of the suction chamber of the gear pump. The main improvement, with respect to previous similar analysis is the use of alginate micro particles as tracers. It is seen that the two-dimensional model is able to characterize the flow field of the real pump in the region of the inlet chamber in which cavitation is expected. In a previous study, it was seen that a cavitation cloud acted as a virtual contact point at low pressure, being responsible for an increase on the volumetric efficiency. The first set of simulations represents the pump working with high outlet pressure. Now, the cavitation cloud is not present and cavitation no longer helps to improve the efficiency of the pump. The second set of simulations represents the pump with an inlet loss factor, which implies a mean inlet pressure below atmospheric conditions. This allows cavitation clouds to propagate upstream. Despite the larger cavitation clouds, volumetric efficiency only drops at high operating velocities, when some clouds become trapped between <b>gears</b> and <b>casing</b> and are transported to the pressure side.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} external gear pumps for automotive applications, which operate at high speed and low pressure. In previous works of the authors, a hybrid lumped-parameter/finite-element model has been developed, in order to foresee the pump dynamic behaviour in terms of <b>gear</b> and <b>casing</b> acceleration. The model includes the main important phenomena involved in the pump operation {{and it has been}} validated on the basis of experimental data. In this research, an original optimization process has been applied to such a hybrid model {{in order to reduce the}} pump vibration level, i. e. the acceleration of the external casing. The set up of the optimization process comprises a single objective (case accelerations) and some operational and geometrical input variables (oil viscosity, oil Bulk modulus, relief groove dimension and radial clearance in the journal bearings). This paper compares three optimization methodologies for the optimization of the pump vibration level. In particular common optimization processes based on simulations are compared with a combined analysis based, firstly, on Design Of Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Modelling (RSM) and, secondly, on the application of evolutionary algorithms to reach the optimal variable combination. The different methodologies are compared in terms of time efficiency and accuracy in the solution. Finally, a robust design process has been carried out in order to consider the manufacturing tolerances of the real pump and assess their effect on the performance of the component. The results offer important information and design insights that would be very difficult to obtain without such procedures...|$|R
