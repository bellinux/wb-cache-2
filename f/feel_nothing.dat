25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I <b>feel</b> <b>nothing</b> but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about Mars professing [...] "his love for a {{beautiful}} girl who occupies his dreams". Megan Vick for Billboard carries on with her explanation [...] "Mars professes his love..."When you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while/ 'Cause girl you're amazing, {{just the way you}} are". She concludes, [...] "Mars' lyrics aim to make female listeners <b>feel</b> <b>nothing</b> short of perfect in their own skin". Tim Byron of The Vine said {{the song is}} [...] "effective – the repeated lines {{at the start of the}} verses are catchy". Consequence of Sound's Kevin Barber described the song [...] "Mars sticks to the song’s name and insists that he wouldn’t want to change anything about his particular gal.You believe him, too. With an undeniably catchy chorus".|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} positive reviews by music critics. Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the song {{four out of}} five stars and described it as a [...] "huge-hearted urbany piano ballad" [...] and compared it to [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] by Alicia Keys with a similar sound as the Keys song. In her review for Billboard, Megan Vick wrote: [...] "Over a breezy piano and vaguely hip-hop breakbeat, Mars professes his love for a beautiful girl who occupies his dreams [...] Mars pens lyrics that aim to make female listeners <b>feel</b> <b>nothing</b> short of perfect in their own skin. With its steady, danceable pulse and singalong chorus, Mars has created a feel-good jam that should establish him as a solo contender in his own right." [...] Nima Baniamer from Contactmusic.com felt that [...] "there is nothing about the single that makes Bruno Mars stand out from all the other RnB artists dominating the charts at the moment", and said, [...] "The song never builds to any climax and it simply falls a bit flat, coming across quite corny and cheesy." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in which Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him {{is a sort of}} scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science. He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can <b>feel</b> <b>nothing</b> but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos {{became the}} focus of {{controversy}} over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about Blackwater USA employees who were killed and mutilated in Fallujah:"Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I <b>feel</b> <b>nothing</b> over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave {{men and women in uniform}} make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay. I was angry that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E
