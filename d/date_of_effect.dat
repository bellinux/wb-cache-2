40|$|There is {{a widely}} {{recognised}} national trend for girls to outperform boys {{at all levels of}} compulsory schooling. With few exceptions, however, most recent research has reported that, in relation to academic performance at university, men are proportionately over-represented at the First Class level. A number of general hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, including those that assume gender-linked differences in cognitive and/or personality traits. A smaller proportion of research has given explanatory primacy to the broad subject area studied. More specifically, it has been alleged that the over-representation of men within the First bracket is largely a function of a 'compositional effect' whereby men achieve proportionately more Firsts as there are more of them within the First-rich Sciences.

40|$|We re-evaluate the non-perturbative {{contribution}} to the thrust distribution in e^+e^-→ hadrons, {{in the light of}} the latest experimental data and the recent NNLO perturbative calculation of this quantity. By extending the calculation to NNLO+NLL accuracy, we perform the most detailed study to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> non-perturbative physics on this observable. In particular, we investigate how well a model based on a low-scale QCD effective coupling can account for such effects. We find that the difference between the improved perturbative distribution and the experimental data is consistent with a 1 /Q-dependent non-perturbative shift in the distribution, as predicted by the effective coupling model. Best fit values of α_s(M_Z) = 0. 1164 ^+ 0. 0028 _- 0. 0026 and α_ 0 (2 GeV) = 0. 59 +/- 0. 03 are obtained with χ^ 2 /d. o. f. = 1. 09.

40|$|There {{have been}} many reports to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> {{seemingly}} small, non-linear, autoparametric interactions in certain structures undergoing forced vibration, and {{it is known that}} large intermodal exchanges of energy can occur under several prescribed internal resonance conditions. This paper purports to illustrate the highly complex responses that can be generated within a system of coupled cantilever beams when two such internal resonances, each {{in the form of a}} combination resonance, exist in very close proximity to each other. The resulting four mode interaction can exhibit non-synchronous large amplitude responses of the indirectly excited modes, in addition to the well known phenomenon of saturation of the directly excited mode, and the stationary system responses are also shown to be highly susceptible to very small shifts in system tuning. Thus it is proposed that the non-linear response of the system can be dependent on the dominance, or otherwise, of one of the internally generated combination resonances over its near neighbour. A four degree of freedom model is proposed and a multiple scales treatment of the governing equations is presented. A selection of experimental results are presented which highlight the above phenomen...|$|R
50|$|Millimeter {{wavelength}} {{radiation is}} {{a subset of}} the microwave radio frequency spectrum. Even at its high-energy end, it is still more than 3 orders of magnitude lower in energy than its nearest radiotoxic neighbour (ultraviolet) in the electromagnetic spectrum. As such, millimeter wave radiation is non-ionizing and incapable of causing cancers by radiolytic DNA bond cleavage. Yet, the WHO (World Health Organization) IARC (International Agency for Research in Cancer) in 2011 classified non-ionizing radiation such as millimeter waves or microwaves, as 2B, which means possibly carcinogenic to humans. Due to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves into tissue (typically less than 1 mm), acute biological <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> irradiation are localized in epidermal and dermal layers and manifest primarily as thermal effects. There is no clear evidence to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> harmful <b>effects</b> other than those caused by localised heating and ensuing chemical changes (expression of heat shock proteins, denaturation, proteolysis, and inflammatory response, see also mobile phone radiation and health).

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders. It is hypothesized that deficits in the development of structural and functional connectivity underlie the psychopathology in ASD and ADHD. Further, interest in non-pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders has been increasing. One particular alternative that is currently being investigated is supplementation with omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA’s). Using various neuroimaging methods, the studies in part I of this thesis tried to unravel the characteristics of the (dis) connected brain from multiple perspectives in both ASD and ADHD. In part II we explored the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> omega- 3 fatty acids on human brain development, and whether dietary supplementation with omega- 3 fatty acids proves to be a suitable (augmentation to) therapy for ADHD by means of a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial. We showed ASD is characterized by a heterogeneous pattern of changes in functional connectivity during task and rest. Further, we found with age-related differences in structural connectivity of the Forceps Minor that were related to the pattern of prefrontal gyrification in ASD. Taken together, these findings, combined with current literature, suggest that the complex pattern of increases and decreases in brain connectivity is not sufficiently captured by the current neurobiological models of ASD. This emphasizes the need for the development of more refined neurobiological models that better describe the relation between the symptoms of ASD and the underlying neurobiology. In ADHD, the increased connectivity in prefrontal resting-state networks is in keeping with a pattern of delayed network development, but these differences were present without changes in structural connectivity. Here, longitudinal studies are needed to validate whether these findings indeed fit with the hypothesized developmental delay and to elucidate how the developmental pathways of structural and functional connectivity interact. The studies in part II showed that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> omega- 3 PUFA’s varies throughout the lifespan. During gestation and early development, omega- 3 PUFAs may optimize conditions for adequate development of brain connectivity, whereas during aging omega- 3 PUFAs primarily seem to have a neuroprotective effect. Further, there is some evidence to suggest that deficits in the prenatal accrual of omega- 3 PUFAs may give rise to various psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression or ADHD. However, there is no consistent evidence to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> omega- 3 PUFAs on neurobiology of such disorders. Specifically, our study showed that symptoms of inattention were reduced in children receiving a high dose of omega- 3 PUFAs as compared to children receiving placebo. The severity of inattention problems was also related to omega- 3 PUFA status as measured in cheek-cell phospholipids. However, no treatment effects were observed on cognitive control, or brain activation. As dopaminergic turnover measured in urine {{did not seem to be}} affected either, we took these findings to suggest that the neural mechanism underlying the improvements in attention did not involve dopaminergic cognitive control networks. Nevertheless, these findings do suggest that supplementation with omega- 3 PUFAs may be an effective augmentation of pharmacological treatments of ADHD...|$|R
