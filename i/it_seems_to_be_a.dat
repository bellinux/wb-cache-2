5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to {{the presence or absence}} of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} African {{frilled shark}} (Chlamydoselachus africana) is {{a species of}} shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae, described in 2009. It {{is found in the}} deep waters off southern Angola to southern Namibia. This species is difficult to distinguish from the better-known frilled shark (C. anguineus), but is smaller at maturity and differs in several proportional measurements including head length and mouth width. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> specialized predator of smaller sharks, using its flexible jaws and numerous needle-like, recurved teeth to capture and swallow them whole. Reproduction is presumably ovoviviparous, as with the other member of its family.|$|E

25|$|After AD 596, {{documentary}} {{sources that}} Bede {{took pains to}} obtain throughout England and from Rome are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed along with critical consideration of its authenticity. This is impressive; nevertheless, the Historia, like other historical writing from this period has a lower degree of objectivity than modern historical writings. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mixture of fact, legend and literature. For example, Bede quotes at length some speeches by {{people who were not}} his contemporaries and whose speeches do not appear in any other surviving source; it is doubtful whether oral traditional history supported these ostensible quotations.|$|E
500|$|The {{speakers}} of Nahuatl themselves often refer to their language as either Mexicano or some word derived from mācēhualli, the Nahuatl word for [...] "commoner". One {{example of the}} latter {{is the case for}} Nahuatl spoken in Tetelcingo, whose speakers call their language mösiehuali. The Pipil people of El Salvador do not call their own language [...] "Pipil", as most linguists do, but rather nawat. The Nahuas of Durango call their language Mexicanero. Speakers of Nahuatl of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec call their language mela'tajtol ("the straight language"). Some speech communities use [...] "Nahuatl" [...] as the name for their language although <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> recent innovation. Linguists commonly identify localized dialects of Nahuatl by adding as a qualifier the name of the village or area where that variety is spoken.|$|E

Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet".

In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show's adult audience: [...] " [...] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [...] On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the frames." [...] In a 2007 interview, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite TV character and admitted that SpongeBob SquarePants is [...] "the show I watch with my daughters". British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also said he watches the series with his children.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, many LGBT {{people in}} the West, {{particularly}} those in major metropolitan areas, have developed a so-called gay culture. To many, gay culture is exemplified by the gay pride movement, with annual parades and displays of rainbow flags. Yet not all LGBT people choose to participate in [...] "queer culture", and many gay men and women specifically decline to do so. To some <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> frivolous display, perpetuating gay stereotypes.

2500|$|At times, heavenly interlocutors {{will reveal}} divine secrets. In some texts, the mystic’s {{interest}} {{extends to the}} heavenly music and liturgy, usually connected with the angelic adorations mentioned in Isaiah 6:3. The mantra-like repetitive nature of the liturgies recorded {{in many of these}} compositions seems meant to encourage further ascent. The ultimate goal of the ascent varies from text to text. In some cases, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> visionary glimpse of God, to [...] "Behold the King in His Beauty." [...] Others hint at [...] "enthronement," [...] that the adept be accepted among the angelic retinue of God and be given an honored seat. One text actually envisions the successful pilgrim getting to sit in God's [...] "lap." [...] Scholars such as Peter Schaefer and Elliot Wolfson see an erotic theology implied in this kind of image, though it must be said sexual motifs, while present in highly attenuated forms, {{are few and far between}} if one surveys the full scope of the literature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} in Rylands initially faced little criticism within England and Wales, although many American scholars and judges {{of the time}} felt that judgment was a poor one. Doe CJ of the New Hampshire Supreme Court wrote that it [...] "put a clog upon natural and reasonably necessary uses of matter and tend to embarrass and obstruct {{much of the work}} which <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> man's duty carefully to do". The American interpretation was based primarily on the idea that it would cause economic harm. Further American criticism is {{based on the idea that}} it is poor law. Firstly, they argue, it is not trespass, since the damage is not direct, and secondly, it is not a nuisance, because there is no continuous action. Glofcheski, writing in the Hong Kong Law Journal, notes that [...] "the doctrine has not flourished... a tort imposing strict liability should be closely interpreted and circumspectly applied". It has been argued that the decision was never entirely accepted by the judiciary as a whole, and that it is difficult to justify. This is for two reasons; firstly, it is a case of very limited applicability, and it has been suggested that it be folded into a general principle of strict liability for [...] "ultra-hazardous" [...] activities. Secondly, subsequent case law in England and Wales, particularly in Rickards v Lothian, has undermined the [...] "non-natural use" [...] element by introducing a cost/benefit analysis which severely limits the decision's usefulness.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} with Nathan-Turner's attitude that the sonic screwdriver {{should not be}} used as a cure-all, the new production team gave it even more functionality than previous versions which has given the series some criticism as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> deus ex machina, a literary device that is generally avoided. Some of the uses in the new series include: repairing electronic equipment; re-attaching materials such as barbed wire; detecting, intercepting and sending signals; remotely operating the TARDIS; burning, cutting, or igniting substances; fusing metal; scanning and identifying substances; amplifying or augmenting sound; modifying mobile phones to enable [...] "universal roaming”; disabling alien disguises; resonating concrete; reversing teleportation of another entity. It is sometimes used to disassemble robotic enemies or turn other objects into weapons; healing cuts and wounds. In [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] and [...] "Utopia" [...] it is used to operate the TARDIS controls remotely; when the Doctor attempts to counteract the Master's theft of the TARDIS, it is used to limit the TARDIS' destination. In [...] "Doomsday", the Doctor states that the sonic screwdriver does not kill, wound or maim; however, it is sometimes brandished in a threatening manner, such as in [...] "The Christmas Invasion", [...] "The Impossible Planet", [...] "The Runaway Bride", [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] and [...] "The Infinite Quest". In [...] "World War Three", when confronted by a group of Slitheen, the Doctor threatens to [...] "triplicate the flammability" [...] of a bottle of port wine with the sonic screwdriver, though one of the Slitheen realises he is bluffing. In [...] "Closing Time", ringed energy beams are seen emitted from the device, giving it a more weapon-like appearance, particularly when used to disable a weakened Cyberman at a distance.|$|E
2500|$|Pica is the {{ingestion}} of non-nutritive substances and {{has so far}} been poorly documented. In non-human animals in the laboratory it has been examined through the {{ingestion of}} kaolin (a clay mineral) by rats. Rats were induced to intake kaolin by administering various emetic stimuli such as copper sulfate, apomorphine, cisplatin, and motion. Rats are unable to vomit when they ingest a substance that is harmful thus pica in rats is analogous to vomiting in other species; it is a way for rats to relieve digestive distress. [...] In some animals pica seems to be an adaptive trait but in others <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true psychopathology like in the case of some chickens. Chickens can display a type of pica when they are feed-deprived (feeding restriction has been adopted by the egg industry to induce molting). [...] They increase their non-nutritive pecking, such as pecking structural features of their environment like wood or wire on fences or the feathers of other birds. It is a typical response that occurs when feeding is restricted or is completely withdrawn. Some of the non-nutritive pecking may be due to a redirection of foraging related behavior. [...] Another animal that has displayed a more complex pica example are cattle. Cattle eat bones when they have a phosphorus deficiency. However, in some cases they persist on eating bones even after their phosphorus levels have stabilized and they are getting adequate doses of phosphorus in their diet. In this case evidence supports both a physical and psychological adaptive response. Cattle that continue to eat bones after their phosphorus levels are adequate do it because of a psychological reinforcer. [...] "The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult." ...|$|E
