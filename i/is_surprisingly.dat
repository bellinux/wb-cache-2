5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some panoramic views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as the bustling village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> {{favourable}} to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.|$|E

25|$|When {{considering}} {{representations of}} an associative algebra, one can forget the underlying field, and simply regard the associative algebra as a ring, and its representations as modules.

25|$|Service {{quality for}} {{water supply and}} {{sanitation}} has many dimensions. For example, service quality for water supply can be measured through the continuity of supply, which is generally low in Yemen, and customer satisfaction, which <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> high.

25|$|The {{number of}} named species of {{bacteria}} and archaea (approximately 13,000) <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems. The {{reason for this}} is the differences in species concepts between the bacteria and macro-organisms, the difficulties in growing/characterising in pure culture (a prerequisite to naming new species, vide supra) and extensive horizontal gene transfer blurring the distinction of species.|$|E

One small study in the UK demonstrated that most children who had their tonsils removed did not meet these criteria, meaning that most children operated on did not really benefit from the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, as a {{consequence}} of its considerable economic prosperity, the Basque Country has received an increasing number of immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and China, settling mostly in the major urban areas. Nevertheless, foreign immigrant population <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> lower in the Basque country than in Madrid and Catalonia, despite having similar GDP per capita and significantly lower levels of unemployment.|$|E
25|$|T. attritum is 2.2mm long. It has a {{yellowish}} carapace with a {{black line}} all around. The sternum is yellow-orange with gray pigment, the legs are yellow with darker marks. The top of the abdomen is whitish with a median darker longitudinal band, irregular in outline and bordered on each side by a white band. The venter is black with a white transverse pigment band. The species <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> similar to Theridion melanurum and Theridion varians, but much smaller.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} for the semimajor axis <b>is</b> <b>surprisingly</b> sharp for the prograde satellites. A satellite on a prograde, {{circular orbit}} (inclination=0°) placed at 0.5 rH would leave Jupiter {{in as little}} as forty years. The effect can be explained by so-called evection resonance. The apocenter of the satellite, where the planet’s grip on the moon is at its weakest, gets locked in resonance with the position of the Sun. The effects of the perturbation accumulate at each passage pushing the satellite even further outwards.|$|E

Entitled Léonce Perret, the biography was published by the French Association for Historical Film Studies in collaboration with the Bologne Film Library under the direction of Bernard Bastide and Jean A.
