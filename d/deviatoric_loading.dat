According to the study, {{the assumption that}} dilatancy angle stays constant is correct only for the dense soil. On the other hand, for the loose or medium density soil this assumption is unacceptable. For the loose and medium density sands, the calculation error in volumetric strain analysis may exceed 50 %. In order to assess the adequacy of soil behavior description in the calculations using the model of "Hardening Soil" numerical simulations were performed using Plaxis triaxial testing of soil.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results {{obtained}} from triaxial tests on Kansas outcrop chalk flooded with inert NaCl brine. Permeability measurements are conducted at 50 ºC under different stress states simulated by five test sequences of hydrostatic and deviatoric loadings. The loading behaviors like shear failure, dilatancy, compression of chalk and their influences on permeability evolution are studied and discussed in detail. The results show that permeability {{is strongly dependent on}} stress and strain. It generally decreases with increasing confining pressure by compressing the pore spaces. <b>Deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> performed prior to hydrostatic loading has minor effect on permeability. As the confining pressure continues to increase, permeabilities of all the tested samples tend to converge. Shear failure occurring in the <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> phase contributes to the enhancement of permeability in chalk with porosities ranging from 38 to 40 %. Single shear-band failure is exhibited with a symbol of the critical point where radial strain rate exceeds axial strain rate. This behavior is accompanied with an increase in permeability. Despite the profound influences of the loading phases, short-term creep and unloading cycles only have minor effects on permeability evolution. Experimental results from deviatoric loadings indicate that confining pressure has a great influence on permeability since chalks tend to be more brittle at lower confining pressure, thus resulting in greater increase in permeability when shear failure occurs. These experimental results can provide the fundamental approaches to establish the basic understanding of the stress states impact on permeability evolution and can be employed as a foundation and illustration for the future work...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the North Sea Tertiary section, {{wellbore}} instability {{problems are}} frequently reported in Palaeocene-Early Oligocene smectite-rich mudrocks. Analysis {{of the mechanical}} properties of these Tertiary mudrocks is generally hampered {{by the lack of}} suitable core material. This study represents an attempt to study the geomechanical behaviour of mudrocks by triaxial tests of side-wall cores obtained from the borehole wall. The tests performed include measuring the changes in pore pressure during shearing and undrained shear strength in specimens initially consolidated to in situ effective stress levels. The coefficients of permeability (kf), estimated from the consolidation time behaviour range from 2. 6 x 10 -n to 2. 4 x 10 - 12 m/s. The tested cores behaved like slightly overconsolidated to normally consolidated materials with an initial near constant volume (elastic behaviour) for low <b>deviatoric</b> <b>load</b> followed by an increasingly contractant behaviour approaching failure. Compared with results from onshore analogues, the strength properties of the investigated mudrocks appear to be related to their content of expandable clay minerals.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with diffuse and other ensuing failure modes in geomaterials when tested under homogeneous states of shearing in various loading programs and drainage conditions. Material instability is indeed the basic property that accounts for the instability of an initially homogeneous deformation field leading to diffuse failure and strain localization in geomaterials. The former is normally characterized by a runaway type of failure accompanied with a sudden and violent collapse of the material {{in the absence of}} any localization phenomena. Against this backdrop, we present a brief overview of material instability in elastoplastic solids where one finds a rich source of theoretical concepts including bifurcation, strain localization, diffuse failure and second-order work, as well as a considerable body of experiments. Some compelling laboratory experimental studies of material instability with focus to diffuse failure are then presented and interpreted based on the second-order work. Finally, various material instability analyses using an elastoplastic constitutive and a general finite element analysis of the above-mentioned laboratory experimental tests are presented as a boundary value problem. It is shown that instability can be captured from otherwise uniform stress, density and hydraulic states, whereas uniform <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loads</b> are being applied on the external boundaries of a specimen. Although the numerical simulations reproduce well the laboratory experimental results, they also highlight the hierarchy of failure modes where localization phenomena emerge in the post-bifurcation regime as a result of a degradation of homogeneity starting from a diffuse mode signalled by a zero second-order work...|$|R
40|$|We report {{simultaneous}} laboratory {{measurements of}} seismic velocities and fluid permeability on lava flow basalt from Etna (Italy). Results {{were obtained for}} dry and saturated samples deformed under triaxial compression. During each test, the effective pressure was first increased up to 190 MPa to investigate the effect of pre-existing crack closure on seismic properties. Then, the effective pressure was unloaded down to 20 MPa, a pressure which mirrors the stress field acting under a lava pile of approximately 1. 5 – 2 km thick, and deviatoric stress was increased until failure of the specimens. Using an effective medium model, the measured elastic wave velocities were inverted in terms of two crack densities: ρi the crack density of the pre-existing thermal cracks and ρv the crack density of the stress-induced cracks. In addition a link was established between elastic properties (elastic wave velocities Vp and Vs) and permeability using a statistical permeability model. Our {{results show that the}} velocities increase with increasing hydrostatic pressure up to 190 MPa, due to the closure of the pre-existing thermal cracks. This is interpreted by a decrease of the crack density ρi from ~ 1 to 0. 2. The effect of pre-existing cracks closure is also highlighted by the permeability evolution which decreases of more than two orders of magnitude. Under <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading,</b> the velocities signature is interpreted, in the first stage of the loading, by the closure of the pre-existing thermal cracks. However, with increasing <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> newly-formed vertical cracks nucleate and propagate. This is clearly seen from the velocity signature and its interpretation in term of crack density, from the location of the acoustic emission sources, and from microstructural observations. This competition between pre-existing cracks closure and propagation of vertical cracks is also seen from the permeability evolution, and our study shows that mechanically-induced cracks has lesser influence on permeability change than pre-existing thermal cracks...|$|E

For each sub-domain, a strain tensor is defined and a description of its structure is proposed. Our analysis, carried out on a biaxial compression test, reveals that strain is {{significantly related to the}} structure at the meso-scale: (1) strain in the major (respectively, minor) principal compression direction is largest within the sub-domains which are elongated in the minor (respectively, major) principal compression direction, and (2) contractancy takes place within the sub-domains which are elongated in the minor principal compression direction whereas dilatancy takes place within the sub-domains which are elongated in the major principal compression direction.

Part of the new harbour constructed {{at the edge of}} the International Airport of Nice collapsed into the sea. The main aim of this work was 1) to present a review of facts and details related to the 1979 accident and a review of the geological setting, and 2) to evaluate the slope stability before and after the new harbour construction, by taking into account new available data such as sediment cores and piezocone CPTU data. The CPTU data were of great value to understand the origin of the 1979 event. They show the existence of a sensitive clay bed between 30 mbsf and 45 mbsf. Under high <b>deviatoric</b> <b>load</b> a sensitive clay layer underwent an important creep, which dramatically decreased its resistance and caused the slope failure. This working hypothesis was supported by the good agreement between the maximum thickness of the failure surface and the depth of the sensitive clay layer. Slope stability assessment using the finite element model Femuslope show the metastable state of the Nice slope before the harbour extension. Numerical calculations demonstrated that creeping of the sensitive clay layer could be at the origin of the 1979 slide. In addition, the exceptionally heavy rainfall which occurred before the accident and consequently the seepage of fresh water probably induced the decrease of the effective stress and accelerated sediment creeping and triggered the Nice slope failure. A progressive and relatively long-term creeping failure scenario is in good agreement with the official report mentioning cracks, settlements, failures and embankment collapses occurred during land filling operations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{a class of}} granular materials characterized {{by the possibility of}} interlocking between the particles. The interlocking is modeled by its effect through rolling resistance depending on relative rotation and normal force at the contact points and involving a single parameter analogous to the sliding friction coefficient. The model, which is introduced in the framework of the contact dynamics, method, is applied to simulate the simple shear of a large granular sample. We present a detailed analysis regarding the influence of rolling and sliding friction parameters on the macroscopic response in terms of shear strength, fabric properties, and force transmission. Interestingly, two distinct regimes can be distinguished in which the steady-state shear strength is controlled by either rolling resistance or sliding friction. The relative contributions of rolling and sliding contacts to the shear strength are consistent with the same two regimes. Interlocking strongly affects the force network by enhancing the arching effect and thus increasing the relative importance of weak contact forces and torques, which is reflected in a decreasing power-law probability distribution of the contact forces and torques below the mean. Due to the combined effect of friction and interlocking, the force-carrying backbone takes an increasingly columnar aspect involving a low fraction of particles. Our data suggest that the nature of the weak contact network is strongly affected by the formation of these columns of particles which {{do not need to be}} propped laterally. In particular, in the limit of high rolling resistance and sliding friction, the role of the weak network of contacts is no longer to prop the force chains, but, like the strong contact network, to actively sustain the <b>deviatoric</b> <b>load</b> imposed on the system...|$|R

The inverse Laplace transforms are performed numerically to find the time-dependent distributions of field variables in the rock mass around the wellbore. These numerical results show that although the pore pressure diffusion has little influence on temperature and stress, temperature changes can strongly affect the pore pressure and stress around the wellbore.

40|$|AbstractThe {{inherent}} and stress-induced anisotropy {{of saturated}} Hostun sand has been examined {{by means of}} shear wave velocity measurements under drained monotonic and cyclic triaxial conditions. Tests were carried out on samples prepared by moist tamping {{for a wide range}} of initial densities in a fully instrumented stress-path triaxial apparatus equipped with bender element instrumentation in three directions. Data have been normalised to account for the variations in void ratio and mean effective stress. The evolution of shear stiffness under anisotropic stress conditions has been explored by performing both constant mean effective stress tests and constant radial stress tests in compression and extension. Some samples were subsequently subjected to multiple drained <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> cycles, and the evolution of shear stiffness was examined. The tests showed that the initial inherent anisotropy was small, namely, lower than that previously observed in dry pluviated samples of the same sand in a cubical cell apparatus. Changing stress levels in compression or extension resulted in stress-induced anisotropy even when there were no changes in the values for p′, indicating that the widely-used empirical expressions for G 0 under isotropic stress states are not strictly applicable under anisotropic stress conditions. The comparison between stress-induced anisotropy in compression and in extension is discussed, and the evolution of shear stiffness during drained cyclic loading is examined.

It is found that the initiation of instability is generally accompanied by the rotation of principal direction of fabric anisotropy if the loading direction does not coincide with the principal direction of fabric anisotropy which is characterized by normal contact unit.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{comprehensive}} program at URI that is investigating sediment deformation processes on submarine slopes. The work presented herein centers on developing a numerical capability for predicting the stress-strain-time behavior of fine-grained sediments {{that can be used to}} analyze deformation patterns observed on the continental margin. ^ A new finite element code (GEO-CP) is presented which uses a realistic characterization of marine materials, including creep and time-dependent hardening. The constitutive model chosen is that of Borja and Kavazanjian which incorporates the widely used creep equations of Taylor and Singh-Mitchell. The GEO-CP program was derived from the code CRISP, and includes a number of significant improvements. ^ The predictive capabilities of GEO-CP are examined in a unique long-term, drained, triaxial creep test conducted on an undisturbed sample of deep sea clay. In general, the predicted behavior during the early stages of deformation is dominated by the compressibility and drainage parameters, whereas the long-term behavior is most sensitive to the creep parameters. In the creep test used in this study, the model predicts the measured axial deformation very well. ^ The program is also used to examine the pore pressure response in the triaxial specimen following the application of isotropic and <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loads.</b> Results show that for the low permeability marine clay the Mandel-Cryer effect is pronounced and results in large pressure gradients and non-uniform stress distributions. The effect of creep on pore pressure dissipation is to delay the rate at which it proceeds. In addition to laboratory settings, the program is put through verification runs that show close agreement with exact solutions when available. Overall, significant confidence has been gained in the code to serve as a useful tool in modeling field slopes. ^ A discussion of the modeling approach for a particular cross-section of the continental slope south of New England centers on the various analysis options available.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{physical}} model tests were conducted with foundations placed on both unreinforced and reinforced sloped fills of different angles and subjected to repeated loading of different amplitudes and frequencies. Both small- and large-scale experiments were carried out under plane-strain conditions with a strip footing placed at a constant setback distance from the slope crest. Model sloped fills consisted of moist sand (at approximately the same moisture content) compacted in layers to a consistent density. Short vertical bars at different spacings, and horizontally placed geogrid and geocell were used as reinforcement. The influence of each test variable, such as soil-reinforcement, slope angle, repeated loading amplitude and frequency, on the behaviour characteristics e. g., foundation deformation and soil stress below it, was studied. Numerical simulations of foundations on sloped fills under both monotonic and repeated loading were conducted. Also, a low-cost, repeated-load model testing facility, which incurred almost no operational or maintenance costs, was designed and manufactured. The experimental study showed that a foundation on a sloped fill, subjected to <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> amplitude 2 / 3 rd of its static load, remained stable {{as long as the}} maximum total loading remained below 50 % of its ultimate bearing capacity. Under a particular repeated loading conditions, the permanent deformations of such a foundation (in both the vertical and slope directions) were found to increase exponentially with increases in the slope angle. On the other hand, for a particular slope angle, the permanent deformations increased with increases in both the amplitude and frequency values of the repeated loading. A similar variation was observed for both the resilient and total deformations as the loading amplitude and frequency changes. The use of different reinforcing elements within the sloped fill not only increased the slope stability but also improved the deformation behaviour of a foundation placed on top of it. Based on experimental results, an empirical equation was developed to predict the vertical permanent deformations of a foundation on a sloped fill for a range of slope angle, repeated loading amplitude and frequency, as the number of loading cycles increased. In a particular repeated-load testing, as the loading cycles progressed, the residual soil stresses at any depth below the foundation increased whereas the resilient soil stresses remained constant. The rate at which the residual soil stress increased depend on both soil depth and loading amplitude, i. e., soil close to foundation and subjected to higher repeated loading amplitude exhibited higher increment rate. Monotonic-load testing subsequent to repeated-load testing showed that both the stiffness and bearing capacity of a foundation increased significantly due to repeated load application. The monotonic load-displacement plots inferred that those foundations subjected to higher repeated loading amplitudes (within the shakedown limit load) exhibited stiffer responses in both the vertical and slope directions. On the other hand, the stiffness of a foundation which experienced higher-frequency repeated loading was found to be less compared with that under low-frequency repeated loading. Also, the soil stress corresponding to a particular monotonic foundation loading intensity at a particular depth was found to be greater for those foundations which experienced higher <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> amplitudes during previous repeated-load testing...|$|E

The laboratory tests involves gas permeability and porosity measurements coincident with hydrostatic and triaxial quasi-static, stress-rate controlled compression tests. The permeability and porosity of the as-received samples decrease significantly as a result of hydrostatic loading. These changes are largely irreversible, and are believed to "heal" or return the rock to a condition comparable to its undisturbed state. <b>Deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> induces a dramatic change in pore structure. The permeability can increase more than 5 orders of magnitude over the initial (healed) state as the samples are loaded. The gas permeability changes are consistent with flow paths initially developing along the grain boundaries and then along axial secondary tensile cracks. The results from two sets of in situ gas permeability measurements from the underground workings of the WIPP Facility are given. The results consistently indicate that there is no measurable gas permeability prior to disturbing the rock by excavation. In the immediate vicinity of an excavation, the gas permeability can be 5 orders of magnitude greater than the undisturbed permeability.

Experimental responses of both hydraulic and mechanical behaviour are given after different heating/cooling cycling levels (105, 200, 300, 400 C). The reference state, used for comparison purposes, is taken after mass stabilization at 60 C. Typical uniaxial compression tests are provided, and original triaxial deviatoric compressive test responses are also given. Hydraulic behaviour is identified simultaneously to triaxial <b>deviatoric</b> compressive <b>loading</b> through gas permeability Kgas assessment. Kgas is well correlated with volumetric strain evolution: gas permeability increases hugely when v testifies of a dilatant material behaviour, instead of contractile from the test start. Finally, the thermo-mechanical model, based on a thermodynamics approach, is identified using the experimental results on uniaxial and triaxial deviatoric compression. It is also positively validated at residual state for triaxial deviatoric compression, but also by using a different stress path in lateral extension, which is at the origin of noticeable plasticity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{particle}} breakage has {{a significant}} impact on the mechanical behavior of granular materials. In this paper, we present an elasto-plastic model with two yield surfaces to which the influence of particle breakage has been introduced. The main feature of this model is to incorporate the change in the critical state line (CSL) consequent to the grain breakage induced by isotropic and <b>deviatoric</b> stresses during <b>loading.</b> For this purpose we propose a breakage function which connects the evolution of the CSL to the energy consumed. Results from earlier studies on drained and undrained compression and extension triaxial tests were used to calibrate and validate the model. Comparison between earlier results and our simulations indicates that the model can reproduce with good accuracy the mechanical behavior of crushable granular materials and predict the evolution of the grain size distribution during loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{macroscopic}} mechanical {{behavior of}} granular materials inherently {{depends on the}} properties of particles that compose them. Using the discrete element method, the effect of particle contact friction and polydispersity on the macroscopic stress response of 3 D sphere packings is studied. The analytical expressions for the pressure, coordination number and fraction of rattlers proposed for isotropically deformed frictionless systems also hold when the interparticle coefficient of friction is finite; however, the numerical values of the parameters such as the jamming volume fraction change with varying microscopic contact and particle properties. The macroscopic response under <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> is studied with triaxial test simulations. Concerning the shear strength, our results agree with previous studies showing that the deviatoric stress ratio increases with particle coefficient of friction μ starting from a nonzero value for μ = 0 and saturating for large μ. On the other hand, the volumetric strain {{does not have a}} monotonic dependence on the particle contact friction. Most notably, maximum compaction is reached at an intermediate value of the coefficient of friction μ ≈ 0. 3. The effect of polydispersity on the macroscopic stress–strain relationship cannot be studied independent of initial packing conditions. The shear strength increases with polydispersity when the initial volume fraction is fixed, but the effect of polydispersity is much less pronounced when the initial pressure of the packings is fixed. Finally, a simple hypoplastic constitutive model is calibrated with numerical test results following an established procedure to ascertain the relation between particle properties and material coefficients of the macroscopic model. The calibrated model is in good qualitative agreement with simulation results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMechanical {{characteristics}} (i. e., stiffness, {{internal friction}} angle, peak strength) and crushability of a soft granular material {{were evaluated by}} performing a comprehensive series of laboratory tests using the following devices: standard and non-standard triaxial apparatus, direct and annular shear box, oedometer and hydrostatic devices. The initial tested specimens differ by initial void ratio, grading characteristics and particle hardness. The air-dried specimen of soft particles were then subjected to monotonic loadings for various stress paths (direct and annular shear stress paths, oedometer stress paths until different upper normal pressures, triaxial stress paths including different confining pressures). After each homogeneous test, sieving has been performed in order to characterize the evolution of grading characteristics of the granular packing. Experimental results on mechanical properties show that maximum internal friction angle is rather independent of the particle stiffness even though small differences may exist before peak stress-state. As highlighted by recent studies (Arslan in Granul Matter 11 (2) : 87 - 97, 2009), the volumetric response of the specimen indicates that classical critical state is no more a relevant framework when particle crushability is too high compared with the applied stress-state. Crushability related to loading paths has been evaluated through the relative breakage ratio (Br). The first results pointed out the effects of initial geometrical configuration (i. e., void ratio, grading) and particle stiffness. Analysis of the stress paths effects {{on the amount of}} breakage revealed that stress-state is not sufficient to describe properly breakage undergone by the material which is confirmed by an obvious link between volumetric strain and total breakage. Finally, the present study showed that the percentage of fine particles content during breakage may be seen {{as a function of the}} "level" of <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading</b> paths...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} two {{distinct}} areas of Earth Sciences that are linked by common processes. The first is dehydration reactions at intermediate depths {{that lead to}} seismicity, {{and the second is}} the mechanics of the deformation of porous sandstones which is important for the development of sub-surface reservoirs. The breakdown of hydrous minerals in subduction zones is often invoked as the cause of seismicity at intermediate depths (50 - 200 km). The release of high pressure fluid is thought to reduce effective stress allowing brittle deformation at pressures where instabilities are typically supressed. Pore fluid pressure (Pf) evolution is dependent on the feedback between reaction rate, fluid flow and deformation. Reaction generates fluid which, if unable to drain, will lead to an increase in Pf. However dehydration reactions are also typically associated with (i) solid volume reduction which produces porosity, enhancing fluid flow and allowing high Pf to dissipate, and (ii) compaction of this pore space that can restrict fluid flow enabling Pf to build up. This thesis aims to constrain the processes that control the reaction rate, and hence the fluid production rate, and also determine the deformation behaviour of the porous reaction product. This is done by investigating experimentally the reaction gypsum → bassanite + H₂O. Reaction processes are investigated by imaging a dehydrating gypsum sample using real time 4 D X-ray synchrotron microtomography. The datasets acquired allow the evolving pore structure and connectivity to be analyzed during reaction. The growth of bassanite grains is tracked and the kinetics are shown to be intimately linked to the spatial evolution of porosity. New pores wrap around bassanite grains producing moat-like structures; generating diffusion pathways along which the transport of chemical constituents to the growing grains occurs. As the moats grow in width, diffusion and hence reaction rate slow down. Individual moats become interconnected early in the reaction allowing efficient drainage and dissipation of locally high Pf. Identifying the dominant chemical transport pathway is important for modelling of dehydrating systems to constrain better the feedback between reaction, fluid flow and deformation. The mechanical behaviour of the porous reaction product bassanite is investigated by mapping the yield curve evolution along different loading paths. Yield curves are typically plotted in P-Q space where P is the effective mean stress and Q is the differential stress. They are typically considered to be elliptical in shape with the low pressure side being associated with localized brittle faulting (dilation) and the high pressure side with distributed ductile deformation (compaction). A new stress-probing methodology is used to map in high resolution the yield curve and its evolution with continued deformation. This reveals that the yield curve is not perfectly elliptical with the high pressure side comprised partly of a near vertical limb. The yield curve evolution is dependent on the nature of inelastic strain, with deviatorically compacted samples having considerably larger yield curves than hydrostatically compacted samples of similar porosity. This is associated with the formation of a heterogeneous microstructure during <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading,</b> showing sets of conjugate shear fractures. The same stress-probing methodology is applied to two high porosity sandstones to see if the yield curve evolution observed for porous bassanite is applicable. Both sandstones show a similar near vertical limb on the high pressure side of the curve as observed with bassanite. The yield curve evolution for sandstone is also more sensitive to <b>deviatoric</b> <b>loading,</b> like bassanite, although no localized deformation features are observed. The data highlight that future studies of porous rock deformation should consider the effect of the nature of inelastic strain on the mechanical and microstructural evolution of porous rock...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{behavior}} of inclusion-reinforced composites {{is affected by}} the nature of the bond between the constituents. Imperfect bonding may result either from the manufacturing process or from damage development when the composite is loaded. For linear elastic materials, it lowers the effective elastic modulus. For non-linear (e. g. plastic) material models, debonding between harder and softer phases may be at the origin of micro cracking, shear banding, or ductile damage. The first part of the thesis proposes particular solutions allowing the determination of the effective properties of the composite for particular cases of loading, such as the <b>deviatoric</b> tension <b>loading.</b> The solution is based on the theory of linear elasticity coupled with mean field homogenization schemes. The second and main part of the thesis is based on the generalization of the concept of Eshelby’s solution, to account for nonlinear interface debonding between the constituents of a composite material. The solution is incremental and it can work with any kind of cohesive law and under any kind of external loading. Two simplifying hypotheses are adopted. The stress field inside the spherical particle as well as the compliance across the interface is considered to be uniform. The Mori-Tanaka method is extended based on the generalization of Eshelby’s solution to account for the effect of nonlinear interface debonding. The extended Mori Tanaka method is able to predict the macroscopic mechanical {{behavior of}} a composite material with any kind of cohesive law and external loading. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. DOI: [URL] {{modeling}} of anisotropic damage in rock raises many fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical issues. In this paper, the maximum likelihood method {{is used to}} analyze the performance of the Differential Stress Induced Damage (DSID) model recently formulated by Xu and Arson. The stress/strain relationship is a nonlinear function of parameters ncluding unknown constants (i. e.,damage constitutive parameters) and known variables (e. g., elastic parameters and controlled stress state). Logarithmic transformation, normalization and forward deletion are employed, in order to find the optimum number of constitutive parameters, as a trade off between accuracy and simplicity. For Eastern France claystone subject to <b>deviatoric</b> stress <b>loading</b> (e. g., triaxial and proportional compression loading), it is found that (1) only one damage parameter (a₂) is needed in the expression of the free energy to predict stress/strain curves; (2) a₂ controls the deviation of the current principal directions of stress to the principal directions of damage; (3) model parameters involved in the damage criterion can be related to a₂. As a result, a₂ is the only parameter needed to model differential-stress induced damage in Eastern France claystone. It is also shown that within the set of assumptions made in this study, the DSID model is not sensitive to the initial damage threshold C₀, except for C₀> 10 ⁶ Pa a range of values in which only one constitutive parameter becomes insufficient to predict the stress/strain curves of damaged claystone. Coupling probabilistic calibration and optimization methods to numerical codes promises to allow adapting the complexity of anisotropic damage models to different rocks and stress paths...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple anisotropic sand model within a recently proposed Anisotropic Critical State Theory (ACST), which {{was motivated by}} grain level kinematics studied by means of DEM. The model adopts the SANISAND constitutive model platform and uses a fundamental ingredient of ACST, namely the fabric anisotropy variable A that equals the first joint invariant of properly defined and evolving <b>deviatoric</b> fabric and <b>loading</b> direction tensors. The A evolves towards its critical state value that constitutes a concurrent additional requirement to that of critical stress-ratio and void-ratio, for attaining critical state. The A {{is used for the}} definition of evolving dilatancy state lines that delineate contractive and dilative states in the void ratio - mean effective stress space, the plastic modulus and the evolution equation of the fabric tensor. Since the development is within ACST, the thermodynamically consistent uniqueness of the critical state line is postulated. The model is shown to be capable of simulating the anisotropic behavior of sands, based on comparisons to Toyoura sand experiments. In addition, parametric analyses show the influence of the initial value and pace of evolution of the fabric tensor on the stress strain response. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
