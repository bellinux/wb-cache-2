5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun but I had never fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened {{and that was when}} I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E
5|$|In , a 2010 {{documentary}} film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted: It's something that I probably won’t realize until my career is over, {{how many people}} are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was able to travel here.|$|E

[...] "It is {{abstract}} reasoning from given <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> aim at, as {{you will}} understand when you have heard my 'Human Reeds,' and my other--dear me, there's your door bell. <b>I</b> thought <b>that</b> Colonel was gone for the day." ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

500|$|While campaigning on 28 October for the {{forthcoming}} Glasgow North East by-election on 22 November, Griffin was {{asked why he}} had laughed on Question Time. He replied: [...] "I had thought that David Dimbleby would have the professional self-respect to at least make a show of being fair. I was laughing at the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was wrong", adding, [...] "All that was exposed was the pure, vicious bigotry of the British ruling elite." ...|$|E
500|$|As a youngster, Gunn did {{not always}} play in goal and he {{was viewed as a}} handy outfield player in his early years at Aberdeen. Ferguson recalls, [...] "He could strike a ball as well as anyone, so well in <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> once played him at centre-forward in a reserve match ... He scored a {{brilliant}} goal ... It was a marvellous moment." [...] However, as a professional, and at his adult height of , Gunn settled into playing in goal.|$|E

Weir was [...] "genuinely surprised and completely thrilled" [...] to be offered the part. Bill Bailey was pleased {{to be given a}} comedic human character, explaining, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am almost playing a human means the expressions are easier to do.

500|$|Emmeline Pankhurst {{was born}} on 15 July 1858 in the Manchester suburb of Moss Side. Although her birth {{certificate}} states otherwise, she believed that her birthday was a day earlier, on Bastille Day – 14 July. Most biographies, including those written by her daughters, repeat this claim. Feeling a kinship with the female revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille, she said in 1908: [...] "I have always thought that the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was born on}} that day {{had some kind of}} influence over my life." [...] The reason for the discrepancy remains unclear.|$|E

He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might have been OK with it.

500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, M.I.A. voiced {{her fears}} of the {{influence}} of video game violence on her son and his generation, saying, [...] "I don't know which is worse. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw it in my life has maybe given me lots of issues, but there's a whole generation of American kids seeing violence on their computer screens and then getting shipped off to Afghanistan. They feel like they know the violence when they don't. Not having a proper understanding of violence, especially what it's like {{on the receiving end of}} it, just makes you interpret it wrong and makes inflicting violence easier." ...|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky and Portman first {{discussed}} a ballet film in 2000, {{after the release}} of Requiem for a Dream, though the script had not yet been written. He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, [...] "I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself." [...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
500|$|The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in {{particular}} constantly attacked Ferraro's integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about [...] "the ethnic slur that I am {{somehow or other}} connected to organized crime. There's lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible because of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype..." [...] On the , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37percent of the vote to 36percent, with Sharpton and Holtzman well behind. Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Jeff Gannon {{began writing}} editorials for the paper. His pieces {{included}} criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis, {{who had helped}} uncover Gannon's pornographic ads. Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's history of anti-gay reporting as well as Gannon's refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, “My personal life is a private matter, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have become a public person.” Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the [...] "steady stream of feedback/vitriol" [...] had declined [...] "a little" [...] with each new Gannon article.|$|E
