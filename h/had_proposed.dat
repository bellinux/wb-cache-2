5|$|According to Heisenberg, {{he began}} to address nuclear energy, {{morality}} and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions. Ivan Supek, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1960, {{the first section of}} freeway along M-78 was opened in the Lennon area. The next year, the freeway had been {{extended}} as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon. Also in 1961, the MSHD <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> that the section of US27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead.|$|E
5|$|Carla Thomas {{claimed that}} the pair had planned to record another duet album in December the same year, but Phil Walden denied this. Redding <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> to record an album {{featuring}} cut and rearranged songs in different tempos; for example, ballads would be uptempo and vice versa. Another suggestion was to record an album entirely consisting of country standards.|$|E

5|$|The London and Brighton Railway {{terminus}} at London Bridge provided reasonable {{access to}} the City of London but was inconvenient for travellers to and from Westminster.

5|$|The {{obsession}} {{led him to}} {{deny that}} animals could be colored for other reasons: for protection by mimicry, as the naturalist Henry Walter Bates <b>had</b> <b>proposed,</b> supported by many examples of butterflies from South America; through sexual selection, as Charles Darwin had argued, again supported by many observations. The unbalanced treatment of animal coloration in Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom encapsulates Thayer's partial understanding and his rejection of other theories.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{took the}} Resolves to the Virginia Convention in Williamsburg, and {{although}} delegates made some changes, the adopted resolution closely tracks both the Fairfax Resolves, and the scheme for non-exportation of tobacco Mason <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> some years earlier.

30|$|Thus far, {{many types}} of DCS <b>have</b> been <b>proposed.</b> Brooks <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> SA (Subsumption Architecture) [7]. Recently, SA is used as typical DCS. In SA, layers of control system are built to let a robot operate at {{increasing}} levels of competence. Rosenblatt <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> DAMN (Distributed Architecture for Mobile Navigation) [8]. In DAMN, an arbiter performs command fusion and selects an action which best satisfies the prioritized goals of the system by voting. Morales et al. <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> SSM (Sensor Sharing Manager) [9]. In SSM, many processes run in parallel such as localization, obstacle detection, and navigation. These DCSs allow the robot to generate robust and/or flexible behaviors.|$|R

5|$|Whilst the Campaign for Borders Rail {{acknowledged}} that the half-hourly weekday stopping service would be useful for commuters, it questions whether {{this is the best}} use of a line, which could carry other types of traffic.

5|$|Also in the 1878 session, tax {{assessments}} for railroad property {{were raised}} to match {{those of other}} property. Agrarian interests were pleased that the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> in the previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) {{and the establishment of}} a state board of health. Bills of local import again dominated the session, representing 90 percent of the acts and resolutions passed by the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|At {{the demand}} of the sultan, Transylvania troops {{assisted}} Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia. The sultan also ordered Sigismund to pay {{double the amount}} of the yearly tribute. Balthasar Báthory murdered Sigismund's secretary, Pál Gyulai, on 10December 1592. He also persuaded Sigismund to order the execution of Gálffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during the absence of the king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came to nothing.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a mobile unit in London, attending bombed sites during the Blitz. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a welder in a factory in north London, a job that lasted {{until the end of the}} year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife and children in the United States when he <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{agreed to}} four televised debates, {{three of which}} were held. The candidates agreed to a fourth debate {{which was to be}} held on October 30 in WGBH-TV's studio, hosted by a Boston media consortium, and moderated by John King, but the day before both pulled out due to Hurricane Sandy. Victoria Kennedy, widow of Ted Kennedy, <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> an additional debate with Tom Brokaw as moderator, however Brown would only accept the invitation if she pledged not to endorse Brown's opponent; which she refused.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam.

5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|By early 1844, a rift {{developed}} between Smith {{and a half}} dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said that Smith <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E
5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) <b>had</b> <b>proposed</b> an {{underground}} railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E
