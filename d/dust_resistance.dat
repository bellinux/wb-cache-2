2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and <b>dust</b> <b>resistance,</b> as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|E

40|$|Metal dusting is {{a catastrophic}} {{carburisation}} phenomenon that occurs at temperatures of 450 - 850 °C in atmospheres of high carbon activity. The resistance of alloys to corrosion, including metal dusting, {{relies on the}} formation of a dense, adherent oxide layer that separates the alloy from the corrosive environment. For such an oxide layer to be protective, it must achieve full surface coverage, be crack-free and be established before significant material degradation has occurred. Formation of a protective oxide scale can be enhanced by increasing the population of rapid diffusion paths for the protective elements (e. g. Cr and Al) to reach the alloy surface. In this work, laser surface melting has been used to improve the metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> of Alloy 800 H by creating a rapid solidification microstructure and, thereby, increasing the density of rapid diffusion paths.

40|$|We have {{performed}} {{a long term}} comparative study between five wrought and three centricast materials, both as-is, and in coated condition. Two commercially available coatings were applied to each different alloy. One coating was aluminum based with a chromium rich intermediate layer. The other coating was nickel rich with substantial amounts of silicon and aluminum. Both types of coating were of good quality, and did not show (micro) defects. The coated and bare alloy samples were exposed in a high pressure metal dusting atmosphere, and characterised based on mass loss, pit depth, pit size and pit density at regular intervals. The results indicate that a properly applied coating can boost the metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> of low chromium alloys to a level comparable with alloy 693, for which generally no metal dusting attack is observed.

40|$|Corrosion {{investigations}} and testing standards normally use standard surface pre-treatments, e. g. ground samples. This {{is in order}} to be able to determine the impact of various elements. The end users of materials therefore generally have access to good data regarding the impact of the alloy composition. The problem is that alloys are almost never used in a ground condition, as the surface condition strongly depends on the production route used. This study addresses this problem. The metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> of wrought and spun cast 20 Cr 32 NiFe with different surface states has been investigated. The samples came from commercially available tubes with their standard surface condition; the wrought alloys in a pickled state and the spun cast deep hole drilled. Samples with the original and ground surfaces were exposed for 300 h at 600 °C in a CO/CO 2 /H 2 /H 2 O mixture, P tot= 5. 5 bar (ac: Boudouard/COred/Water-Gas- Shift: 558 / 232 / 379), corresponding to conditions in some furnaces used for the direct reduction of iron ore. The results clearly show that that 20 Cr 32 NiFe is not suitable for high carbon activities. However, the pickled surface was sensitive toward metal dusting attack while the drilled and the ground samples had better resistance. This shows that the surface pre-treatment plays a crucial role. © 2011 by NACE International...|$|R

40|$|The {{metal dusting}} {{behavior}} of three ferrous alloys with varying Cr content (2. 3 %, 8. 6 %, and 20. 1 % by weight) {{has been studied}} in carbonaceous atmospheres where the activity of carbon is greater than 1. Failures due to metal dusting {{have been reported in}} petrochemical, chemical industries, nuclear reactors and solid oxide fuel cells. It is estimated that financial losses in hydrogen industry alone due to metal dusting related maintenance problems is estimated to be around $ 300 million annually. Two atmospheres with varying water vapor contents (23 and 2. 3 %) have been used for the study to understand the role of vapor during metal dusting. ^ Low Cr alloy, T 22, showed extensive surface degradation and pitting, while increasing Cr content showed improved <b>resistance</b> to metal <b>dusting</b> for T 91 (medium Cr) and 800 (high Cr) alloys due to the formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal <b>dusting.</b> <b>Resistance</b> to metal <b>dusting</b> also improved in atmosphere with higher vapor content. Presence of high vapor content in the atmosphere favors the formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal dusting and these scales not only delay the ingress of carbon into the alloy matrix but also offer resistance to carbon diffusion thus improving the overall resistance of the alloys against metal dusting. ^ A combination of high Cr content in the alloy and high vapor content in the atmosphere is favorable for formation of protective Cr 2 O 3 scales early during metal dusting and this improves the resistance of the alloys to metal dusting corrosion. ...|$|R

40|$|Metal dusting {{corrosion}} {{is a form}} of {{high temperature}} corrosion that is caused by carbon supersaturated gas, leading to a rapid degradation of the metals. Usually, metal dusting corrosion is associated with temperatures between 500 and 800 °C, and very low oxygen partial pressures, {{due to the nature of}} the main chemical reactions in the gas phase. In nickel, metal dusting corrosion is caused by the catalytical deposition of graphite on the metal that eventually grows inward and causes a rapid degradation of the metal. One way to mitigate metal dusting corrosion is by physically separating the metal from the reaction gas with an oxide layer that blocks gas and carbon diffusion. This layer can be achieved by alloying with metals that form stable, thermally grown oxides under the low oxygen partial pressures typically present. In this study, the effect of aluminium on the dusting of Ni-Al model alloys and commercial Fe-Ni-Cr alloys has been studied. Reactions were carried out in a CO-H 2 -H 2 O gas mixture, using temperature cycling with a reaction temperature of 650 °C, leading to a carbon activity of 36. 7 and an oxygen partial pressure of 2. 8 E- 26 atm. It was found that the protective effect of aluminium was strongly dependant on the amount of aluminium alloyed, as concentration and diffusion determine the protective properties of the alumina. Low Al alloys were severely attacked at a rate similar to that of pure nickel, while the intermetallic &# 946;-NiAl phase proved to be very resistant. The &# 947;'-Ni 3 Al phase with an intermediate amount of aluminium, showed pitting-type attack, indicating partial protection of the alloy. The commercial Fe-Ni-Cr alloys featuring only low Cr and Al concentrations were all heavily attacked. It was also found that alloying of low levels of hafnium into the Ni-Al alloys generally did not improve metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> without a high-temperature preoxidation treatment that produce dense, slow growing &# 945;-Al 2 O 3...|$|R

The {{deposition of}} carbon from a carbon-rich environment onto structural materials is prevalent in petrochemical and chemical {{industries such as}} in the production of syngas, iron reduction plants, petroleum refineries, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear plants, fuel cells using molten salts and hydrocarbons, and the recycle-gas loop equipment of coal-gasification units. The consequence of carbon deposition is a metal related degradation phenomenon known as "Metal dusting". Metal dusting results in rapid material wastage and/or thinning of material, producing hemispherical pits and grooves as the affected material disintegrates into a mixture of carbon and metal particles. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate material factors that cause or contribute to metal dusting. This was achieved by refurbishing the in-built metal dusting rig to carry out experimental tests on a laboratory scale. The objectives of this research were to simulate a metal dusting environment, characterize the resistance of various alloys to metal dusting, and to evaluate the effects of surface treatment and temperature on metal dusting. Metal dusting was induced on a wide variety of nickelbased and iron-based alloys which were capable of forming chromium oxide scales in a flowing CO-HrH 20 atmosphere at 650 °C and 500 °C. Some of the alloys were heat treated at 850 °C for an hour prior to exposure and others were ground to 600 grit SiC. Some degree of metal dusting attack was observed for all alloys tested except for an alloy with high chromium and nickel content. The results indicated that metal dusting is much more aggressive at lower temperatures than at high temperatures. It was also observed that the surface working of the alloys had a very significant effect to metal <b>dusting</b> <b>resistance</b> as well as the amount of scale forming elements additions and the presence of certain carbides forming elements.
