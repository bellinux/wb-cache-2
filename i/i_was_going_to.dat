I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win Paris–Roubaix. At {{the entrance to the}} vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> direct <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write my way in.

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
