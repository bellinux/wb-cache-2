5|$|If {{the bike}} and rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E
5|$|More generally, in {{a closed}} system of {{particles}}, all <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> are balanced. The particles may accelerate with {{respect to each other}} but the center of mass of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>forces,</b> {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>forces</b> are {{produced}} between the particles of a deformable object, assumed as a continuum, {{as a reaction}} to applied external forces, i.e., either surface forces or body forces. This reaction follows from Euler's laws of motion for a continuum, which are equivalent to Newton's laws of motion for a particle. A measure of the intensity of these <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> is called stress. Because the object is assumed as a continuum, these <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> are distributed continuously within the volume of the object.|$|E

25|$|Elastic {{deformation}} in solids is {{reversible change}} in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.|$|E

25|$|Culture {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the development of all countries. The culture of France and of the French people has been shaped by geography, by profound historical events, and by foreign and <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> and groups. France, and in particular Paris, has played an important role as a center of high culture since the 17th century, first in Europe, and from the 19th century on, worldwide. From the late 19th century, France has also played an important role in cinema, fashion, cuisine, literature, technology, science and mathematics. The importance of French culture has waxed and waned over the centuries, depending on its economic, political and military importance. French culture today is marked both by great regional and socioeconomic differences and strong unifying tendencies.|$|E

25|$|A second clause {{promotes}} alliance {{by making}} reassurances of aid, most likely military support, if either party is {{attacked by a}} third party or by <b>internal</b> <b>forces</b> of rebellion or insurgency. The other stipulations coincide with HattuÅ¡iliÅ¡' aims (consult Hittite aims section) in that the Hittite ruler placed great emphasis on establishing legitimacy for his rule: each country swore to the other to extradite political fugitives back to their home country and within the Hittite version of the treaty Ramesses II agreed to provide support to HattuÅ¡iliÅ¡' successors in order to hold the Hittite throne against dissenters. After {{the conclusion of the}} provision detailing the extradition of emigrants to their land of origin, the two rulers call upon the respective gods of Hatti and Egypt to bear witness to their agreement. The inclusion of the gods is a common feature in major pieces of international law since only a direct appeal to the gods could provide the proper means to guarantee adherence to the treaty. Their noted ability to bestow curses and blessings to people is employed as a serious penalty that would be imposed in case of a violation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the study of}} cooperative manipulation of a cable-suspended load with two aerial robots and without explicit communication. The role of the <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> for the asymptotic stability of the beam-position/beam-attitude equilibria is analyzed in depth. Using a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that if a non-zero <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> is chosen then asymptotic stabilization of any desired beam-pose configuration can be achieved with a decentralized and communication-less master-slave admittance controller. If, conversely, a zero <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> is chosen, as done {{in the majority of}} the state-of-the-art algorithms, the attitude of the beam is not controllable without communication. Non-zero <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> can be interpreted then as a fundamental factor that enables the use of cables as implicit communication means between the two aerial vehicles in replacement of the explicit ones. Furthermore, the formal proof of the system output-strictly passivity with respect to an energy-like storage function and a certain input-output pair is given. This proves the stability and the robustness of the method even during motion. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations with added noise and realistic uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{continuous}} {{rigid frame}} bridge has been applied widely in our country. But in recent years, over-deflection of beam in this bridge has become an serious problem. This may cause the redistribution of displacement and <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> of the whole structure, especially in dynamic load status. A two-dimensional pile-soil-bridge model is built up in ANSYS based on a factual bridge. The over-deflection is considered as the decrease of beam elastic modulus or rigidity. The displacement and <b>internal</b> <b>force</b> of key parts are analysed in static and dynamic vehicle load. The study shows that over-deflection will reduce the first three natural vibration frequency, weaken the sensitivity of bridge to dynamic load.
