25|$|An {{idealized}} mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can {{be calculated}} from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite {{was applied to the}} most silicic. A normative <b>feldspathoid</b> classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.|$|E
2500|$|A QAPF diagram is {{a double}} ternary diagram {{which is used to}} {{classify}} igneous rocks based on mineralogic composition. The acronym, QAPF, stands for [...] "Quartz, Alkali feldspar, Plagioclase, <b>Feldspathoid</b> (Foid)". These are the mineral groups used for classification in QAPF diagram. Q, A, P and F percentages are normalized (recalculated so that their sum is 100%).|$|E
50|$|Syenite pegmatites are quartz {{depleted}} {{and contain}} large <b>feldspathoid</b> crystals instead.|$|E
5000|$|... {{containing}} matrix restricted feldspars and/or <b>feldspathoids</b> {{if present}} ...|$|R
25|$|In a {{simplified}} classification, igneous rock types are separated {{on the basis}} of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with <b>feldspathoids</b> are silica-undersaturated, because <b>feldspathoids</b> cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.|$|R
5000|$|Alkali basalt is {{relatively}} poor in silica and rich in sodium. It is silica-undersaturated and may contain <b>feldspathoids,</b> alkali feldspar and phlogopite.|$|R
50|$|Foid, {{contraction}} {{of the term}} <b>feldspathoid,</b> is applied to any igneous rock containing up to 60% modal <b>feldspathoid</b> minerals. For example, a syenite with significant nepheline present can be termed a '(nepheline)-bearing syenite', or a '(nepheline)-syenite', with the term (nepheline) replaceable by any 'foid' mineral. Such terminology {{is used in the}} Streckeisen (QAPF) classification of igneous rocks.|$|E

50|$|Phonolite is a {{fine-grained}} {{equivalent of}} nepheline syenite. They {{are products of}} partial melting, are silica undersaturated, and have <b>feldspathoids</b> in their normative mineralogy.|$|R
50|$|Most carbonatites tend {{to include}} some {{silicate}} mineral fraction; by definition an igneous rock containing >50% carbonate minerals is classified as a carbonatite. Silicate minerals associated with such compositions are pyroxene, olivine, and silica-undersaturated minerals such as nepheline and other <b>feldspathoids.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>feldspathoids</b> are a {{group of}} tectosilicate {{minerals}} which resemble feldspars but have a different structure and much lower silica content. They occur in rare and unusual types of igneous rocks, and are not found in rocks containing primary quartz.|$|R

50|$|At {{very low}} degrees of partial melting a silica undersaturated melt is produced, forming a {{nepheline}} syenite, where orthoclase {{is replaced by}} a <b>feldspathoid</b> such as leucite, nepheline or analcime.|$|E
50|$|Most pegmatites are {{composed}} of quartz, feldspar and mica, having a similar silicic composition as granite. Rarer intermediate composition and mafic pegmatites containing amphibole, Ca-plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, <b>feldspathoids</b> and other unusual minerals are known, found in recrystallised zones and apophyses associated with large layered intrusions.|$|R
5000|$|Analcime {{is usually}} {{classified}} as a zeolite mineral, but structurally and chemically it is more similar to the <b>feldspathoids.</b> Analcime occurs as a primary mineral in analcime basalt and other alkaline igneous rocks. It also occurs as cavity and vesicle fillings associated with prehnite, calcite, and zeolites.|$|R
25|$|Tectosilicates, {{also known}} as {{framework}} silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization. With all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the feldspars, <b>feldspathoids,</b> and the zeolites. Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable {{as a result of}} strong covalent bonds.|$|R
50|$|The {{typical range}} of phenocrysts in ignimbrites are biotite, quartz, {{sanidine}} or other alkali feldspar, occasionally hornblende, rarely pyroxene {{and in the}} case of phonolite tuffs, the <b>feldspathoid</b> minerals such as nepheline and leucite.|$|E
50|$|Nepheline syenites are silica-undersaturated {{and some}} are {{peralkaline}} (terms discussed in igneous rock). Nepheline is a <b>feldspathoid,</b> a solid-solution mineral, that does not coexist with quartz; rather, nepheline would react with quartz to produce alkali feldspar.|$|E
50|$|Tugtupite is a {{beryllium}} aluminium tectosilicate. It {{also contains}} sodium and chlorine {{and has the}} formula Na4AlBeSi4O12Cl. Tugtupite {{is a member of}} the silica deficient <b>feldspathoid</b> mineral group. It occurs in high alkali intrusive igneous rocks.|$|E
50|$|Mineral assemblages in {{phonolite}} occurrences {{are usually}} abundant <b>feldspathoids</b> (nepheline, sodalite, hauyne, leucite and analcite) and alkali feldspar (sanidine, anorthoclase or orthoclase), and rare sodic plagioclase. Biotite, sodium-rich amphiboles and pyroxenes along with iron-rich olivine are common minor minerals. Accessory phases include titanite, apatite, corundum, zircon, magnetite and ilmenite.|$|R
40|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} study of a fine-grained, pin, Ca-rich inclusion from the Allende meteorite has revealed strong evidence for direct condensation of its constituent minerals from a vapor. This observation extends to the alkali-bearing phases {{in addition to the}} Ca-, Al-silicates and suggests that the <b>feldspathoids</b> as well as the refractory silicates are solar nebular condensates...|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell has {{suggested}} that rocks belonging to the [...] "lamprophyre facies" [...] are characterized {{by the presence of}} phenocrysts of mica and/or amphibole together with lesser clinopyroxene and/or melilite set in a groundmass which may consist (either singly or in various combinations) of plagioclase, alkali feldspar, <b>feldspathoids,</b> carbonate, monticellite, melilite, mica, amphibole, pyroxene, perovskite, Fe-Ti oxides and glass.|$|R
5000|$|Foidolite (...) {{is a rare}} {{coarse-grained}} intrusive {{igneous rock}} with a <b>feldspathoid</b> mineral content greater than 60%. Crystals of alkali feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, amphibole, pyroxene, and/or olivine may be present within the rock. The volcanic equivalents are termed foidite and phonolitic or tephritic foidites.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{benefit of}} calculating a CIPW norm is {{determining}} what the ideal mineralogy of an aphanitic or porphyritic igneous rock is. Secondly, {{the degree of}} silica saturation of the melt that formed the rock can be assessed {{in the absence of}} diagnostic <b>feldspathoid</b> species.|$|E
5000|$|Essexite is an {{alkaline}} {{igneous rock}} equivalent to an alkaline basalt. The presence of nepheline, a <b>feldspathoid</b> mineral, indicates that essexites are silica undersaturated. The presence of orthoclase {{indicates that it}} contains sufficient potassium to favor production of orthoclase over microcline or potassic oligoclase.|$|E
5000|$|Tephrite is an igneous, {{volcanic}} (extrusive) rock, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. Mineral {{content is}} usually abundant <b>feldspathoids</b> (leucite or nepheline), plagioclase, and lesser alkali feldspar. Pyroxenes (clinopyroxenes) are common accessory minerals. Quartz and olivine are absent. Occurrences include leucite nepheline tephrite from Hamberg bei Neckarelz near Heidelberg, Germany, phonolite-tephrite at Monte Vulture, Basilicata, Italy and basanite-tephrite intrusions in Namibia.|$|R
50|$|Typical skarn {{minerals}} include pyroxene, garnet, idocrase, wollastonite, actinolite, magnetite or hematite, and epidote. Because skarns {{are formed}} from incompatible-element rich, siliceous aqueous fluids {{a variety of}} uncommon mineral types {{are found in the}} skarn environment, such as: tourmaline, topaz, beryl, corundum, fluorite, apatite, barite, strontianite, tantalite, anglesite, and others. Often, <b>feldspathoids</b> and rare calc-silicates such as scapolite are found in more marginal areas.|$|R
50|$|Like all basalt, {{the rock}} type is {{dominated}} by clinopyroxene plus plagioclase, with minor iron-titanium oxides. Orthopyroxene or pigeonite may also be present in tholeiitic basalt, and olivine, if present, may be rimmed by either of these calcium-poor pyroxenes. Tridymite or quartz may {{be present in the}} fine-grained groundmass of tholeiitic basalt, and <b>feldspathoids</b> are absent. Tholeiitic rocks may have a fine, glassy groundmass, as may other types of basalt.|$|R
50|$|Lazurite is a tectosilicate mineral with sulfate, sulfur and {{chloride}} with formula: (Na,Ca)8(S,Cl,SO4,OH)2(Al6Si6O24). It is a <b>feldspathoid</b> and {{a member}} of the sodalite group. Lazurite crystallizes in the isometric system although well formed crystals are rare. It is usually massive and forms the bulk of the gemstone lapis lazuli.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} mineral component of lapis lazuli is lazurite (25% to 40%), a <b>feldspathoid</b> silicate mineral with the formula (Na,Ca)8(AlSiO4)6(S,SO4,Cl)1-2. Most lapis lazuli also contains calcite (white), sodalite (blue), and pyrite (metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain augite; diopside; enstatite; mica; hauynite; hornblende, nosean, and sulfur-rich löllingite geyerite.|$|E
50|$|Trachyte is an igneous {{volcanic}} rock with an aphanitic to porphyritic texture. It is the volcanic equivalent of syenite. The mineral assemblage consists of essential alkali feldspar; relatively minor plagioclase and quartz or a <b>feldspathoid</b> such as nepheline {{may also be}} present. (See the QAPF diagram). Biotite, clinopyroxene and olivine are common accessory minerals.|$|E
25|$|Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the {{hitherto}} accepted {{criteria for}} the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted {{in terms of the}} rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, <b>Feldspathoids,</b> magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.|$|R
50|$|Chemical {{weathering}} {{alters the}} minerals constituent of rock surface. Decomposition of mafic and opaque minerals releases ions and colloids of iron, magnesium, calcium and sulphur. Alteration of feldspars and <b>feldspathoids</b> releases silica colloid. These materials are reached and transported by surface water. The remnant materials are highly aluminous and siliceous. They could have certain mechanical firmness of own minerals, however no cohesion. Therefore, physical {{disintegration of the}} rock takes place to form the surface.|$|R
