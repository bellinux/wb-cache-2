40|$|SummaryIntroductionDouble gloving is {{recommended}} in orthopedic surgery, notably in total hip arthroplasties (THA) to prevent {{contamination of the}} surgical site. HypothesisSystematic glove changes during the key phases of hip prosthesis implantation reduce the frequency of occult perforations and bacterial loading of glove surfaces. Patients and methodsDuring 29 THA implantation procedures, we evaluated the bacterial contamination of the outer glove surface and its perforation rate. Contaminations were sought by placing the gloved fingertips on blood <b>geloses</b> (incubation, 48 h at 37 °C), and perforations were sought using a water test (NF EN 455 - 1). ResultsOne intervention was excluded from the study because an initial contamination was detected, leaving 28 cases analyzed. Fifteen interventions (53. 6 %) presented contaminated <b>geloses</b> (26 contaminated glove changes for 3. 38 % of the gloves used). These contaminations {{were found on the}} gloves of all of the gloved personnel, with no distinction as to the right or left side. Thirty-eight percent of the contaminations occurred during joint reduction, whereas the other surgical stages grouped 15 – 26 % of the contaminations (P< 0. 05). Twenty-nine bacteria were identified: 62 % coagulase-negative staphylococci (16 % of which were methicillin-resistant). Twenty-eight perforations were identified (3. 5 % of the gloves used), 67. 8 % of which were located on the operator and 64. 3 % on the dominant side. Eighty percent of the perforations occurred during the “surgical incision” and the “cup and stem implantation” stages (respectively, 5. 0 % and 5. 5 % of the gloves used during the surgical time) (P< 0. 05), without being associated with an increased risk of bacterial contamination. At the 12 -month clinical follow-up, no infectious complications were found. On the gloves worn by the 20 surgical team members contaminated during these 28 surgical procedures, replacing contaminated gloves with new sterile gloves rendered all the bacteriological samples of the subsequent surgical stages negative in 16 cases (80 %). DiscussionIncreasing the number of outer glove renewals, notably during certain surgical stages at risk for contamination (prosthesis reduction) or perforation (surgical incision/femoral cementing) can reduce the risk of contamination and perforation. The bacteria isolated suggest a cutaneous origin. Regularly changing gloves has resulted in a sterile state in 80 % of cases.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and action}} of four starch polymers in talc flocculation has been studied. The polymers include: two {{chemically modified starch}} polymers (carboxymethyl (CM) and phenyl succinate (PS) starch), with similar molecular weight but variation in terms of added aromatic functionality; and two unmodified starch polymers, <b>Gelose</b> 80 and <b>Gelose</b> 50, which vary in their amylose:amylopectin ratio. The adsorption behaviour of the polymers indicated that the carboxyl groups of the functionalised polymers discouraged adsorption at low ionic strength, with the non-charged <b>Gelose</b> polymers adsorbing to higher densities in spite of having lower molecular weights. AFM imaging and contact angle measurements indicated that the polymers interact similarly with the talc basal plane in terms of coverage and effect on hydrophobicity, with minor differences in adsorbed layer thickness. CM and PS starch had an equal and best effect on the flocculation behaviour of talc suspension. The settling rate of bare talc was 0. 14 m h 1; the two functionalised starch polymers increased the settling rate to 1. 7 and 2 m h 1 for CM and PS starch, respectively (at 8 mg L 1 concentration). Whereas different chemical substitution had no pronounced effect on the settling behaviour, the relative content of amylose to amylopectin did produce differences in settling. <b>Gelose</b> 80 (80 % amylose; 1. 3 m h 1 settling rate at 40 mg L 1 concentration) performed better when compared <b>Gelose</b> 50 (50 % amylose; 0. 65 m h 1 settling rate at 40 mg L 1 concentration). Of the two unmodified starch polymers, <b>Gelose</b> 80 gave the best overall settling performance, highlighting {{the effect of the}} linear starch chains in encouraging good bridging flocculation...|$|E
40|$|In the 1980 s, {{tropical}} forest-management principles {{underwent a}} shift toward approaches giving greater responsibilities to rural people. One argument {{for such a}} shift were the long-term relations established between rural people and their natural resources. In Madagascar, a new law was drawn up in 1996 (<b>Gelose</b> law), which sought to integrate rural people into forest management. A gap was observed between the changes foreseen by the projects implementing the <b>Gelose</b> law and the actual changes. In this article, we use {{the concept of the}} social-ecological system (SES) to analyze that gap. The differences existing between the planned changes set by the <b>Gelose</b> contract in the village of Ambatoloaka (northwest of Madagascar) and the practices observed in 2010 were conceptualized as a gap between two SESs. The first SES is the targeted one (i. e., a virtual one); it corresponds to the designed <b>Gelose</b> contract. The second SES is the observed one. It is characterized by the heterogeneity of forest users and uses, which have several impacts on forest management, and by very dynamic social and ecological systems. The observed SES has been reshaped contingent on the constraints and opportunities offered by the <b>Gelose</b> contract as well as on other ecological and social components. The consequences and opportunities that such an SES reshaping would offer to improve the implementation of the <b>Gelose</b> law are discussed. The main reasons explaining the gap between the two SESs are as follows: (1) the clash between static and homogeneous perceptions in the targeted SES and the dynamics and heterogeneity that characterize the observed SES; and (2) the focus on one specific use of forest ecosystems (i. e., charcoal-making) in the targeted SES. Forest management in the observed SES depends on several uses of forest ecosystems. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and TGA-FTIR were also used to study the mechanism of thermal decomposition process. The results show a multiple-step mechanism for the thermal {{decomposition of}} all cornstarches. The sequence of activation energy for the cornstarches is waxy>maize>G 50 >G 80, which corresponds to amylopectin content. FTIR results confirm that the thermal decomposition of cornstarch is due to the long-chain scission. The higher activation energy for cornstarch with higher amylopectin content can be explained by its higher molecular weight and more alpha- 1, 6 bonds...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytical}} method {{to define and}} quantify the amylose content in starches is developed using two-dimensional (2 D) macromolecular size/branch chain-length distributions obtained by multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, also known as GPC) and enzymatic debranching. This method permits clear separation of amylose (low molecular weights, {{a small number of}} long-chain branches), amylopectin (high molecular weights, a large number of short-chain branches), long-chain-branched amylopectin and intermediate components. The results are applied to rice starch, normal maize starch, and two “high-amylose” starches (<b>Gelose</b> 50 and <b>Gelose</b> 80) and used to validate four “single-quantity” techniques for measuring amylose content: iodine colorimetry, concanavalin A precipitation, and 1 D SEC debranched (or chain-length) and branched distributions. Quantitatively accurate amylose contents can be obtained with the first three single-quantity methods for starch samples with clear separation of the amylose and amylopectin populations, but the 1 D SEC branched distribution seriously overestimates the values compared to the other techniques. For high-amylose starches, the definition of amylose content must be taken with caution: it is impossible to separate the different macromolecular populations unambiguously because of the higher abundance of hybrid species. The 2 D structural method serves as a reference to identify amylose content and validate single-quantity analytical procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties and phase transition of cornstarch with low moisture content under shear stress was investigated using a mixer with twin-roller rotors by the variation of torque as functions of temperature and time. Cornstarches with different AM/AP ratios (wx: 4 : 96, maize: 29 : 71, <b>Gelose</b> 50 : 62 : 38, and <b>Gelose</b> 80 : 77 : 23) {{were used as}} model materials in the experimental work. The results showed that, as the AM content increased from 0 to 77 %, the maximum torque increased from about 54 to 66 N/m and the final torque increased from about 27 to 47 N/m, respectively, and a longer mixing time was required to achieve a stable state (constant torque value). Microscopic and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies showed that the phase transition reflected by changes of birefringence and endotherms could well {{be associated with the}} torque curve measured by the mixer. The higher gelatinization temperatures of the starches with higher AM content, and especially the existence of multi-phase transitions at high temperatures, could explain the rheological behaviors detected by the mixer.

40|$|Milling of starch {{granules}} {{is important}} for many food applications and involves a combination of mechanical and thermal energy. In {{order to understand the}} effects of mechanical force alone, four commercial starches including maize starch (MS), potato starch (PS), and two high amylose maize starches (HAMS) (<b>Gelose</b> 50 and <b>Gelose</b> 80) were cryo-milled for 20 min under the same conditions. The structural and conformational changes of the starches after cryo-milling were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The cryo-milled starches had less crystallinity (15 - 35 %) and 35 - 50 % less ordered structure (double and single helices) than the native starch counterparts. The gelatinisation temperatures of the starches were not significantly altered by cryo-milling, but the gelatinisation enthalpies were significantly reduced in line with the reductions in the amount of double helices. Although, all four starches showed similar extent of degradation of crystalline/ordered structure, SEC results showed a greater degradation of amylopectin molecule in MS and PS than in HAMS. Increased amylose content in starch seemed to reduce the molecular degradation during milling, which is consistent with a role for amylose as a mechanical plasticiser in starch granules. It is concluded that (i) cryo-milling has differential effects on molecular size and conformation depending on starch granule type, and (ii) deterioration of starch crystalline and molecular order by mechanical treatment is not necessarily linked with the reduction in molecular size. The implication from the results is that the mechanical forces acting during cryo-milling are capable of disrupting helical and crystalline structures without breaking covalent bonds of starch molecules. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Extrusion markedly increased {{the rate of}} starch digestion and reduced the ERS content, irrespective of whether B-type or B- and V-type polymorphs were present. Increasing feed moisture and storage resulted in only slight increases in ERS content, with X-ray diffraction and FTIR also showing small changes in long and short range molecular order, respectively. Analysis of residues from in vitro digestion showed the mechanism of enzyme resistance of granular and extruded high amylose starch to be markedly different, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Enzyme digestion of granular high amylose maize starch showed initial disorganization in structure followed by slow reorganization at later stages of digestion.

New land use policy alters inevitably {{the context in which}} farmers plan their livelihood strategies, that could lead, deliberatly or not, to livelihood changes and subsequent disagreements with local population. The question of how farming systems can or cannot adapt to conservation is a central focus of academic debate and public policy concern. In this paper we assume that conservation measures create disparities among local communities and that farmers ’ adaptation capacities are different. Which types of farmers are more capable of adaptation? What are their room for manoeuvre to become “environmental managers”? From a case study in the eastern rainforest of Madagascar, we propose to seek factors influencing variability in farmers adaptation capacities among contrasting farming systems in the Fianarantsoa forest corridor. We categorise farms on the basis of livelihood and land use strategies, and analyse responses to conservation measures. Our results explain heterogeneity in adaptation capacities, which could be of great interest for a better understanding of farm’s possible evolution in the current perspective of agriculture role in land management and forest conservation...|$|E
40|$|Being heated in {{abundant}} water, native waxy cornstarch displayed {{only one}} endotherm (G), {{while there were}} two endotherms (G and M 2) for native <b>Gelose</b> 50 (G 50) cornstarch. Waxy cornstarch granules could swell dramatically at around the To of endotherm G, while G 50 cornstarch granules presented a less {{significant increase in the}} volume near the To of endotherm G. As the temperature increased up to 70 °C, the scattering objects in both of the cornstarches became looser. Interestingly, when the temperature was 75 °C or higher, mass fractal structures at three scale levels emerged for waxy cornstarch, and a mass fractal structure at the higher scale level and a surface fractal structure at the lower scale level appeared for G 50 cornstarch, suggesting the inhomogeneity at a nano-colloidal level and a nano-particle level respectively for the two starches. The scattering objects at the lower or intermediate scale level could form a mass fractal structure at the higher scale level with different compactness (Dm 1). The average thickness of the semi-crystalline lamellae (d) of the both cornstarches changed slightly with an increase in the temperature and finally disappeared due to the multiple fractal structures. Additionally, the A-type crystalline structure of waxy cornstarch and the B-type crystalline structure of G 50 cornstarch displayed a similar trend with the temperature regarding the anisotropy. For G 50 cornstarch, the V-type crystalline structure required a higher temperature to complete its melting...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{processes}} of decomposition of agar-agar by micro 6 rganisms involves first of all {{a knowledge of the}} chemical nature of the agar. This material is prepared from certain marine algae and, {{due to the fact that}} it is used as a food in the Orient and for medicinal purposes in Europe and America, as well as due to its employment for the preparation of culture media, its chemical nature has received considerable attention. It has been found that the composition of the agar varies with the nature of the plant from which it is obtained. Japanese agar is usually prepared from Gelidium corneum, while other species of Gelidium and species of Gracillaria, Fucus and Eucheuma are also employed in different parts of the world. Although agar contains a considerable amount of ash, themajor part of it consists of one or more hemicelluloses, or carbohydrates which are readily hydrolized by hot dilute mineral acids. The most important constituent of the agar is a galactan, first referred to by Payen as <b>gelose,</b> to which he gave the formula C 6 Hjo 05. Czapek (1913) in summarizing the results of previous investiga-tors, concludes that one-third of the agar consists of galactan. On treatment of agar with nitric acid, mucic and oxalic acids are produced. Pentosans are usually reported to be present in agar but in very small amounts. Fellers (1916) reported the presenc...|$|E
40|$|Grape seed extract (GSE) {{may have}} health {{benefits}} {{in terms of}} the intestinal microflora. Little information is available. Using <b>Gelose</b> 80 (starch=STR) as a source of microflora energy, we hypothesized that in vitro fermentation by porcine intestinal bacteria would be altered by GSE. We used both ileal and fecal digesta from pigs, to represent the microflora of the small and large intestines. Ileal and fecal inocula were added separately to pre-warmed, sealed bottles, containing anaerobic medium and starch, with or without GSE. Anaerobic fermentation was at 39 °C for 96 hours. Gas production was measured intermittently, and end-point samples collected at 96 hours. These samples were analyzed for SCFA using GC. The DMCV was higher for the fecal compared with the ileal fermentation. There was also a significant interaction, so that addition of GSE decreased the gas production for ileal compared with fecal inoculum. Generally speaking, {{there was no difference between}} SCFA values for both ileal samples and the STR_Fec sample. However, addition of GSE led to a significant reduction in SCFA values for the fecal inoculum. Ile-ileal inoculum; Fec-fecal inoculum; DMCV-gas volume/gram DM Feces contains more, and a much greater diversity of microflora than the ileal digesta. Therefore, reduced SCFA with added GSE to the faecal inoculum, suggests that of the larger number of fecal species present, some of the most active ones must be sensitive to the GSE or its metabolites. In terms of SCFA production, the ileal microflora appear to be more robust. Future work will determine whether GSE may have antibiotic properties...|$|E
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} how the multi-scale structure of starch granules changes during acid hydrolysis. The degradation mechanism {{has also been}} discussed. Both the whole native <b>Gelose</b> 80 (G 80) starch in its granule form and the enzyme debranched G 80 starch degraded apparently until a stable size was reached. In contrast, no degradation of the debranched waxy starch was observed from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results. This indicated that amylose and amylopectin were hydrolyzed through cleavage of α-(1  →  4) and α-(1  →  6) linkages, respectively. From X-ray diffraction (XRD), the relative crystallinity was increased with increased acid treatment days. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) {{results showed that the}} lamellar peak intensity and crystalline thickness (d) from 1 D correlation function for G 80 were increased during acid hydrolysis. However, the lamellar structure of waxy starch disappeared quickly. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), two different acid hydrolysis patterns were observed at the starch granule level including the endo-corrosion pattern in waxy starch and the exo-corrosion pattern in G 80. Those differences would lead to the quick degradation of the lamellar structure of waxy starch and contributed to the gradual crystallinity increase for G 80 starch. Thermal degradation behavior from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the thermal decomposition temperature of acid-hydrolyzed starch was shifted to low temperature, which confirmed the molecular weight degradation during acid hydrolysis. This work enables a further understanding of acid hydrolysis mechanism, which is of value for the acid processing of starch-based foods...|$|E
40|$|The {{feeding of}} Xiphinema diversicaudatum was studied on {{seedlings}} of rye grass and of other plants growing in agar. It fed at root-tips, where it induced galls, {{and in the}} piliferous area. Typically, X. diversicaudatum inserted its‘stylet through one or two cells and then commenced feeding on a column of progressively deeper cells. Salivation, which involved a rapid emptying of the ducts of the dorsal oesophageal gland cell, was observed between the frequ nt bouts of oesophageal bulb contractions. Usually, there were several such bouts during feeding on each cell. The rate of bulb contraction declined between salivations: X. divsrsicaudatunz also had periods of apparent inactivity when feeding deep within either the root-tip or the piliferous region and these were also thought to be periods of a distinct type of salivation. This behaviour {{was associated with the}} formation of a spherical structure at the stylet tip and subsequent prolonged periods of ingestion without further salivation. Estimates were made from video recordings of the amounts ingested and these were found to be large, especially during periods of prolonged ingestion which occurred when nematodes were feeding deep within root-tip galls and the piliferous region.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} shear on the starch degradation, with a particular focus on the changes in molecular and lamellar structures. Corn starches with different amylose/amylopectin ratios (waxy corn starch, or WCS: 1 : 99; normal corn starch, or NCS: 25 : 75; and <b>Gelose</b> 80 starch, or G 80 : 80 : 20) were used as model materials to be processed using a Haake twin-rotor mixer for different times. Molecular and lamellar structural analysis was performed using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The degree of damage of starch at the granule level was evaluated by an assay kit. The results showed that amylose molecules in starch granules did not change significantly, while amylopectin molecules degraded to a stable size caused by the shear treatment. The average thickness of semi-crystalline lamellae disappeared rapidly during processing. A typical positive deviation from Porod 2 ̆ 7 s law at a high q region was observed, attributed {{to the presence of}} thermal density fluctuations or mixing within phases. Nonetheless, the degree of mixing within phases for the processed samples was lower than the native starch. The study of the mass fractal structure indicated that the scattering objects of the processed starches were more compact than those of the native counterparts. Furthermore, waxy corn starch (containing mostly amylopectin) experienced the greatest granule damage than the other starches. All the results showed that the rigid crystal structure in amylopectin is more sensitive to the shear treatment than the flexible amorphous structure in amylose. This mechanistic understanding at the microstructure level is helpful in designing the processing of starch-based foods or plastics with desired functional properties...|$|E
