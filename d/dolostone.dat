5|$|In 1825, {{engineers}} {{working on}} the Delaware and Hudson Canal found large numbers of <b>dolostone</b> rocks in the region, which enabled the production of natural cement. The rocks contained dolomite of the Upper Silurian's Rondout formation. Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral, and was mined.

5|$|Rosendale is {{underlain}} by a shale {{member of}} the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines {{the bottom of the}} Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of fossiliferous limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation's <b>dolostone</b> member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the Wisconsonian glaciation.|$|E

40|$|Moderate {{to large}} {{earthquakes}} often nucleate within and propagate through carbonates {{in the shallow}} crust. The occurrence of thick belts of low-strain fault-related breccias is relatively common within carbonate damage zones and was generally interpreted {{in relation to the}} quasi-static growth of faults. Here we report the occurrence of hundreds of meters thick belts of intensely fragmented <b>dolostones</b> along a major transpressive fault zone in the Italian Southern Alps. These fault rocks have been shattered in-situ with negligible shear strain accumulation. The conditions of in-situ shattering were investigated by deforming the host <b>dolostones</b> in uniaxial compression both under quasi-static (strain rate ∼ 10 − 5 s− 1) and dynamic (strain rate > 50 s− 1) loading. <b>Dolostones</b> deformed up to failure under low-strain rate were affected by single to multiple discrete extensional fractures sub-parallel to the loading direction. <b>Dolostones</b> deformed under high-strain rate were shattered above a strain rate threshold of ∼ 120 s− 1 and peak stresses on average larger than the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock, whereas they were split in few fragments or remained macroscopically intact at lower strain rates. Fracture networks were investigated in three dimensions showing that low- and high-strain rate damage patterns (fracture intensity, aperture, orientation) were significantly different, with the latter being similar to that of natural in-situ shattered <b>dolostones</b> (i. e., comparable fragment size distributions). In-situ shattered <b>dolostones</b> were thus interpreted as the result of high energy dynamic fragmentation (dissipated strain energies > 1. 8 MJ/m 3) similarly to pulverized rocks in crystalline lithologies. Given their seismic origin, the presence of in-situ shattered <b>dolostones</b> can be used in earthquake hazard studies as evidence of the propagation of seismic ruptures at shallow depth...|$|R

Rare-earth element distribution display seawater-like patterns. Redox-sensitive trace elements indicate suboxic conditions. High Ba/Al ratios can be related to high organic productivity. delta C- 13 values are nearly constant at - 3. 7 %(0) and delta O- 18 (PDB) are about - 6 %(0). Sr- 87 /Sr- 96 ratios range between 0. 7061 and 0. 7073. The delta C- 13 signatures are nearly similar to those of coeval cap <b>dolostones</b> from the northern part of the Basin. The y <b>dolostones</b> change upwards to limestones with secondary textures, as well as more negative delta C- 13 and higher Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratio. Therefore, only the <b>dolostones</b> witness the post-glacial conditions in seawater. It is proposed that, due to a bloom of microbial productivity following ice thaw, organic matter likely accumulated at the water-sediment interface and was consumed by sulphate-reducing bacteria, leading to the precipitation of delta C- 13 -negative dolomite. This microbially mediated model is supported by present-day field evidence from hypersaline lagoons in Brazil and by previously published culture experiments. It is consistent with the sedimentological and geochemical data from the Ghana cap <b>dolostones</b> and can be applied to other Neoproterozoic cap <b>dolostones</b> worldwide...|$|R

In order to determine which stratigraphic unit(s) provided this terrigenous do-lomite, the iron contents of Triassic and Jurassic <b>dolostones</b> were analyzed, with an electron microprobe, and {{compared with that of}} the Miocene terrigenous dolomite. As was expected from their present greater surface exposure, Jurrassic <b>dolostones</b> proved to be the principal source. The trace of probable Triassic dolomite detritus in Miocene samples analyzed is proportionate to the small area of Triassic exposure relative to that of the Jurassic. Diagenetic dolomite in Miocene host calcarenites occurs as l) pervasive crystals of fine- to medium-crystalline dolomite and 2) overgrowths on the terrigenous dolomite crystals. These two varieties commonly occur together, but overgrowths occur in some samples {{in the absence of the}} pervasive variety, which indicates that "seeding " by terrigenous dolomite promoted iagenetic dolomitization. Calcitization of Miocene dolomite favored centers of the pervasive variety of dolomite crystals and the inner margins of dolomite overgrowths.

25|$|Dropping dilute acid (often 10% HCl) aids in {{distinguishing}} carbonates {{from other}} mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate (2−) group, which causes {{the affected area}} to effervesce, giving off carbon dioxide gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered. An example of this test is done when distinguish calcite from dolomite, especially within rocks (limestone and <b>dolostone</b> respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce. Zeolite minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.|$|E

40|$|The Triassic Evaporites (TE) of the Umbria-Marche Apennines, a {{sedimentary}} succession {{made up of}} {{a sequence}} of alternating sulphates (anhydrites and gypsum) and <b>dolostones,</b> represent a key lithology in terms of sealing properties and earthquake triggering. Here we: (1) report laboratory measurements of density, porosity, Vp, Vs, seismic anisotropy and permeability at effective confining pressures from 0 to 100 MPa, conducted on samples of TE collected from both outcrops and boreholes; and (2) attempt to upscale the laboratory results to larger scale geophysical investigation, such as Vp sonic logs, seismic tomography and in situ measurements of pore-fluid pressure. The average laboratory P-wave velocity is 6. 0 km/s for <b>dolostones,</b> 4. 6 km/s for gypsum-dolostones and 5. 8 km/s for anhydrites, at ambient pressure. As effective confining pressure is increased up to 100 MPa, the average P-wave velocity increases to 7. 0 km/s for <b>dolostones,</b> 5. 3 km/s for gypsum and 6. 4 km/s for anhydrites. Vp/Vs ratios appear to be independent of confining pressure, with average values of ~ 1. 8 to ~ 2. 2 for sulphates and ~ 1. 9 to ~ 2. 2 for <b>dolostones,</b> respectively, for dry and saturated conditions. All samples are characterized by very low permeability (10 - 18 m 2 to 10 - 21 m 2), with the higher values for gypsum-dolostones and fractured <b>dolostones</b> samples. The Vp profiles obtained from ultrasonic laboratory measurements match well the in situ Vp profiles measured using sonic logs. In the laboratory, the Vp/Vs ratio increases when pressurized pore fluids are present, in agreement with 4 D seismic tomography that relates the increase in Vp/Vs ratio to the migration of fluids during the 1997 Umbria-Marche seismic sequence (Mmax~ 6. 0) that nucleates within the TE.
