40|$|A case of {{non-specific}} <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the {{urinary bladder}} is reported. A 16 -year-old {{high school student}} visited our outpatient clinic with the com- plaints of fever and severe perineal discomfort after a 3 -week medication. Diagnostic imagings showed a mass formation at the anterior wall of the urinary bladder extending to the surrounding tissue, and an osteolytic change of the pubic bone was recognized. The first two biopsies by a needle and TUR failed to diagnose. A sufficient amount of tissue obtained by an open biopsy finally led to the diagnosis of non-specific inflammatory granulation. The patient received treatment with an antibiotic and 10 mg/day of p. o. predonisolone, {{which resulted in a}} 60 % reduction of the mass in a week and its complete disappearance in two months. The steroid therapy was terminated after 3 months. We collected only 9 cases of non-specific <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granuloma</b> of the urinary bladder in the Japanese literature.

40|$|A single {{enhancing}} lesion in {{the brain}} parenchyma, also called an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granuloma,</b> is a frequent neurologic diagnosis. One of the commonest causes of this lesion is human neurocysticercosis, the infection by the larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. Following the demonstration that viable cysticercosis cysts survive in good conditions for several years in the human brain, single cysticercal granulomas have been consistently interpreted as representing late degeneration of a long-established parasite. On the basis of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory evidence detailed in this article, we hypothesize that in most cases these inflammatory lesions correspond to parasites that die in the early steps of infection, likely as the natural result of the host immunity overcoming mild infections...|$|E
40|$|An {{isolated}} and unilateral foot drop due to intracranial lesion is quite rare.

30|$|Of 77 lesions, CESM {{detected}} three cancers {{that were}} misdiagnosed as benign lesions by MRI including one intra-cystic papillary carcinoma (2.5 Â cm) and two DCIS (7 Â mm and 10 Â mm). The two DCIS showed characteristics of benign tumors on MRI i.e. regular outline, uniform enhancement, typeIof time density curve and ADC value of 1.28 Â ÃÂ  10 â 3 Â mm 2 /s. The two lesions showed enhancement on combined image and clustered microcalcifications on low-energy image by using CESM. DCIS is breast malignancy {{that tends to}} be misdiagnosed by MRI (Teifke et al. 2002; Fallenberg et al. 2014). This {{may be due to}} a lack of neoangiogenesis in DCIS, resulting in less enhancement or more unspecific enhancement in MRI. The intra-cystic papillary carcinoma had very few enhanced solid components on MRI, but showed irregular enhanced cyst wall on CESM. Two <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granulomas</b> were misdiagnosed by both CESM and MRI according to routine diagnostic criteria. We reviewed the two cases and speculated that the sign of ring- or honeycomb-like enhancement may provide clues for the diagnosis of inflammatory disease.|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} results of cysticercus-specific IgG {{antibody}} levels, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with brain CT findings in suspected neurocysticercosis and to assess the clinical significance of ELISA.

Patients with multiple cysts without enhancement on CT, which were thought to represent viable cysticerci, were positive by ELISA. Those with cysts with enhancement or poorly defined low densities or enhancing nodules, which represented cysticerci on degener-ation, were also positive by ELISA. Those with multiple spotty calcifications, which represent cysticerci in the inactive stage, were negative by ELISA.

40|$|SummaryWe report {{three cases}} of pseudotumoral lesion {{secondary}} to total hip replacement using metal on polyethylene bearings, presenting two distinct macroscopic aspects: (a) classic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granuloma</b> and, in one case, (b) onset of hematoma associated with gluteal vessel lesions, probably {{affected by the}} pseudotumoral process. Diagnosis was radiographic, with CT-scan serving to confirm and, more importantly, to reveal extension and analyze surrounding tissue. Arteriography is needed when the lesion is liquid, and biopsy may be envisaged depending upon the clinical situation. In all three cases, histology was typically that of granulomatous lesions related to wear debris.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a human {{pulmonary}} dirofilariasis in a 59 -year-old man. At the medical examination, a chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass, measuring 18 15 mm in diameter, with an irregular margin {{on the bottom of the}} right lower lobe. We could not neglect the possibility of a primary lung cancer, and therefore, a lung partial resection was performed under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The intra-operative pathological findings revealed <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granuloma</b> with coagulation necrosis and no malignant cells. The permanent pathological examination showed occlusion of the peripheral pulmonary artery by worms and formation of a necrotic mass surrounded by reactive inflammation and hemorrhage.

30|$|Another {{inflammatory}} disease where hybrid PET/MRI {{may play a}} pivotal role is the cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis. In up to 40 % of cases, the initial clinical manifestation of this insidious disease is sudden cardiac death (Sekiguchi et al. 1980). In case of cardiac involvement, the myocardium is infiltrated with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granulomas</b> which may result in scarring, malignant arrhythmia, and heart failure. It is obvious that cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis must be ruled out reliably. Usually, the guidelines of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare are used to estimate the probability of cardiac involvement. However, these guidelines only recommend cardiac MRI or Ga- 67 scintigraphy as imaging tests and not FDG PET. Accumulating evidence suggests a valuable and important role of FDG PET regarding the diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy guidance of cardiac sarcoidosis and an expert consensus clearly recommended this method (Birnie et al. 2014; Slart et al. 2018). A myocardial perfusion study (such as N- 13 ammonia PET) may add to the FDG PET for the differentiation between early stage, advanced stage, or healed cardiac sarcoidosis, and also have prognostic implications (Blankstein et al. 2014). In principle, FDG PET may be combined with MRI perfusion. MRI MPI, however, only images {{a certain number of}} slices (most often three). There are approaches to perform MRI-based MPI of the entire left ventricle, but this is not implemented in clinical routine yet (Wissmann et al. 2017). Therefore, certain parts of the heart (such as the apex) may not be adequately assessed with a MRI MPI/FDG PET approach. The combination of LGE MRI with FDG PET may have an additional benefit, in the exact illustration of myocardial scarring which is important in the case of ICD implantation (Schneider et al. 2014). While there are some case reports and smaller studies on hybrid FDG PET/MRI for cardiac sarcoidosis, a prospective trial with larger patient numbers is still missing (Hanneman et al. 2017; Schneider et al. 2014; Wada et al. 2016; Kiko et al. 2018; Wicks et al. 2018). An alternative approach may be the assessment of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granulomas</b> in the myocardium using radiotracers targeting the somatostatin receptor (e.g., Ga- 68 DOTANOC). While first reports using this approach are available for PET/CT, there is no clinical experience with simultaneous PET/MRI (Slart et al. 2017; Gormsen et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>granulomas</b> {{constituted}} {{of various}} proportions of macrophages, polynuclear (PMNs) and mononuclear cells were induced in adult pathogen-free mice by injecting polyacrylamide beads into subcutaneous pouches. Using specific anti-mouse alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) antibodies, {{the presence of}} AFP was immunocytochemically demonstrated in the cytoplasm of macrophages and of immature PMNs (mature PMNs and mononuclear cells were AFP negative). AFP-labelling started as soon as 36 h after granuloma induction and reached a maximum 60 - 72 h later, to disappear on day 5. The examination of different organs in these mice also showed a transitory labelling for AFP of liver hepatocytes and of elements of kidney and of exocrine pancreas. Parallel to these findings, the selective concentration inside the granulomatous pouches of radiolabelled AFP injected {{in the course of}} inflammation was observed. These results suggest that (a) shortly after the inflammatory reaction the synthesis of AFP is resumed by the liver; (b) the newly synthesized AFP is secreted in the serum and preferentially taken up by the granulomas; and (c) consequently, in adult mice, AFP behaves as a positive acute phase reactant. The physiopathological implications of these facts are discussed in relation with the biological properties of AFP...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} procedure, {{postoperative}} outcome and complications {{of a new}} technique for ureteral implantation {{by means of a}} three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy in dogs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of dogs requiring ureteral implantation between April 2007 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Data retrieved included signalment, preoperative biochemistry results, details of the surgical procedure, perioperative and postoperative complications, postoperative biochemistry results and outcome. RESULTS: Nine dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Follow-up times ranged from 10 to 79 months (median 30 months), with 8 of 9 dogs having an excellent long-term outcome and no major postoperative complications. One dog with follicular cystitis as a comorbidity developed obstruction from <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granuloma</b> and required revision surgery. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The three-stitch technique for ureteral implantation compares favourably to previously documented techniques in terms of outcome and complication rates. Reduced tissue handling and a decreased volume of suture material may be beneficial for healing. The technique is also faster than previously described options, which may be of benefit in unstable patients requiring ureteral implantation due to traumatic injury or rupture...|$|E

Typical <b>inflammatory</b> <b>granulomas</b> were found in WT mice, while, iNOS(-/-) mice presented incipient <b>granulomas</b> with intense <b>inflammatory</b> process and necrosis. Additionally, splenocytes from iNOS(-/-) mice did not produce nitric oxide, however, their proliferative response to Con-A was impaired, just like infected WT mice. Moreover, infected iNOS(-/-) mice presented a mixed pattern of immune response, releasing high levels of both Th 1 (IL- 12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and Th 2 (IL- 4 and IL- 10) cytokines. These {{data suggest that the}} enzyme iNOS is a resistance factor during paracoccidioidomycosis by controlling fungal proliferation, by influencing cytokines production, and by appeasing the development of a high inflammatory response and consequently formation of necrosis. However, iNOS-derived nitric oxide seems not being the unique factor responsible for immunosuppression observed in infections caused by P. brasiliensis. (c) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.
