5|$|The RFC 6520 <b>Heartbeat</b> Extension tests TLS/DTLS secure {{communication}} links by allowing a computer {{at one end}} of a connection to send a <b>Heartbeat</b> Request message, consisting of a payload, typically a text string, along with the payload's length as a 16-bit integer. The receiving computer then must send exactly the same payload back to the sender.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem can}} be fixed by {{ignoring}} <b>Heartbeat</b> Request messages that ask for more data than their payload needs.|$|E

5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS <b>heartbeat</b> extension, thus the bug's name derives from <b>heartbeat.</b> The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the <b>heartbeat,</b> and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
5|$|Many major {{web sites}} patched the bug or {{disabled}} the <b>Heartbeat</b> Extension {{within days of}} its announcement, but {{it is unclear whether}} potential attackers were aware of it earlier and to what extent it was exploited.|$|E
50|$|As {{the video}} continues, {{additional}} symbolism becomes apparent. The {{start of the}} song’s instrumental music contains percussion reminiscent of the sound of <b>heartbeats.</b> The audio image of <b>heartbeats</b> is then synchronized to a large visual image of a beating heart.|$|R
50|$|Ventricular {{tachycardia}} {{represents a}} series of irregular <b>heartbeats</b> that may cause the heart to completely shut down resulting in cessation of oxygen flow. Further, irregular <b>heartbeats</b> may result in formation of blood clots, thus leading to oxygen deprivation to all organs.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Heartbeat</b> Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented the <b>Heartbeat</b> Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The defect spread with the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. <b>Heartbeat</b> support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Version 1.0.1g of OpenSSL adds some bounds {{checks to}} prevent the buffer over-read. For example, the {{following}} test was introduced {{to determine whether a}} <b>heartbeat</b> request would trigger Heartbleed; it silently discards malicious requests.|$|E

Eddie leads the group in a number that results in Bird's girlfriend fainting in Eddie's arms. The <b>Heartbeats</b> win the contest and the interest of Big Red, who owns Big Red Records. Big Red offers them a deal, but Jimmy and his wife Eleanor, aware of Big Red's corruption, decline. The group instead releases their first single on Jimmy's own independent label and searches for a record company they can trust, but no one else is interested aside from a label which wants to buy Duck's songs for a group they've already signed, The Five Horsemen. The <b>Heartbeats</b> sign with Big Red.|$|R

These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular <b>heartbeat,</b> high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E
