40|$|Abstract. The {{obtainment}} of ultrafine grain microstructures, by {{the application}} of process parameters which are potentially feasible under industrial conditions, is attractive {{to develop a new}} generation of low alloy steel (Ultrafine Grain Steel, UFG) characterized by high strength and toughness, good cold/warm formability, environmentally-friendly process. The ferrite grain size refinement beyond existing levels by means of <b>hot</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> without requiring drastic plant changes, can be achieved by lowering the rolling temperature down to the range Ae 3 - Ar 3 in the finishing stands. In this temperature range different metallurgical mechanisms may take place. Austenite recrystallization is slower and there is a greater chance of obtaining non-recrystallized deformed austenite (pancake), which after phase transformation will give finer ferrite (Heavy Gamma Deformation). Or, in alternative, Deformation Induced Ferrite Transformation can occur especially in C-Mn steels, promoting the formation of ultrafine ferrite grains (DIFT). Most of the existing studies on UFG steel focus on flat products. In this paper the mechanisms to be exploited for producing UFG long products are identified and examined on different low and medium carbon non-alloyed steels, as the common grades used for fastener applications. In particular, Heavy Gamma Deformation and DIFT are investigated through laboratory tests aimed at determining the process parameters affecting the two mechanisms in different ranges of chemical composition. On the basis of the results found, some basic concepts for industrialization on modern <b>hot</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> will be given...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the optimization of the thickness control system on the <b>hot</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> at The Danish Steel Works Ltd. The optimization is done by replacing the existing linear analog thickness controller with a nonlinear digital controller. The discrete time control law used for the digital controller is derived from a multivariable controller which is designed using a model based on data from the rolling mill at The Danish Steel Works Ltd, see [Pedersen, 1995 b]. The implementation of the digital controller therefore also serves as a preliminary test of the multivariable control law. Toverify the performance of the new control law its performance and stability of the two control laws is compared. 2.
