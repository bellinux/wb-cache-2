5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are endothermic compounds). They are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|Workers who {{are older}} {{typically}} start satellite nests {{and have more}} developed ovaries. Younger and lesser-developed workers join the satellite after its establishment. The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is very <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are needed {{for the establishment of}} the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest. Although, after several months the main nest can become abandoned. If not enough workers follow the initial worker to the new nest, then it will most likely fail as a satellite.|$|E
50|$|These {{relatively}} rare landforms are <b>important</b> ecologically, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> support unique plant communities and provide important services to terrestrial wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Those {{excavations}} {{are considered}} <b>important</b> mainly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> proved that a heavy Euboean influenced settlement was established already from the 11th century.|$|R
50|$|These {{two modes}} {{are the most}} <b>important</b> <b>because</b> (a) <b>they</b> exist at all {{frequencies}} and (b) in most practical situations they carry more energy than the higher-order modes.|$|R
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} pair of transits {{occurred in}} December 1874 and December 1882; the following pair {{will occur in}} December 2117 and December 2125. The oldest film known is the 1874 Passage de Venus, showing the 1874 Venus transit of the sun. Historically, transits of Venus were <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> allowed astronomers to determine {{the size of the}} astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Horrocks in 1639. Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to observe a transit of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Despite U.S. {{declarations}} of neutrality and German accountability for its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading {{to calls for}} war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program over three years for 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had to handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the}} war 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E
50|$|Generally, large of {{processor}} register {{shows how}} big numbers core of processor can count one time. Number of registers is <b>important</b> too, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> can connect {{together for a}} moment with some instructions.|$|R
50|$|Metallo-beta-lactamases are <b>important</b> enzymes <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are {{involved}} in the breakdown of antibiotics by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is unclear whether metallo-beta-lactamase activity evolved once or twice within the superfamily; if twice, this would suggest structural exaptation.|$|R
50|$|Pottery {{during the}} Goryeo dynasty reached {{very high levels}} of refinement. The kilns at Buan-gun in Jeollabuk-do {{produced}} earthenware while the Ganjingun kilns produced celadon wares. The kiln sites are <b>important</b> today <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are {{the remnants of the}} pottery culture.|$|R
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> provide {{shelter for}} {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are {{coniferous}} and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, an {{increasing}} number of instances have been noted of tsetse flies occupying unusual, and often man-made, habitats. Recently, some aberrant populations have become <b>important,</b> either <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have drawn attention to new aspects of trypanosomiasis transmission or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have necessitated modifications of established tsetse control methods...|$|R
25|$|Thus {{the row of}} {{terraces}} in Jeffrey Street {{have become}} historically <b>important</b> largely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are the survivors. Smaller rows survived {{on the west side}} of the bridge, but the row in Jeffrey Street is the longest surviving row on the North Shore.|$|R
40|$|Modeling and {{analysis}} of biochemical systems are <b>important</b> tasks <b>because</b> <b>they</b> can unlock insights into the complicated dynamics of systems which are difficult or expensive to test experimentally.

25|$|Directional-hemispherical {{reflectance}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as black-sky albedo and bi-hemispherical reflectance as white-sky albedo. These terms are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{parameters}} {{breaking wave}} height, wave peel angle (α), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters {{have been used}} to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.|$|E
50|$|These {{numbers are}} NOT the IPC {{value of these}} CPUs.

40|$|This report {{describes}} two {{new cases}} of BWS. This diagnosis of BWS may be missed because of variable or incomplete clinical expression. Recognition of such patients is <b>important,</b> however, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{have the potential for}} development of neoplasias. There also appears to be an increased risk of malignancies associated with hemihypertrophy and BWS...|$|R
50|$|The surface {{vertices}} are {{the points}} where each optical surface crosses the optical axis. <b>They</b> are <b>important</b> primarily <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are the physically measurable parameters {{for the position}} of the optical elements, and so the positions of the cardinal points must be known with respect to the vertices to describe the physical system.|$|R
25|$|Fire Fighter (White helmet) is {{the lowest}} rank of {{operational}} fire personnel, {{but they are the}} most <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> make up the numbers. These fire-fighters can be trained just as much as a more highly ranked person but they do not usually take a leadership role at an incident.|$|E
25|$|Her {{literary}} {{contributions are}} particularly <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{open up the}} Anglo-European prevailing definitions of the American literary tradition to accommodate the often underrepresented traditions, priorities, and ideas about identity that {{in a general way}} characterize many American Indian cultures and in a more specific way form the bedrock of Silko's Laguna heritage and experience.|$|E
25|$|These two {{chemicals}} {{were very}} <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> enabled {{the introduction of}} a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for bleaching cloth.|$|E
50|$|These {{parameters}} can {{be entered}} into models {{that provide a}} statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is {{a key factor in}} determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile.

25|$|The {{maneuvers}} {{consist of}} four distinct actions, each helping {{to determine the}} position of the fetus. The maneuvers are <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> help determine the position and presentation of the fetus, which in conjunction with correct assessment of the shape of the maternal pelvis can indicate whether the delivery is going to be complicated, or whether a Cesarean section is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Heating by {{low-energy}} cosmic rays: The first mechanism {{proposed for}} heating the ISM was heating by low-energy cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are an efficient heating source able to penetrate {{in the depths}} of molecular clouds. Cosmic rays transfer energy to gas through both ionization and excitation and to free electrons through Coulomb interactions. Low-energy cosmic rays (a few MeV) are more <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are far more numerous than high-energy cosmic rays.|$|E
25|$|In Nature, sucrose {{is present}} in many plants, and in {{particular}} their roots, fruits and nectars, because {{it serves as a}} way to store energy, primarily from photosynthesis. Many mammals, birds, insects and bacteria accumulate and feed on the sucrose in plants and for some it is their main food source. Seen from a human consumption perspective, honeybees are especially <b>important</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> accumulate sucrose and produce honey, an important foodstuff all over the world. The carbohydrates in honey itself primarily consists of fructose and glucose with trace amounts of sucrose only.|$|E
500|$|There are {{a variety}} of end users to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are <b>important</b> forecasts <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are used to protect life and property. [...] Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.|$|R
30|$|For {{governmental}} actors, this in an <b>important</b> procedure <b>because</b> <b>they</b> usually {{share common}} goals, despite potential ideological differences due to coalition governments. In most political systems, the various government departments are tied together by common objectives, parties, coalition contracts, or presidents. The {{aim of the}} method is to unify governmental actors by aligning them with each other.|$|R
25|$|Elderly {{populations are}} also a good target for MMR-based screening, because the {{radiation}} risk is less <b>important</b> and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have {{a higher risk of}} tuberculosis (85 per 100,000 in developed countries, in the average). In Japan, for example, it is still used routinely, and the Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association (JATA) reported the detection of 228 cases in 965,440 chest radiographs in 1996 alone.|$|R
