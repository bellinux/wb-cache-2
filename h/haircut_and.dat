40|$|Regulators {{aiming to}} ward off the next {{financial}} market failure need to implement rules to smooth the boom-bust cycle in margin requirements <b>and</b> <b>haircuts</b> used in securities financing and derivative transactions, which seriously exacerbated the last financial crisis. In this study, the author argues that key elements in a system-wide regulatory framework should include rules to mitigate swings between loose terms for margins <b>and</b> <b>haircuts</b> in boom times, and tightened terms during busts. Longworth emphasizes “through-the-cycle” <b>haircuts</b> <b>and</b> initial margins, the potential use of add-ons to <b>haircuts</b> <b>and</b> margins by macroprudential authorities, and market practices that are less procyclical than they were before and during the crisis.

25|$|Early in 1996, Sting's {{appearance}} {{started to}} change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing his blond flattop <b>haircut,</b> <b>and</b> he often wore black tights with a multi-colored scorpion, although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful face paint. Sting teamed {{with his old}} friend Luger, who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the January 22 edition of Nitro. The team often retained the championship {{as a result of}} Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for WCW Uncensored in March, Harlem Heat member Booker T teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against The Giant at Slamboree in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of Nitro.|$|E

500|$|Joseph Rudolf [...] "Rudy" [...] Nappi, {{the artist}} from 1953 to 1979, {{illustrated}} a more average teenager.

Nappi gave Nancy Peter Pan collars, shirtwaist dresses, a pageboy (later a flip) <b>haircut,</b> <b>and</b> the occasional pair of jeans. Nancy's hair color was changed from blonde to strawberry-blonde, reddish-blonde, or titian {{by the end of}} the decade.

Veitch and Brown started Matthew's House, an organization they founded as [...] "a ministry to help people working in or addicted to the sex industry". They chose the name [...] "Matthew's House" [...] in reference to the Calling of Matthew, a gospel episode in which Jesus eats with sinners at the home of Matthew the Apostle.|$|E
