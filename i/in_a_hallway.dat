5|$|On July 14, 2012, Barr came in second, {{losing the}} {{nomination}} to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate despite suggestions {{that she could}} choose Barr. Barr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate, (Farheen Hakeem), to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> reportedly ensued. Barr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway.</b> She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a corner of a room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E

25|$|School of the Art Institute of Chicago student David Nelson created Mirth & Girth, a {{painting}} that depicted Washington wearing women's lingerie and holding a pencil, which was briefly displayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> at the school on May 11, 1988. City aldermen {{and members of the}} Chicago Police Department soon seized the painting then later returned it with a five-inch gash on the canvas. Nelson, assisted by the ACLU, subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. The complainants eventually split a US$95,000 (1994, US$138,000 in 2008) settlement from the city.|$|E
25|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} {{in the house and}} grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet {{on the second floor of}} his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a miter saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later.

Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E

500|$|According to Pixar {{designer}} Jason Deamer, [...] "Most of {{the characters}} were designed while Jan [...] was still directing... He has a real eye for sculpture." [...] For example, according to Pinkava, the critic Anton Ego was designed to resemble a vulture. Rat expert Debbie Ducommun (a.k.a. the [...] "Rat Lady") was consulted on rat habits and characteristics. A vivarium containing pet rats sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> {{for more than a}} year so animators could study the movement of the animals' fur, noses, ears, paws, and tails as they ran. The cast members strove to make their French accents authentic yet understandable. John Ratzenberger notes that he often segued into an Italian accent. To save time, human characters were designed and animated without toes.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Kathleen Willey {{alleged that}} Clinton groped her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> in 1993.

On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.|$|E
