40|$|The {{increasing}} use <b>of</b> fossil <b>fuels</b> has led {{to increased}} emissions of sulphur oxides into the air, which is {{a major cause of}} acid rain. Legislation already adopted in 2009 stipulates that the maximum level of sulphur allowed in fuels is only 10 ppm. The process of hydrodesulphurization (HDS) used in refineries is based on very expensive physico-chemical techniques, and has limitations in the removal of organic sulphur. As for stricter legislation on the maximum levels of sulphur in fossil fuels, the most HDS recalcitrant compounds needs to be removed. This implies an increase in the intensity of the physical-chemical treatment and inherently its associated costs. As a result, the recalcitrant compounds to HDS represent a significant barrier to the achievement of very low levels of sulphur in some petroleum fractions. The alternative to the physical-chemical treatment could be the use of biological processes (biodesulphurisation) which is more effective for the desulphurization <b>of</b> fossil <b>fuels,</b> especially as the removal of sulphur covalently bound to organic matrices. The biodesulphurisation (BDS) occurs in more mild conditions of operation under conditions of atmospheric pressure and temperature, giving greater specificity of reaction {{due to the nature of}} the biocatalysts, not requiring molecular hydrogen. Thus, in the last 15 years there has been an increase of studies involving the use of microorganisms with the ability to specifically remove the HDS recalcitrant sulphur compounds. Several model compounds such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), DBT sulphone or benzothiophene (BT) are used in BDS studies to characterise organic sulphur in coal, coal tars and crude oils. The desulphurising microorganisms are able to remove the sulphur atom from these compounds and use it in their metabolism. However, such compounds are very toxic to the cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the toxicity of several compounds used in BDS studies, such as DBT and its derivatives and organic solvents used to dissolve these hydrocarbons, to two typical desulphurising strains, namely: Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1 B and Rhodococcus eritropolis strain D 1. The toxicity bioassays evaluated the inhibitory effect of the studied compounds to the described bacteria by measuring the respiration rate (mg O 2 /l) under defined conditions in the presence of different concentrations of those compounds. The inhibitory or toxic effect of each chemical at a specific concentration is expressed as a percent of the baseline respiration rate. From these results the several IC 50 s were estimated and are described in Table 1. These toxicity values showed that strain 1 B was less sensitive for almost all of the hydrocarbons, which is an important advantage considering the <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> fossil <b>fuels</b> process. On the other hand, strain 1 B was more sensitive to dimethylformamide (DMF), a typical solvent used in BDS studies. However, a good correlation can be observed between IC 50 - 1 B versus IC 50 -D 1 (IC 50 -D 1 = 0. 504 x IC 50 - 1 B + 2. 84; r 2 = 0. 908, p < 0. 05) ...|$|R

40|$|After {{injection}} of calcium carbide and magnesium during <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> hot metal, the slag is normally solid and contains {{large amounts of}} iron. Besides the enclosed iron droplets in the slag, drawn-off hot metal during slag skimming also accounts for iron losses during <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> hot metal. Iron losses during hot metal desulphurisation using both calcium carbide (mono-injection), and calcium carbide and magnesium (co-injection), have been studied by large-scale investigations of slag from the slag pit as well as slag sampling during the desulphurisation process at SSAB EMEA in Luleå. An alkali-containing mineral, nepheline syenite, was mixed together with thecalcium carbide to facilitate slag formation during desulphurisation and to enhance the separation of iron from the slag. Even though the addition of nepheline syenite resulted in a more fine-grained slag, no reduction in the iron content in the slag before slag skimming was observed. The addition of 5 wt-% of nepheline syenite to the calcium carbide during mono-injection decreased the magnetic fraction of the slag from the slag pit from 2. 5 wt-% to 1. 9 wt-%. The decrease in the larger magnetic fractions combined with the improved iron yield may arise from a more effective slag skimming due to the change in slag consistency. During co-injection with magnesium and calcium carbide, the magnetic fraction of the slag from the slag pit decreased from 3. 2 wt-% to 3. 1 wt-% {{with the addition of}} 10 wt-% of nepheline syenite. Even though nepheline syenite has a positive effect on the slag skimming, due to a decrease in larger magnetic fractions, the total magnetic iron losses have not decreased significantly. A plausible explanation for the lack of improved iron yield during co-injection in the present study could be that the increased turbulence during {{injection of}} magnesium counteracts any positive effect from addition of nepheline syenite on the slag properties. Finally, no negative effect on the reagent efficiency was observed during the trials with addition of nepheline syenite.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Acidic {{drainage}} as {{a result}} of mining and mineral processing activities is a growing concern. The effects of Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) include environmental pollution in the affected areas and beyond. As South Africa has water challenges, the potential threat of continual depletion of useable water resources through their contamination by ARD and other mining activities may affect economic productivity, as well as quality of life. Currently used ARD remediation measures are variable and costly, not only in South Africa but worldwide. End of pipe approaches such as treatment by neutralisation fail {{to reduce the risk of}} ARD generation and provide long term solutions. Further it fails to address the limited resource utilisation of the byproduct materials, currently disposed of as ARD forming wastes. The Department of Chemical Engineering, at UCT, has focused research onto the prevention of ARD generation and minimisation of waste. One approach proposed is the two stage froth flotation process for separating sulphides, responsible for ARD formation, from the remaining tailings, leaving these benign with respect to ARD. Testwork results have proven its technical feasibility using porphyry copper tailings, fine coal and more recently gold tailings. Historically, ultrafine coal was not treated by most collieries in South Africa, but disposed as waste. Oxidation of the pyrite in the coal leads to generation of acidic water. In this project, an economic analysis of the coal two stage flotation process for the mitigation of ARD formation is considered.

The research was conducted using chromium-nickel- molybdenum steel intended for heat treatment in order to produce crankshafts. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in a ladle furnace with the capacity of 65 Mg of steel. Data from 10 melts were analysed. Samples of refining slag and metal were taken to analyse their chemical composition. On their basis researchers analysed the process <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> steel at the ladle furnace workstation. Calculations were made concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag to determine the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations. The calculations were made using a thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. Findings: Analysing the process <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> steel under slag with the average chemical composition of: CaO – 54. 0 %, Al 2 O 3 - 30. 2 %, SiO 2 9. 0 %, MgO – 8. 2 %, and FeO content at the level of 0. 94 % drew attention to a high degree <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> at the level of 86 %. Due to this fact it was possible to obtain high basicity of slag: V=CaO/SiO 2 at the level of 6. 21. Mannesmann index, which characterizes the ability of slag to remove sulphur and non-metallic inclusions from steel and is defined as M=(CaO/SiO 2) /Al 2 O 3, amounted to 0. 21 %- 1 and was too low in comparison to the required one ranging from 0. 35 - 0. 45 %- 1. The calculations concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag, which determined the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations, were performed using the thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. These calculations showed that there were no solid precipitations present. The refining process under slag used in this research proved to be extremely efficient in terms <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation.</b> Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that the slag forming technology in the ladle is correct in terms of materials used, both as far as their type and amount are concerned.

The best setting <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and air was gained by selecting the shortest time of the setting to reach 400 ºC of the temperature of the reactor. The 400 ºC is the temperature of pyrolysis process started. It was found that the best setting <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and air for gas burner is the setting of 19 mbar <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with 2. 5 of air. The time taken to achieve pyrolysis temperature from the best setting is 25 minutes. The heat distribution patterns also have been reviewed and discussed in this research. This study provides clearer insight into the heat distribution of the gas fired pyrolysis system...|$|R
