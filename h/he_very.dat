5|$|Although Shaw's unmasking scene {{lasted only}} {{two minutes and}} seven seconds and {{included}} just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw, he received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for any role {{in the rest of}} his career. He later reflected that <b>he</b> <b>very</b> much enjoyed his experience filming for Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but <b>he</b> <b>very</b> quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as <b>he</b> <b>very</b> rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E

5000|$|Roberto Martínez, {{after signing}} Fyvie for Wigan Athletic, said [...] "Technically <b>he's</b> <b>very</b> gifted, enjoys {{playing in the}} midfield where he can cover large areas, <b>he's</b> <b>very</b> {{powerful}} off the ball and in possession is someone who can read the tempo of the game very well".|$|R
25|$|Critics of the governor, both {{among his}} contemporaries and later historians, {{have claimed that}} had he sailed {{directly}} to the Moluccas rather than to Malacca, <b>he</b> <b>very</b> possibly could have dislodged the undermanned Dutch from the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|He possessed {{excellent}} {{judgment in}} the selection of explanations from the earlier exegetes, as Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, the Rashbam, and Nahmanides, and <b>he</b> <b>very</b> often gives original interpretations which show an extensive philological knowledge.|$|E
25|$|When Nawab Amir-ul-umra learnt the {{distress}} of her heart, his own overflowed with kindness: <b>he</b> <b>very</b> graciously set her up {{as his own}} mother, giving her the fort of Kumher for her residence and the mahals (palaces) around it for her support.|$|E

50|$|When we meet Abraham, one of {{the things}} that we realize most about him is that <b>he's</b> <b>very</b> mission-oriented at this point. You're not going to learn a lot about how he emotionally feels about things necessarily. <b>He's</b> <b>very</b> reactive. <b>He</b> keeps his eye on the target. He's not to be f---ed with. He will kill you.|$|R
25|$|Kroupa {{wrote with}} great honesty and passion about {{a variety of}} topics, but <b>he</b> <b>very</b> {{carefully}} danced around his own increasing dependence on heroin. Everybody knew that Kroupa occasionally used heroin, cocaine {{and dozens of other}} drugs, but not the extent.|$|E
25|$|His highest {{first-class}} {{score was}} 126 for Cambridge University against the MCC in 1953. <b>He</b> <b>very</b> seldom bowled his leg-breaks, and his single first-class wicket came in his second-last match, when he bowled Gerry Alexander in the MCC match against the Governor-General's XI in Auckland.|$|E
25|$|When Sauron {{made the}} ring, he {{was obliged to}} {{transfer}} much of his power into {{it so that it}} could control the other rings, themselves objects of great potency. With the ring, Sauron remained very powerful, and he could use it to dominate the will of others; <b>he</b> <b>very</b> quickly corrupted Númenor into the worship of Melkor and open rebellion against the Valar.|$|E

25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and <b>he</b> <b>very</b> candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.|$|E
25|$|In {{looking for}} applied {{research}} opportunities, Wild {{discovered that the}} Australian Department of Civil Aviation had been considering a call by the International Civil Aviation Organization for member states to propose a new system to replace the longstanding Instrument Landing System. <b>He</b> <b>very</b> quickly formed {{the concept of a}} microwave landing system and applied his energies to the project with great enthusiasm. The concept was simple: a radar fan beam scans back and forth horizontally while another scans up and down, giving the aircraft's position within a few inches.|$|E
25|$|As {{the party}} travels by train to Gralea, Ardyn appears and tricks Noctis into {{throwing}} Prompto from the train. Seemingly abandoned by his friends, Prompto spends several days wandering the frozen wastes. <b>He</b> <b>very</b> nearly freezes to death before {{being picked up}} by a magitek patrol, who bring him to the First Magitek Production Facility. When he awakens, Ardyn reappears and reveals that Prompto was intended to be a vessel for a magitek soldier before he escaped. He encourages Prompto to confront the empire's chief magitek researcher, Verstael Besithia, to learn more.|$|E

25|$|Kotonishiki was {{regarded}} as an oshi-sumo specialist, favouring tsuki (thrusting) and oshi (pushing) techniques. However, he was also capable of fighting on the mawashi or belt. Somewhat unusually, his preferred grip on the mawashi was morozashi, with both arms inside his opponent's. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri (force out), closely followed by oshi-dashi (push out). Together these two techniques accounted for half his victories at sekitori level. <b>He</b> <b>very</b> rarely employed throwing moves, {{with the exception of}} sukuinage, a beltless scoop throw.|$|E
25|$|Monday came, all was well. Tuesday came, he not sick. Wednesday came, {{and still}} he was well; with which his impertinent wife did much twit {{him in his}} teeth. Thursday came, and dinner was ended, <b>he</b> <b>very</b> well: {{he went down to}} the water-side, and took a pair of oars to go to some {{buildings}} he was in hand with in Puddle-dock. Being {{in the middle of the}} Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th century, {{northern}} Westchester County {{was mostly}} divided into large farms, while the county's southern portion was more densely populated, {{with the larger}} villages. It is believed that one such farm was the hundred-acre (40ha) farm that includes the house property. No record of its purchase exists, but later records show Arthur Williams, upon his appointment as a town assessor in 1803 and later as the district's highway master, as living at the property and suggesting he had done so for a long time. His family {{had been in the}} region since the 17th century; <b>he</b> <b>very</b> likely built the house.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. No. [Confidentially] But there's a party <b>he's</b> <b>very</b> much {{attached}} to, {{not altogether}} com-il-fa. It's a sad story.|$|R

25|$|Barrichello {{won five}} karting titles in Brazil {{before going to}} Europe to race in the Formula Vauxhall Lotus series in 1990. In his first year, he won the championship, a feat he {{replicated}} the following year in the British Formula 3 Championship, beating David Coulthard. <b>He</b> <b>very</b> nearly joined Formula One, the highest category of single seater racing, at just 19 years of age. Instead he competed in Formula 3000 in 1992. He {{finished third in the}} championship, and joined the Jordan Formula One team for the 1993 Formula One season. During this time, and also early in his Formula One career, Barrichello lived in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK.|$|E
25|$|Though {{normally}} {{loved by}} most of his countrymen, Storm P. has also been criticised for being too toothless, cosy and petit bourgeois. In spite of his social background and interest of poor milieus, <b>he</b> <b>very</b> seldom shows deeper social criticism or revolutionary opinions; the dramatic age in which he lived left rather small stamps on his work. On the other hand he was no staunch giggler; many of his paintings deal with death, sorrow and macabre themes. Though not a revolutionary, he has indeed painted the victims of social injustice and misery, often with a strong touch of compassion. Melancholy and fear are not unknown to him, but his official appearance was an optimistic one.|$|E
25|$|After the Restoration <b>he</b> <b>very</b> quickly {{fell into}} disrepute. His {{sympathy with the}} parliament, which his {{predictions}} had generally shown, was not calculated to bring him into royal favour. He came under the lash of Samuel Butler, who, making allowance for some satiric exaggeration, has given {{in the character of}} Hudibras Sidrophel a probably not very incorrect picture of the man; and, having by this time amassed a tolerable fortune, he bought a small estate at Hersham in Surrey, to which he retired, and where he diverted the exercise of his peculiar talents to the practice of medicine. He died in 1681. In 2003 a commemorative plaque was placed next to the disused Aldwych tube station on the Strand. Lilly lived in a house on the site from 1627 to 1665.|$|E
