This therapy {{is useful in}} Mendelian recessive diseases. There is an ethical moratorium to perform insertion gene therapy in germ cells, because this procedure increases the human genome. Somatic cell gene therapy cures individuals but increases the gene frequency of <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> in the population. This occurs because {{the descendants of the}} cured patient should carry his or her «ill» genes. We denote by «DNA gene surgery» the procedure that replaces «ill» nucleotide(s) by healthy one(s) conserving the genome size and the gene context of expression and regulation. Several procedures for gene surgery have been applied to cells and animals. Those based on DNA repair as Chimeric RNA/DNA, one stranded oligonucleotides and tristranded DNA. Those based on DNA recombination with oligo-DNA or one stranded DNA, and transposable DNA segments. Gene surgery can be applied to germ cell gene therapy without ethical contraindications. It can cure Mendelian dominant diseases and it can be applied to heterozygotes. It preserves the regulation and expression gene context. If a technical safe procedure is available, the entire mankind could be treated and cured of all the Mendelian diseases, in one generation. Susceptibilities for all diseases could also be treated. The moratorium for research on germ cell gene therapy by gene surgery should be interrupted.

40|$|International audienceAutosomal <b>dominant</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{can occur}} de novo {{and in the}} form of somatic mosaicism, which can give rise to a less severe phenotype, and make {{diagnosis}} more difficult given the sensitivity limits of the methods used. We report the case of female child with a history of surgery for syndactyly of the hands and feet, who was admitted at 6 years of age to a pediatric intensive care unit following cardiac arrest. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a long QT interval that on occasions reached 500 ms. Despite the absence of facial dysmorphism and the presence of normal psychomotor development, a diagnosis of Timothy syndrome was made given the association of syndactyly and the ECG features. Sanger sequencing of the CACNA 1 C gene, followed by sequencing of the genes KCNQ 1, KCNH 2, KCNE 1, KCNE 2, were negative. The subsequent analysis of a panel of genes responsible for hereditary cardiac rhythm disorders using Haloplex technology revealed a recurrent mosaic p. Gly 406 Arg missense mutation of the CACNA 1 C gene in 18 % of the cells. This mosaicism can explain the negative Sanger analysis and the less complete phenotype in this patient. Given the other cases in the literature, mosaic mutations in Timothy syndrome appear more common than previously thought. This case demonstrates the importance of using next-generation sequencing to identify mosaic mutations when the clinical picture supports a specific mutation that is not identified using conventional testing...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in {{multiple}} cardiac sarcomeric proteins including myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) cause a <b>dominant</b> <b>genetic</b> heart <b>disease,</b> familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Patients with mutations {{in these two}} genes have quite distinct clinical characteristics. Those with MyHC mutations demonstrate more significant and uniform cardiac hypertrophy and a variable frequency of sudden death. Patients with cTnT mutations generally exhibit mild or no hypertrophy, but a high frequency of sudden death at an early age. To understand the basis for these distinctions and to study the pathogenesis of the disease, we have created transgenic mice expressing a truncated mouse cTnT allele analogous to one found in FHC patients. Mice expressing truncated cTnT at low (� 5 %) levels develop cardiomyopathy and their hearts are significantly smaller (18 – 27 %) than wild type. These animals also exhibit significant diastolic dysfunction and milder systolic dysfunction. Animals that express higher levels of transgene protein die within 24 h of birth. Transgenic mouse hearts demonstrate myocellular disarray and have a reduced number of cardiac myocytes that are smaller in size. These studies suggest that multiple cellular mechanisms result in the human disease, which is generally characterized by mild hypertrophy, but, also, frequent sudden death. (J. Clin. Invest...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dominant</b> human <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> that impair {{reproductive}} {{fitness and}} have high locus heterogeneity constitute {{a problem for}} gene discovery because the usual criterion of finding more mutations in specific genes than expected by chance may require extremely large populations. Heterotaxy (Htx), a congenital heart disease resulting from abnormalities in left-right (LR) body patterning, has features suggesting that many cases fall into this category. In this setting, appropriate model systems may provide a means to support implication of specific genes. By high-resolution genotyping of 262 Htx subjects and 991 controls, we identify a twofold excess of subjects with rare genic copy number variations in Htx (14. 5 % vs. 7. 4 %, P = 1. 5 × 10 − 4). Although 7 of 45 Htx copy number variations were large chromosomal abnormalities, 38 smaller copy number variations altered a total of 61 genes, 22 of which had Xenopus orthologs. In situ hybridization identified 7 of these 22 genes with expression in the ciliated LR organizer (gastrocoel roof plate), a marked enrichment compared with 40 of 845 previously studied genes (sevenfold enrichment, P < 10 − 6). Morpholino knockdown in Xenopus of Htx candidates demonstrated that five (NEK 2, ROCK 2, TGFBR 2, GALNT 11, and NUP 188) strongly disrupted both morphological LR development and expression of pitx 2, a molecular marker of LR patterning. These effects were specific, because 0 of 13 control genes from rare Htx or control copy number variations produced significant LR abnormalities (P = 0. 001).

40|$|Context: Familial male-limited {{precocious}} puberty is a <b>dominant</b> autosomal <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> caused by activating LH receptor gene mutations, clinically expressed only in males. In preliminary studies, {{in addition to}} the expected testosterone increase, we found high inhibin B levels before the age of normal puberty. Objectives: The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the cellular origin of serum inhibin thanks to testis section immunostaining. Main Outcome Measures: Serum testosterone, gonadotropin, inhibin B, pan-C-inhibin, and anti-Mullerian hormone levels were measured. Immunostaining was performed using specific anti [...] and anti [...] subunit antibodies. Subjects and Methods: Five boys from three families (mutation M 398 T or I 542 L) were investigated at onset (2 - 6 yr), on ketoconazole treatment, and at adolescence. Testis biopsies were performed in three subjects before the disease was fully characterized. Results: The high testosterone levels were suppressed by ketoconazole. Anti-Mullerian hormone levels were inversely related to testosterone: low at diagnosis, elevated after testosterone suppression. Despite FSH suppression, inhibin B and pan-C-inhibin levels were high from clinical onset to adolescence. Biopsy specimens showed normal Sertoli cell complement and germ cell maturation until the spermatocyte II stage. Sertoli and Leydig cells displayed positive inhibin -subunit immunostaining. Only Leydig cells and spermatogonia stained positively for the inhibin -subunit. Conclusions: Familial male-limited {{precocious puberty}} is a unique model of inhibin B secretion, demonstrating that Leydig cells can produce significant amounts of the dimeric molecule. Our results also suggest that the pubertal FSH rise is not required for full expression of the two inhibin B genes and for the initiation of germ cell maturation...|$|R
