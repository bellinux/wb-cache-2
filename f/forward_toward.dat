5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper Swabia and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their goal was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. This would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in northern Italy and Germany, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. The North Vietnamese forces lost 49.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move <b>forward,</b> <b>toward</b> the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

25|$|Cubism is an early-20th-century art {{movement}} {{which brought}} European {{painting and sculpture}} historically <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> 20th century Modern art. Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in literature and architecture. Cubism has been considered {{to be among the}} most influential art movements of the 20th century.

50|$|Fingering {{the vagina}} is often {{performed}} {{in an effort}} to stimulate the G-spot. The G-spot is reportedly located roughly 5 cm up on the anterior wall of the vagina, <b>forwards</b> <b>toward</b> the navel. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the Skene's gland, is commonly cited as a method that may lead to female ejaculation. Parallels are sometimes drawn with the fingering or other manipulation of the male prostate through the anus.|$|R
25|$|Farther west {{there were}} clashes at Saluzzo and Pinerolo. On 16 October 1799 the {{divisions}} of Victor and François Muller attacked the Austrians at Beinette with serious losses on both sides. Finally, Melas {{gave up his}} attempted siege of Cuneo and pulled back. Lemoine's division was involved in actions at Mondovì on 27–28 October. On 31 October 1799, Melas with 15,000 soldiers drubbed Grenier with 7,000 at Centallo. The French suffered 1,000 casualties while the Austrians lost only 200 and captured four guns. However, the French gradually pressed <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> Fossano. Duhesme fought an Austrian force at Pinerolo on 1 November {{and the next day}} the French captured Mondovì.|$|E
25|$|The Hartington City Hall and Auditorium {{includes}} three levels: raised basement partially below grade, main level, and upper level. The basement level and main level are basically rectangular in plan, 75 feet (23 meters) wide (north-south along Broadway) and 130 feet (40 meters) {{front to back}} (east-west along Centre). However, the upper level plan is {{in the shape of}} a cross, so that the four corners are one story lower and function as wings. The two front wings project <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> Broadway as well as laterally (north and south). The two rear wings are flush with the back (east) of the building. The southeast wing projects south and contains the two fire house doors, but the northeast wing does not project north. The basement originally contained the armory including officers’ quarters, lockers, supply room, and sleeping facilities for fire fighters, with the firehouse in back under the auditorium stage. The main level accommodated the lobby and city offices in front, the auditorium’s hardwood floor taking up the large middle, and the stage in back above the fire house. The cross-shaped upper level included a small space in front above the lobby and the stage fly space in back, but the bulk of it in the middle was simply open to the auditorium.|$|E
500|$|During the Battle of Marion, Division Commander Stephen G. Burbridge {{ordered the}} 5th USCC between two white units {{on the left}} flank of the Union line. Lieutenant Colonel James S. Brisbin and his second in command, Carpenter, led their {{dismounted}} soldiers <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> the Confederate defensive works. The Confederates opened heavy fire upon the advancing Union troops that included four ten pound Parrott rifled cannons. The first Union charge wavered and fell back. [...] Carpenter was seen giving clear orders to reform and rallied his men. With a mighty yell the 5th USCC rushed <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> the breastworks but could not break the defensive line. [...] Carpenter ordered the men to dig in and night fell. Volunteers went out between lines to rescue the wounded.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} BGR, a new beacon-less geographic routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Data packets are <b>forwarded</b> <b>toward</b> the des-tination, and nodes which {{hear the}} packet compete for becoming the next hop. A recovery strategy is {{provided for the}} case of empty forwarding areas. The main innovation is a strategy to avoid simultaneous forwarding situations, which would otherwise cause packet failures. It is confirmed by simulation that BGR sends very few packets and is reliable in fields with sufficiently high node density. Furthermore, BGR is compared with similar algorithms after developing a general framework for beacon-less algorithms with an integrative terminology. Different kinds of forward-ing areas are compared. ...|$|R
30|$|Each CCN device {{basically}} {{has three}} functional blocks for content delivery: content store (CS), pending interest table (PIT), and forwarding information base (FIB). The FIB has the role to <b>forward</b> interest packets <b>toward</b> the potential content holder(s) of matching data. It is almost similar to an FIB table of an IP router. The CS {{looks like the}} content cache. It stores data packets {{to be used in}} the future by other content requesters. So, CCN can provide localized transmission near content requesters. This is the main difference from the IP router that forgets a packet after it has been forwarded. The PIT keeps track of interests <b>forwarded</b> <b>toward</b> the content source(s) so that returned data can be sent back to its requester(s). PIT entries are eliminated as soon as they have been consumed to forward a matching data packet. PIT entries for interests that never find a matching data are eventually timed out and naturally eliminated.|$|R

30|$|Chatzigiannakis et al. [10] {{proposed}} a new data dissemination protocol for wireless sensor networks, which pulls additional {{knowledge about the}} network to subsequently improve data <b>forwarding</b> <b>toward</b> the sink. This extra information is still local, limited, and obtained in a distributed manner. This extra knowledge is acquired by {{only a small fraction}} of sensors. Thus, the extra energy cost only marginally affects the overall protocol efficiency. The protocol has low latency and manages to propagate data successfully, even in the case of low densities. However, the proposed mechanism has a limitation in that it does not support adaptive data dissemination, because it does not reflect the real network condition. In contrast, our proposed model makes a feature of adaptive data dissemination based on self-adjusting the various parameters in terms of the actual network conditions.|$|R
500|$|Kershaw's {{pitching}} style {{relies on}} deception, movement and changes of velocity. He keeps the ball hidden {{so that it}} is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches, he also consistently lands low on the strikezone below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when the ball is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the windup, Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a [...] "kickstand move" [...] drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.|$|E
500|$|Charles and the Aulic Council {{were divided}} about the {{strategy}} {{with which to}} attack the French. Charles wanted a major thrust from Bohemia designed to isolate the French forces in northern Germany and lead to a rapid decision. The greater part of the Austrian army was already concentrated there, so {{it seemed like a}} natural operation. The Aulic Council disagreed on account of the Danube River splitting the forces of Charles and his brother John. [...] They instead suggested that the main attack should be launched south of the Danube so as to maintain safer communications with Vienna. [...] In the end, they had their way, but not before precious time had been lost. The Austrian plan called for the Bohemian corps, the I under Bellegarde, consisting of 38,000 troops, and the II of 20,000 troops under Kollowrat, to attack Regensburg (Ratisbon) from the Bohemian mountains by way of Cham, the Austrian center and reserve, comprising 66,000 men of Hohenzollern's III, Rosenberg's IV, and Lichtenstein's I Reserve Corps, to advance on the same objective through Scharding, and the left wing, made up of the V of Archduke Louis, Hiller's VI, and Kienmayer's II Reserve Corps, a total of 61,000 men, to move <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> Landshut and guard the flank.|$|E
500|$|Collectively, the/a crest. Long crest {{feathers}} {{are sometimes}} called quill feathers. Also defined herewith: recumbent crests and recursive crests. A type of [...] feather {{with a long}} [...] with [...] on either side, that often presents as a prominent tuft on the [...] and (or through) the neck and upper [...] Birds with crests include Victoria crowned pigeons, northern lapwings, macaroni penguins and others, but the most recognizable are cockatoos and cockatiels, which can raise or lower their crests at will {{and use them to}} communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defence to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised. In some species the position of the crest is a threat signal {{that can be used to}} predict behaviour. In Steller's jays, for example, a raised crest indicates a likelihood of attack, and a lowered crest indicates a likelihood of retreat. Crests can be recumbent or recursive, depending on the species. The recumbent crest, such as in white cockatoos, has feathers that are straight and lie down essentially flat on the head until fanned out. The recursive crest, such as in sulphur-crested cockatoos and Major Mitchell's cockatoos, is noticeable even when its feathers are not fanned out because they curve upward at the tips even when lying flat, and when standing up, often bend slightly <b>forward</b> <b>toward</b> the front of the head. Some birds, like galahs and rose-breasted cockatoos, have modified crests that have both recumbent and recursive features.|$|E

To understand this, the writer asks to look back to situation of where Indonesia was still occupied by the Dutch. It was understandable that the colonial government had interests in seeing Indonesian’s law scholars who were skillful in applying the law made by the colonial government rather than being critical to those.
