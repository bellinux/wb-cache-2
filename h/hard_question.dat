500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a <b>hard</b> <b>question</b> {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you {{obviously}} think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

[...] He replied, [...] "It's a <b>hard</b> <b>question</b> because as I said at the start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God." [...] Freeman later said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his views on religion.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{afternoon}} of the third day of the war, the American SIGINT spy ship USS Liberty, outfitted by the NSA, was attacked by Israeli warplanes and torpedo boats in international waters north of Sinai. This U.S. Navy ship was severely damaged with loss of life. The Israelis quickly notified the Americans and later explained that they [...] "had mistaken the Liberty (455 feet long) for the Egyptian coastal steamer El Quseir (275 feet long). The US government formally accepted the apology and the explanation." [...] Some continue to accept this position. Yet [...] "scholars and military experts," [...] according to author Thomas Powers, state that [...] "the <b>hard</b> <b>question</b> is not whether the attack was deliberate but why the Israelis thought it necessary." [...] About the Liberty Helms in his memoirs quotes the opinion of his deputy, DDCI Rufus Taylor, and mentions the conclusion of a board of inquiry. Then Helms adds, [...] "I have yet to understand why it was felt necessary to attack this ship or who ordered the attack".|$|E
