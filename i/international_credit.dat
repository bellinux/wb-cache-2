Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican <b>international</b> <b>credit</b> and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to <b>international</b> <b>credit</b> more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis {{he did not want to}} risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E

25|$|As soon as {{she assumed}} the {{presidency}} of the Philippines, Aquino moved quickly to tackle the issue of the US$28 billion-foreign debt incurred by her predecessor, which has badly tarnished the <b>international</b> <b>credit</b> standing and economic reputation of the country. After weighing all possible options such as choosing not to pay, Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country's image. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended that it was the most practical move. It was crucial for the country at that time to regain the investors' confidence in the Philippine economy. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country's outstanding debts to regain good <b>international</b> <b>credit</b> ratings and attract the attention of future markets. Although it borrowed an additional $9 billion, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years after the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, due to the need to infuse capital and money into the economy, the Aquino administration succeeded in wrangling lower interest rates and longer payment terms in settling the country's debts. From 87.9 percent when it inherited the foreign debt from the Marcos regime, the Cory Aquino administration was able to reduce by 30.1 percent the Philippines' external debt-to-GDP ratio to 67.8 percent in 1991.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Today, <b>international</b> <b>credits</b> {{are among the}} key {{ingredients}} of the growth strategies pursued by the developing countries and {{the investigation of the}} relationship between <b>international</b> <b>credits</b> and income distribution is of special importance when the effectiveness of such flows are evaluated. In this study, we examine the effect of <b>international</b> <b>credits,</b> including those disbursed by the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), on the income distribution in developing countries using data for years 1961 - 1996 for 63 countries, with maximum of 163 country-year observations and panel data estimation procedure. Our results briefly indicate that the WB loans do not appear to have reduced inequality in the countries in our sample. Comparing the performance of the WB group to that of the IMF, we find that credits originated from the IMF have a significant improving effect on the income distribution; which is stronger in the transition countries. Our results also point out that the presence of high rates of inflation appears to aggravate inequality. Additionally, our findings support the empirical literature that there exists a positive relationship between the level of income and inequality {{in the early stages of}} development. Moreover, evidence from our regressions show that economic growth has not got a significant impact on income distribution. Finally, our results show that the inclusion of the governance variables leaves the former results intact, that is improvement in the governance measures has not sufficed to contribute to equality in distribution in the countries examined in this study.

25|$|In Peru, the {{political}} situation was complicated. President Prado had declared war on Chile for deep-seated economical and political reasons but without the funds or <b>international</b> <b>credit</b> to finance the war. He turned over {{the administration of the}} state to vice-president Luis La Puerta de Mendoza in order to assume for himself the command of the army. Because of the Chilean blockade, Peru could not export revenue-making goods via its ports. As a consequence, public revenue was cut in half from what had been expected; meanwhile spending was tripled. The Peruvian government in 1879 experienced several political crisis and seven ministers of finance. General Buendía, chief of the defeated allied troops in Iquique and More, chief of the sunken warship Independence, were both put on trial but were eventually acquitted.|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} {{recession of}} the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, {{as well as his}} use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the western conservative portion of his power base – this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the Bank of Canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100% of GDP, further weakening the Canadian dollar and damaging Canada's <b>international</b> <b>credit</b> rating.|$|E

[...] There are other factors beside the embargo explaining the lack of imports, in particular Cuba's lack of hard currency.
