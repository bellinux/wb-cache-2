2500|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>eggs</b> of Triops longicaudatus {{are sold}} in kits to be raised as {{aquarium}} pets, sold {{under the name of}} [...] "aquasaurs", [...] "trigons" [...] or [...] "triops". These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and daphnia as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the bottom and sides of the tank and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of enterococci in various <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> white products was surveyed, and some behaviors of enterococci, detected from the <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> whites, {{in the manufacturing}} process of <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> white were studied. From some of <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> white samples, enterococci including Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens, and S. faecium were identified, but S. durans was not detected. These three spp. of enterococcus did not grow in yolk-free egg white, but grew well in egg white containing small quantities of egg yolk. These enterococci hardly decreased by the pasteurization in various conditions including Cunningham and Lineweaver's method. In the desugaring process by glucose oxidase method these enterococci perished, but in yeast or bacteria fermentation of yolk-free egg white, the counts of these enterococci hardly changed. Small counts of presumable enterococci perished in the spontaneous fermentation of yolk-free egg white, but increased rapidly in the fermentation of the egg white containing 0. 15 % yolk. These enterococci decreased considerably by spray <b>drying</b> <b>egg</b> white, but hardly changed by pan drying. In the heat treatments of dried powder at 57 ° C. and of dried crystal at 50 ° C, many days were needed {{for the destruction of}} these enterococci...|$|R
