The understanding of their biogeochemical cycles can be improved using stable isotope analysis. However, high-precision isotope measurements on air trapped in ice cores are challenging because of the high susceptibility to contamination and fractionation. Here, we present a dry extraction system for combined CH 4 and N 2 O stable isotope analysis from ice core air, using an ice grating device. The system allows simultaneous analysis of &delta;D(CH 4 ) or &delta; 13 C(CH 4 ), together with &delta; 15 N(N 2 O), &delta; 18 O(N 2 O) and &delta; 15 N(NO+ fragment) on a single ice core sample, using two isotope mass spectrometry systems. The optimum quantity of ice for analysis is about 600 g with typical "Holocene" mixing ratios for CH 4 and N 2 O. In this case, the reproducibility (1 &sigma;) is 2. 1 &permil; for &delta;D(CH 4 ), 0. 18 &permil; for &delta; 13 C(CH 4 ), 0. 51 &permil; for &delta; 15 N(N 2 O), 0. 69 &permil; for &delta; 18 O(N 2 O) and 1. 12 &permil; for &delta; 15 N(NO+ fragment).

40|$|The {{radioisotope}} 32 Si {{was evaluated}} as a tracer for measuring silica production rates in marine waters. j 2 Si is a weak p-emitter that decays to 32 P allowing the isotope {{to be used}} to determine simultaneously the production rate of biogenic silica and organic phosphorus. High specific activity ‘*Si, 42, 000 - 52, 000 Bq (pug Si) -I, was produced by the proton spallation of KCl. Reasonable tracer additions result in only nanomolar increases in the ambient silicic acid and orthophosphate concentrations during production rate experiments. Protocols for quantifying the amount of 32 Si and 32 P in samples by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) and gas-flow proportional counting (GFPC) are presented. Both protocols eliminate the 4 -month wait for secular equilibrium between 32 Si and 72 P required by earlier methods. GFPC is especially useful as the instrumentation is lightweight and portable allowing real-time analysis of samples at sea. Real-time analysis by GFPC at sea and postcruise analysis by LSC gave results that agreed to within 17 and 7 % for 12 Si and 32 e respectively. Subsequent <b>intercalibrations</b> of the LSC and GFPC methods indicated that agreement to within O. l- 4 % for both isotopes can be achieved.

The toxic effect of Al {{has been attributed to}} inorganic Al (Ali), though there are few in situ studies in ambient humic waters which are the focus of this thesis. The aim was to estimate Ali toxicity and thus also Ali concentrations in Swedish humic streams. Subsequently it is necessary to analyse Ali correctly, which was studied by modelling and method <b>intercalibrations.</b> The hypothesis was that the effect of Ali could be followed via physiological effects and Al accumulation, as well as by mortality. Toxicity was studied by in stream exposures of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and two salmonid prey organisms (Gammarus pulex and Baetis rhodani) during spring flood. The modelling of the Ali fraction was performed using monitoring data covering all of Sweden with satisfactory results. The essential variables for Ali modelling were determined; Al, DOC, pH and F, while Fe, Ca and Mg had less effect. The automated analytical procedure for Ali (with cation exchange followed by complexation with pyrocatechol violet) was modified and validated and showed to be the preferred method for laboratory analyses. To avoid detrimental effects for brown trout Ali should be 5. 0; mortality was high when the Ali was above 50 µg/L. The invertebrates were more sensitive, as mortalities occurred at pH 15 µg/L for G. pulex, and at pH 20 µg/L for B. rhodani. It is prudent to use a wide view and let the most sensitive species set the tolerance limits; a pH above 5. 7 - 6. 0 and Ali below 15 - 20 µg/L allows the stream ecosystems to thrive. Today, as waters are recovering from acidification, the aim of mitigating liming is to carefully adjust dosage to avoid suboptimal water quality. The thresholds found in this thesis can be used to efficiently but carefully decrease liming, as both Ali and pH levels have to be balanced to sustain the recovering aquatic biota...|$|R

The MSU anomalies we computed about a 10 -year mean annual cycle at each grid point, with the MSUs intercalibrated {{to a common}} arbitrary level. The <b>intercalibrations</b> remove relative biases between instruments of up to several tenths of a degree celsius. The monthly gridpoint anomaly agreement between concurrently operating satellites reveals single-satellite precision on generally better than 0. 07 C in the tropics and better than 0. 15 C at higher latitudes. Monthly anomalies in radiosonde channel 2 brightness temperatures computed with the radiative transfer equation compare very closely to the MSU measured anomalies in all climate zones, with correlations generally from 0. 94 to 0. 98 and standard errors of 0. 15 C in the tropics to 0. 30 C at high latitudes. Simplification of these radiative transfer calculations to a static weighting profile applied to the radiosonde temperature profile leads to an average degradation of only 0. 02 deg. in the monthly skill. In terms of a more traditionally measured quantity, the MSU channel 2 anomalies match best with either the radiosonde 100 - 20 -kPa or 100 - 15 -kPa layer anomalies.

The samples selected were representative of the long range (400 km) transport of metal (Zn, Cd, etc.) contamination from former Zn-refining activities at Decazeville (i. e. δ 66 Zn > 1 ‰) and its phasing out, recorded during 30 years in wild oysters from the Gironde Estuary mouth (RNO/ROCCH sample bank). The study also addresses additional anthropogenic sources (urban and viticulture) and focuses on geochemical reactivity of Zn in the turbidity gradient and the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) of the fluvial Gironde Estuary. In this area, dissolved Zn showed a strong removal onto suspended particulate matter (SPM) and progressive enrichment in heavy isotopes with increasing SPM concentrations varying from δ 66 Zn = - 0. 02 ‰ at 2 mg/L to + 0. 90 ‰ at 1310 mg/L. These signatures were attributed to kinetically driven adsorption due to strongly increasing sorption sites in the turbidity gradient and MTZ of the estuary. Oysters from the estuary mouth, contaminated sediments from the Lot River and SPM entering the estuary showed parallel historical evolutions (1979 - 2010) for Zn/Cd ratios but not for δ 66 Zn values. Oysters had signatures varying from δ 66 Zn = 1. 43 ‰ in 1983 to 1. 18 ‰ in 2010 and were offset by δ 66 Zn = 0. 6 - 0. 7 ‰ compared to past (1988) and present SPM from the salinity gradient. Isotopic signatures in river-borne particles entering the Gironde Estuary under contrasting freshwater discharge regimes during 2003 - 2011 showed similar values (δ 66 Zn ≈ 0. 35 ± 0. 03 ‰; 1 SD, n= 15), i. e. they were neither related to former metal refining activities at least for the past decade nor clearly affected by other anthropogenic sources. Therefore, the Zn isotopic signatures in Gironde oysters reflect the geochemical reactivity of Zn in the estuary rather than signatures of past metallurgical contaminations in the watershed as recorded in contaminated river sediments. The study also shows that the isotopic composition of Zn is strongly fractionated by its geochemical reactivity in the Gironde Estuary, representative of meso-macrotidal estuarine systems...|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{research}} satellites carry self-calibrating multispectral imagers {{that can be}} used for calibrating operational imagers lacking complete self-calibrating capabilities. In particular, the visible (VIS, 0. 65 m) channels on operational meteorological satellites are generally calibrated before launch, but require vicarious calibration techniques to monitor the gains and offsets once they are in orbit. To ensure that the self-calibrating instruments are performing as expected, this paper examines the consistencies between the VIS channel (channel 1) reflectances of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites and the Version 5 a and 6 reflectances of the Visible Infrared Scanner (VIRS) on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission using a variety of techniques. These include comparisons of Terra and Aqua VIS radiances with coincident broadband shortwave radiances from the well-calibrated Clouds and the Earth s Radiant Energy System (CERES), time series of deep convective cloud (DCC) albedos, and ray-matching <b>intercalibrations</b> between each of the three satellites. Time series of matched Terra and VIRS data, Aqua and VIRS data, and DCC reflected fluxes reveal that an older version (Version 5 a, ending in early 2004) of the VIRS calibration produced a highly stable record, while the latest version (Version 6) appears to overestimate the sensor gain change by approx. 1 %/y as the result of a manually induced gain adjustment. Comparisons with the CERES shortwave radiances unearthed a sudden change in the Terra MODIS calibration that caused a 1. 17 % decrease in the gain on 19 November 2003 that can be easily reversed. After correction for these manual adjustments, the trends in the VIRS and Terra channels are no greater than 0. 1 %/y. Although the results were more ambiguous, no statistically significant trends were found in the Aqua MODIS channel- 1 gain. The Aqua radiances are 1 % greater, on average, than their Terra counterparts, and after normalization are 4. 6 % greater than VIRS radiances, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The discrepancy between the two MODIS instruments should be taken into account to ensure consistency between parameters derived from them. With the adjustments, any of the three instruments can serve as references for calibrating other satellites. Monitoring of the calibrations continues in near-real-time and the results are available via the world wide web...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made over the last decade in the extension of astronomically calibrated geological time scales for the Neogene (Hilgen et al., 1999, Shackleton et al., 1999). The validity of these time scales has been supported by comparison of data from different parts of the world’s oceans, through the improvement of astronomical calculations, and independent dating methods and <b>intercalibrations</b> (Renne et al., 1994). While evidence of astronomical forcing has been found for intervals from most parts of the Cenozoic, extending astronomically calibrated time scales into the Paleogene faces some fundamental problems that require a different approach than the sophisticated “pattern matching” that worked so well for the Neogene. These challenges are related to uncertainties and limits of astronomical calculations, sparser data coverage, and a climate system that behaved quite differently to today’s “ice-house” setting. This contribution reviews some of the challenges that will have to tackled, presents a new set of astronomically calibrated benthic isotope data from the late Eocene, and suggests a new approach to synthesise astronomically calibrated durations for magnetic reversals that arise from floating time scales, which are so far more common in the Paleogene. Challenges and limits of astronomical calculations for time scale use: One crucial challenge that is faced when tackling the astronomical calibration of the geological time scale {{is the fact that the}} Solar System is chaotic, limiting the age back to which one can compute astronomical solutions with confidence (Laskar, 1999). Thus, one has to constrain astronomical parameters from the rock record. Apart from tidal dissipation effects, which change the detailed interference of particularly obliquity and climatic precession cycles, a larger scale effect is more directly linked to the chaotic nature of the Solar System: amplitude variations of the obliquity and climatic precession cycles with periods of ~ 1. 2 and ~ 2. 4 million years can be affected by chaotic transitions in the planetary solutions. This contribution will review the effects these chaotic transitions can have on astronomical “target” curves, particularly during the Paleogene, and why astronomical time scale calibrations will have to take this into account. Astronomically calibrated stable benthic isotopes from the Eocene: High-resolution lithological proxy measurements from ODP 1052 in the western Atlantic (Pälike et al., 2001) have provided duration estimates for magnetochrons from the late middle Eocene. This contribution presents high-resolution benthic stable isotope measurements from the same location. The astronomically calibrated isotope measurements co-vary with the lithological measurements and the astronomy in the obliquity frequency band, documenting the interaction of astronomy and climate during this transition from the Paleogene “green-house” world to the Oligocene “ice-house” world (Figure 1), and significant events that were not recognised in previous, lower resolution studies. Integration of floating time scales with magnetostratigraphy: The geomagnetic polarity time scale (Cande & Kent, 1995) incorporates astronomically calibrated ages back to 5. 23 Ma. Recent results have changed significantly the age of the Oligocene/ Miocene boundary (Shackleton et al. 1999, 2000). These changes, which we will show have now been corroborated by results from ODP 199, need to be incorporated into the astronomically calibrated polarity time scale. We present a new approach, using a combination of calibrated absolute ages, and constraints on sea-floor spreading rates obtained from astronomically calibrated magnetic reversals from floating time scales, to compute a consistent set of spline interpolated ages for sea-floor magnetic reversals. This approach allows us to incorporate durations of magnetic reversals that result from the floating time scales more common in the Paleogene so far. First results, constrained by results from ODP 1218 in the Oligocene, and ODP 1052 in the late middle Eocene, suggest that the Eocene/Oligocene boundary age could be slightly older than previously estimated. It is suggested that this approach might be a useful first step to integrate astronomically calibrated ages from the Cenozoic until a full coverage, with independent data from different ocean basins, becomes available...|$|R

The process has fostered a scientific debate on ecological classification with important implications for environmental management. Despite a significant level of statistical abstraction, <b>intercalibration</b> yielded a fundamental and unified vision of what constitutes good ecology across Europe, in principle ensuring greater parity in the funds invested to achieve good ecological status...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive {{requests}} {{that all}} water bodies be protected and enhanced {{in order to}} achieve Good Ecological Status by 2015. The <b>intercalibration</b> of the biological monitoring results of Member States has to be carried out in relation to classification tasks, in order to guarantee a common understanding of ¿Good Status¿ at a European level. An <b>intercalibration</b> exercise was carried out within the framework of different Geographical <b>Intercalibration</b> Groups (GIGs), grouping countries together that share the same river types and geographical contexts. By means of the <b>intercalibration</b> exercise common European boundaries are proposed for river invertebrate assessment methods, within each GIG. The {{purpose of this study is}} to validate the boundaries proposed for the formal <b>intercalibration</b> exercise using a benchmark dataset comprising data collected in different European countries that satisfy WFD requirements. Such data provide evidence of a high degree of comparability among countries and includes a set of reference sites. The STAR <b>Intercalibration</b> Common metric index (STAR_ICMi) was calculated for benchmark samples selected as the index in which national assessment boundaries are expressed for the <b>intercalibration</b> exercise in two GIGs. For the STAR_ICMi the coefficient of variation was also calculated, demonstrating a comparable variability with indices that are based on a species level identification. A fixed percentile of reference samples STAR_ICMi values were selected as the boundary between High and Good status. The range from this fixed percentile to the lowest possible value was divided into four equal parts in order to obtain the remaining class boundaries. The resulting High/Good and Good/Moderate boundaries were compared to the boundaries proposed by GIGs and proved to be in line with those defined in the <b>intercalibration</b> exercise. The process of validation explained in the present paper, or similar ones, can be an important step forward. Infact, even if for the <b>intercalibration</b> exercise some procedures to check the MS datasets where put into practice, at the end it was fully up to Member States to guarantee for the WFD compliancy of their reference conditions and methods.

40|$|Following the 38 th Annual European Meeting on Atmospheric Studies by Optical Methods in Siuntio in Finland, an <b>intercalibration</b> {{workshop}} for optical low light calibration sources {{was held in}} Sodankylä, Finland. The main purpose of this workshop {{was to provide a}} comparable scale for absolute measurements of aurora and airglow. All sources brought to the <b>intercalibration</b> workshop were compared to the Fritz Peak reference source using the Lindau Calibration Photometer built by Wilhelm Barke and Hans Lauche in 1984. The results were compared to several earlier <b>intercalibration</b> workshops. It was found that most sources were fairly stable over time, with errors in the range of 5 – 25 %. To further validate the results, two sources were also intercalibrated at UNIS, Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Preliminary analysis indicates agreement with the <b>intercalibration</b> in Sodankylä within about 15 – 25 %...|$|E
40|$|The CMS {{electromagnetic}} calorimeter {{is presently}} under construction at CERN. Inter-calibration of the channels {{is a crucial}} issue for physics performance. The main source of channel-to-channel response variation in the barrel is the crystal-to-crystal variation of scintillation light yield which has an RMS of 8 %. An improved method of using laboratory measurements performed during the ECAL assembly phase to provide an initial <b>intercalibration</b> is presented. The <b>intercalibration</b> constants derived from these measurements are compared to reference coefficients measured using high energy electrons in a test-beam.

40|$|The {{main results}} of the STAR project on the <b>intercalibration</b> of {{boundaries}} of European assessment systems and comparison between assessment methods are summarized here. The main findings are outlined {{in the context of}} the Water Framework Directive that requires reliable instructions to be set up on how to use and harmonise assessment systems and methods for European rivers. The main papers published on these subjects by STAR partners are reviewed, with focus on major questions addressed and approaches used for investigation. The need for broad coverage of geographic ranges and pressure gradients, together with the goal of providing outcomes appropriate to the effective application of the WFD are emphasized. Extensive datasets from a wide range of countries, stream types and sites and a large number of methods, metrics and approaches are compared and tested and various cross-cutting themes emerged. Among these, the value of the use of benchmarking systems for comparison and <b>intercalibration</b> is highlighted. Two ways of looking for comparability of assessment systems results were analyzed: a) by adopting identical sampling techniques across Europe and b) by harmonizing the classification {{results of the}} national assessment systems. In addition, the need, in the <b>intercalibration</b> process, for a proper definition of the criteria for reference conditions is underlined. This is because their imprecision now represents one of the major weaknesses of the whole <b>intercalibration</b> process. Direct and indirect approaches to <b>intercalibration</b> are considered and commented on for their potential use in distinct circumstances. Finally, the use common metrics for the <b>intercalibration</b> process, which make comparability across Europe valid, is tested and indeed encouraged...|$|E

Up to now test beam electrons and cosmic muons have been used to precalibrate ECAL. During the summer 2006, nine ECAL supermodules have been exposed to a high energy electron beam at the CERN SPS north area facility and the <b>intercalibration</b> coefficients of the 1700 channels have been measured for each supermodule. The reproducibility of the <b>intercalibration</b> has been tested by measuring a supermodule twice.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission was recommended by the National Research Council in 2007 to provide an on-orbit <b>intercalibration</b> standard with accuracy of 0. 3 % (k = 2) for relevant Earth observing sensors. The goal of reference <b>intercalibration,</b> as established in the Decadal Survey, is to enable rigorous high-accuracy observations of critical climate change parameters, including reflected broadband radiation [Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) ], cloud properties [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ], and changes in surface albedo, including snow and ice albedo feedback. In this paper, we describe the CLARREO approach for performing <b>intercalibration</b> on orbit in the reflected solar (RS) wavelength domain. It is based on providing highly accurate spectral reflectance and reflected radiance measurements from the CLARREO Reflected Solar Spectrometer (RSS) to establish an on-orbit reference for existing sensors, namely, CERES and VIIRS on Joint Polar Satellite System satellites, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and follow-on imagers on MetOp, Landsat imagers, and imagers on geostationary platforms. One of two fundamental CLARREO mission goals is to provide sufficient sampling of high-accuracy observations that are matched in time, space, and viewing angles with measurements made by existing instruments, {{to a degree that}} overcomes the random error sources from imperfect data matching and instrument noise. The data matching is achieved through CLARREO RSS pointing operations on orbit that align its line of sight with the intercalibrated sensor. These operations must be planned in advance; therefore, <b>intercalibration</b> events must be predicted by orbital modeling. If two competing opportunities are identified, one target sensor must be given priority over the other. The <b>intercalibration</b> method is to monitor changes in targeted sensor response function parameters: effective offset, gain, nonlinearity, optics spectral response, and sensitivity to polarization. In this paper, we use existing satellite data and orbital simulationmethods to determinemission requirements for CLARREO, its instrument pointing ability, methodology, and needed <b>intercalibration</b> sampling and data matching for accurate <b>intercalibration</b> of RS radiation sensors on orbit...|$|E
