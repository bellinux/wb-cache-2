5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden {{has been}} {{featured}} in several accessories and one book for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. The Hall of Heroes accessory for the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1989, features a four-page description and game statistics for Drizzt and Guenhwyvar, written by R. A. Salvatore. The Heroes' Lorebook accessory, published in 1996 and written by Dale Donovan and Paul Culotta, features an update and revision of Drizzt's information from Hall of Heroes. The 1999 accessory Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark by Eric L. Boyd, details the cities and civilizations of Faerûn's Underdark through {{the perspective of the}} title character. The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting hardcover for the game's third edition features a brief description and game statistics for Drizzt <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition,</b> under the section on the Sword Coast North.|$|E
5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> of the Giro was the Passo Pordoi, and the first rider to cross it was Fagor–MBK's Jean-Claude Bagot. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition,</b> Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E

25|$|Following their {{signing with}} Chrysalis Records in early 1981 for the European, Japanese, UK and US {{releases}} Flowers {{had to change}} their name due to legal restrictions preventing confusion with a Scottish group The Flowers. Therefore, when the album was released on the international markets, in June 1981 by Chrysalis, it was released under the band's new name, Icehouse. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> of the album, all of the vocals were re-recorded {{and all of the}} music was completely remixed.|$|E

25|$|The {{winner of}} the 2012 race, Robert Gesink, did not {{participate}} in this edition as he was riding the Giro d'Italia. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition,</b> the UCI elected to reintroduce blood testing based on the biological passport, as USADA would also take care of pre-race testing, but no cooperation was established between the two agencies. The favorites for the overall classification have been deemed to be Tejay van Garderen, Haimar Zubeldia, Cameron Meyer, Michael Rogers (who won the 2010 edition and was making a come-back to the race), Thomas De Gendt and Francisco Mancebo, among others. Another rider to watch was David Zabriskie, who finished second in the general classification of the race on four occasions including the latest edition, without ever winning the top honors.|$|E
25|$|The Third Edition of {{the game}} was {{published}} as a single hardback book in 1987. It had the most in-depth and complex movement and manoeuvre system of any edition. Other changes included {{a variety of new}} specialist troop types, rules for war machines and a more finely tuned system of representing heroes and wizards. It kept the same magic system and open-ended army design system as the first two editions. However, by this stage the use of army lists was very much encouraged. Army lists <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> were published in a separate book called Warhammer Armies in 1988; until then, use of the 2nd Edition's Ravening Hordes list was encouraged. This is partly because it was the last edition published before Games Workshop took a different commercial approach, leading to competition from former GW employees in the briefly published competing Fantasy Warlord.|$|E
25|$|Mozambique, as {{a member}} of the African Cricket Association, competes in the World Cricket League Africa Region which is a 50 over {{competition}} for African countries that aren't full member of the ICC. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition,</b> they competed in the third division as they drawn to meet Sierra Leone, Morocco and Rwanda. In the opening match against Sierra Leone, they scored a six wicket win after they bowled out the opposition for only 197. In return, Kaleem Shah top scored with 55 to give the team their first up victory. Kaleem Shah scored the first century of the tournament in the next game against Morocco to get the team to 275 from 50 overs. Morocco in return could only muster up a score of 196 with Shah being the best bowler. The final group game saw Mozambique win the match against Rwanda by 112 runs to finish on top of pool 2. In the semi-final stage, they took on Ghana and Zainul Patel dominated the bowling with 4 wickets to help in getting the team through to the final. In the final game of the tournament, top scorer Kaleem Shah top scored in the final with him scoring 77 in the 89 run victory to move Mozambique to the next division.|$|E

If a crash had happened within the final [...] of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received {{the same time as the}} group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.

[...] <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition,</b> Chekhov clarified why Vasilisa wept, heightened Ivan's reaction to the dark and cold near the story's beginning, and made clearer the connection between truth, beauty, and human history.
