40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} Z d-actions, d ≥ 1, by automorphisms of compact connected abelian groups which contain {{at least one}} expansive automorphism (such actions are called algebraic Z d-actions of expansive rank one). If α is such a Z <b>d-action</b> on an infinite compact connected abelian group X, then every expansive element α n of this action has a dense group ∆αn(X) of homoclinic points. For different expansive elements α m, α n these groups are generally different and may have zero intersection. By obtaining an appropriate structure formula we prove that these groups are canonically isomorphic for different m, n, and that the restriction of α {{to any of these}} groups defines by duality another algebraic Z <b>d-action</b> α ∗ of expansive rank one on a compact connected abelian group X ∗, called the adjoint action of α. The second adjoint α ∗ ∗ = (α ∗) ∗ obtained by repeating this construction is algebraically conjugate to α. A class of examples of algebraic Z d-actions of expansive rank one is obtained by fixing a d-tuple c of algebraic numbers consisting not entirely of roots of unity and by associating with it a finite set Sc of places of the algebraic number field K = K(c) generated by the entries of c. For every Sc-integral ideal I in K we define an algebraic Z <b>d-action</b> α of expansive rank one on a compact connected abelian group. In this case the adjoint action α ∗ arises from the inverse ideal class I − 1 of I. If I, J are two Sc-integral ideals, then the algebraic Z d-actions arising from them are algebraically conjugate if and only if the ideals lie in the same ideal class.

In this case, we show that the continuous hull {{can be seen as the}} projective limit of a suitable sequence of branched, oriented and flat compact d-manifolds. Truncated sequences furnish better and better finite approximations of the asymptotic dynamical system and the algebraic topological features related to this sequence reflect the dynamical properties of the R <b>d-action</b> on the continuous hull.

40|$|Let G be {{a finite}} graph or an {{infinite}} graph on which Z d acts with finite fundamental domain. If G is finite, let T be a random spanning tree chosen uniformly from all spanning trees of G; if G is infinite, methods from [Pem] {{show that this}} still makes sense, producing a random essential spanning forest of G. A method for calculating local characteristics (i. e. finite-dimensional marginals) of T from the transfer-impedance matrix is presented. This differs from the classical matrix-tree theorem in that only small pieces of the matrix (n-dimensional minors) are needed to compute small (n-dimensional) marginals. Calculation of the matrix entries relies on the calculation of the Green’s function for G, {{which is not a}} local calculation. However, it is shown how the calculation of the Green’s function may be reduced to a finite computation in the case when G is an infinite graph admitting a Z <b>d-action</b> with finite quotient.

40|$|A {{depth control}} {{system based on}} the three point hitch of an {{agricultural}} tractor and a wheel sensor was developed for real time soil compaction measurements, aiming to develop compaction maps with uniform soil depths. To measure the distance variation between the soil surface and {{the frame of the}} compaction sensor system a pendulum-type metal-wheel sensor with a linear displacement transducer was designed. An analytical-statistical hybrid model was developed for the direct calculation of the frame height variation utilising the sensor output in volt. Results of various measurements performed on asphalt road, soil road and agricultural silty clay loam soil were compared with ultrasonic measurements to validate the sensor, resulting in standard deviations of 0 • 0035 m, 0 • 0051 m and 0 • 0080 m respectively. The relatively big weight of 175 N made the wheel sensor less sensitive to height variations compared to the ultrasonic sensor when passing directly above plant stubble. Therefore, the wheel sensor can be properly used in fields covered with plant residue and stubble, where the ultrasonic sensor provides misleading measurement of distance from the soil surface. A semi-analytical model was developed for the conversion of the voltage applied to the hydraulic system of the thee point hitch of a New Holland 8160 agricultural tractor to the depth under the soil surface of the cutting tool. The model consists of two distinct submodels: a model for the agricultural tractor based on a kinematic and dynamic analysis of the tractor in the xy-plane and a model for the hydraulic system with a theoretical model structure, for which the parameters have been determined by means of black box frequency domain identification techniques. Both submodels have been coupled and succesfully validated by comparing experimental results with those predicted by the model. It was concluded that the tractor dynamics were not excited by the activity of the hydraulic subsystem. Therefore, a reduced model consisting of the hydraulic system model multiplied by a conversion factor was used for controller design. Based on the dynamic model of the system, several controllers were designed with the root locus technique.
