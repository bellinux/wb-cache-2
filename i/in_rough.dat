5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> {{weather was}} the most obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E

5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 people across 40 different towns. The island of Roatán received {{a gust of}} 58mph (93km/h). Farther north and west in Belize, the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center—popular attractions for tourists—were heavily damaged. About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when his boat capsized <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> seas, while a second man was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, a {{schooner}} carrying {{four people}} capsized <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> seas roughly 250mi (400km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on June30.

5|$|Steps {{were taken}} during David's reign {{to make the}} {{government}} of that part of Scotland he administered more like the government of Anglo-Norman England. New sheriffdoms enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During his reign, royal sheriffs were established in the king's core personal territories; namely, <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> chronological order, at Roxburgh, Scone, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Stirling and Perth. The Justiciarship too was created in David's reign. Although this institution had Anglo-Norman origins, in Scotland north of the Forth at least, it represented some form of continuity with an older office.|$|E

In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the stalled sci-fi horror film project Night Skies.

5|$|The {{storm petrel}} cannot survive on islands where land mammals such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural {{predation}} from gulls, skuas, owls and falcons. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern {{due to its}} high total numbers. Its presence <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> weather at sea has led to various mariners' superstitions, and, by analogy, to its use as a symbol by revolutionary and anarchist groups.|$|E

5|$|As Typhoon Tingting {{approached}} the Mariana Islands, three Chinese women drowned <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> seas {{produced by the}} storm in Saipan. On June28, Tingting produced strong winds throughout the region. Sustained winds on Guam reached 82km/h (51mph) with gusts to 106km/h (66mph); a pressure of 994.6hPa (mbar) was also recorded on the island. Although located closer {{to the center of}} Tingting, Rota reported lower winds than Guam; the highest sustained wind reached 70km/h (44mph) with gusts of 93km/h (58mph). Due to the lack of sufficient observations on Tinian, the highest sustained winds recorded were suspected to be lower than what they really were. Winds of 56km/h (35mph) were recorded several times with gusts to 84km/h (52mph). Sustained winds on Saipan were recorded up to 100km/h (62mph) with gusts to 124km/h (77mph); a pressure of 984.9hPa (mbar) was also recorded. The highest winds during Typhoon Tingting throughout the Mariana Islands were measured on Pagan Island where 106km/h (66mph) sustained winds were recorded along with a gust of 212km/h (132mph).|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Prime Minister Holt {{vanished}} while swimming <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> seas near Melbourne; {{his body}} was never recovered. John McEwen, {{as leader of the}} junior Coalition partner, the Country Party, took over as prime minister for three weeks until the Liberals could elect a new leader. Senator John Gorton won the vote and became prime minister. The leadership campaign was conducted mostly by television, and Gorton appeared to have the visual appeal needed to keep Whitlam out of office. Gorton resigned his seat in the Senate, and in February 1968 won the by-election for Holt's seat of Higgins in Victoria. For the remainder of the year, Gorton appeared to have the better of Whitlam in the House of Representatives. In his chronicle of the Whitlam years, however, speechwriter Graham Freudenberg asserts that Gorton's erratic behaviour, Whitlam's strengthening of his party, and events outside Australia (such as the Vietnam War) ate away at Liberal dominance.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the storm, several of the main roads in New Orleans were shut down due to flooding. At least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. In Baton Rouge, dozens of people were {{evacuated}} from a flooded home via ambulance and wagon to safer areas. In nearby Mississippi, rainfall from the storm was mainly confined to the southeastern counties; however, significant accumulations, peaking at , were recorded. Rain from the remnant low spread into Georgia. Some stream flooding and crop damage were reported but overall, the damage was minor. In all, Arlene caused $500,000 ($3.7million 2010 USD) in damage. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> surf off the Galveston coast. After the initial low dissipated over the southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.|$|E
5|$|Furious was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925 although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side <b>in</b> <b>rough</b> weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious. In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart), each usually of six aircraft.|$|E
