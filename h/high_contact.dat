2500|$|In round 16, Cotchin was {{reported}} {{for a late}} bump on 's Sam Wright. Wright was concussed in the incident and the AFL's match review panel judged the hit to be reckless with <b>high</b> <b>contact</b> and of high impact. Cotchin was offered a three-match suspension, which he and the club subsequently challenged. The AFL Tribunal found him guilty, and upgraded him to a four match suspension {{as a result of}} the unsuccessful challenge. Cotchin returned to football for Richmond's final two games of the season against [...] and Port Adelaide. He recorded twenty-two disposals and kicked two goals in each of the two matches. His season total of 17 matches was his highest to date and was his 19.5 disposals and 4.8 clearances per game. Cotchin finished seventh in the club's best and fairest award that year.|$|E

The water meniscus will propagate in microchannel by capillary action if ΔP has positive value [12], and in our experiments, we have observed that the air-water meniscus movement was slower in the microchannel of <b>higher</b> <b>contact</b> angle, indicating that θ 1 (surface wettability reduced) was increased while maintaining w, h, and θ 2. For <b>higher</b> <b>contact</b> angles fluid flow is significantly slower than for low contact angles, a conclusion supported by Equation 4.|$|R

5000|$|Ultrasonic {{vibration}} machining physically operates by {{the mechanism}} of microchipping or erosion on the work piece's surface. Since the abrasive slurry is kept in motion by high frequency, low amplitude vibrations the impact forces of the slurry are significant causing <b>high</b> <b>contact</b> stresses. These <b>high</b> <b>contact</b> stresses are achieved by the small contact area between the slurry's particles and the work piece's surface.

50|$|On a given {{volume of}} air or liquid, {{the surface area}} changes {{proportionally}} with drop or bubble size, the very surface area where exchange can occur.

50|$|Hydrophobic {{molecules}} {{tend to be}} nonpolar and, thus, prefer other neutral {{molecules and}} nonpolar solvents. Because water molecules are polar, hydrophobes do not dissolve well among them. Hydrophobic molecules in water often cluster together, forming micelles.
