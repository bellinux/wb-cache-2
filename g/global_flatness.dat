40|$|In {{large area}} micro hot embossing, process {{temperature}} plays {{a critical role}} in both the local fidelity of microstructure formation and global uniformity. Micro embossing at the lowest temperature with acceptable fidelity can improve the <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> after demolding. This paper focuses on polymer deformation and recovery in micro embossing when the process temperatures are below its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this study, PMMA (Polymethyl Methacrylate) substrates (Tg = 105 °C) were employed as the process material, and the process temperature ranged from 25 °C to Tg. It was found that at temperature below Tg- 55 °C, significant recovery occurred after processing, but it was still possible to form permanent structures with sufficiently high loading stress. With an increase in temperature, plastic deformation increased and was the dominate polymer deformation for permanent cavities formation. However, the formation of protrusive structures was not complete since there was little polymer flow. The polymer will lose its storage modulus at a raised temperature and microstructures could be formed with high fidelity. A compromise between the local fidelity and <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> has to be reached in micro hot embossing...|$|E

The significance of low temperature hot embossing is to improve <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> of embossed devices. This paper reports on experimental studies of polymer deformation and relaxation in micro embossing when the process temperatures are below or near its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this investigation, an indentation system and a micro embosser were used to investigate the relationship of microstructure formation versus process temperature and load pressure. The depth of indentation was controlled and the load force at a certain indentation depth was measured. Experiments were carried out using 1 mm thick PMMA films with the process temperature ranging from Tg- 55 °C to Tg + 20 °C. The embossed structures included a single micro cavity and groups of micro cavity arrays. It was found that at temperature of Tg- 55 °C, elastic deformation dominated the formation of microstructures and significant relaxation happened after embossing. From Tg- 20 °C to Tg, plastic deformation dominated polymer deformation, and permanent cavities could be formed on PMMA substrates without obvious relaxation.

A general space lidar performance issue is the obstruction by optically dense clouds. For this purpose cloud free statistics, the <b>global</b> cloud top <b>flatness</b> and <b>global</b> cloud top distributions were derived from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Path�nder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) level 2, 333 m and 5 km lidar cloud-layer products between 01 January 2007 and 01 January 2008. Merging both data sets together thereby allowed the best possible simulation of near global and seasonal real world atmospheric conditions that a spaceborne Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar like MERLIN will encounter. With 40. 5 % overall global cloud free fraction, a cloud gap distribution which is following a power-law distribution with exponent 1. 51 +-� 0. 01 together with a mean cloud gap length of 7. 41 km and about 200 daily <b>global</b> cloud top <b>flatness</b> events, the analysis reveals a dominance of small cloud gaps which is confirmed by a low median cloud gap length of only 1 km. While the cloud free fraction results were compared and confirmed with Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) seasonal and annual cloud fraction data, the power-law distribution of cloud gaps was confirmed by an extensive statistical analysis using maximum likelihood estimation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and likelihood ratio tests. Taking 6. 05 x 10 e 8 individual CALIPSO measurements of the year 2007 with a horizontal resolution of 333 m and computing cloud gap and cloud free statistics for 2 �x 2 � latitude/longitude grid points thereby identified regional and seasonal changes in the probability of spaceborne lidar surface detection.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, high {{resolution}} spatial light modulators (SLMs) have been developed at the IMS Dresden. These are fabricated using one of two different technological processes. In one version a flexible, highly reflecting aluminum coating of about 50 nm is evaporated onto a elastic layer, while the other version has quite rigid aluminum mirrors that are suspended by flexible hinges above the substrate. Both versions are fabricated {{on top of a}} CMOS DRAM matrix, which allows the addressing of individual pixels. So far SLMs with over 2 million pixels have been produced. In order to ensure a high quality of these SLMs a map of the SLM under test is needed showing the exact position of defective pixels together with the type of defect e. g. not responding, always deflected, wrong spring constant, poorly reflecting surface. Additionally information on the local and <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> is required. This task can only be handled by an automated test stitching together many single measurements.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of cosmic shear, or distortion {{of images of}} distant sources unaccompanied by magnification, is an effective way of probing the content and state of the foreground Universe, because light rays {{do not have to}} pass through mass structures in order to be sheared. It is shown that the delay in the arrival times between two simultaneously emitted photons that appear to be arriving from a pair of images of a strongly lensed cosmological source contains not only information about the Hubble constant, but also the long range gravitational effect of galactic scale mass clumps located away from the light paths in question. This is therefore also a method of detecting shear. Data on time delays among a sample of strongly lensed sources can provide crucial information about whether extra dynamics beyond gravity and dark energy are responsible for the <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> of space. If the standard Λ CDM model is correct, there should be a large dispersion in the value of H_ 0 as inferred from the delay data by (the usual procedure of) ignoring the effect of all other mass clumps except the strong lens itself. The fact that there has not been any report of a significant deviation from the h = 0. 7 mark during any of the H_ 0 determinations by this technique may already be pointing to the absence of the random effect discussed here.

40|$|Abstract. For {{manufacturing}} of Integrated Circuits (IC), Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CPM) is {{the most}} popular method to reach a <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> in wafer fabrication. One of the most important factors to be concerned in CMP is the polishing pad. The polishing pad needs to be dressed to maintain the quality and the throughput of production. This is due to the wear of polishing pad and the influence of impurities. Particularly important targets in the pad dressing are to increase the material removal rate (MRR) and a low non-uniformity (N. u.). A higher material removal rate (MRR) is achieved by higher stresses acted on to the pad. Meanwhile, stiffness properties of pad are changeable because of depth elimination and deterioration in the non-uniformity (N. u.) of pad surface. Therefore, in order to conduct an improved planarization process with higher MRR and lower N. u., an investigation of pad deformation is necessary. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop pad deformation equations for pad dressing. Firstly, the uniform circular distribution pressure is used to simulate applied loading on polishing pad done by dresser during dressing process. Then, the three-dimensional pad deformation depth and stiffness of polishing pad are obtained by using Hertizian contact theorem and principle of elasticity. Finally, the superposition method is introduced to calculate the deformation resulted from total dressing force. The theoretical results reveal that the deformation in the center of dresser is significant. Similar deformed-shapes are obtained for different pad depth under the same loading. In conclusion, the deformed magnitude is strongly correlated to the indices such as MRR and Nu...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the electrostatic potential {{generated by a}} point charge at rest in Reissner-Nordström space-time with a conical defect. An expression for the selfenergy is also presented. PACS nos. 04. 20 -q, 41. 20 -q, 41. 90 +e It {{is well known that}} the gravitational field modifies the electrostatic interaction of a charged particle {{in such a way that}} the particle experiences a finite self-force [1, 2]. The origin of this force comes from the space-time curvature associated with the gravitational field. On the other hand, even in the absence of curvature, such as in the conical space-time of an infinite straight cosmic string [3], it was shown that a charged point particle [4] or a linear charge distribution [5] placed at rest in this background becomes subject to a finite repulsive electrostatic self-force. In this case, the origin of this force is the distortion in the particle field caused by the lack of <b>global</b> <b>flatness</b> of the space-time of a cosmic string. Therefore, the modifications of the electrostatic potential comes from two contributions, one of geometric origin and the other of topological one. Some authors have suggested that the most simple exact solutions of Einstein’s equations can easily be generalized to include a conical defect [6]. Such space-times have been considered in different context and some investigations were done in these backgrounds [7]. In this paper we determine the expression for the electrostatic potential generated by a point charge held stationary in the space-time of Reissner- Nordström pierced by a cosmic string and also determine the self-energy. These results extend previous one obtained by Linet [8] in the case of a Schwarzschild background with conical defect. The Reissner-Nordström space-time endowed with a conical defect takes the following 1 form ds 2 =...|$|E
