5|$|It {{was first}} time I ever swung wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. I had never played every day <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> That's totally different.... You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E

5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy point <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and the song reflects the yearning {{that was going on}} inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always {{feel the need to}} be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

25|$|I {{do want to}} {{move people}} on some deep level. But I won't take on the mantle of social responsibility. That's not {{compatible}} with entertainment.
