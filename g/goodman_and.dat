5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis was {{described}} as a new species in the second 2009 paper by <b>Goodman</b> <b>and</b> colleagues. The specific name is derived from the Malagasy word Mahafaly, which refers to the Mahafaly Plateau, where the specimen has been recorded, and to the Mahafaly ethnic group of the region. Analysis of sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene suggested that M.brachytragos is most closely related to another Malagasy species, M.sororculus. Although samples of M.mahafaliensis differed from each other by a maximum of 2.2% in their cytochrome b, <b>Goodman</b> <b>and</b> colleagues could not discern any phylogeographic structure within the species.|$|E

5|$|During 2009, Steven <b>Goodman</b> <b>and</b> colleagues {{published}} two {{papers that}} found {{a total of}} five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues (1995), up to four of which {{can be found in a}} single locality. In order to determine the true identity of M.manavi, <b>Goodman</b> <b>and</b> Claude Maminirina obtained bats near the type locality of M.manavi (the site where the original material was collected, from which the species was described) for inclusion in the analysis; they also sequenced one of Thomas's original specimens. Among the five species they identified, M.griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only; M.mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island; and M.manavi itself is known only from the eastern edge of the Central Highlands. These five species are not each other's closest relatives according to analyses of cytochrome b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution. Cytochrome b suggested that the closest relative of M.manavi is the slightly larger M.petersoni from southeastern Madagascar. Two specimens of M.manavi differed by 1.3% in their cytochrome b sequences and by 2.5% from M.petersoni.|$|E

5|$|During a 2003 {{biological}} {{inventory of}} the Mikea Forest, a forest region of southwestern Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus Macrotarsomys was collected. This animal {{turned out to be}} distinct from both previously known species of the genus—bastard big-footed mouse, which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger greater big-footed mouse, known only from the Ankarafantsika National Park. Accordingly, Steven <b>Goodman</b> <b>and</b> Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, Macrotarsomys petteri. The specific name, petteri, honors French zoologist Francis Petter for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. Petter's big-footed mouse, the largest species in the genus, is most similar to greater big-footed mouse, which may be its closest relative.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} the Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War, {{through the end of}} the Indian Wars there were 426 {{recipients}} who received it for actions in one of the Indian Wars, including four American Jews.

The last Jew to receive the medal for the Indian wars was Jacob Trautman who received it for his actions in the battle now frequently referred to as the Wounded Knee Massacre.|$|E
