5|$|The {{territory}} of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, {{who had a}} friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: each would leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen <b>Friday</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy ("White Zebu") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.|$|E

25|$|In Maryland, the Maryland Transit Administration ran special snow trains on {{its heavy}} rail and light rail lines to keep tracks clear. Delaware Gov.

Bob McDonnell and snow emergencies declared in the District of Columbia and some Maryland counties). Maryland was under a state of emergency as of mid-day on February 6, as state and county road crews said they were struggling to keep even one lane open on major roads and 151,000 customers were without power in Maryland, including 34,000 Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. customers in the region. Cars were left abandoned on highways, trees came down and Humvees were used to ferry patients to local hospitals.

25|$|Arnold's Wildcats were {{a highly}} {{successful}} team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22–4 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi Finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated Eastside Spectres in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had {{a unique opportunity to}} win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point {{in the history of the}} NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109–83). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86–81). Game 2 was played on a <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90–80) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.|$|E

500|$|Small {{numbers of}} German Jews began {{settling}} in Eugene {{in the late}} 19th century, but most moved on. In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there, and by the 1920s Eugene's Jewish community began gathering prayer quorums for holding <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> Jewish holiday services in individuals' homes. Historian Steven Lowenstein writes that [...] "fter Hymen Rubenstein's death in 1933, his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remodeled and named Temple Beth Israel".

500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E

2500|$|The Herald {{published}} {{a story on}} May 3 that Hart had spent <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> most of Saturday with {{a young woman in}} his Washington, D.C. townhouse.

If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'll be very bored." [...] The Heralds reporters at some point learned that the New York Times was planning to feature the story with the quote on Sunday, incorporated it into their story, and the two articles appearing on the same day ignited a political firestorm. On Sunday, Hart's campaign denied any scandal and condemned the Heralds reporters for intrusive reporting. [...] Hart later noted that his [...] "follow me around" [...] comment was not [...] "challenging the press with a taunt", but, made in frustration, was only intended to invite the media to observe his public behavior, and [...] never intended to invite reporters to be [...] "skulking around in the shadows" [...] of his home. [...] '“He did not {{think of it as a}} challenge,” Dionne would recall many years later. “And at the time, I did not think of it as a challenge.”' [...] Nor did Hart's comment influence the Miami Herald to pursue the story.|$|E
