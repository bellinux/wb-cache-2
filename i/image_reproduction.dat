Five observers matched two scenes using a memory matching technique. Observers were able to produce accurate matches when originals and reproductions were viewed at the same white point.

These matches were compared to the predictions of various color appearance models using a paired-comparison technique in a second psychophysical experiment.

5|$|Although Watts's {{work was}} seen as {{outdated}} and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed Hope's intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in The Old Guitarist (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, {{by the time of}} his death in 1904 Hope had become a globally recognised <b>image.</b> <b>Reproductions</b> circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, Hope was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld Grimké's Rachel explicitly use the addition of a copy of Hope to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.|$|R
50|$|In {{the history}} of the German Democratic Republic Leow was in the first decades after his death a {{so-called}} Damnatio Memoriae, that means, he was concealed deliberately in {{the history of}} the GDR and in the public culture of remembrance of the East German state: His person was deliberately not mentioned and traces of its existence have been systematically eliminated from publicated documents and <b>image</b> <b>reproductions</b> of the GDR. So Leow was for example out retouched of a widely printed photograph that showed him next to Ernst Thälmann during a RFB march in the 1920s. The reason for this practice was that the arrest and murder Leows (before fascism of German Communists and refugees) by the Soviet sister state did not fit into the historical picture of the GDR, and therefore in his publications were not allowed to occur.|$|R

Main idea of this thesis is to compare and analyze the qualitative parameters of flexographic and digital printing machines. In literature analysis, many articles of this topic are to be examined, to get enough information that is needed and methodologies, which will help to achieve better and more accurate results. Digital printing method is growing more and more popular very fast, because it opens doors to various possibilities, for using variety of materials which is getting wider and wider day by day. Qualitative parameters of this printing method are analyzed and compared to flexographic printing, also with international quality standard ISO 12647 - 6 : 2012 and {{with one of the}} most popular standard in flexographic printing – FIRST (standard, which defines qualitative parameters of flexographic <b>images</b> <b>reproduction).</b> All of the pros and cons of flexographic and digital printing will be analyzed and compared to each other in this thesis...|$|R

50|$|Due {{to section}} 374 of the Patriot Act, the {{definition}} of domestic counterfeiting now encompasses analog, digital, or electronic <b>image</b> <b>reproductions</b> and the penalties are set out {{in various parts of}} the U.S. Code. Penalties for domestic counterfeiting were increased to 20 years imprisonment for the counterfeiting of obligations or securities, and also for passing off counterfeited currency. It also makes it an offense to own an analog, digital, or electronic image of any obligation or other security of the United States, to make an impression of tools that are used to make such an obligation or possess or sell impressions of tools used for obligations or securities. The penalties for such violations of the law are severe: offenders will be imprisoned for up to 25 years. The law also considersconnecting parts of different notes to be a counterfeiting offense, and the Patriot Act increased the penalty from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. The Act also increases the penalty from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years for counterfeiting bonds and obligations of certain domestic lending agencies.|$|R
