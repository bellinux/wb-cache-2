5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|Accommodation for {{students}} is {{primarily in the}} central precinct of the university and two areas of Bristol: Clifton and Stoke Bishop. In Stoke Bishop, Wills Hall {{on the edge of}} the Clifton Downs was the first to be opened, in 1929, by the then chancellor, Winston Churchill. Its original quadrangle layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. Churchill Hall, named for the chancellor, followed in 1956, then Badock Hall in 1964. At the time of Badock Hall's establishment, some of the buildings were called Hiatt Baker Hall, but two years later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the university. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was University Hall, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992. The University's newest undergraduate residence, 33 Colston Street, was opened in the city centre in October 2011 after acquiring the property in 2009. The university established a partnership with Unite PLC in order provide accommodation due to increase in number of students accepted for entry for academic year 2012/2013. A£20 million project of expanding facilities of Hiatt Baker is to provide additional 327 places for undergraduate students in 2014. All of the main halls elect <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> to the Junior Common Room to organise the halls social calendar for the next year.
