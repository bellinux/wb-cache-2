Incompatibility of attributes in terms of measurement rates or header labeling between datasets results in outliers, leading to an inconsistent result from an application. The attributes of consistency are as follow. ① <b>Header</b> <b>frame</b> consistency: consistency of the <b>header</b> <b>frame</b> of the device. This could be categorized into: persistence of PMU header that states whether the PMU header structure is consistent over time, and persistence of PDC header that states whether the PDC header structure is consistent over time. ② Data frame consistency: consistency of data frames of the device.

40|$|For {{efficient}} {{non-linear editing}} (NLE) operations, a flash file {{system should be}} designed considering three factors: data indexing, system calls and <b>frame</b> <b>header</b> updates. Based on the hybrid architecture of phase-change RAM (PRAM) and NAND flash, we introduce a non-linear editing flash file system (NLE-FFS) which is designed for mobile multimedia devices that support NLE. In the proposed file system, the following three features are proposed. First, new data indexing scheme is proposed that is not limited by page-alignment constraint. Not only does it deal effectively with large multimedia files, it also facilitates flexible datamanagement. Second, new system calls are proposed that minimize re-write overhead due to NLE operations by updating a small amount Of metadata. Finally, an H-data block is proposed to reduce the overhead caused by <b>frame</b> <b>header</b> updates. The H-data block is a PRAM region reserved for <b>frame</b> <b>header</b> data updates.

40|$|This paper overviews a novel {{switching}} architecture for high-speed networks: Isochronets. Isochronets time-divide {{network bandwidth}} among routing trees. Traffic moves down a routing tree {{to the root}} during its time band. Network functions such as routing and flow control are entirely governed by band timers and require no processing of <b>frame</b> <b>headers</b> bits. <b>Frame</b> motions need not be delayed for switch processing, allowing Isochronets to scale over a large spectrum of transmission speeds and support all-optical implementations. The network functions as a media-access layer that can support multiple framing protocols simultaneously, handled by higher layers at the periphery. Internetworking is reduced to a simple media-layer bridging. Isochronets provide flexible quality of service control and multicasting through allocation of bands to routing trees. They can be tuned to span a spectrum of performance behaviors outperforming both circuit or packet switching. 1 Introduction R [...] ...|$|R

30|$|In this {{overview}} of the topics that are addressed in this special issue, we first consider narrowband single-carrier systems, where narrow band means that the RF bandwidth {{of the system is}} comparable with the symbol transmission rate of the link. This is, for example, typical for a satellite link. In the paper by Lee et al. the frame synchronization problem in a DVB-S 2 link was investigated. The link works at low SNR and uses forward error correction for data detection. Further, the incoming signal is disturbed by a large clock frequency offset. Under these hostile circumstances, the traditional correlation method, that looks for the synchronization sequence available in the <b>frame</b> <b>header</b> to obtain <b>frame</b> synchronization, gives rise to poor performance. To solve this problem, and to make the frame synchronizer more robust, the authors modify the correlation-based estimator with an additional correction term depending on the signal energy.|$|R
