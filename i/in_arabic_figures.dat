On the 17th {{he sent a}} copy of the verses to Moore, then {{resident}} at Paris; and on September 20 he desired Moore to get [...] "twenty copies of the whole carefully and privately printed off." [...] A copy is in the possession of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am indebted to his kindness for the following description: [...] "The pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz. half-title ('The Irish Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp. [1], [2] + Text, pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a dropped head, 'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp. 4-7 contain six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up thirty-two in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.' There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,' occurs on pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered <b>in</b> <b>Arabic</b> <b>figures</b> in the outside corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered <b>in</b> <b>Arabic</b> <b>figures.</b> The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a peculiar fine-ribbed paper." [...] Twenty stanzas of The Irish Avatar were printed by Medwin in Conversations of Lord Byron, 1824, pp. 216-220, and in a second edition, 1824, pp. 332-338. In a [...] "new edition" [...] of the Conversations, etc., 1824, pp. 264-270, the entire poem, numbering thirty-two stanzas, was published {{for the first time in}} England (see Athenæum, July 27, 1901). The Irish Avatar was first published by Murray in 1831 (Works, vi. 419-425).|$|E
50|$|Its {{timber-frame}} architecture featured multi-level gables, and facades {{embedded with}} glass. A contemporary observer described its {{appearance in the}} mid-19th century, prior to its demolition:The outside of the building {{was covered with a}} strong, and, as time has proved, durable cement, in which was observable coarse gravel and broken glass, the latter consisting of fragments of dark-colored junk bottles. At {{the upper part of the}} principle gable on the Dock square front the date of the time of erecting the building, 1680, was distinctly impressed into the rough-cast cement <b>in</b> <b>Arabic</b> <b>figures,</b> together with various ornamental devices.|$|E
5000|$|This {{astrolabe}} presents {{some unusual}} characteristics. All the engraved characters are in Latin, this fact made the scholars {{think that the}} instrument {{was made in the}} Christian Europe. The pointers of his [...] "spider" [...] indicate eighteen stars: ten boreal stars and eight austral stars (that is to say, situated beneath of the equator). Eleven of them correspond to the date of 980 AD. Still like this, the names of the stars are not engraved on the brass. The words ROME and FRANCE are engraved in Latin characters in one of the eardrums. These characters are accompanied by the numbers 41-30 (<b>in</b> <b>arabic</b> <b>figures).</b> The characters are identical to those used {{at the end of the}} 10th century in the Catalan Latin manuscripts, being Catalonia in that moment a mark of the Carolingian France. This would explain the presence of the word FRANCE. The figures express in degrees and minutes: 41° 30′, which correspond exactly to the latitude of Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} {{numbering}} the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work Der Parthenon, and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme {{in the light of}} recent discoveries. The convention, here preserved, is that blocks are numbered in Roman and <b>figures</b> <b>in</b> <b>Arabic</b> numerals, the <b>figures</b> are numbered left to right against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south.|$|R
60|$|Numerals are {{occasionally}} seen <b>in</b> <b>Arabic</b> {{or other}} <b>figures,</b> not disposed {{in any particular}} Form, but coloured.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1860s Elmore was {{moving away from}} such Hogarthian {{subjects}} towards a more classical style influenced by Edward Poynter and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. He also painted <b>Arabic</b> <b>figures,</b> <b>in</b> line with the vogue for Orientalism in art.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arabic</b> {{literary}} <b>figures</b> include Ali Douagi, who {{has written}} more than 150 radio plays, more than 500 poems and songs, and nearly 15 plays.

Other literary figures include Moncef Ghachem, Hassan Ben Othmen, Habib Selmi, Walid Soliman and Mahmoud Messaadi. Messaadi was known for points of intersection of Islamic themes and nationalism within his work. Tunisian poetry is non-conformist and innovative: the language of Abou el Kacem Chebbi opposes the lack of imagination <b>in</b> <b>Arabic</b> literature.|$|R
