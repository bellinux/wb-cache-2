40|$|There {{is concern}} that the conifer {{component}} of mixed conifer-deciduous forests in the Great Lakes region is on the decline, possibly the result of insufficient conifer regeneration. Limitations on conifer regeneration that occur during the first 18 months of seedling emergence and establishment were examined for Abies balsamea (L.)

We hypothesized that the removal of potential barriers to regeneration, including forest floor, seed predation, and competition with understory vegetation, will enhance conifer regeneration.

RDS-corrected estimates of syphilis antibody prevalence ranged from 12. 8 to 26. 8 % in Tijuana and from 2. 9 to 15. 6 % in Ciudad Juárez, depending on how recruitment patterns were modeled, and assumptions about how network size affected an individual’s probability of being included in the sample.

Our ap-proach is based on Riemannian geometry, the viability {{of which has been}} demonstrated by various researchers in foregoing work. In the Rie-mannian framework bundles of axons are represented by geodesics on the manifold. Here we do not discuss methods to compute these geodesics, nor do we rely on the availability of geodesics. Instead we propose local measures which are directly computable from the local DTI data, and which enable us to preselect viable or <b>exclude</b> uninteresting <b>seed</b> points for the potentially time consuming extraction of geodesics. If geodesics are available, our measures can be readily applied to these as well. We consider two types of geodesic measures. One pertains to the con-nectivity saliency of a geodesic, the second to its stability with respect to local spatial perturbations. For the first type of measure we consider both differential as well as integral measures for characterizing a geodesic’s saliency either locally or globally. (In the latter case one needs to be in possession of the geodesic curve, in the former case a single tangent vec-tor suffices.) The second type of measure is intrinsically local, and turns out to be related to a well known tensor in Riemannian geometry...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{cerebral}} cortices are {{of great}} importance for {{our understanding of the}} human brain. Although their functions are relatively monomodal, primary cerebral cortices have been suggested to compromise structurally and functionally distinct subregions from many evidences, for example, cytoarchitectionics, myeloarchitectonics and functional brain imaging. In recent years, structural connectivity-based parcellation using diffusion MRI has been extensively used to do parcellation of subcortical areas and association cortex. However, it has rarely been employed to primary cerebral cortices. In connectivity-based parcellation, connectivity profiles are very vital. Different researchers used different information of connectivity profiles, such as global connectivity profiles (the connectivity information from seed to the whole brain) and long connectivity profiles (the connectivity information from seed to other brain regions after <b>excluding</b> the <b>seed).</b> Given that primary cerebral cortices are rich of local hierarchical connections and possess high local functional connectivity profiles, we proposed that local connectivity profiles (the connectivity information in the seed region of interest (ROI)) might be used for parcellating primary cerebral cortices. Global, long and local connectivity profiles were compared on M 1, A 1, S 1 and V 1. We found that results using the three were all in good consistency with cytoarchitectonic results. More importantly, results using local connectivity profiles showed less inter-subject variability than results using the other two. This suggests that for parcellation of primary cerebral cortices local connectivity profiles are superior to global and long connectivity profiles. This also infers us that different connectivity profiles should be adopted according to the characteristics of the cerebral cortices...|$|R
40|$|Background: Respondent-driven {{sampling}} (RDS) is a chain- referral {{method that}} is being widely used to recruit most at-risk populations. Because the method is respondent driven, observations are dependent. However, few publications have focused on methodological challenges {{in the analysis of}} data collected by RDS. Methods: In this article, we propose a method for estimating the vari- ance of the HIV prevalence rate, based on the Markov transition prob- abilities and within recruitment cluster variation. The method was applied to a female commercial sex workers study carried out in 10 Brazilian cities in 2008. Both the inverse of network size {{and the size of the}} city were considered in the estimation of overall sampling weights. The study included a behavior questionnaire and rapid tests for HIV and syphilis. Results: About 2523 interviews were conducted successfully, <b>excluding</b> the <b>seeds.</b> Results show a positive homophily between recruits for those HIV+; HIV- recruiters selected HIV+ recruits 4 % of the time; HIV+ recruiters selected other HIV+ recruits 19. 6 % of the time, about 5 times higher. The prevalence rate was estimated at 4. 8 % (95 % confidence interval: 3. 4 to 6. 1), and a design effect of 2. 63. Conclusions: Using statistical methods for complex sample designs, it was possible to estimate HIV prevalence, standard error, and the design effect analytically. Additionally, the proposed analysis lends itself to logistic regression, permitting multivariate models. The stratification in cities has proved suitable for reducing the effect of design and can be adopted in other RDS studies, provided the weights of the strata are known...|$|R

Bancroft et al. / 1 / publishing the first data, interpreted their spectra as a superposition of three doublets : one from Fe++ in a tetrahedral site.

Overmore a mixture of both is evidently in contradiction with the former NGR experiments. Not before 1977 (Fleet / 4 /) was the crystal structure of Deerite well understood. Cations occupy only octahedral sites, forming strips of 6 sites in the a-b plane and continuous band along the c-axis by the superposition of three of those strips. The sites fall in three nearly equivalent classes with bond lengths of 2. 09 for M 1, 2. 15 for M 4 and 2. 15 Å for M 7 sites.
