5|$|A {{revision}} to Allied plans {{meant that}} Morotai played {{a much greater}} role in the liberation of the Philippines than had been originally envisioned. The invasion of Mindanao was postponed in September 1944 in favour of a landing at Leyte in the central Philippines in late October. The air bases at Morotai were the closest Allied air strips to Leyte, and <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> bombers based on the island attacked targets in the southern Philippines and NEI {{in support of the}} landing at Leyte on 25 October. After airfields were completed at Leyte, Morotai was also used as a staging point for <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> bombers traveling to the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|In Jilib, the Islamists used bulldozers {{to prepare}} {{trenches}} and defensive positions. They had about 3,000 <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> 60 technicals mounted with antiaircraft and antitank guns. Up to 4,700 people fled the area {{ahead of the}} fighting.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen Fleet Air Arm squadrons {{were posted}} aboard Ark Royal during her career; {{an average of}} five squadrons at any time. On {{entering}} service, most of Ark Royals squadrons were equipped with either Blackburn Skuas—used as <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> dive bombers—or Fairey Swordfish, for reconnaissance and torpedo bombing. From April 1940, squadrons equipped with Skuas were upgraded to Fairey Fulmars; like their predecessors, these were used as <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> bombers. On occasion, the carrier operated Blackburn Roc fighter-bombers (from April 1939 – October 1940) and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers (during October 1941); these were replacement aircraft used to boost squadron numbers. In June 1940, Ark Royal was host to 701 Naval Air Squadron, a training squadron which operated Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance amphibians.|$|E

5|$|After {{signing the}} Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May Molotov left for Washington, D.C., United States. Molotov met with Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and {{ratified}} a Lend-Lease Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the United States government, albeit vaguely, promised {{to open up}} a second front against Germany. On his flight back to the USSR his plane was attacked by German <b>fighters,</b> <b>and</b> then later by Soviet fighters.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or the sands of the Mediterranean front.|$|E

Wryneck {{launched}} her whaler, and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Survivors in the whaler set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift.|$|E

5|$|Claudius, {{the fourth}} Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire {{following}} Caligula's death in AD 41 {{until his death}} in AD 54. According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of the games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the <b>fighters,</b> <b>and</b> he was criticized for not leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes.|$|E
5|$|During the British scramble, Bf 109s from JG 52 {{which were}} part of a pre-raid sweep, chanced upon RAF fighters out in the open at RAF Manston. Twelve Bf 109s from 2 Staffel II./JG 52, led by Hauptmann Wolfgang Ewald {{attacked}} while the British fighters were refuelling. After two passes, the Germans claimed 10 <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> three Blenheims destroyed. In fact, just two No. 266 Squadron RAF Spitfires were destroyed with another six Hurricanes damaged but repairable. A single Hurricane was also destroyed.|$|E

During the conflict, Betsimisaraka nationalists fought French and Senegalese soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt {{to regain control of}} the port at Tamatave, the island's most important trading port. Betsimisaraka <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> civilians suffered very heavy losses and some of the worst human rights abuses, including execution by being thrown alive from airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both <b>fighters</b> <b>and</b> anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.|$|E
