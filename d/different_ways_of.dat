5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> implementing exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management.

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{mass and}} energy, as {{expressed by the}} formula E=mc, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity.|$|E
