500|$|Browning downplayed {{evidence}} {{brought to}} him by his intelligence officer, Major Brian Urquhart, that the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg were in the Arnhem area, but was not as confident as he led his subordinates to believe. According to Major-General Urquhart, GOC of the British 1st Airborne Division, when informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days, Browning responded that they could hold it for four, but later claimed to Urquhart that he had added: [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be going a bridge too far." ...|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have {{stretched}} a {{point in}} a case of illness.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CLANDON Er---oh, yes: it's so hot, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have {{a jug of}} claret cup.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if there}} is no one in front, uncle, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be able to keep ahead. Our horses are as good as they are likely to have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{manage a}} shark, sir. I once {{saw one of}} those animals, and I do really believe the sogdollager would {{outweigh}} him. <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> manage a shark, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, and don't you see," [...] said Henrietta, [...] "there {{in front}} of the altar is a space, where <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> make the cross and 'I H S' in holly?" ...|$|R
60|$|Chasuble. It's pleasant, is it not, to see {{so perfect}} a reconciliation? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> leave the two {{brothers}} together.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Dad, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well knock {{through the}} Round Plantation. Giles {{tells me that}} the old speckle-backed buck lies up here." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. [After {{a slight}} hesitation.] Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be great friends. Let us be great friends. You may want a friend some day.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is no {{time for}} rash acts or excited feelings, Joyce. Though, were my gallant boy with us, <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> make a push at these fellows, with very {{reasonable}} chances of success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Daughter," [...] he said, {{speaking}} in Orofenan, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> understand, [...] "ask these strangers to bring {{one of those}} lamps of theirs that {{by the light of}} it I may study these writings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If Chief Downs can get {{us on the}} Limited," [...] he said, [...] "and if {{we catch}} the City of Boston, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{have a chance of}} making Mr. Jocelyn Thew eat his words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{so you may}} go on {{wondering}} for {{the rest}} of your life, Captain," [...] exclaimed Quick. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> guess if we tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tie you {{on with my}} puggaree. I wish I had the cummerbund which I lent poor Stuart. Now, Tippy, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> make a {{break for}} it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{does seem}} to have put his back up," [...] he agreed. [...] "As to going on, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> just as well move tomorrow. My arm's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Mabel; and God {{bless you}} for {{thinking of the}} welfare of men as humble as we are. We have our pleasures, it is true, {{as well as our}} gifts, but <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be happier; yes, <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be happier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know much}} of these matters,' resumed Nicholas; 'but Portsmouth is a seaport town, and if no other {{employment}} {{is to be}} obtained, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> get on board some ship. I am young and active, and could be useful in many ways. So could you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Well yeah, we {{fucked up}} that song so bad back then, {{that we had}} to remake it now. As a song, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's fucking great and this version is what the {{original}} should have been. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> release it as a single later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what {{think you}} of Vienna, sweetest?' enquired Ferdinand {{in a more}} serious tone; 'upon my honour, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> do great things there. A {{regiment}} and a chamberlainship at the least!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Luka. I {{once saw}} them driving down some bars in tough clay {{when they were}} making a railway cutting at home. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{do it in the}} same way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'On {{one side}} {{into their own}} court, on the other into Wulstan Street--a quiet place on the whole--all walls and warehouses; and there's an {{excellent}} parish church, Mr. Underwood's; so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> do worse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clever, {{without a}} doubt," [...] I admitted, [...] "only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{get him to}} use his talents in a more {{orthodox}} way. By the by," [...] I added, putting my {{head out of the}} window, [...] "I think it's getting a little chilly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These steamboats {{are great}} inventions {{for the western}} lakes, as are the railroads for this vast inland region. I dare say you can {{remember}} Lake Erie when it was an unusual thing to see a sail of any sort on it; and now, <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> count fifty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{buy that}} land {{if it was}} oil you were after. One time <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> strike it, but those as know told me there wasn't any there, after they'd looked the {{property}} over," [...] replied the old man, as with trembling hand he held the money toward George.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; {{agreeable}} enough--agreeable enough, I suppose. But {{they stayed}} too long. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{have been sitting}} here for the last half-hour, if they'd only gone sooner, I find it pretty hard to forgive them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doot if we {{can break}} him and wadn't say it's wise to try. If he'll come down anither shilling, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> tak' his coal. That wad be a just price {{and we ought to}} be satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what I meant; we {{are quite}} alone here. I {{have not heard}} a horse-hoof or a {{footstep}} or the hoot of a train for miles. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> stop here {{and ask for a}} miracle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that, Bertie; and as we are in no extraordinary hurry <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have been satisfied with felling the trees to- day, and cutting off the branches and getting them into place to-morrow. Still, as Dias seemed to make nothing of it, I {{did not like to}} knock off at the very start." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara laughed. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] she said. [...] "You had a {{much better}} reason than that. Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were what <b>might</b> be called good comrades in the bush?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{dare not}} urge a suit which may offend you; yet, {{if you could}} read my heart, <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be happy. Let me hope!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is {{a convent}} not far off, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>We</b> <b>might</b> find shelter for you there. Yet they might break in. It {{might not be}} easy to meet. I believe you are safer with me. Will you trust in me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had the American with me," [...] said Endymion, [...] "and {{he is very}} lengthy. However, as to your business, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> talk it over here, {{and perhaps}} settle it." [...] And so they left the room together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps it}} won't be so difficult, after all. There {{is nothing more}} to be done here, Watson. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> drive round to {{the offices of the}} Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good day's work to a conclusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, might's well. I {{was just}} wondering---- <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> much of wasting all our youth waiting---- Two-three years in {{engineering}} school, and maybe going to war, and starting in on an engineering job, and me lonely as a turkey in a chicken yard, and you doing the faithful young lady in Brooklyn---- <b>I</b> <b>think</b> perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> get married tomorrow and----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do declare," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Archibald, [...] "everything {{is in the}} newspapers! <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{settle down}} here and enjoy {{ourselves}} without people talking about our reason for coming!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'd tek care he didn't leather me--no, not {{if he was}} my husban' {{ten times}} o'er; I'd pour hot drippin' on him sooner. But the missis hasn't a sperrit like me. He'll mek her come back, you'll see; he'll come round her somehow. There's no {{likelihood}} of her coming hack to-night, though; so <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> fasten the doors {{and go to bed}} when we like.' ...|$|R
