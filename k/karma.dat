5|$|Jains {{believe that}} <b>karma</b> is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. <b>Karma</b> particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. <b>Karma</b> particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. <b>Karma</b> not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. <b>Karma</b> is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its <b>karma,</b> a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Prakriti (nature or type of <b>karma)</b> – According to Jain texts, {{there are}} eight main types of <b>karma</b> which {{categorized}} into the 'harming' and the 'non-harming'; each divided into four types. The harming karmas (ghātiyā karmas) directly affect the soul powers by impeding its perception, knowledge and energy, and also brings about delusion. These harming karmas are: darśanāvaraṇa (perception-obscuring <b>karma),</b> jñānavāraṇa (knowledge-obscuring <b>karma),</b> antarāya (obstacle-creating <b>karma)</b> and mohanīya (deluding <b>karma).</b> The non-harming category (aghātiyā karmas) {{is responsible for the}} reborn soul's physical and mental circumstances, longevity, spiritual potential and experience of pleasant and unpleasant sensations. These non-harming karmas are: nāma (body-determining <b>karma),</b> āyu (lifespan-determining <b>karma),</b> gotra (status-determining <b>karma)</b> and vedanīya (feeling-producing <b>karma),</b> respectively. Different types of karmas thus affect the soul in different ways as per their nature.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, <b>Karma</b> can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the <b>Karma</b> level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the <b>Karma</b> level. During the game the player will encounter <b>Karma</b> moments, the <b>Karma</b> moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide <b>Karma</b> decisions. Completion of <b>Karma</b> awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the <b>Karma</b> level. The player is not locked into choosing either <b>Karma</b> path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. <b>Karma</b> also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil <b>Karma</b> or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good <b>Karma.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} statistic {{tracked by}} {{the game is}} <b>Karma</b> which {{is affected by the}} decisions and actions the character performs during the game. Positive actions to <b>Karma</b> include freeing captives and helping others, while negative actions towards this include killing good characters and stealing. Actions vary in the level of <b>karma</b> change they cause; thus, pickpocketing produces less negative <b>karma</b> than the killing of a good character. <b>Karma</b> can have tangible effects to the player, beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, in that it can affect the ending the player gets, alter dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) or give off unique reactions from other characters, while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific <b>Karma</b> level. However, the player's relationships with the game's factions are distinct, so any two groups or settlements may view the player in contrasting ways, depending on the player's conduct.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{theory of}} <b>karma</b> proposes that <b>karma</b> {{particles}} are attracted and then {{bound to the}} consciousness of souls {{by a combination of}} four factors pertaining to actions: instrumentality, process, modality and motivation.|$|E

5|$|Bhutan competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, {{which was}} held from 5 to 21 August 2016. The country's {{participation}} in Rio de Janeiro marked its ninth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1984 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two female athletes, <b>Karma</b> in the women's individual archery tournament and Kunzang Lenchu in the women's 10 metre air rifle shooting contest. Both qualified for the Games through wildcard places {{because they did not}} match the required qualification standards. <b>Karma</b> was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony while Lenchu held it at the closing ceremony. <b>Karma</b> was eliminated at the Round of 64 while Lenchu exited the competition after the shooting qualification round.|$|E

5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} <b>karma.</b> Various types of <b>karma</b> are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our <b>karma,</b> and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas Eve, Edgeworth {{is arrested}} {{for the murder}} of {{attorney}} Robert Hammond. He initially refuses Phoenix's help, but ultimately relents. Manfred Von <b>Karma,</b> Edgeworth's mentor, has himself appointed as a special prosecutor. After Phoenix learns that another man, Yanni Yogi, shot Hammond, he discovers that Von <b>Karma</b> provided him with the gun. Years earlier, Edgeworth's father, Gregory, convinced a judge to penalize Von <b>Karma</b> for misconduct, ruining his spotless record. Unable to deal with such a blemish on his legacy, Von <b>Karma</b> murdered Gregory in cold blood, leaving Edgeworth to believe himself responsible. Phoenix explains that Edgeworth motivated him to become an attorney: When a young Phoenix was accused of stealing money (a crime for which Larry was the true culprit), Edgeworth persuaded his teacher not to punish him. Following his father's murder, however, Edgeworth, motivated by a hatred of criminals, decided to become Von Karma's pupil instead. After Von <b>Karma</b> suffers a breakdown in court and confesses to the cover-up, Edgeworth is set free. Nevertheless, he decides to rethink whether or not he should resume his previous duties. Meanwhile, Maya, who had been acting as Phoenix's assistant, announces that she will be returning to her home village to finish her training as a spirit medium.|$|E
5|$|Sthiti (the {{duration}} of the karmic bond) – The karmic bond remains latent and bound to the consciousness up to the time it is activated. Although latent <b>karma</b> {{does not affect the}} soul directly, its existence limits the spiritual growth of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such <b>karma</b> is bound before it matures.|$|E
50|$|Mohanīya <b>karmas</b> {{produce a}} {{delusion}} in a soul i.e. {{the soul is}} not able to distinguish between right and wrong. They are of two subtypes—Darśana-mohanīya (Perception delusion) and cāritra-mohanīya (conduct deluding) <b>karmas.</b>|$|R
25|$|The souls {{on account}} of {{accumulation}} of meritorious <b>karmas</b> reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit <b>karmas</b> are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or hells depending on their <b>karmas.</b> As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.|$|R
25|$|When ghātiyā <b>karmas</b> {{are totally}} destroyed, the soul attains kevala Jnana or omniscience. Liberation is {{guaranteed}} for such souls {{in the same}} lifetime as soon the aghātiyā <b>karmas</b> are exhausted in the due course.|$|R

5|$|To Mahavira, {{the metaphysical}} {{nature of the}} {{universe}} consists of dravya, jiva, and ajiva. The jiva gets attached and bound to samsara (wordly realms of suffering and existence) because of <b>karma</b> (activity). <b>Karma,</b> in Jainism, includes both actions and intent, and it colors (lesya) the soul; its particles stick to the soul and affect how, where, and what the soul is instantaneously reborn into after a being dies.|$|E

5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of <b>karma</b> are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the <b>karma</b> is never fruitless. The latent <b>karma</b> becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted <b>karma</b> bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E
