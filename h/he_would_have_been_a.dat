5|$|In an {{interview}} with Liverpool Football Club, he stated that if he wasn't a footballer <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> physio. On 12 September 2010, he was jailed for four months over a drunken attack on a taxi driver which had taken place on 9 August 2009 in Watford, Hertfordshire. He was tried for racially aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm but a jury acquitted him of that charge, but found him guilty of an alternative charge of assaulting the taxi driver.|$|E
5|$|Hirst's leg injury {{kept him}} out of the England side for the first two Test matches against Australia, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> certain selection had he been fit. He was chosen in the squad for the second match but was left out on fitness grounds. However, Hirst was not particularly successful in the three Tests he played that season, hitting a highest score of 40 not out; as a bowler he never took more than three wickets in an innings. In the series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35.00 and took 6 wickets at 35.33. England won the series 2–0, mainly due to the all-round efforts of Hirst's Yorkshire teammate Stanley Jackson, who headed the batting and bowling averages for the series.|$|E

25|$|In the {{inscription}} that records the quindecimviri sacris faciundis who administered the Secular Games of 17 BC, Censorinus occupies {{the most senior}} position, second only to Marcus Agrippa. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> member of this priestly college (collegium) as early as 31 BC, p. 426–426. and in 17 would have been of rather advanced age.|$|E
25|$|A {{forensic}} {{profile of}} the killer suggested {{that it would be}} a young man, in his mid- to late twenties, single, living either alone or with his mother. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> loner, possibly with a drug problem, and may have been in psychiatric care at some point. He would also have had a history of anti-social behaviour and would be unlikely to have had any intimate relationships. The profile indicated a likelihood he would kill again.|$|E

25|$|Allen {{auditioned for}} the lead role in the 2012 musical film Rock of Ages, but lost the role to Diego Boneta. Although Allen was {{considered}} to be a better singer than anyone else who had tried out for the role up to that point, he had never auditioned for a film before and has said that he did not feel confident in his acting abilities. In an interview with OK Magazine, Allen said he does not feel that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> good fit for role and currently does not have any further plans to pursue acting.|$|E
25|$|Although he was {{an immensely}} capable general and statesman, Cesare had trouble {{maintaining}} his domain without continued Papal patronage. Niccolò Machiavelli cites Cesare's dependence on the good will of the Papacy, {{under the control of}} his father, to be the principal disadvantage of his rule. Machiavelli argued that, had Cesare been able to win the favour of the new Pope, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> very successful ruler. The news of his father's death (1503) arrived when Cesare was planning the conquest of Tuscany. While he was convalescing in Castel Sant'Angelo, his troops controlled the conclave.|$|E
500|$|In Abbo's {{version of}} events, the king {{refused to meet}} the Danes in battle, preferring to die a martyr's death. The {{historian}} Susan Ridyard maintains that Edmund's martyrdom cannot be proved {{and the nature of}} his fate — whether he died fighting or was cruelly murdered in the battle's aftermath — cannot be read from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. She notes that the story that Edmund had an armour-bearer implies that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> warrior king who was prepared to fight the Vikings on the battlefield, but she acknowledges the possibility that later accounts belong to [...] "the realm of hagiographical fantasy".|$|E

[...] Kenny's spokesman later dismissed the proposition that the resignation had implications for his leadership. He cited the public endorsement of Kenny by 20 Dáil deputies {{over the course of the}} weekend. Former Fine Gael leader Michael Noonan said he was surprised at the decision: [...] "I thought that George Lee was fitting in well", adding that he believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> cabinet member in a Fine Gael-led government.|$|E

He is also a regular poker player, {{appearing}} twice on Celebrity Poker Showdown and competing at other events, finishing a few places short of the bubble in the main event of the 2010 World Series of Poker. Politically, Azaria has made contributions that support the Democratic Party. He enjoys the music of Elvis Costello, and has stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> therapist if he were not an actor. He considers The Godfather Trilogy to be what inspired him to become an actor, and counts Peter Sellers and Walt Frazier as his heroes. Azaria co-founded the educational support charity, [...] "Determined to Succeed".|$|E
500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian– give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I think <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E

500|$|The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183runs {{and take}} 142wickets; {{he was only}} the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000runs and take 100wickets in an English season {{as part of a}} touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232runs at an average of 38.66. [...] Wisden said of Trumble's batting that season, [...] " [...] played so {{consistently}} well as {{to make it clear that}} if he had not been a bowler <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> great batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he [...] "bowled quite as well as in 1896" [...] and [...] " [...] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage...he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5wickets for 60runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).|$|E
500|$|Following the members' poll, Yorkshire sent a {{telegram}} to Sutcliffe in South Africa, {{asking him to}} withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy. Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it. When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December, they appointed William Worsley, who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments. In the words of Wisden, [...] "Happily the trouble was eventually settled {{to the satisfaction of}} all concerned. Sutcliffe declined the honour and, an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley, that gentleman stepped into the breach." [...] Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for [...] "your loyalty to the club". The Yorkshire Post also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself, noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable, it was [...] "carried to unreasonable lengths". Commenting on the affair, The Times expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game, but that there was nothing in principle to prevent a professional from performing the role. Of Sutcliffe, it said, [...] "One would have liked to see him lead the side, and his general popularity, combined with his skill as a batsman, makes it probable that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> success. However, half the value of a captain is gone if, before he takes up his duties, people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position, and Sutcliffe has been well-advised to recognise this fact." [...] The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose a skipper from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role; it added that Rhodes might have found it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders.|$|E
2500|$|In The Winning Way then Australian coach Bob Dwyer wrote, [...] "I am {{not sure}} whether he [...] {{would have made the}} tour if Brendan Moon and the others had not pulled out, but even if he had <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{borderline}} choice and might have remained on the fringe of the team for much of the tour. Instead, he occupied centre-stage and performed brilliantly." ...|$|E
