40|$|Drug <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes</b> such as {{abacavir}} hypersensitivity and {{the severe}} cutaneous adverse drug reactions {{have been associated}} with significant short- and long-term morbidity and mortality.

The case of the association of HLA-B* 57 : 01 and abacavir hypersensitivity has created a translational roadmap for how this knowledge can be used in the clinic to prevent severe reactions. Although many hurdles exist to the widespread translation of such HLA screening approaches, our understanding of how drugs interact with the major histocompatibility complex has contributed to the discovery of new models that have provided considerable insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions and other T-cell–mediated drug <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Future translation of this knowledge will facilitate the development of preclinical toxicity screening to significantly improve efficacy and safety of drug development and design...|$|R
40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{represent a}} major health problem. They are ranked as the {{fourth most common}} cause of death after heart disease, cancer, and stroke and claim more than 100, 000 lives in the United States each year. This is of particular concern in the setting of HIV, in which potent-and often toxic-antiretroviral therapy remains the best option {{for the vast majority of}} people living with the virus. Like the pathogenesis and etiology of HIV, the mechanisms by which ADRs occur are complex and not entirely understood. One cluster of side effects in particular, <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes,</b> is, perhaps, one of the most perplexing and unique of them all. Rightly, these reactions have become a common fear among clinicians, despite their occurence in only a small percentage of HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying abacavir <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is related}} to the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in immunological tolerance and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific cytotoxic T cells, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

40|$|Understanding and {{preventing}} HLA-associated drug reactions Immunologically-mediated adverse drug reactions (IM-ADRs) contribute disproportionately to drug- related {{morbidity and mortality}} and the cost and uncertainty of drug development. T-cell mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions are a subset of IM-ADEs that are severe and life-threatening, causing severe skin disease such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and organ failure. Severe T-cell mediated drug <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes</b> have recently been associated with specific class I and/or II HLA alleles {{which has led to}} translational pathways for screening and prevention as well as great insight into their immunopathogenesis. The best example is the current widespread use of the HLA class I allele HLA- B* 57 : 01 as a screening test prior to abacavir prescription in routine HIV clinical practice. We have made significant progress in defining the mechanistic basis of the predisposition of HLA-B* 57 : 01 carriers to abacavir hypersensitivity which now has created a translational roadmap to define further the immunopathogenetic mechanisms of other severe HLA-associated T-cell mediated drug <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Notably, this recent work based on the abacavir model suggests that drugs rapidly and non-covalently bind to an HLA allele and alter the repertoire of self-peptides binding to the allele, creating a vigorous CD 8 + T cell response.

HLA-B* 57 : 01 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity exemplifies a successful translational roadmap from pharmacogenomic discovery through to widespread clinical implementation.

We report a 69 old female patient who was using multiple medications and presented with a two month history of recurrent blisters, pustules and crusts. The patient was evaluated by a dermatologist, and biopsies for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination, as well as for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed. The H&E examination revealed a subepidermal blister with numerous luminal eosinophils, as well as a dermal superficial and deep, perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils. The DIF revealed a linear positive staining on the subepidermal interior of the blister with IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, Complement/C 4, lambda light chains, fibrinogen, and albumin; staining was noted in the basement membrane zone, and also focally present around dermal blood vessels and eccrine glands. The dermal staining colocalized with anti-p 0071 (Plakophilin 4). We also observed overexpression of thrombomodulin in adjacent epidermal keratinocytes, {{as well as in the}} upper dermal blood vessels; its presence may be linked to mitigation of inflammation.

40|$|Genes of {{the human}} {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) system encode cell-surface proteins involved in regulation of immune responses, and the way drugs interact with the HLA peptide binding groove {{is important in the}} immunopathogenesis of T-cell mediated drug <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Nevirapine (NVP), is an HIV- 1 antiretroviral with treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) associated with multiple class I and II HLA alleles. Here we utilize a novel analytical approach to explore these multi-allelic associations by systematically examining HLA molecules for similarities in peptide binding specificities and binding pocket structure. We demonstrate that primary predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR, seen across ancestral groups, can be attributed to a cluster of HLA-C alleles sharing a common binding groove F pocket with HLA-C* 04 : 01. An independent association with a group of class II alleles which share the HLA-DRB 1 -P 4 pocket is also observed. In contrast, NVP HSR protection is afforded by a cluster of HLA-B alleles defined by a characteristic peptide binding groove B pocket. The results suggest drug-specific interactions within the antigen binding cleft can be shared across HLA molecules with similar binding pockets. We thereby provide an explanation for multiple HLA associations with cutaneous NVP HSR and advance insight into its pathogenic mechanisms...|$|R

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an alert concerning abacavir and abacavir-containing medications on July 24, 2008, and the FDA-approved drug label for abacavir recommends pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele {{and the use of}} alternative therapy in subjects with this allele.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulse wave {{velocity}} (PWV), {{an index of}} arterial wall stiffness, is modulated by blood pressure (BP). Whether heart rate (HR) is also a modulator of PWV is controversial. Recent research involving mainly patients with high aortic PWV have found either no change or {{a positive correlation between}} the two. Given that PWV is increasingly being measured in cardiovascular studies, the relationship between HR and PWV should be known in patients with preserved arterial wall elasticity. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the importance of HR as a determinant of the variability in PWV in patients with a low degree of atherosclerosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (five female, nine male; aged 68 +/- 8 years) were evaluated post pacemaker implantation due to sick sinus or carotid <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Carotid-femoral PWV was measured at rest and during atrial pacing at 80, 90 and 100 bpm (paced HR). Arterial femoral blood flow (AFBF) was measured by echodoppler. RESULTS: PWV increased from 6. 2 +/- 1. 5 m/s (mean +/- SD) during resting sinus rhythm (HR 62 +/- 8 bpm; mean +/- SD) to 6. 8 +/- 1. 0, 7. 0 +/- 0. 9, and 7. 6 +/- 1. 1 m/s at pacing rates of 80, 90 and 100 bpm, respectively (P < 0. 0001). Systolic (SBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) remained constant at all HR levels, whereas AFBF increased in a linear fashion. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that even in patients with a low degree of atherosclerosis, HR is a potential modulator of carotid-femoral PWV...|$|R

Methods: Adverse event reports contained in databases maintained by the Project on Medical Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (Med-RADAR), product labels, safety advisories disseminated by pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were reviewed.
