40|$|In this paper, an electromechanical, biaxial-type {{concentrated}} solar {{tracking system}} {{was designed for}} solar-thermal applications. In our tracking system, the sunlight was concentrated by the microstructure of Fresnel lens to the <b>heating</b> <b>head</b> of the Stirling engine and two solar cells were installed to provide the power for tracking system operation. In order to obtain the maximum sun power, the tracking system traces the sun with the altitude-azimuth biaxial tracing method and accurately maintains the sun’s radiation perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} <b>heating</b> <b>head.</b> The results indicated that the position of <b>heating</b> <b>head</b> is an important factor for power collection. If the sunlight can be concentrated to completely cover the <b>heating</b> <b>head</b> with small heat loss, we can obtain the maximum temperature of the <b>heating</b> <b>head</b> of the Stirling engine. Therefore, the temperature of <b>heating</b> <b>head</b> can be higher than 1000 °C in our experiment on a sunny day. Moreover, the results also revealed that the temperature decrease of the <b>heating</b> <b>head</b> is less than the power decrease of solar irradiation because of the latent heat of copper and the small heat loss from the <b>heating</b> <b>head...</b>|$|E

40|$|Automated heated {{placement}} of consolidated fiber reinforced polymer ribbon/tape is a rapid, cost effective technique for net shape fabrication of high performance composites. Several research {{efforts in the}} United States are developing the <b>heated</b> <b>head</b> robotic hardware and associated software needed to bring this technology into widespread use for building aircraft parts. These efforts emphasize the use of pre-consolidated thermoplastic ribbon or tape which is thermally welded on-the-fly. The approach provides in-situ consolidation and obviates the need for autoclave processing and massive debulking, thereby reducing costs. Addressed in this paper are some key issues being pursued at NASA Langley related to this technology. These include: (a) preparation of high quality intermediate materials forms such as thermoplastic powders, powder-coated towpreg and consolidated ribbon/tape and (b) achievement of precise control of the following: robot head positioning on the tool; material placement; heat delivery to the lay-down zone; and cut/add, start/stop capability. <b>Heated</b> <b>head</b> development has dealt {{with the use of}} hot gases alone and in combination with focused infrared radiation as heat sources...|$|R

40|$|LaRC(TM) -PETI- 5 is a PhenylEthynyl-Terminated Imide resin {{developed}} at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) during the 1990 s. It offers {{a combination of}} attractive composite and adhesive properties. IM 7 /LaRC(TM) -PETI- 5 composites exhibit thermal and thermo-oxidative stability typical of polyimides, superior chemical resistance and processability, excellent mechanical properties, toughness and damage tolerance. It was selected for study in the High Speed Research program aimed at developing technologies for a future supersonic aircraft, the High Speed Civil Transport, with a projected life span of 60 000 h at a cruise speed up to Mach 2. 4. Robust autoclave processing cycles for LaRC(TM) -PETI- 5 composites have been thoroughly designed and demonstrated, which involved hand lay-up of solvent-ladened 'wet' prepregs. However, this type of processing is not only costly but also environmentally unfriendly. Volatile management and shrinkage could become serious problems in the fabrication of large complex airframe structural subcomponents. Robotic tow placement technology utilizing 'dry' material forms represents a new fabrication process which overcomes these deficiencies. This work evaluates and compares mechanical properties of composites fabricated by <b>heated</b> <b>head</b> automated tow placement (dry process) with those obtained by hand lay-up/autoclave fabrication (wet process). Thermal and rheological properties of the robotically as-placed uncured composites were measured. A post-cure cycle was designed due to the requirement of the PETI- 5 resin for a 370 C/ 1 h hold to reach full cure, conditions which cannot be duplicated during <b>heated</b> <b>head</b> robotic placement. Mechanical properties such as 0 degree flexural strength and modulus, open hole tensile and compressive strength and moduli, reduced section compression dogbone compressive strength, and modified zippora-medium small (MZ-MS) tensile and compressive properties were obtained on the post-cured panels. These properties compared favourably with those obtained from the wet process...|$|R
