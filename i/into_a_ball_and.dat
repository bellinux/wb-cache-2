5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E

25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
500|$|Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. The {{gameplay}} {{centers around}} Sonic's {{ability to run}} at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards {{in the form of}} robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. [...] Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> rotates, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground.|$|E
500|$|While making Metroid Prime Hunters, a Metroid first-person shooter {{video game}} for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo {{producer}} Kensuke Tanabe {{came up with the}} idea to make a pinball game based on the Metroid series as Fuse Games finished Mario Pinball Land, another pinball simulator based on a Nintendo property. Tanabe felt like the Metroid universe fit into such a setting due to series protagonist Samus being able to morph <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> Fuse agreed that the license was [...] "a great fit for pinball", accepting to work on the game. Fuse Games then received some assets from Metroid Prime developers Retro Studios, and collaborated with the Hunters team at Nintendo Software Technology to elaborate on specific aspects of Metroid Prime Pinball, such as Samus's wall climbing and shooting abilities. Head of development Adrian Barritt said that in Metroid Prime Pinball the team tried to fix criticisms raised about the difficulty of Mario Pinball Land, creating a [...] "more beginner friendly" [...] game.|$|E

2500|$|Pangolins {{have also}} been {{reported}} to roll away from danger by self-powered methods. Witnessed by a lion researcher [...] in the Serengeti in Africa, a group of lions surrounded a pangolin, but could not get purchase on it when it rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> so the lions sat around it waiting and dozing. Surrounded by lions, it would unroll itself slightly and give itself a push to roll some distance, until by doing this multiple times it could get {{far enough away from}} the lions to be safe. Moving like this would allow a pangolin to cover distance while still remaining in a protective armoured ball.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa, and her {{relationship}} with Clarke, have been well received by critics and fans. Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, stated, [...] "In a show packed with morally compromised characters, Lexa stood out; she led a tribe of Earth inhabitants named Grounders {{with a combination of}} deftness, intelligence and unhesitating ferocity." [...] Ryan felt Lexa [...] "does not suffer fools gladly, yet Debnam-Carey made Lexa's vulnerability and her attraction to Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor) not just believable, but engrossing." [...] Linda Ge of TheWrap referred to her as a fan-favorite, while Eric Goldman of IGN called her [...] "a standout, highly popular character". The staff for SheWired stated that she [...] "had the best character introduction ever and never stopped being great" [...] and [...] "has proven to be endlessly engaging, even when she's making choices that make us want to crawl <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> cry." [...] Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com characterized Lexa as a [...] "mysterious queer character" [...] that has caught the audience's attention, and complimented the [...] "chemistry and increasing bond between Lexa and Clarke," [...] adding, [...] "Both are smart, and somehow manage to see the bigger picture. [...] Here are two young women, leading their people to salvation or at least as close to salvation as they can get." [...] The A.V. Clubs Kyle Fowle reasoned that Lexa's resolve while facing the reality of protecting the Sky People, the 13th clan, while risking an uprising from the other clans and her own people [...] "is exactly what makes her one of the better characters on TV." [...] Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that she was [...] "one of the best and, yes, most divisive characters in recent TV history." ...|$|E

50|$|Very {{similar in}} habit to Anastatica, but {{practically}} unrelated, are the spore-bearing Selaginella lepidophylla (a lycopod) and earthstar mushroom family (Geastraceae). All of these curl <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> when dry <b>and</b> uncurl when moistened.|$|R
25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy predators use against schooling fish is first to scare them <b>into</b> forming <b>a</b> bait <b>ball.</b> Strategies {{such as those}} outlined {{in the previous section}} can work to a degree against freely streaming fish schools, but work much better if the fish school is first compacted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bait <b>ball.</b> It is difficult for predators working individually to scare <b>a</b> fish school <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bait <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> they usually work together.|$|R

It emerges in March or early April.|$|R
50|$|The main {{ingredients}} {{used to make}} Mangalore Bajji include maida, curd, gram flour, rice flour, chopped onion, coriander leaves, coconut, jeera, green chillies, curry leaves, and salt.

50|$|Pişmaniye (Turkish) or floss halva is a {{traditional}} sweet, prepared in Kocaeli, Turkey, made by flossing thin strands of halva <b>into</b> <b>a</b> light confection.

The result is a halva with a light consistency, similar to cotton candy. Floss halva {{can be found in}} regular and pistachio flavors, and there are brands with halal or kosher certifications.|$|R
