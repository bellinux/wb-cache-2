5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

500|$|... "My Boxer" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Danish singer and songwriter Oh Land. It was included on her third studio album, Wish Bone (2013), and released digitally on 10 July 2013 by Tusk or Tooth Records and A:larm Music. The track was written by Nanna Øland Fabricius and Dan Carey; Carey also served as the sole producer. An electropop recording with a rhythmic beat, its lyrics were inspired by an event where Oh Land walked a blind lady across the street. She compared the experience to having a boxer living <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following the VMAs, {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} to analyse {{the meaning of}} the dress with suggestions by BBC News ranging from anti-fashion, to feminism, aging and decay, and society's attitude towards meat. Chef Fergus Henderson explained this meat attitude as [...] "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly wrapped in plastic from a supermarket." [...] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but someone should whisper <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it." [...] The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal. Enough animals die for food and they should not be killed for stunts like this." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My Boxer" [...] is an electropop {{song with}} an [...] "aggressive and rhythmic" [...] sound {{that has a}} {{duration}} of two minutes and 50 seconds. It {{was one of the}} few tracks not produced by musician Dave Sitek and was instead handled by Carey who used [...] "bobs and weaves with jabbing percussion, glitchy electronics, and a dangerously hummable melody" [...] in its production. Regarding its genre, Jim Carroll of The Irish Times stated that it can be placed under [...] "smart premier league pop" [...] and also said it is cheerful. AllMusic's James Christopher Monger described [...] "My Boxer" [...] as a [...] "forced dancefloor rave" [...] and compared it to the works of American singer Santigold. Similarly, Michael Jose Gonzalez from Gaffa felt the singer took influence from Robyn, while The Arguss Rosie Clarke found its lyrics resembled Gwen Stefani's catalogue. The singer asks herself within the lyrics on various occasions, [...] "Is that weird?", responding to her questions concerning whether or not a boxer living <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> is strange. Her pondering is accompanied by a [...] "pulsating beat" [...] that resembles a live boxer. At one point during the song, Oh Land speaks into a megaphone and quizzes her lover: [...] "Does baby like weird?".|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{finds himself}} too weak from the poison's effects to pilot the TARDIS to rescue his companions; River is {{inspired}} by the Doctor's sympathy, and finds herself guided by the TARDIS itself to pilot the ship, and rescues Amy and Rory in time. On returning to the café, the trio finds the Doctor near death; he asks River to find [...] "River Song" [...] {{and give her a}} message, then whispers something <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> before he passes away. River, who at this point still only knows herself as Melody Pond, asks Amy who River Song is; Amy uses the Teselecta to show River her form stored in the robot's database of who she is to become. With this, River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to bring the Doctor back to life, and passes out. The Doctor, Amy, and Rory take her to a hospital in the far future, leaving the TARDIS-shaped diary as a gift by her bedside, and depart. Later, River is shown becoming an archaeologist so she can find the Doctor herself. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor has discovered the date of his death from the records aboard the Teselecta, but does not reveal this knowledge to Amy or Rory.|$|E

500|$|In his {{decade in}} charge of the National, Olivier acted in {{thirteen}} plays and directed eight. Several of the roles he played were minor characters, including a crazed butler in Feydeau's A Flea <b>in</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Ear</b> and a pompous solicitor in Maugham's Home and Beauty; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in Farquhar's 1706 comedy The Recruiting Officer was a larger role but not the leading one. Apart from his Astrov in the Uncle Vanya, familiar from Chichester, his first leading role for the National was Othello, directed by Dexter in 1964. The production was a box-office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons. His performance divided opinion. Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly; Franco Zeffirelli called it [...] "an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries." [...] Dissenting voices included The Sunday Telegraph, which called it [...] "the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable... near the frontiers of self-parody"; the director Jonathan Miller thought it [...] "a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person". The burden of playing this demanding part {{at the same time as}} managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier. To add to his load, he felt obliged to take over as Solness in The Master Builder when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964. For the first time Olivier began to suffer from stage fright, which plagued him for several years. The National Theatre production of Othello was released as a film in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.|$|E
