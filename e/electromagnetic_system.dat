In their first report (1862) they laid the ground rules for their work – the metric system was to be used, measures of electrical energy must have the same units as measures of mechanical energy and two sets of electromagnetic units {{would have to be}} derived – an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>system</b> and an electrostatic system. In the second report (1863) they introduced the concept of a coherent system of units whereby units of length, mass and time were identified as [...] "fundamental units" [...] (now known as base units). All other units of measure could be derived (hence derived units) from these base units. The metre, gram and second were chosen as base units.|$|E

In order to explain the negative result of the Michelson–Morley experiment, he (1892b) introduced the additional hypothesis that also intermolecular forces are affected in a similar way and introduced length contraction in his theory (without proof as he admitted). The same hypothesis was already made by George FitzGerald in 1889 based on Heaviside's work. While length contraction was a real physical effect for Lorentz, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} for {{the electromagnetic}} field in an anisotropic media {{are written in}} a form containing only the transverse field components relative to a half plane boundary. The operator corresponding to this formulation is the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>system’s</b> matrix. A constructive proof {{of the existence of}} directional wave-field decomposition with respect to the normal of the boundary is presented. In the process of defining the wave-field decomposition (wave-splitting), the resolvent set of the time-Laplace representation of the system’s matrix is analyzed. This set is shown to contain a strip around the imaginary axis. We construct a splitting matrix as a Dunford-Taylor type integral over the resolvent of the unbounded operator defined by the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>system’s</b> matrix. The splitting matrix commutes with the system’s matrix and the decomposition is obtained via a generalized eigenvalue-eigenvector procedure. The decomposition is expressed in terms of components of the splitting matrix. The constructive solution to the question on the existence of a decomposition also generates an impedance mapping solution to an algebraic Riccati operator equation. This solution is the electromagnetic generalization in an anisotropic media of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
