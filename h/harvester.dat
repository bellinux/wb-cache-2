5|$|HMS <b>Harvester</b> was an H-class {{destroyer}} originally {{ordered by}} the Brazilian Navy with the name Jurua in the late 1930s, but bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939. Almost immediately after being commissioned, in May 1940, the ship began evacuating Allied troops from Dunkirk and other locations in France. Afterwards she {{was assigned to the}} Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties. <b>Harvester</b> and another destroyer sank a German submarine in October. She was briefly assigned to Force H in May 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force in June 1941 for escort duties in the North Atlantic. The ship was returned to the Western Approaches Command in October 1941 and was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1942. <b>Harvester</b> was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943 by a German submarine after having rammed and sunk another submarine the previous day while escorting Convoy HX 228.|$|E

Shortly after arriving Jetfire becomes mortally wounded by Starscream and sacrifices himself to give Optimus power to defeat The Fallen. Ironhide destroys the security around the Sun <b>Harvester,</b> and Optimus defeats Megatron. With the security down, Optimus battles The Fallen, destroying both him and the Sun <b>Harvester.</b> Megatron and Starscream get sucked into a space bridge, which transports them to The Fallen's throne room. At {{the end of the}} game, the Autobots rebuild the destroyed pyramid, and Megatron and Starscream observe the creation of a massive Decepticon army now under their control.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International <b>Harvester</b> Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International <b>Harvester,</b> but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEnergy {{harvesting}} {{has received}} a lot of attention in the recent past. At present a single device does not harvested energy enough to power up an electronic sensors. In order to increase the power output multiple identical <b>harvesters</b> are used. When multiple <b>harvesters</b> are used, they bring in non-uniformity in their physical parameters due to variability during manufacturing or even during deployment. Therefore, ‘n’ numbers of <b>harvesters</b> do not necessary produce ‘n’ times the harvested power of a single device. The variability in parameters is less enough to be coined as mistuning. In this paper, an analysis of multiple energy <b>harvesters</b> is studied. The <b>harvesters</b> are assumed to show mistuning. The study is further extended to understand the effect of mechanical coupling between the <b>harvesters.</b> For simplification, pendulums are considered as the <b>harvesters,</b> with magnetic tip masses for the electromagnetic energy harvesting. Mistuning is achieved by varying the length of the pendulums. A generalized mathematical model for n coupled <b>harvesters</b> with mistuning is developed. Simulations are performed with the number of <b>harvesters</b> varying from 2 to 6 with ± 1 % non-repetitive mistuning in the lengths of the <b>harvesters,</b> and a comparison of the power harvested between mechanically coupled and uncoupled <b>harvesters</b> is presented...|$|R

5|$|After commissioning, Handy and Hearty were renamed <b>Harvester</b> and Hesperus, respectively, {{to avoid}} {{confusion}} with Hardy. The Havant-class destroyers initially formed the 9th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to Western Approaches Command for anti-submarine patrols and escort duty.

She was assigned to the 14th Escort Group upon her arrival at St. John's on 1 July. The ship was transferred back to the Western Approaches Command three months later and assigned to the 9th Escort Group. <b>Harvester</b> was converted to an escort destroyer during a lengthy refit at Dundee, Scotland, from 30 January 1942 to 16 April.

5|$|The ship {{joined the}} Dunkirk {{evacuation}} on 29 May and returned 272 men to Dover during the day. However, {{the situation at}} Dunkirk soon became too dangerous to risk the larger and more modern destroyers, so <b>Harvester</b> {{made no attempt to}} evacuate any troops during daylight hours on 30 May. This decision was rescinded during the day on 30 May and the ship sailed for Dunkirk on the night of 30/31 May. En route she was narrowly missed by two torpedoes, but she rescued 1341 men in two trips on 31 May and an additional 576 on 1 June. <b>Harvester</b> was lightly damaged by strafing German aircraft that same day and required repairs that were made at Chatham. On 9 June the ship was ordered to Le Havre, France, to evacuate British troops, but none were to be found. She loaded 78 men at Saint-Valery-en-Caux on 11 June. Later in the month she escorted ships evacuating refugees and troops from Saint-Nazaire and St. Jean de Luz (Operation Ariel).|$|E

5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red <b>harvester</b> ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E

Desperate to get her sister to leave, Elsa creates a giant snow creature, and it throws Anna and her friends away from the palace. Upon noticing Anna's hair is turning white, Kristoff takes her back to his adoptive family of trolls. Pabbie tells Anna that her heart has been frozen by her sister's magic and only an act of true love can save her from freezing completely. Kristoff, believing that a romantic kiss from Hans will heal her, takes Anna back to the kingdom.|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{integration}} of energy harvesting and storage devices {{is considered to}} be one of the most important energy-related technologies due to the possibility of replacing batteries or at least extending the lifetime of a battery. This review aims to describe current progress in the various types of energy <b>harvesters,</b> hybrid energy <b>harvesters,</b> including multi-type energy <b>harvesters</b> with coupling of multiple energy sources, and hybridization of energy <b>harvesters</b> and energy storage devices for self-powered electronics.
