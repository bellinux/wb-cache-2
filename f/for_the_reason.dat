5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

25|$|When using {{fuel and}} oxygen tanks {{they should be}} {{fastened}} securely upright to a wall or a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that the oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the compressed oxygen, capable of even breaking through a brick wall.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to Sergius {{was used}} as a pretext to close many churches and sending clergy to exile. The last officially {{functioning}} anti-Sergiite church in Moscow was closed in 1933 and in Leningrad in 1936. After these churches were closed, they were usually demolished or turned to secular use (rather than being given to Sergii's jurisdiction as though they were really being closed simply <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> of their opposition to Sergii). This campaign greatly diminished the number of functioning churches in the country.|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} {{hypotheses}} proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why electric signals were modified during the fishes' development stages. Firstly, as stated above, the fishes' electroreceptors are usually tuned {{to a specific}} range of frequencies. Therefore, to make effective communication, {{it is necessary for}} the electric fishes to narrow the broad frequency spectrum of the larval EOD. Secondly, it is known that the electroreceptors of catfish, gymnotiforms, and most pre-teleost fish are tuned to lower frequencies. Therefore, keeping the low frequency of larval EOD will increase the risk of being detected by predators.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{due to a}} {{continuing}} fall in mail volumes the government commissioned an independent review of the postal services sector by Richard Hooper CBE, the former deputy chairman of Ofcom. The recommendations in the Hooper Review led Business Secretary Lord Mandelson to seek to part privatise the company by selling a minority stake to a commercial partner. However, despite legislation for the sale passing the House of Lords, it was abandoned in the House of Commons after strong opposition from backbench Labour MPs. The government later cited the difficult economic conditions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> behind the retreat.|$|E
25|$|Chester County native Jesse W. Fell asked Abraham Lincoln for an autobiographical {{narrative}} in 1858. Lincoln initially refused, but eventually wrote a 606-word account, explaining that “there {{is not much}} of it, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> I suppose, {{that there is not}} much of me.” Fell sent this sketch to his friend Joseph Lewis in West Chester. Lewis embellished on the short account and published the biography in the Chester County Times on February 11, 1860. The first published biography of Lincoln, it was circulated in newspapers across the U.S. and was considered crucial in securing the Republican nomination by Lincoln himself. The building that it was written in is today known as the Lincoln Building.|$|E

When Ramsey refused the supervisor’s request, she was fired from her job.

25|$|The {{characters}} of the Japanese visual novel Popotan were designed by Akio Watanabe under the alias Poyoyon♡Rock, and {{the characters in the}} anime adaptation were designed by Rondo Mizukami and based on Akio Watanabe's original concepts for the visual novel. The series takes place on a fictional Earth in which exist supernatural beings with powers and follows three such supernatural sisters as they travel through time in a mansion, searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for their journey. Though many of the characters in the visual novel share personality traits and character relations with their anime counterparts, there are numerous differences between the two media. Both the visual novel and anime have mutually exclusive characters in addition to the changes in character roles.|$|E
25|$|As a consent-based process, {{ensuring}} {{rights under}} the ICCPR internationally is fraught with difficulty. The mechanism relies on member states to implement standards by way of incorporation of ICCPR principles into municipal law or implementation through conduct. Where implementing ICCPR principles into domestic law would conflict existing policy or law, a state may ignore such a principle. New Zealand for example, has been considered slow in incorporating ICCPR principles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> of Parliamentary Supremacy; it may not restrict future Parliaments by strictly adopting all principles into law. A further issue is in delay between making reports and consideration by the HRC. There have been many attempts for this reason, to reform the treaty body system and make systems more effective, coherent and coordinated.|$|E
