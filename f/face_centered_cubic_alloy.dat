40|$|The {{relationship}} of hydrogen solubility and the hydrogen embrittlement of high strength, high performance <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>alloys</b> to the stacking fault {{energy of the}} alloys was investigated. The stacking fault energy is inversely related to {{the distance between the}} two partial dislocations which are formed by the dissociation of a perfect dislocation. The two partial dislocations define a stacking fault in the crystal which offers a region for hydrogen segregation. The distance between the partial dislocations is measured by weak beam, dark field transmission electron microscopy. The stacking fault energy is calculated. Pure copper, pure nickel and copper-nickel single crystals are used to determine the stacking fault energy...|$|R

The general theory {{is used to calculate}} long range order parameters, short range order parameters, energy, and phase diagrams for a <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> binary <b>alloy.</b> The theoretical results are compared to the experimental determination of the copper-gold system, Values for the two adjustable parameters are obtained. An explanation for the behavior of magnetic alloys is developed, Curie temperatures and magnetic moments of the first transition series elements and their alloys in both the ordered and disordered states are predicted. Experimental agreement is excellent in most cases. It is predicted that the state of order can effect the magnetic properties of an alloy to a considerable extent in alloys such as Ni 3 Mn. The values of the adjustable parameter used to fix the level of the Curie temperature, and the adjustable parameter that expresses the effect of ordering on the Curie temperature are obtained. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of ultrafine bimetallic CoxRh 1 −x nanoparticles synthesized in mild conditions by codecomposition of organometallic precursors {{in the presence}} of a polymer or a ligand has been studied using high-resolution electron microscopy and wide-angle x-ray scattering techniques. While pure rhodium particles exhibit the main structural features of a <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> (fcc), <b>alloying</b> with cobalt induces a progressive loss of periodicities, leading in high-cobalt-content particles to a polytetrahedral structure close to the one already encountered in pure-cobalt particles. When increasing the synthesis temperature, the polytetrahedral structure remains remarkably stable, while particles with higher rhodium content clearly evolve towards perfect fcc. Increasing the size of the particles up to 5 – 6 nm stabilizes the structural phases encountered in the phase diagram of the bulk alloy. Different element-sensitive techniques, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) and energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy, have also been implemented in order to get chemical information. Evidence is given for a cobalt surface segregation in these bimetallic particles, highly favorable for magnetic-moment enhancement...|$|R

Since {{the information on the}} atomic interactions is incorporated in the energetics of alloys it is possible with a suitable model, Bethe-Peierls-Weiss model is used in the present work, to invert the problem, i. e. to obtain information on the short-range correlation from the total energy of a random system.

40|$|Quantum {{critical}} {{behavior has}} been associated {{with some of the most}} exotic emergent states of matter including high-temperature superconductivity. Much of the research into quantum critical point (QCP) physics has been hampered by the lack of model systems simple enough to be analyzed by theory. Here, we show that the concentrated solid solution fcc alloys, including the so-called high-entropy alloys, are ideal model systems to study the effects of chemical disorder on emergent properties near a quantum critical region. The <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> (fcc) <b>alloy</b> NiCoCrx with x near 1 is found to be close to the Cr concentration where the ferromagnetic transition temperature, Tc, goes to 0. Near this composition these alloys exhibit a resistivity linear in temperature to 2 K, a linear magnetoresistance, an excess -TlnT contribution to the low temperature heat capacity and excess low temperature entropy. All of the low temperature electrical, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the alloys with compositions near x near 1 are not typical of a Fermi liquid and suggest strong magnetic fluctuations associated with a quantum critical region. The limit of extreme chemical disorder in these simple fcc materials thus provides a novel and unique platform to study quantum critical behavior in a highly tunable system...|$|R
50|$|Most {{polycrystalline}} {{metals and}} alloys usually deform via shear caused by dislocations, twins, and / or shear bands. This leads to pronounced plastic anisotropy at the grain scale and to preferred grain orientation distributions, i.e. crystallographic textures. Cold rolling textures of most <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> metals and <b>alloys</b> for instance range between two types, i.e. the brass-type texture and the copper-type texture. The stacking fault energy {{plays an important role}} for the prevailing mechanisms of plastic deformation and the resultant textures. For aluminum and other fcc materials with high SFE, dislocation glide is the main mechanism during cold rolling and the {112}<111> (copper) and {123}<634> (S) texture components (copper-type textures) are developed. In contrast, in Cu-30 wt.% Zn (alpha-brass) and related {{metals and alloys}} with low SFE, mechanical twinning and shear banding occur together with dislocation glide as main deformation carriers, particularly at large plastic deformations. The resulting rolling textures are characterized by the {011}<211> (brass) and {01 1}<100> (Goss) texture components (brass-type texture). In either case non-crystallographic shear banding plays an essential role for the specific type of deformation texture evolved.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA new {{extension}} of the self-consistent mean field (SCMF) theory is developed to describe diffusion in dilute alloys, special attention being paid {{to the problem of}} self-diffusion in presence of solute atoms. We start from a microscopic model of the atom-vacancy exchange frequency including nearest neighbour interactions and derive kinetic equations from a Master equation. The non-equilibrium distribution function is expressed trough time dependent effective interactions. Their range of interaction is controlling the level of description of the paths of a vacancy after a first exchange. In contrast to the previous diffusion models devoted to concentrated alloys, the present formulation makes appear into the final result several exchange frequencies associated to a given atom depending on the chemical species of the atoms nearby. A first approximation restricted to nearest neighbour effective interactions yields analytical expressions of the transport coefficients of a <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> dilute binary <b>alloy.</b> The phenomenological coefficients are equivalent to the ones obtained using the five frequency model within the first shell approximation. A new expression of the self-diffusion coefficient is proposed and compared to Monte carlo (MC) simulations using the same atomic diffusion model. The SCMF theory reproduces the main tendencies of the MC simulations, in particular within the random alloy region where the recent five-frequency model was mistaken. The limitations and future improvements of the SCMF approach are easily related to the range of the effective interactions considered...|$|R
40|$|Bilbiography: p. 141 - 148. This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to find the}} optimum hydraulic fluids and materials for combating cavitation erosion in hydraulic mining machinery operating,on 5 : 95 oil-in-water emulsions, Controlled cavitation was generated in the laboratory in a vibratory cavitation apparatus employing the stationery specimen system. The influence of separation distance between the drill tip and specimen and of varying medium temperature on cavitation erosion were also investigated but were of secondary importance to the studies on materials and emulsions, The evaluation {{of the influence of}} a number of commercial metal cutting coolants and specific hydraulic emulsions oncavitation erosion,showed that those emulsions with a high mineral oil content suppress erosion the most, This phenomenon is considered to be either the result of a reduction in nucleation of highly damaging surface cavities due to the elimination of surface nuclei by an oil film, or to damping of cavity collapse due to the high dissolved gas content of oil-in-water emulsions, A large number of commercial grade alloys and polymers have been investigated, The alloys ranged from single phase, <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> nickel <b>alloys</b> to complex, multi-phase, cobalt based alloys while the polymeric materials were all linear and crystalline. The modes of erosion and mechanisms of erosion resistance were studied in detail by optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The fractographic studies on the alloys revealed, in particular, the role played by second phase particles and other surface features such as protruding grain boundaries and surface steps created by dislocation movement, twinning and phase transformations, Furthermore, X-ray diffractometry coupled with theoretical considerations and the findings of previous investigations indicated the fundamental importance of phase transitions in contributing towards the erosion resistance of alloys, Cobalt based Stellite alloys, nickel based cemented carbides and the intermetallic alloy NiTi have exceptionally high erosion resistance, The Stellites have a high yield stress and also undergo an awe phase transition which results in a high work hardening rate and high strain to fracture, NiTi similarly undergoes a phase transformation which allows absorption of seven per cent reversible strain and also results in a high work hardening rate. The erosion resistance of nickel based tungsten carbides is, in turn, attributable to the very high yield stress of these materials, Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene and nylons have relatively high erosion resistances, Their exceptional performances are due to a high strain to fracture and high yield strength respectively. On the other hand low tensile strength polytetrafluoroethylene has a very poor resistance to erosion. This work has identified various material properties which are required for erosion resistance, These are : (a) a high yield stress, (b) a high work hardening rate and (c) a high strain to fracture...|$|R
40|$|Trough the {{following}} pages a comprehensive study of open structures will be shown, including mono-vacancy calculations and open surfaces. These are electronic structure calculations using density functional theory within the exact muffin tin method. First I investigate the accuracy of five common density functional approximations for the theoretical description of {{the formation energy of}} mono-vacancies in three close  packed metals. Besides the local density approximation (LDA), I consider two generalized gradient approximation developed by Perdew and co-workers (PBE and PBEsol) and two gradient-level functionals obtained within the subsystem functional approach (AM 05 and LAG). As test cases, I select aluminium, nickel and copper, all of them adopting the <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> crystallographic structure. This investigation is followed by a performance comparison of the three common gradient level exchange-correlation functionals for metallic bulk, surface and vacancy systems. I find that approximations which by construction give similar results for the jellium surface, show large deviations for realistic systems. The particular charge density and density gradient dependence of the exchange-correlation energy densities is shown to be the reason behind the obtained differences. Our findings confirm that both the global (total energy) and the local (energy density) behavior of the exchange-correlation functional should be monitored for a consistent functional design. I also calculate the vacancy formation energies of paramagnetic <b>face</b> <b>centered</b> <b>cubic</b> (fcc) Fe-Cr-Ni <b>alloys</b> as a function of chemical composition. These alloys are well known model systems for low carbon austenitic stainless steels. The theoretical predictions obtained for homogeneous chemistry and relaxed nearest neighbor lattice sites are in line with the experimental observations. In particular, Ni is found to decrease and Cr increase the vacancy formation energy of the ternary system. The results are interpreted in terms of effective chemical potentials. The impact of vacancy on the local magnetic properties of austenitic steel alloys is also investigated. I made a performance comparison of local density and generalized gradient level approach on substitutional defects in five light actinides. This is a complex test for high density calculations to check the weaknesses of the local density approximation against gradient level ones. I believe the existing other gradient level approaches fit our error bar in the obtained data and shows similar trends against the very limited number of experimental data. Based on our ab initio results, I predict that vacancies are more easily formed (more stable) in the fcc(bcc) lattice for U, Np and Pu and in the bcc(fcc) lattice for Th and Pa.
