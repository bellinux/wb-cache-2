5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in <b>keratinization</b> of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased <b>keratinization</b> may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and <b>keratinization.</b> This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, {{also known}} as retinoids, {{benefits}} the skin by normalizing <b>keratinization,</b> downregulating sebum production which contributes to acne, and reversing and treating photodamage, striae, and cellulite.|$|E
25|$|The {{sample is}} stained using the Papanicolaou technique, in which tinctorial dyes and acids are {{selectively}} retained by cells. Unstained cells cannot {{be seen with}} a light microscope. Papanicolaou chose stains that highlighted cytoplasmic <b>keratinization,</b> which actually has almost {{nothing to do with}} the nuclear features used to make diagnoses now.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made {{based upon the}} clinical appearance, and swabs can be taken of {{the surface of the}} denture. Investigations to rule out possibility of diabetes may be indicated. Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated, but if taken shows histologic evidence of proliferative or degenerative responses and reduced <b>keratinization</b> and epithelial atrophy.|$|E
25|$|Epidermis {{is divided}} into several layers where cells are formed through mitosis at the {{innermost}} layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with keratin. They eventually reach the top layer called stratum corneum and are sloughed off, or desquamated. This process is called <b>keratinization</b> and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{disposal}} {{tends to}} be similar to that of normal epidermis: immature/basal cells at the periphery, becoming more mature to the centre of the tumor masses. Tumor cells transform into keratinized squamous cells and form round nodules with concentric, laminated layers, called [...] "cell nests" [...] or [...] "epithelial/keratinous pearls". The surrounding stroma is reduced and contains inflammatory infiltrate (lymphocytes). Poorly differentiated squamous carcinomas contain more pleomorphic cells and no <b>keratinization.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The enamel organ [...] is {{composed}} of the outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum and stratum intermedium. [...] These cells give rise to ameloblasts, which produce enamel and {{become a part of}} the reduced enamel epithelium (REE) after maturation of the enamel. The location where the outer enamel epithelium and inner enamel epithelium join is called the cervical loop. The growth of cervical loop cells into the deeper tissues forms Hertwig Epithelial Root Sheath, which determines the root shape of the tooth. During tooth development there are strong similarities between <b>keratinization</b> and amelogenesis. Keratin is also present in epithelial cells of tooth germ [...] and a thin film of keratin is present on a recently erupted tooth (Nasmyth's membrane or enamel cuticle).|$|E

50|$|Dyskeratosis is {{abnormal}} <b>keratinization</b> occurring prematurely within individual {{cells or}} groups of cells below the stratum granulosum.|$|E
50|$|Refers to a {{carcinoma}} with observable {{features and}} characteristics indicative of squamous differentiation (intercellular bridges, <b>keratinization,</b> squamous pearls).|$|E
50|$|During biopsy, {{the lesion}} may show three signs: Gritty texture, Firmness and cystification owing to <b>keratinization,</b> fribrosis and {{necrosis}} respectively.|$|E
50|$|Talarozole (formerly R115866, planned {{trade name}} Rambazole) was an investigational drug for the {{treatment}} of acne, psoriasis and other <b>keratinization</b> disorders. Development has been discontinued.|$|E

50|$|Migratory lesions of {{ichthyosis}} linearis circumflexa may {{be caused}} by a dermal influx of inflammatory cells that undergo phagocytosis and digestion by keratinocytes, resulting in disruption of <b>keratinization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Keratohyalin is {{a protein}} {{structure}} found in granules in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis, {{which may be}} involved in <b>keratinization,</b> and in Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus.|$|E
50|$|The fluid {{is absorbed}} through the fetal tissue and skin. After the 15th-25th week of {{pregnancy}} when the <b>keratinization</b> of an embryo's skin occurs, the fluid is primarily {{absorbed by the}} fetal gut.|$|E
50|$|Porokeratosis is a {{specific}} disorder of <b>keratinization</b> that is characterized histologically {{by the presence of}} a cornoid lamella, a thin column of closely stacked, parakeratotic cells extending through the stratum corneum with a thin or absent granular layer.|$|E
50|$|Histologically, {{they are}} made up of {{irregular}} connective tissue cores with a keratin-containing epithelium which has fine secondary processes. Heavy <b>keratinization</b> of filiform papillae, occurring for instance in cats, gives the tongue a roughness that is characteristic of these animals.|$|E
50|$|A sunburn cell is a {{keratinocyte}} with a pyknotic nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm {{that appears}} after exposure to UVC or UVB radiation or UVA {{in the presence}} of psoralens. It shows premature and abnormal <b>keratinization,</b> and has been described as an example of apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Keratinization</b> is the {{differentiation}} of keratinocytes in the stratum granulosum into nonvital surface cells or squames {{to form the}} stratum corneum. The cells terminally differentiate as they migrate to the surface from the stratum basale where the progenitor cells are located to the superficial surface.|$|E

5000|$|There may be {{abnormal}} <b>keratinization,</b> where keratin {{is formed}} below the normal keratin layer. This {{can occur in}} individual cells or groups of cells, forming an intraepithelial keratin pearl.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{structural}} proteins (filaggrin, keratin), enzymes (proteases), lipids and antimicrobial peptides (defensins) contribute {{to maintain the}} important barrier function of the skin. <b>Keratinization</b> {{is part of the}} physical barrier formation (cornification), in which the keratinocytes produce more and more keratin and undergo terminal differentiation. The fully cornified keratinocytes that form the outermost layer are constantly shed off and replaced by new cells.|$|E
5000|$|Healthy gums {{usually have}} a color that has been {{described}} as [...] "coral pink." [...] Other colours like red, white, and blue can signify inflammation (gingivitis) or pathology. Although described as the colour coral pink, variation in colour is possible. This can be the result of factors such as: thickness and degree of <b>keratinization</b> of the epithelium, blood flow to the gums , natural pigmentation, disease and medications.|$|E
50|$|Keratin {{filaments}} {{are abundant}} in keratinocytes in the cornified {{layer of the}} epidermis; these are proteins which have undergone <b>keratinization.</b> In addition, keratin filaments are present in epithelial cells in general. For example, mouse thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are known to react with antibodies for keratin 5, keratin 8, and keratin 14. These antibodies are used as fluorescent markers to distinguish subsets of TECs in genetic studies of the thymus.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} 15% {{of cases}} {{are caused by}} a variety of diseases involving <b>keratinization</b> disorders. Known causes of collodion baby include ichthyosis vulgaris and trichothiodystrophy. Less well documented causes include Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, Netherton syndrome, Gaucher disease type 2, congenital hypothyroidism, Conradi syndrome, Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome, ketoadipiaciduria, koraxitrachitic syndrome, ichthyosis variegata and palmoplantar keratoderma with anogenital leukokeratosis. Since many of these conditions have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, they are rare and can be associated with consanguinity.|$|E
5000|$|Stippling is a {{consequence}} of the microscopic elevations and depressions of the surface of the gingival tissue due to the connective tissue projections within the tissue. [...] "The degree of <b>keratinization</b> and the prominence of stippling appear to be related." [...] To be more specific, stippling occurs at sites of fusion of the epithelial ridges (also known as rete pegs) and correspond to the fusion of the valleys created by the connective tissue papillae.|$|E
5000|$|Trichorrhexis invaginata (also {{known as}} [...] "Bamboo hair" [...] ) is a {{distinctive}} hair shaft abnormality {{that may occur}} sporadically, either in normal hair or with other hair shaft abnormalities, or regularly as a marker for Netherton's syndrome. The primary defect appears to be abnormal <b>keratinization</b> of the hair shaft in the keratogenous zone, allowing for intussusception of the fully keratinized and hard distal shaft into the incompletely keratinized and soft proximal portion of the shaft.|$|E

5000|$|Parakeratosis is {{a mode of}} <b>keratinization</b> {{characterized}} by the retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum. In mucous membranes, parakeratosis is normal. [...] In the skin, this process leads to the abnormal replacement of annular squames with nucleated cells. Parakeratosis {{is associated with the}} thinning or loss of the granular layer and is usually seen in diseases of increased cell turnover, whether inflammatory or neoplastic. Parakeratosis is seen in the plaques of psoriasis and in dandruff.|$|E
