These observations are in line with the classic ‘Mosaic Theory of Regeneration’ (Aubréville [1938]) developed from patterns in mixed tropical forests on the Ivory Coast (see Richards [1952]).|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{vegetation}} communities and their diversity patterns in Chenab valley, the buffer zone of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in Chamoli District of Uttarakhand, India. A total of 42 sites were selected randomly based on the landform heterogeneity of the area. Eight forest communities with overlap among vegetation types and also various plant associations were noticed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) following PAST program and two shrub communities identified separately were, Berberis and bamboo. The range of density in various forest communities was from 203 - 545 trees ha- 1 and total basal area from 17. 5 - 71. 7 m 2 ha- 1. The range of species richness of tree layer, shrub layer and herb layer was from 2 - 14, 1 - 10 and 4 - 14 and diversity from 0. 693 - 2. 304, 0. 514 - 2. 052 and 1. 202 - 2. 583, respectively. The distribution pattern of trees, shrubs and herbs shows that the species were evenly distributed {{in most of the}} sites and the �-diversity of the present study area is 7. 4. Rhododendron and Taxus, the undercanopy species facilitated the regeneration of Chimnobambusa falcata, while the conversion of lower <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> individuals to higher <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> individuals is steady and progressive. Though, evergreen and deciduous species had good population of seedlings and saplings, but the conversion to next <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> was very poor due to the high anthropogenic pressure.

30|$|In {{natural forest}} ecosystems, {{accumulated}} biomass {{is an important}} parameter for assessing sustainable utilization, productivity, and CO 2 sequestration from the atmosphere. Therefore, accuracy of estimation method {{is very important for}} a number of applications like global carbon cycle, timber extraction, to assess carbon stock tracking changes, etc. (Vashum and Jayakumar 2012). The aboveground forest biomass/carbon have been estimated by a number of methods and techniques based on inventory and stock tables. Most of the studies have been done in tropical forests with varying interests and objectives such as nutrient cycling, productivity, and sustainability of forest. The data is collected from limited to small, nonrandomly selected areas with insufficient focus on global carbon research (Brown et al. 1989). Most of the tropical tree inventories included large <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> trees with an interest in commercial timber. Further, the tropical forests are uneven aged and composed of all size and age classes. Omission of small or smaller <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> trees would many a times underestimate the important role of these individuals to the total forest biomass. Therefore, it is imperative to first analyze the structure and species composition of the vegetation and consider all or at least large proportion of the vegetation component for biomass estimation especially in tropical forests (Salunkhe et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|Myanmar {{has been}} {{experiencing}} natural teak forest degradation, consequent affect of over-exploitation of teak above the prescribed cut limit, and challenging of restoring its degraded forests. The un-sustainable way of teak production {{from the natural}} forests of Myanmar is the main driving factor {{to point out the}} currently applied Brandis yield model for Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) of teak and to propose an alternative model for the yield regulation of teak. This study was composed of five chapters: introduction, study site and data set, preliminary analysis of teak conditions in natural forests, developing alternative approach for yield regulation, discussion and conclusion. Under the system of Myanma Selection System (MSS), it was believed that the future consistent supply of teak would be ensured by following AAC with the prescribed girth limit for exploitable teak trees and felling cycle of thirty-year. Through the preliminary analysis on existing yield model, this study addressed that no forest stands had been harvested in accordance with AAC. Decreasing girth limit and shortening felling cycles were observed in the selected research site. In fact, this yield regulation model was developed over centuries for the sustainable teak productivity of the virgin natural forests which were almost untouched by disturbances. The author also examined disturbance finding in each <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> of teak stock. The loss of younger stems of teak between two felling cycles was suggested mainly due to illegal logging by local people staying near the forest sites. To resolve the drawbacks of existing yield model, the new model was developed by considering the utility of maturities as an index in the sustainable management of natural teak in stand levels. The concept of the maturity is to check whether the trees in each <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> moved to next higher class over years and if moved, the maturity was considered increase. As long as we found the maturity increase across the girth classes, that stand could be considered as stable and chosen for harvest. While Brandis’ method was applicable only for the forests with the excess amount of mature trees, the new one would be feasible to apply in the current situation of natural forests which has been facing the problems of degradation and over-exploitation of timber in Myanmar. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 04 - 13; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3846 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学系研究科森林科学専...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{potential}} of forest plantations in Sri Lanka consisting of teak, mahogany and two species of eucalyptus, to facilitate the conservation of biodiversity using two taxonomic groups, the plants and birds. Their diversity in plantations at a harvestable age were {{compared with that of}} a natural forest. Enumerations of plants and dbh/height measurements were conducted in quadrates, while avifauna was recorded along transects. Results show that plantation forests supported a reasonably rich community of both plants and birds, including natives and endemics. A large proportion of species were common to both plantations and natural forests indicating that plantations hold a subset of forest species. The presence of plants of various height and <b>girth</b> <b>classes</b> together with the high diversity and evenness values indicate that, although timber plantations are initially established as mono-cultivations, they facilitate the colonization of additional species. These findings thus demonstrate that forest plantations could make a significant contribution towards biodiversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} carried out in a {{temperate}} forest for enumeration of floristic diversity and community characteristics analysis of the Talle Wildlife Sanctuary. A random sampling approach was adopted. Altogether, 63 species were recorded from the sampled area (0. 2  ha).

Seventy percent of species showed low frequency distribution and species having higher frequency classes were almost absent or represented by only a few species. Dominance distribution of species resulted in a log normal distribution pattern which further signifies that the forest community was heterogeneous in nature. Species Prediction and Diversity Estimation analysis categorized 80 % of the species as a rare species group and 20 % as abundant species group. Estimation of coefficient of variation showed that rare species have equal detection possibilities in the sampled area.

Two sites (National Park vs. hunting zone) that differ in elephant density were compared for intensity of bark damage and correlations between the intensity of bark damage and stem size of the baobab trees and population structure of the baobab trees. Elephants and baobabs showed co-occurrence in PBR suggesting that there is nowhere to hide for baobabs. The intensity of bark damage was positively correlated with elephant density and baobab girth. Baobab population <b>girth</b> <b>classes</b> were not significantly different in areas with and without bark damage.

This study investigated effects of height and girth on yield of Acacia senegal L. in the natural forests. Three heights and girth classes were purposely selected. Trees which heights and girth fell within those classes were selected randomly and tapped at constant height classes with varying girth classes. Exudates were collected, weighed and recorded according to height and <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> respectively. Descriptive and ANOVA results showed that when total tree height was lower than 2. 0 m, gum yield increased as tree girth goes higher from 35 - 	 54 cm (163. 6 - 209. 7 g). Tree girth significantly affected gum yield (p≤ 0. 05) and trees which total heights were lower than 	 2. 0 m	(maximum of 1. 95 m) and girth higher than 54 cm (maximum of 65 cm) produced the highest mean gum yield.

40|$|Impact of {{disturbance}} on forest stand density, basal area, dbh class distribution of density and basal area, species richness, species diversity and similarity index was assessed through monitoring six, one-hectare, permanent forest plots {{after a period}} of 24 years in tropical moist forests of Uttara Kannada district, Western Ghats, India. It was observed that all sites lost trees due to removal by people and mortality. Loss of trees was more in sites that are easily accessible and closer to human habitation. In spite of a decrease in tree density, an increase in basal area was observed in some forest plots, which could be on account of stimulatory growth of surviving trees. Decrease in basal area in other sites indicates greater human pressure and overexploitation of trees. Preponderance of lower <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> trees, and a unimodal reverse `J-shaped' curve of density distribution as observed in majority of the sites in the benchmark year, was indicative of regenerating status of these forests. The decrease in number of species in all forest sites was due to indiscriminate removal of trees by people, without sparing species with only a few individuals, and also due to mortality of trees of rare species. Higher species richness and diversity in the lowest dbh class in most of the sites in the benchmark year is indicative of the existence of favorable conditions for sylvigenesis. The decrease in the similarity index suggests extirpation of species, favoring invasion and colonization by secondary species. To minimize human pressure on forests and to facilitate regeneration and growth, proper management planning and conservation measures are needed...|$|E

40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{the impact of}} anthropogenic disturbance on forest structure and plant diversity in the riparian forest in the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka, Southern India. We clustered 11 transects into groups with low and high anthropogenic disturbances. In total, 73 tree species were recorded on 11 transects, of which 57 species were found in less-disturbed sites and 39 species in high-disturbed sites. Shannon-Wiener diversity confirmed higher values for less-disturbed sites (3. 2 0. 7) compared with high-disturbed sites (2. 7 0. 5). Evenness index suggested no complete evenness in the two sites. Mean species richness and number of individuals in the majority <b>girth</b> <b>classes</b> {{were found to be}} higher in less-disturbed sites than in high-disturbed sites. Non-native plants dominated the high-disturbed sites. The occurrence of native and non-native species was correlated with the level of disturbance. Current disturbance intensities may have led to loss of native species such as Ixora bracheata, Madhuca latifolia, Syzygium cumini and Terminalia arjuna in riparian forests. This study concludes that species-rich areas in the riparian forests are under threat.

A comparatively higher number of trees and shrubs were recorded on the western aspect where low erosion and greater anthropogenic pressure were present. The total tree density was higher at hilltop of eastern aspect and hill slope of western aspect. Total tree basal area varied from 4. 5 m 2 ha- 1 (hill base) to 11. 9 m 2 ha- 1 (hilltop) on the eastern aspect and from 9. 3 m 2 ha- 1 (hilltop) to 16. 8 m 2 ha- 1 (hill base) on the western aspect. The sap-ling and seedling density was lower on western aspect because higher anthropogenic distur-bances may lead the removal of seedlings {{of most of the}} tree species.

In an undisturbed, natural population of D. montana, female fecundity was not significantly influenced by distance to neighbours or by flower numbers on neighbours. In the same population fruit set was also unrelated to the angular dispersion of neighbours. On the other hand, in an altered population of this species in which conspecifics are extremely isolated due to human activities, insect visitation and fruit set were strongly and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest male. Moreover, the number of insects and fruit set in the natural population were significantly higher in the natural population than in the altered population. In the natural population, trees of large girth produced larger numbers of flowers in both sexes and females which produced larger numbers of flowers, also produced more fruits and fruit set (fruits/flower). In the altered population, fruit numbers and fruit set in female trees were unrelated to the flower numbers, which is possibly due to pollination limitation {{as a result of}} inadequate pollinator visits at female trees.

In all a total of 1, 138 lianas belonging to 40 species were recorded. Mean liana density was 379 stems ha- 1. Plots 1, 2 and 3 contained 211, 668 and 259 lianas ha- 1 respectively. Their corresponding species richness was 15, 24 and 24. The number of lianas twining over individual trees ranged from 1 to 3, but ma-jority of the hosts supported only a single liana. Rutaceae and Papilionaceae were the most species-rich plant families of lianas followed by Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Con-naraceae, and Piperaceae.

Species richness (radj 2 = 0. 49; P= 0. 05), dominance (radj 2 = 0. 68; P= 0. 009), and density (radj 2 = 0. 62; P= 0. 02) were significantly increased at different disturbance intensities. Disturbances strongly influenced typical community association and structure by increasing diversity and population at certain magnitude and thereby showed declining trend towards maturation. Fragmented moist deciduous forests seek immediate attention as they represent spatial habitat for many economical or ecological important species, thus sustaining local biodiversity for livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, {{located in}} one of the global {{biodiversity}} hotspots, is endowed with abundant floral wealth, including a wide array of medicinal plants (MPs). However, over-exploitation of these resources is widespread, and only a few studies have assessed the richness and diversity of Bhutanese forests and in particular about the MP resources. A vegetation survey was conducted in Tshothang Chiwog, south-eastern Bhutan to characterize the floristic structure of the broad-leaf mixed coniferous forests with a special focus on MPs. A questionnaire survey involving 40 farmers was also conducted to assess the ethnobotanical and socioeconomic aspects of MP extraction. A total of 157 plant species (38 trees, 19 shrubs, 85 herbs and ferns, and 15 climbers), representing 74 families and 137 genera were identified from the study area, of which 69 species (14 trees, 10 shrubs, 38 herbs and ferns, and seven climbers), belonging to 41 families and 69 genera were medicinally important. The most species-rich families of medicinal plants were: Asteraceae (eight spp.), Apiaceae (four spp.), Polygonaceae, Brassicaceae, Zingiberaceae, and Urticaceae (three species each). Herbaceous flora exhibited the highest diversity (Simpson diversity index, D = 0. 97 and Shannon-Weiner index, H′ = 5. 82), followed by trees and shrubs (D = 0. 95 and 0. 92 and H′ = 4. 86 and 3. 97, respectively). All but one herb showed abundance-to-frequency ratio (A/F) ≥ 0. 05, signifying a contagious distribution pattern (large aggregated distribution). <b>Girth</b> <b>class</b> distribution of trees followed an inverse J-shaped pattern. Results of the ethnobotanic study documented 55 MPs. MP collection, as reported by the interviewees, generally improved the socioeconomic status of the people of Tshothang Chiwog. Apart from improving the livelihood security of the local people, aspects relating to health care and culture are also important. Respondents were also concerned about the declining MP wealth of the Chiwog over the years, due to over-exploitation. Monitoring the plant resources and adopting conservation programmes in the Chiwog, in their opinion, may improve the MP wealth of the locality. The lessons learned from the study may have applicability over the south-eastern part of Bhutan and other regions with similar eco-climatic features...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in subtropical humid forests of Meghalaya to study the distributional pattern of species, floristic composition, community structure and tree population structure. Forest fragments of varying sizes (0. 5 ha, 1 ha, 2 ha and 5 ha) were used in the study. All of the forest fragments are distributed within the same altitudinal range, and had similar rainfall and temperature regimes. Four forest fragments were sampled using random quadrats to analyze the impact of fragment size on tree diversity andpopulation structure. Indices were used to compare the dispersion pattern of plant species, species diversity among fragments, and the heterogeneity and homogeneity of the fragments. A total of 45 tree species were recorded from all the fragments and simple correlation showed that the species richness was positively related to fragment size (n = 4, P< 0. 05). Other measures such as stand density, basal cover, diversity and dominance indices were unrelated to fragment size. Forest canopy was composed mainly of Castonopsis indica, C. armata, Schima khasiana and Engelhardtia spicata in all of the fragments. A majority of woody tree species were contagiously distributed which made the forest community highly patchy in nature. Low values of Sorensen’s similarity index and high values of Whittaker’s β-diversity index between the fragments suggest marked difference in the species composition among the fragments. The maximum stand density, basal area, Shannon diversity index and Simpson dominance index was recorded in a 5 -ha fragment. Trees in lower girth classes (15 – 55 cm circumference at breast height, CBH) accounted for 52 – 86 % of stand density in all fragments except in 0. 5 -ha fragments where middle <b>girth</b> <b>class</b> (55 – 95 cm CBH) accounted for 47 % of the total stand density. The overall density of seedlings, saplings and adult trees formed a pyramidal structure, indicating that the period between the sapling and adult stage was a critical stage in tree life cycles, as the maximum mortality occurred during this period. These groves are mildly/highly disturbed by communitiesusing forests for their timber and fuel wood requirements as well as cattle and goat grazing. Tree regeneration was apparently not limited, as was evidenced by high density of saplings. These human activities may have been responsible for a decrease in tree diversity in the smaller fragments. Large fragments that were less disturbed harbored species not present in small fragments...|$|E

40|$|Aim of the study: The aim of {{the present}} study was to understatnd the forest composition, structure, {{diversity}} and regeneration potential along altitudinal gradient. Area of study: The study was carried out in Dhanaulti forest which falls under temperate region of Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand state, India. Material and Methods: Vegetation analysis was carried out using 10 quadrats at each altitude using a quadrate size of 10 × 10 m 2. In each quadrate, categories of trees > 30 cm cbh were considered as trees, 10 - 30 cm cbh as saplings and < 10 cm cbh as seedlings. The data were quantitatively analyzed. Main results: In upper and middle altitudes, Cedrus deodara was reported dominant tree whereas, in lower altitude Quercus leucotrichophora was reported dominant. Tree density was highest in lower altitude which reduced middle and upper altitudes whereas, total basal cover increased with increasing altitude. The increasing total basal cover with altitude could be because of the presence of Cedrus deodara trees having higher <b>girth</b> <b>classes.</b> In tree, sapling and seedling layers, diversity (H) and equitabiltiy (EC) decreased with increasing altitude. However, concentrations of dominace (CD) and beta diversity (BD have shown reverse trend with H and EC which increased with increasing altitudes, in each layer of tree, sapling and seedling. The distribution pattern of most species in all layers of trees, saplings and seedlings was contagious. The regeneration potential of the species has shown that some of the species in the absence of tree layer are still regenerating particularly, Rhododendron arboreum, Benthamidia capitata, Neolitsea pallens etc. It indicates that most of the species are shifting upward as they are getting suitable conditions. Research highlights: Altitude influence species composition, diversity and regeneration potential of species.

Modeling marketable products {{is a key to}} obtain good fitness between observed and theoretical girth distribution. We determine the best parameter recovery method with the Weibull function for two sylvicultural regimes (coppice and high forest). Data on stand variables were collected from 1101 sample plots. The three Weibull function parameters were estimated with three parameters re-covery methods: the maximum likelihood method, the method of moments and the method of percentiles. Stepwise regression and the simultaneously re-estimated parameter using the Seemingly Unrelated Re-gression Estimation were applied to model each parameter. The results indicated that the three methods successfully predicted girth size distributions within the sample stands. The method of moments was the best one with lowest values of Reynolds error index and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic however the syl-vicultural regimes. The Weibull parameter distribution model developed for each of the two sylvicultural regimes was quite reliable. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of a class of iterative probabilistic algorithms in regular graphs, called locally greedy algorithms, which will provide bounds for graph functions in regular graphs with large <b>girth.</b> This <b>class</b> is useful because, by conveniently setting the parameters associated with it, we may derive algorithms for some well-known graph problems, such as algorithms to find a large independent set, a large induced forest, or even a small dominating set in an input graph G. The name ``locally greedy" comes from the fact that, in an algorithm of this class, the probability associated with the random selection of a vertex v is determined by {{the current state of the}} vertices within some fixed distance of v. Given r > 2 and an r-regular graph G, we determine the expected performance of a locally greedy algorithm in G, depending on the girth g of the input and on the degree r of its vertices. When the girth of the graph is sufficiently large, this analysis leads to new lower bounds on the independence number of G and on the maximum number of vertices in an induced forest in G, which, in both cases, improve the bounds previously known. It also implies bounds on the same functions in graphs with large girth and maximum degree r and in random regular graphs. As a matter of fact, the asymptotic lower bounds on the cardinality of a maximum induced forest in a random regular graph improve earlier bounds, while, for independent sets, our bounds coincide with asymptotic lower bounds first obtained by Wormald. Our result provides an alternative proof of these bounds which avoids sharp concentration arguments. The main contribution of this work lies in the method presented rather than in these particular new bounds. This method allows us, in some sense, to directly analyse prioritised algorithms in regular graphs, so that the class of locally greedy algorithms, or slight modifications thereof, may be applied to a wider range of problems in regular graphs with large girth...|$|R
