5|$|Elements are loosely {{structured}} interest groups, where specific {{themes and}} <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> addressed. They can {{be open for}} non-members and are commonly in operation only for short periods. Topics of interest include, for example, animal rights, which {{was the subject of}} the Arkte element operated by Aquino's wife Lilith.|$|E
5|$|Enhancement of the {{language}} goes along with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about {{the language}}'s development; specific <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> discussed in the Roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org.

5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy <b>issues,</b> <b>are</b> better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Tony's {{complicated}} life is {{his relationship}} with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by his constant infidelity and her struggle to reconcile the reality of Tony's business (which she is often in denial of), with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Both have up-and-down relationships with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J.

5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it would discuss the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown {{has many}} {{additional}} groups representing national, ethnic, and linguistic interests. Georgetown's has {{the second most}} politically active student body in the United States according to the Princeton Review.

5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{the release}} team publishes {{guidelines}} to the developers {{in order to}} ready the release. A new release occurs after a freeze, when all important software is reasonably up-to-date in the Testing branch and any other significant <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> solved.

5|$|Some {{collectors}} try {{to acquire}} a basic collection of the more common stamps from 1922 onwards, though that can be difficult now due to the quantity issued. Many collectors concentrate on one type of stamp, such as definitives or commemoratives, or even one issue, such as Gerl definitives. The First Day covers, especially commemoratives with full sets affixed, are popular though the older <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> harder to find because less than a million of the high value stamps were printed {{in the early years}} (1929–1940s) for several issues, a far lower number than the 20-plus millions printed for most of the low values during the same period.|$|E
5|$|The 1982-dated issues {{banknotes}} differed {{little from}} the earlier, {{except that it}} took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare. However, there was an error with early runs of the $10 banknote (Pick no. 3b), because it bears Salisbury as {{the name of the}} capital city instead of Harare. These type of <b>issues</b> <b>are</b> rare. Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination was taken in 1983 with K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank.|$|E
