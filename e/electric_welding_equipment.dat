5000|$|On {{return home}} in 1944, Bamford {{initially}} worked for English Electric developing <b>electric</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> in Stafford. A short return stint {{with the family}} firm proved too stifling, and his Uncle Henry released him, saying he thought Joe had [...] "little future ahead of him." [...] After selling Brylcreem for a short while, in October 1945 Bamford rented a 10 ft by 15 ft lock-up garage for 30 shillings (= £1.50) a week, and made a farm trailer from scrap steel and war surplus Jeep axles, using a prototype electric welder bought for £2-10s (= £2.50). He opened for business on the day his first son, Anthony, was born, and sold the trailer for £45 and a cart, which he also repaired and sold for another £45.|$|E

40|$|Electric {{arc welding}} {{is widely used}} in {{construction}} and engineering for rigid connections of metal elements. Substantial nonlinearity of dynamic voltage-current characteristics of electric arcs in such equipment {{is a source of}} distortion in current and voltage sinusoids at the points of other electric receivers parallel joints. The voltage fluctuations from the nominal value result in changing luminous flux of bulbs, while current higher harmonics result in additional losses in electric motors. However, the problem of <b>electric</b> <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> influence on power lines wasn’t paid proper attention to. Therefore, this work is to research electric arc equipment influence on power lines in order to find out the values and the spectrum of higher harmonics, and the prevailing amplitudes dynamics of change. In this paper the results of experimental researches of harmonics spectrum in electrical circuits of electric arc welding machine of alternating voltage that it generates during the technological process and the main energy parameters, that influence negatively on the power supply networks of 0, 4 / 0, 23 kV. Analyzing the results of the measurements we {{come to the conclusion that}} if the load factor is about 35 % the power coefficient of the welding machine is 0, 46, that is rather low. Such a result is economically disadvantageous since high reactive power results in a significant increase of active power losses in the elements of power supply. That’s why reactive power compensation as well as higher harmonics filtration are necessitate...|$|E

Thin plate is usually welded using low current whereas <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> that {{available in the}} market has a high current capacity. It is not optimum condition because <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> is working under its capacity. The largeconstruction manufacturing often {{requires a lot of}} <b>welding</b> <b>equipments.</b> It shows a high investment and maintenance costs. It is important to design the double electrode <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> with a single power supply. Austenitic stainless steels SUS 304 and carbon steel SS 400 with thickness of 1. 5 mm were used.

40|$|The {{competition}} in industrial markets in general has become intense and fierce. Supplier companies are increasingly facing difficulties in differentiating their market offerings {{in the minds}} of customers. New ways of creating competitive advantage are sought after, and the notion of customer value is gaining in importance. It has been recognized that understanding the way in which customers judge and value suppliers' market offerings is crucial for achieving competitive advantage (Graf & Maas 2008, 2). This study contributes to the understanding of customer value in business markets, especially in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market. It provides valuable practical implications for <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> suppliers about chances to benefit of the customer value concept when striving for competitive advantage. This study applies general theories of competitive advantage and customer value in business markets. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore and to analyze customer value drivers in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market, and to discuss how these value drivers relate to the competitive advantage of <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> suppliers. A customer value approach is used in order to assess by which means a supplier's market offering can best meet customers' requirements. A qualitative approach was used to conduct this study. The data was gathered in 13 semi-structured phone interviews with <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> buyers from various fields of engineering. The data was analyzed in relation to the existing theory, relying on the notion that customer value is a subjectively perceived, multidimensional construct. During the analysis, it was identified that customer value in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market consists of 16 different value drivers which can be categorized under economic, product-related, service-related and relational benefits. Customer companies, however, have diversified preferences and requirements guiding their selection of <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> suppliers. The most difficult task for a supplier is to decide which value elements and which customer segments to concentrate on. Based on the analysis, the key to achieve competitive advantage in the Finnish <b>welding</b> <b>equipment</b> market is on identifying the service gaps and providing customers with improved service and relational benefits. The chances for a supplier to succeed in competition can be increased by providing service elements for those customers that currently lack it and making the interactions personal.
