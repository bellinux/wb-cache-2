40|$|This paper {{analyses}} optimal overhead allocation in {{a simple}} one-period setting with several divisions (production, sales or service departments). At the begin-ning of the period, headquarters has {{to decide on the}} procurement of a <b>common</b> <b>input.</b> The divisions possess private information on their respective marginal profit expectations of the <b>common</b> <b>input.</b> The objective of headquarters is to determine the most efficient overhead allocation mechanism. Different mechan-isms are compared. The conclusion is that the non-allocation of the common costs leads to a presentation of excessive profit expectations by the divisional managers and will thus induce an overinvestment in the <b>common</b> <b>input.</b> The Groves scheme prevents such a misallocation of resources only if collusion is precluded. In contrast, full-cost allocation leads to the first-best solution if allocation is based on a measure that ideally approximates the divisions' pro-portion of marginal profitability of the input. Thus, in the case of homogeneous divisions which benefit equally from the <b>common</b> <b>input</b> an equal allocation is optimal. In the case that divisions with higher profits benefit more from a <b>common</b> <b>input,</b> the allocation of overhead costs according to the divisional profits observable {{at the end of the}} period ('ability-to-bear' principle) can be optimal. ...|$|R

However, due to finite signal transmission speeds and differences in {{the distance to the}} source, time shifts between otherwise <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> are unavoidable. Since <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> can be a source of correlation between the elements of multi-unit dynamical systems, regardless of whether these elements are directly connected with one another or not, it is of importance to understand their impact on synchronization. As a canonical model that is representative for a variety of different dynamical systems, we study limit-cycle oscillators that are driven by stochastic time-shifted <b>common</b> <b>inputs.</b> We show that if the oscillators are coupled, time shifts in stochastic <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> do not simply shift the distribution of the phase differences, but rather the distribution actually changes as a result.

40|$|Because of {{the huge}} {{bandwidth}} of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems, in-band narrowband interference may hinder receiver performance. In this dissertation, sources of potential narrowband interference that lie within the IEEE 802. 15. 3 a UWB bandwidth are presented, and a solution is proposed. To combat interference in Multi-Band OFDM (MB-OFDM) UWB systems, an analog notch filter {{is designed to be}} included in the UWB receive chain. The architecture of the filter is based on feed-forward subtraction of the interference, and includes a Least Means Squared (LMS) tuning scheme to maximize attenuation. The filter uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) result for interference detection and discrete center frequency tuning of the filter. It was fabricated in a 0. 18 ????m process, and experimental results are provided. This is the first study of potential in-band interference sources for UWB. The proposed filter offers a practical means for ensuring reliable UWB communication in the presense of such interference. The Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) is the predominant building block in the design of the notch filter. In many cases, OTAs must handle input signals with large common mode swings. A new scheme for achieving rail-to-rail input to an OTA is introduced. Constant gm is obtained by using tunable level shifters and a single differential pair. Feedback circuitry controls the level shifters in a manner that fixes the common mode input of the differential pair, resulting in consistent and stable operation for rail-to-rail inputs. As the new technique avoids using complimentary input differential pairs, this method overcomes problems such as Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) and Gain Bandwidth (GBW) product degradation that exist in many other designs. The circuit was fabricated in a 0. 5 ????m process.

Analytical approximations are derived for the moments of the steady state potential and the effective time constant. We show that postsynaptic �ring barely depends on the correlation between inhibitory inputs; only the inhibitory �ring rate matters. In contrast, both the degree of synchrony and the �ring rate of excitatory inputs are relevant. A coef�cient of variation CV> 1 can be attained with low inhibitory �ring rates and (Poisson-modulated) synchronized excitatory synaptic input, where both the number of presynaptic neurons in synchronous �ring assemblies and the synchronous �ring rate should be suf�ciently large. The correlation in �ring of a pair of uncoupled neurons due to <b>common</b> excitatory <b>input</b> is initially increased for increasing �ring rates of independent inhibitory inputs but decreases for large inhibitory �ring rates. <b>Common</b> inhibitory <b>input</b> to a pair of uncoupled neurons barely induces correlated �ring, but ampli�es the effect of common excitation.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityFor {{more than}} four decades, {{observations}} of synchronized motoneuron firings detected during human muscle contractions {{have been used to}} determine the strength of <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> shared by motoneurons. This notion {{is referred to as the}} "common input". It relies on the supposition that synchronization is caused by branches of presynaptic inputs shared by motoneurons. However, direct empirical observations that physical <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> elicit synchronized firings have never been reported. The disquiet over the lack of physical evidence has been compounded by the lack of statistical rigor of the methods used to detect synchronized firings. In spite of its seemingly wide acceptance, the validity of the <b>common</b> <b>input</b> notion remains unproven. I set out to evaluate the methods used to detect synchronization and derive an improved statistical approach to test rigorously the notion that <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> cause synchronization. More than, 1, 000, 000 firings from over 2, 100 motoneurons were decomposed from EMG signals collected during voluntary contractions ranging from 5 % to 50 % of the maximal force in two human muscles - a data set an order of magnitude greater than any reported in previous synchronization studies. Any errors that occurred during EMG decomposition were classified and mitigated using a newly derived error reduction algorithm. With improved estimates of the firing times, I developed a statistically-based method (SigMax) for detecting synchronized firings and compared it to three other commonly used techniques. SigMax revealed three types of errors produced by the previous methods that ignore proper statistical considerations necessary to detect synchronization. Using the error reduction and SigMax method, I designed two experiments to examine the possible physiological cause of motoneuron synchronization. The first experiment implemented a dual force-level contraction paradigm to test the <b>common</b> <b>input</b> notion. My analysis demonstrated that anatomically hard-wired <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> were not responsible for the changes in synchronization that occurred with changes in contraction force. Therefore, I implemented a second experimental protocol to ascertain factors other than <b>common</b> <b>inputs</b> that may cause synchronization. Results from a three- dimensional regression analysis of these data indicated that synchronization likely occurs as an epiphenomenon of the sensitivities of motoneuron firing rates to voluntary excitation...|$|R
