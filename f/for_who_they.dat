5|$|While {{the rest}} of the family gets used to their new home, Marge becomes homesick. Homer sneaks her back into Springfield one night under the {{disguise}} of Mr. Burns and Smithers, and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Marge is initially angry at the members of the mob, but she stuns them by saying that she does not want to live in Springfield or deal with them anymore, having found a place to live where she and her family can be accepted <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are and love each other without worry of hate and judgment from others. Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to The Outlands. Back in the Simpsons' new home, Bart discovers Lenny and Carl sneaking in. They tell the family they long to start a new life in The Outlands. Soon, Moe, Mayor Quimby, and many other Springfield residents show up, wishing to abandon their lives in Springfield and start over in The Outlands. Soon, all of Springfield moves there to start new lives with the Simpsons, and they begin rebuilding a new city which they name Springfield.|$|E

25|$|Dan {{then goes}} on to explain how the spirit of anger works. It covers your eyes, and distorts your vision.

Furthermore, it disturbs the mind so that the Lord departs from it and Beliar inhabits it.|$|E

25|$|Given the definition, {{once the}} child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in gender roles that their {{same-sex}} models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or androgyny, their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are and how they should behave.|$|E
25|$|While {{planning}} {{what to do}} next, Banzai and the Cavaliers are met by John Parker (Carl Lumbly), {{a messenger}} from John Emdall (Rosalind Cash), {{the leader of the}} alien Black Lectroids of Planet 10, currently in Earth's orbit. Emdall explains that they have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, but had managed to banish them to the eighth dimension. Lizardo's failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids' leader, John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo's mind and enable several dozen others to escape. Now that Banzai has perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids. Emdall had shocked Banzai previously to allow him to see the Lectroids <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are, and now tasks him with stopping Whorfin or otherwise the Black Lectroids will fake a nuclear explosion to start World War III that will annihilate the Earth and the Red Lectroids with it. The Cavaliers track down the Red Lectroids to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey, finding that their arrival in 1938 was told by Orson Welles' broadcast of The War of the Worlds until the Lectroids forced him to admit it was a work of fiction. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the eighth dimension under the pretense of a new United States Air Force bomber.|$|E

[...] The performance featured dance routines and dancers wearing torture bags over their heads with the words 'Freak' and 'Queen' printed on them. Bruna Nessif for E! Online described the performance as [...] "interesting," [...] and noted that the theme [...] "to celebrate everyone <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are" [...] was similar to the moral content presented on Gaga's album Born This Way (2011).

The concert, dubbed [...] "The Rage Factor", gave away all the tickets by free photo registration to prevent touting over the weekend of the February 13–14, followed by an online lottery on February 17.

500|$|... "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] {{explores the}} central theme of homosexuality, {{particularly}} through the gay characters Sparky and Big Gay Al, who {{would go on to}} play a more prominent role in the fifth season episode, [...] "Cripple Fight". The episode encourages tolerance of homosexuality, with protagonist Stan initially displaying anger and dismay upon learning that his dog is gay, but eventually learning to accept homosexuality and concluding that we should accept others <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are. Big Gay Al displays several exaggerated gay stereotypes, including his lisping voice and flamboyant wardrobe, which includes an ascot tie. Although some have described the depiction as inflammatory, other commentators have said the stereotypes are used as functions of satire. Nick Marx and Matt Sienkiewicz, PhD students in media and cultural studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, said in a 2009 journal article, [...] "These episodes function not {{as part of a larger}} discursive web, but as media texts encoded in a manner similar to that of The Simpsons".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the factory}} workers are not {{enthusiastic}} about the radical change in their product line. [...] Some of them, especially the intimidating Don, make Lola feel very unwelcome. Lola taunts him back, enlisting {{the help of the}} female factory workers to prove that Lola is closer to a woman's ideal man than Don ("What a Woman Wants"). Lola presents Don with a unique wager to see who is the better [...] "man": Lola will do any one thing that Don specifies if Don will do one thing that Lola specifies. Don's challenge is for Lola to fight him in a boxing match at the pub. Charlie, remembering Lola's background, is horrified. Lola easily scores against Don in the ring but ultimately lets Don win the match ("In This Corner"). Afterwards, in private, Don asks why she let him win, and Lola replies that she could not be so cruel as to humiliate Don in front of his mates. She gives him her part of the challenge: [...] "accept someone <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are." ...|$|E

Filipa Jodelka of The Guardian observed that [...] "David's family went on to pronounce him wicked and cast him out into darkness." [...] Writers kept the paternity of Kylie's baby a secret up until birth. On-screen the child, named Lily, has a paternity test taken {{in which it is}} revealed that David is her biological father. David then boasts about the result to Nick to cause further trouble. Producer Stuart Blackburn said that he used the story to [...] "push Kylie to the edge". It also created the opportunity for writers to revisit David's bad persona. He said the revelation damages their relationship but his team were keeping the possibility of the pair reuniting. Kylie is angry at herself and David. Blackburn explained [...] "in her head she's a screw-up, and she'll be furious with herself for imagining she could ever have a normal life. If there's hope for Kylie and David, they must accept each other <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> really are." ...|$|E

Immediately after [...] "Search Committee" [...] first aired, NBC posted Andy, Dwight and Darryl's resume on their official website and allowed fans to vote <b>for</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> believed should be the manager. Spader would later join the cast as CEO of Sabre in the eighth season while Tate is currently set to return {{in the second half of}} the eighth season as romantic interest for Robert California. In the eighth-season premiere, [...] "The List", Andy was revealed to be the new manager. Arnett was considered a high possibility to appear on the series, but could not due to his commitment to the NBC comedy series Up All Night. This also marks the eighth and final appearance of Kathy Bates as Jo Bennett, of whom later episodes in the eighth season would refer to Jo later stepping down from her position as Sabre CEO and hiring Robert California to replace her, and later dissolving the company entirely as chairman.|$|E
