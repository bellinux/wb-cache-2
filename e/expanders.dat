40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and dynamic performance are key factors to drives, which, however, will be deteriorated by air leakage between the air pockets and friction distributions to the pneumatic drives. This paper presents a novel magnetic scroll <b>expander,</b> aiming at improving the typical scroll <b>expander</b> performance and energy efficiency {{especially when the}} <b>expander</b> operates at low compressed air pressures. The mathematical model of the proposed magnetic scroll <b>expander</b> is developed. ANSYS Maxwell software is employed to analyse the generalised magnetic field strength and magnetic forces/torque. The development of a prototype of magnetic scroll <b>expander</b> is described.

25|$|Colloid {{solutions}} used in {{intravenous therapy}} {{belong to a}} major group of volume <b>expanders,</b> {{and can be used}} for intravenous fluid replacement. Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, and therefore, they should theoretically preferentially increase the intravascular volume, whereas other types of volume <b>expanders</b> called crystalloids also increase the interstitial volume and intracellular volume. However, there is still controversy to the actual difference in efficacy by this difference, and much of the research related to this use of colloids is based on fraudulent research by Joachim Boldt. Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study carried out on a prototype of a hermetic scroll <b>expander,</b> integrated into a gas cycle test rig, whose working fluid is HFC- 245 fa. This system was designed to test only the performance of the <b>expander.</b> It is mainly made up of a scroll compressor, a scroll <b>expander,</b> a heat exchanger and a by-pass valve. The latter is used to adjust the pressure ratio imposed to the <b>expander.</b> The <b>expander</b> is originally a compressor designed for heat pump applications and characterized by a nominal power input of 2. 5 kWe. Performance of the <b>expander</b> is evaluated in terms of isentropic effectiveness and filling factor as function of the main operating conditions. The study also investigates the impact of oil mass fraction on the <b>expander</b> performance. Maximum overall isentropic effectiveness of 71. 03 % is measured, which is partly explained by the good volumetric performance of the machine. Using the experimental data, parameters of a semi-empirical simulation model of the <b>expander</b> are identified. This model is used to analyze the measured performance of the <b>expander.</b> Finally, a polynomial empirical model of the <b>expander</b> is proposed for fast and robust simulations of ORC systems.

40|$|As {{emissions}} regulations {{become more}} stringent, automakers must improve fuel consumption in their vehicles to meet performance targets. An Organic Rankine Cycle is a technology with substantial fuel savings potential. As the power producing device in the system, the <b>expander</b> {{is a critical}} component with a large impact on overall cycle efficiency. The choice of <b>expander</b> type can significantlly affect system design choices. In order to decrease development time, a modeling tool which can evaluate the performance of various <b>expander</b> types is necessary to simulate <b>expander</b> performance {{without the need for}} costly prototyping and testing. This thesis will examine the development of a generic Matlab <b>expander</b> model which can replicate <b>expander</b> performance through a thermodynamic analysis. A modular approach to modeling allows for differentiation between <b>expander</b> types and sizes through modification of user defined modules. Thermal behaviour of the device is examined with an emphasis on heat transfer and its effect on <b>expander</b> performance.

25|$|Although optical devices {{also used}} for {{continuous}} light, like beam <b>expanders</b> and spatial filters, {{may be used for}} ultrashort pulses, several optical devices have been specifically designed for ultrashort pulses. One of them is the pulse compressor, a device {{that can be used to}} control the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses. It is composed of a sequence of prisms, or gratings. When properly adjusted it can alter the spectral phase φ(ω) of the input pulse so that the output pulse is a bandwidth-limited pulse with the shortest possible duration. A pulse shaper can be used to make more complicated alterations on both the phase and the amplitude of ultrashort pulses.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} supercritical organic Rankine cycle system driven by exhaust heat using 18 organic working fluids is presented. Several parameters, such as the net power output, exergy efficiency, <b>expander</b> size parameter (SP), and heat exchanger requirement of evaporator and the condenser, were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of this recovery cycle and screen the working fluids. The results reveal that in most cases, raising the <b>expander</b> inlet temperature is helpful to improve the net power output and the exergy efficiency. However, the effect of the <b>expander</b> inlet pressure on those parameters is related to the <b>expander</b> inlet temperature and working fluid used. Either lower <b>expander</b> inlet temperature and pressure, or higher <b>expander</b> inlet temperature and pressure, generally makes the net power output more. Lower <b>expander</b> inlet temperature results in larger total heat transfer requirement and <b>expander</b> size. According to the screening criteria of both the higher output and the lower investment, the following working fluids for the supercritical ORC system are recommended: R 152 a and R 143 a...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{combined}} power-cooling thermodynamic cycle, for {{use with}} low-temperature, sensible heat sources, is under experimental investigation. In this power-cooling cycle, absorption condensation is used to regenerate the working fluid. This allows the <b>expander</b> exhaust temperature to drop significantly below the temperature at which absorption is taking place. This is an obvious departure from pure working fluid, Rankine cycle operation and {{is the source of}} cooling. <b>Expander</b> exhaust temperatures are controlled by the cycle parameters of <b>expander</b> exit pressure (absorption pressure), <b>expander</b> isentropic efficiency, and the vapor properties (temperature, pressure, and concentration) at <b>expander</b> inlet.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to analyze}} micro-CHP units based on Rankine cycles. Two types of <b>expander</b> are considered: {{a small scale}} inward flow radial turbine and a volumetric scroll type <b>expander.</b> This latter, should allow to overcome the limitation imposed by a standard steam-turbine that arise when the required shaft-power is very low. Moreover, the scroll <b>expander</b> will also allow to easily treat wet steams, which must be avoided when considering a turbo-expander. The final aim is to deduce {{which one of the}} two types of <b>expander</b> is more suitable, with a specified target performance and the availability of a certain hot source. In order to define the thermodynamic expansion process, the analysis uses a onedimensional model of the radial turbine, previously developed by the authors, and of an estimation of the scroll <b>expander</b> efficiency. Also, the analysis is carried out for different working fluids, such as water, and two organic fluids, cyclohexane and toluene. Through the discussion of the results, for a specified set of constraints (e. g. <b>expander</b> inlet temperature, temperature of condensation, <b>expander</b> geometrical parameters) it is possible to deduce important indications on the most suitable <b>expander</b> for a given cycle layout...|$|R
