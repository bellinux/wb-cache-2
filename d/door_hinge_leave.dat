5000|$|A well-oiled <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> has {{one degree}} of freedom, so its energy {{landscape}} {{is a function}} [...] If the <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> isn't mounted perfectly, the door will naturally swing closed, open, or to some partially open angle when it is allowed to swing freely. These angles correspond to states of minimal energy of the system, or valleys in the energy landscape.|$|R

50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>hinges</b> {{were now}} {{concealed}} {{and the front}} <b>doors</b> now <b>hinged</b> at their leading edge. There was an independent heater for the rear passengers and demisting slots for the rear window. All features were standard, the provision of alternatives being believed to lead to an unsatisfactory compromise.|$|R

40|$|The {{preamble}} of {{the bachelor}} work describes {{the development of}} CAD systems and explains the basic concepts of this issue. Further the work is focused on technical documentation and outlines for the preparation of technical drawings. The work deals with {{the description of the}} formation of our two most famous computer programs - Autodesk Inventor and SolidWorks 3 D parametric modeller, on which this work is mainly focused. There are modelled two <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> from two different manufacturers in the practical part. Modelling is implemented in the SolidWorks 3 D parametric modeller, in which these <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> are created through the individual assemblies and parts...|$|R

2500|$|A [...] "suicide door" [...] is the slang {{term for}} an {{automobile}} <b>door</b> <b>hinged</b> at its rear rather than the front. Such doors were originally used on horse-drawn carriages, but are rarely found on modern vehicles, primarily because of safety concerns.|$|R

50|$|The box-bed {{is closed}} {{on all sides}} by panels of wood. One enters it by {{removing}} curtains, opening a <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> or sliding <b>doors</b> {{on one or two}} slides.The bed is placed on short legs to prevent moisture due to a dirt floor.|$|R
5000|$|Doors - Due to {{the added}} {{weight of the}} {{transparent}} and opaque armor in the <b>doors,</b> the <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> are reinforced using a proprietary system designed by the company to completely avoid hinge failure and prevent sheet metal fatigue around the hinge system.|$|R
5000|$|Wood framed screen <b>doors,</b> <b>hinged</b> and sliding, {{are also}} {{available}} from limited production and custom carpentry sources, used for aesthetic style and sustainable building applications. Wood-framed screen doors were a fixture of many homes in the American South before air conditioning was common.|$|R
50|$|Curling is a {{sheet metal}} forming process used to form the edges into a hollow ring. Curling can be {{performed}} to eliminate sharp edges and increase the moment of inertia near the curled end. Other parts are curled to perform their primary function, such as <b>door</b> <b>hinges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later {{the rear}} {{part of the}} body was widened so that both the rear fenders and <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> were {{embedded}} into the bodywork itself. The air now flowed through transverse inlets, which were raised above the rear of the rounded roof. The trailing edge was also raised.|$|R
50|$|First model {{change from}} {{previous}} generation saw minor improvements, to include {{installation of the}} front <b>door</b> <b>hinges</b> to a conventional implementation {{as opposed to the}} rear-hinged door. The design was boxier over all, with a more wedgy appearance. This generation was also offered as an all-electric truck and van.|$|R
50|$|The CX {{eventually}} {{acquired a}} reputation for high running costs, which over time cut sales. Ironically, it was the components standard to any automobile (steel, <b>door</b> <b>hinges,</b> starter motors, electrical connections, etc.) that proved troublesome in service, not the advanced components. The quality of construction improved too slowly to eliminate this perception.|$|R

50|$|Over the years, the use {{of these}} {{buildings}} has changed considerably, however, in most instances, these changes do not affect the exterior of the structure.
