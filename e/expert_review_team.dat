40|$|Verification of gas {{emissions}} faces particular problems of uncertainty, {{because of their}} intangibility, the variety of factors that influence them, and continuing disagreements on the monitoring methodologies. Verification under the UNFCCC aims to test compliance with the binding GHG emissions reduction targets identified in the Kyoto Protocol. The paper describes the verification system, which is managed by an international secretariat but based on national reporting. The Protocol has only recently come into force, making the effectiveness {{of some of the}} verification tools difficult to assess, although experience has been gained from gradual improvements made since the Treaty was first developed. The system has some innovative features (for example, <b>Expert</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Teams,</b> Designated Operational Entities, and a complex compliance methodology), and these may be of wider relevance in verification systems design. POLICY CONCLUSIONS i. Verification of highly technical matters such as greenhouse gas reductions is a challenging area which must accommodate competing pressures; decentralisation of reporting responds to a political expedient (national sovereignty) but rapidly comes up against major capacity constraints (the lack of qualified technical personnel, particularly for Parties in the South). Financial incentives and technical support may be required to address these constraints, and the UNFCCC offers an interesting approach in these areas, though the investments are considerable...|$|R

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol is {{remarkable}} among global multilateral environmental agreements for {{its efforts to}} depoliticize compliance. However, attempts to create autonomous, arm’s length and rule-based compliance processes with extensive reliance on putatively neutral experts were only partially realized in practice in the first commitment period from 2008 to 2012. In particular, the procedurally constrained facilitative powers vested in the Facilitative Branch were circumvented, and <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> <b>teams</b> (ERTs) assumed pivotal roles in compliance facilitation. The ad hoc diplomatic and facilitative practices engaged in by these small teams of technical experts {{raise questions about the}} reliability and consistency of the compliance process. For the future operation of the Kyoto compliance system, it is suggested that ERTs should be confined to more technical and procedural roles, in line with their expertise. There would then be greater scope for the Facilitative Branch to assume a more comprehensive facilitative role, safeguarded by due process guarantees, in accordance with its mandate. However, if – as appears likely – the future compliance trajectories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will include a significant role for ERTs without oversight by the Compliance Committee, it is important to develop appropriate procedural safeguards that reflect and shape the various technical and political roles these teams currently play...|$|R

While none of the findings are new, the study underlines the importance of continued emphasis on sound project management techniques: a clean project management structure with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities across the various partners in a project, an understanding of institutional standards and procedures and any differences among the partners, and the critical need for a comprehensive IMS {{that can be used}} easily and routinely to identify potential threats to the critical path. The study also highlights the continuing need for realistic estimates of the total LCC. Sufficient time and resources must be allocated early in a project to ensure that the appropriate trade studies and analyses are performed across all aspects of a mission: spacecraft, ground system, operations concept, and fault management, to ensure that proposed and confirmed costs truly reflect the resource requirements over the entire mission life cycle. These studies need to include a realistic review of the assumptions underlying the use of new technologies, the integration of heritage and new hardware and software into the total mission environment, and any development and test savings based on heritage technology and lessons learned.

40|$|The {{submission}} of annual national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories {{is a requirement}} under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. These national GHG inventories should be transparent, consistent, comparable, complete and accurate. The application of these principles allows for more reliable data on GHG inventories and GHG emission trends, which are to be provided to the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. The review of the inventory submissions from different Parties indicates varying levels of adherence to these principles, though {{the quality of the}} national inventories has been continuously improving {{as a result of the}} experience gained by national experts in preparing inventories, the refinements of the methodological and reporting guidelines provided to Parties, and the results of the intensive review activities that took place in the period 2000 - 2002, coordinated and supported by the UNFCCC secretariat. The paper describes improvements in national GHG inventories in adhering to the principles of transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness and accuracy achieved during the period 2000 - 2002.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} a {{theoretical}} debate as to which retrospective record review method is the most valid, reliable, cost efficient and feasible for detecting adverse events. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the feasibility and capability of two common retrospective record review methods, the "Harvard Medical Practice Study" method and the "Global Trigger Tool" in detecting adverse events in adult orthopaedic inpatients. METHODS: We performed a three-stage structured retrospective record review process in a random sample of 350 orthopaedic admissions during 2009 at a Swedish university hospital. Two teams comprised each of a registered nurse and two physicians were assigned, one to each method. All records were primarily reviewed by registered nurses. Records containing a potential adverse event were forwarded to physicians for review in stage 2. Physicians made an independent review regarding, for example, healthcare causation, preventability and severity. In the third review stage all adverse events that were found with the two methods together were compared and all discrepancies after review stage 2 were analysed. Events that had not been identified by one of the methods in the first two review stages were reviewed by the respective physicians. RESULTS: Altogether, 160 different adverse events were identified in 105 (30. 0 %) of the 350 records with both methods combined. The "Harvard Medical Practice Study" method identified 155 of the 160 (96. 9 %, 95 % CI: 92. 9 - 99. 0) adverse events in 104 (29. 7 %) records compared with 137 (85. 6 %, 95 % CI: 79. 2 - 90. 7) adverse events in 98 (28. 0 %) records using the "Global Trigger Tool". Adverse events "causing harm without permanent disability" accounted for most of the observed difference. The overall positive predictive value for criteria and triggers using the "Harvard Medical Practice Study" method and the "Global Trigger Tool" was 40. 3 % and 30. 4 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: More adverse events were identified using the "Harvard Medical Practice Study" method than using the "Global Trigger Tool". Differences in review methodology, perception of less severe adverse events and context knowledge may explain the observed difference between two <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> <b>teams</b> in the detection of adverse events...|$|R

40|$|Programs and {{initiatives}} {{have been created}} to empower, educate, and provide information to consumers; these are sometimes generically known as self-management interventions. Evaluating and comparing such programs has been a challenge, as many skills that consumers believe are important to manage and participate in their individual healthcare are not currently captured by existing tools. The objective of the Effective Musculoskeletal Consumer Project {{is to develop a}} scale to measure an effective consumer. A review of the literature, interviews, workshops, and preliminary surveys at OMERACT 7 (May 2005) were conducted in the first phases of the Project. A questionnaire consisting of 64 items was developed to measure the skills and attributes of an effective musculoskeletal (MSK) consumer. Content experts on our team reduced this scale to 48 items, which was pilot-tested with consumers from Canada and Australia. Dimensionality assessment showed that the scale was unidimensional. Classical and item response theory analyses showed that the 48 -item scale had quite high reliability, but that 2 items were very poor. Based on the item analysis, 35 items were retained. The revised scale was presented at OMERACT 8, where a panel reviewed the scale and provided input. This input and another <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> by our <b>team</b> was used to further refine the Effective Consumer Scale to 17 items.
