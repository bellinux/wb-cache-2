5000|$|The main {{opposition}} to the drift hypothesis is the social causation thesis, which says social class position is causally related to the probability of mental illness. John W.

These studies he looked at supported the drift hypothesis, but when he examined them, he found their conclusions were [...] "based on assumptions and methods that lacked empirical support." [...] Another statement in Fox's study was, in studies done on social class and mental illness, [...] "identify drift as an individual's downward <b>intergenerational</b> <b>social</b> <b>mobility</b> after the onset of mental illness, rather than as residential drift from higher to lower class status areas".

We find that the reform resulted in a substantial narrowing of the gap in educational attainment between different social origin groups.

30|$|While some {{children}} of immigrants experience <b>intergenerational</b> upward <b>social</b> <b>mobility,</b> others do not. This paper explores the impact of parental and family involvement on offspring trajectories by contrasting families whose children experienced a highly mobile path, achieving tertiary education, against families whose children experienced low or no educational mobility. Focusing on within-group differences, the qualitative study analyses interviews conducted with twenty young persons and one of their parents in Kosovar families in Zurich, Switzerland, in 2013. Findings from our dyadic data reveal that educational outcomes are not only associated with parental educational attainment {{in the country of}} origin but also with professional mobility in the country of destination. This association is mediated by parenting styles, involvement and practices. While all parents show an important emotional involvement in their children’s educational trajectory, significant within-group differences in the Albanian-speaking group appear with respect to their parenting styles, parental school involvement and resource mobilisation. We show that educational success is associated with an authoritative parenting style practised by parents of different educational background. By contrast, lack of educational success is common in families where parents cannot provide secure guidance to their children, whatever their previous educational achievement.|$|R

ABSTRACT: The thesis, in which the view through the sociological prism is enhanced by the lens of psychology, theoretically and empirically examines non-cognitive personality traits and characteristics ('Big Five', Self-esteem, Locus of Control, Willpower), {{within the context of the}} social and psychological aspects of attaining social status (influences by one's family, peers and teachers, and others), with a specific focus on intergenerational upward mobility and the identification of its sources. Research for this paper was designed as a combination of (primarily) representative questionnaire surveys among the adult population in the Czech Republic, and qualitative interviews with selected individuals who have shown intergenerational upward mobility. The results show that, aside from cognitive skills, the statistically less relevant and hitherto somewhat neglected non-cognitive traits and characteristics of individuals do play a role in the process of attaining social status.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that across three British birth cohorts, relative rates of <b>intergenerational</b> <b>social</b> class <b>mobility</b> have remained at an essentially constant level among men and also among women who have worked only full-time.

We develop a parsimonious model for the log odds ratios which express the associations between individuals’ class origins and destinations. This model is derived from a topological model that comprises three kinds of readily interpretable binary characteristics and eight effects in all, each of which does, or does not, apply to particular cells of the mobility table: i. e. effects of class hierarchy, class inheritance and status affinity. Results show that the pattern as well as the level of social fluidity is essentially unchanged across the cohorts; that gender differences in this prevailing pattern are limited; and that marked differences in the degree of inequality in relative mobility chances arise with long-range transitions where inheritance effects are reinforced by hierarchy effects that are not offset by status affinity effects...|$|R

On the basis of unique longitudinal interview and register data from Sweden, this study analyses the roles played by parental upward mobility and parental levels of education in downward mobility. Elements from cultural capital theory (CCT) are investigated as possible mechanisms for explaining the relationship between independent and dependent factors. Whereas the study fails to find support for the role of parental mobility, the parents' level of education {{turns out to be a}} powerful predictor of downward mobility. And whereas the measure of cultural capital presents a weak or non-existent relationship with the dependent variable, two attitudinal variables, employed as indicators of habitus and a possible don Quixote effect, do present a significant relationship with the risk for downward mobility. However, while the study hypothesized these attitudes to be mediating mechanisms that might explain the relationship between parental educational level and downward mobility, in the multivariate analyses the attitudinal measures instead turn out to have an independent effect in addition to the parental level of education.

40|$|According to {{the health}} {{selection}} hypothesis, poor mental health and behavioural problems in adolescence limit socioeconomic attainment. But {{to what extent is}} health selection driven by prior social causation? This paper quantifies the extent to which health selection - here, restricted or downward <b>intergenerational</b> <b>social</b> class <b>mobility</b> due to poor mental health or behavioural problems - {{can be attributed to the}} influence of modifiable childhood risk factors. The UK National Child Development Study provides measures of socioeconomic deprivation and childhood adversities, as well as multiple-informant ratings of adolescents' mental health and behavioural problems, for which confirmatory factor analysis supports a three-factor model. Decomposition analysis is used to robustly assess the extent of attenuation of selection effects when conditioning on the childhood environment. Conduct problems, hyperactivity, and to a lesser extent emotional symptoms at age 16 are associated with individuals' chances of achieving (un) desirable mobility outcomes. When prior childhood risk factors are taken into account, the association of conduct problems with mobility is attenuated by around 50 %, indicating a substantial role for confounding and earlier processes of social causation in the generation of this health selection effect. Further analyses indicate that this attenuation is greater for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and is mostly driven by the inclusion of indicators of generalised disadvantage such as crowded housing and low income. On the other hand, the effects of emotional symptoms and hyperactivity on mobility outcomes are not significantly accounted for by childhood risk factors.

We provide an indepth study of data collected from the marriage registrations acts. These documents provide us information on the spouses, but also on their parents and the witnesses.

Since we collected all acts for married men with a name beginning with letter B, we have also in our dataset the act for the marriage of the father when he get himself also married in Geneva. This led us to split our population into those who have a father married in Geneva and those who have not.
