5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems <b>has</b> <b>all</b> but disappeared, while a fascination with the curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E
