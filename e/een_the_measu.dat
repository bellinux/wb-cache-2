Its design emphasizes (i) large-scale infrastructures composed from diversely-administered hosts, rather than infrastructures {{controlled by a}} single entity, and (ii) facilitating diverse types of measurements by diverse parties, {{some of whom are}} allowed richer access to certain portions of the infrastructure than others. We discuss our experiences with developing and operating the infrastructure to date: problems we have encountered, both foreseen and unanticipated, mistakes we made, and how we have adapted the design to address these. We also explore two key issues for developing a large-scale, extensible infrastructure: the problem of securely updating software on the measurement platforms, and the problem of constraining the resources consumed by different measurements. We argue that both of these can be unified in terms of controlling the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>measu</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new measure for network {{performance}} evaluation called topology lifetime. The measure provides insight into {{which one of}} a set of topologies is likely to last the longest before more capacity must be installed. The lifetime measure is not single valued, but considers growth as a function {{of a set of}} demand shifts (perturbation). One network may be better able to support a uniform growth in the traffic, while another may support more growth when unexpected shifts in the load occur. The ability of a network to support unexpected changes in load is becoming more important because of (1) current practices for installing fiber optics cables, (2) recent advances in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), and (3) the increasing popularity of the Internet. The lifetime measure is applied to several topologies; a dual ring, a chordal ring, a Manhattan Street network and an hierarchical network.

This {{study was conducted to}} assess the safety and efficacy of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) for percutaneously undrainable abscesses in CD. Methods. A consecutive cohort of 83 CD patients with percutaneously undrainable abdominal abscesses between January 2011 and June 2015 was retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into <b>the</b> <b>EEN</b> group and <b>the</b> non-EEN group. Results. The cumulative surgical rate was significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>EEN</b> group than in the non-EEN group (P= 0. 001). Fifteen percent patients treated with EEN avoided surgery. EEN (P= 0. 002) was associated with a decreased need for surgery. Previous abdominal surgery (P= 0. 009) and abscess diameter[*]>[*] 3 [*]cm (P= 0. 022) were associated with an increased need for operation. <b>EEN</b> increased <b>the</b> albumin level, while decreased ESR and CRP significantly for patients requiring surgery. The risk of postoperative intra-abdominal septic complications (P= 0. 036) was significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>EEN</b> group compared with the non-EEN group. Conclusions. EEN is feasible in CD patients presenting with percutaneously undrainable abdominal abscesses.
