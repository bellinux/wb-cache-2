500|$|Ponsford {{broke into}} {{international}} cricket in the 1924–25 season. After scoring 166 for Victoria against South Australia, and 81 for an Australian XI against the touring English team, {{he was selected}} for the first Test against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Batting at number three, Ponsford joined his captain Herbie Collins at the wicket after the dismissal of opening batsman Warren Bardsley. Although Ponsford initially struggled against the [...] "baffling" [...] swing bowling of Maurice Tate, the experienced Collins was confident enough to farm the strike during Tate's initial spell [...] and Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on his Test debut. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] until I was settled in. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] He scored 128 in the second Test at Melbourne; thereby becoming the first batsman to score centuries {{in his first two}} Tests. Ponsford played in all five Tests of the series, scoring 468runs at an average of 46.80.|$|E
500|$|The next {{international}} {{visitors to}} Australia were the English team of 1924–1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting {{with a young}} Victorian in his début Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on début. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] until I was settled in. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, Collins said to his profligate leg spinner, [...] "You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving {{a gap in the}} offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking to hit it into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154.|$|E
