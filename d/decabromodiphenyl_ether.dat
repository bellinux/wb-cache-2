40|$|In this study, we {{assess the}} {{applicability}} of different analytical techniques, namely, direct probe (DP), gas chromatography (GC), and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) with a high resolution (HR) -time-of-flight (TOF) -mass spectrometry (MS) {{for the analysis of}} flame retardants and plasticizers in electronic waste and car interiors. APCI-HRTOFMS is a combination scarcely exploited yet with GC or with a direct probe for screening purposes and {{to the best of our}} knowledge, never with GC × GC to provide comprehensive information. Because of the increasing number of flame retardants and questions about their environmental fate, there is a need for the development of wider target and untargeted screening techniques to assess human exposure to these compounds. With the use of the APCI source, we took the advantage of using a soft ionization technique that provides mainly molecular ions, in addition to the accuracy of HRMS for identification. The direct probe provided a very easy and inexpensive method for the identification of flame retardants without any sample preparation. This technique seems extremely useful for the screening of solid materials such as electrical devices, electronics and other waste. GC-APCI-HRTOF-MS appeared to be more sensitive compared to liquid chromatography (LC) -APCI/atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) -HRTOF-MS for a wider range of flame retardants with absolute detection limits in the range of 0. 5 - 25 pg.

The largest applications are in electrical parts, with smaller usage in automotive and textiles. A polycyclic chlorohydrocarbon, DECHLORANE PLUS, is employed in low smoke formulations. <b>Decabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> has major use in polyamide 6. Alternative brominated additives include decabromodiphenylethane, polybrominated phenylindane, polymeric dibromophenylene oxide, polybrominated polystyrene and oligomeric glycidyl ethers of tetrabromobisphenol A, and polypentabromobenzyl acrylate. In non-reinforced polyamide 6, melamine cyanurate is effective. With glass reinforcements, some melamine pyro- or polyphosphates are useful. Polyamide 6 can be flame retarded with high loadings of magnesium hydroxide. Stabilized and coated red phosphorus is used in Europe and the Far East.

40|$|Halogen-containing aromatics, mainly bromine-containing phenols, are harmful {{compounds}} contaminating {{pyrolysis oil}} from electronic boards containing halogenated flame retardants. In addition, theirformation increases {{the potential for}} evolution of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) and dibenzofurans (PBDFs) at relatively low temperature (up to 500 °C). As a model compound, 2, 4 -dibromophenol (DBP) was pyrolyzed at 290 - 450 °C. While its pyrolysis in a nitrogen flow reactor or in encapsulated ampules yields bromine-containing phenols, phenoxyphenols, PBDDs, and PBDFs, pyrolysis of DBP in a hydrogen-donating medium of polypropylene (PP) at 290 - 350 °C mainly results {{in the formation of}} phenol and HBr, indicating the occurrence of a facile hydrodebromination of DBP. The hydrodebromination efficiency depends on temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the initial components. This thermal behavior of DBP is compared to that of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and <b>decabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether.</b> A treatment of halogen-containing aromatics with PP offers a new perspective on the development of low-environmental-impact disposal processes for electronic scrap...|$|E
40|$|<b>Decabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> (BDE 209) was {{of great}} concern due to its {{biotransformation}} in different organisms. However, most studies devoted to the metabolic intermediates of BDE 209, less {{has been done on}} the metabolic pathways in vivo, especially on the relationships among debrominated-BDEs, OH-BDEs and MeO-BDEs. In this study, the metabolic pathways and intermediates of BDE 209 in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were investigated, and the time-dependent transformations of the metabolites were also examined. The primary debrominated metabolites were BDE 47, 49, 99, 197, 207; the main MeO-BDEs were MeO-BDE 47, MeO-BDE 68 and MeO-BDE 100; OH-BDEs were primarily composed of OH-BDE 28 and OH-BDE 42. From the time-dependent and dose-effect relationships, the debromination should be followed by hydroxylation, and then by methoxylation. The increasing in body burden of MeO-BDEs corresponded to the decreasing of OH-BDEs, which could indirectly prove the inter-conversion between OH-BDEs and MeO-BDEs. This study would motivate the future research of toxicological mechanisms of BDEs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
