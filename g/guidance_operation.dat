40|$|In {{the combat}} {{scenario}} where the infrared missile {{is an almost}} continuous threat during the operation, fighter aircraft are currently quite susceptible to being killed in attacks by infrared missiles. Theoretical analysis applied to an encounter simulation {{seems to indicate that}} it is possible to use the infrared Active Jammer and the expendable decoy (flare) to defeat the infrared missile (spin-scan and con-scan seekers). The theoretical analysis of a simplified case of a spin-scan and con-scan reticle with amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and phase modulation leads to expressions for the targets' positions, as seen by the missile seeker, under no-jamming condition. The signal waveforms consist of target radiation power failing on the reticle and the reticle modulation function. We apply signal processing techniques to the modulated signal to determine the tracking error rate under no-jamming, active jamming and flare jamming different conditions, and by comparing with the unjammed tracking error rate, to determine the differences and effectiveness of jamming. The analytical result is simulated by means of a simulation program (MATLAB), which evaluates the change in the missile LOS (line of sight) rotation rate and the impact on the missile <b>guidance</b> <b>operation.</b> The analysis indicated successful jamming in the different jamming source situations. Following the jamming analysis, one can use the result to do further operational analysis as in OT&E (operation test and evaluation) and to evaluate the operational effectiveness of the jammers and to develop operational tactics to further increase the survivability of the fighter aircraft in the combat situation.

40|$|There {{are good}} reasons to expect {{that the process of}} European {{integration}} might bring about a renaissance of comparative law and private international law, the two disciplines, in which Herbert Bernstein had excelled in the New and the Old World. To be sure, Europe’s legal systems must respond to processes of economic and political integration. It seems nevertheless quite unrealistic to expect from the European Union any comprehensive harmonisation of private law. Europe’s systems of private law are deeply entwined in the economic and political histories of the polities which they order and to which they owe their legitimacy. Europe’s identity is defined by the diversity of its legal heritage. Should not deepened comparative studies prepare and accompany the search for a Europeanised private law system; and is it not the very vocation of private international law to organise constructive responses to legal diversity? Pertinent efforts have been undertaken and are under way. And yet, the Europeanisation process, so this essay argues, follows a logic of its own, which none of our inherited legal disciplines seems able to cope with. Three difficulties will be discussed. One is inherent in very general developments of "post-classical private law, in particular its linkages with regulatory and distributive policies opening to social values human rights. Comparative law has often furthered, international adapted this (in Germany) so-called materialisation process. Europeanisation, however, adds challenging new dimensions. They are inherent the multi-level structures of European polity hence inevitable. interventions into general (the codified systems continental Europe common UK) have so far been quite marginal.

Little more {{is known about the}} nature of this object, but in mid- 2013 it will pass near the Earth, affording an exceptional opportunity for ground-based characterization. At this apparition 2002 GT will be in range of Arecibo. In addition to Doppler measurements, radar delay observations with precisions of a few microseconds are expected and {{have a good chance of}} revealing whether the system is binary or not. The asteroid will be brighter than 16 th mag., which will facilitate a host of observations at a variety of wavelengths. Light curve measurements across a wide range of viewing perspectives will reveal the rotation rate and ultimately lead to strong constraints on the shape and pole orientation. Visible and infrared spectra will constrain the mineralogy, taxonomy, albedo and size. Along with the radar observations, optical astrometry will further constrain the orbit, both to facilitate terminal <b>guidance</b> <b>operations</b> and to potentially reveal nongravitational forces acting on the asteroid.
