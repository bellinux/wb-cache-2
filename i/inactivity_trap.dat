50|$|The various {{measures}} that had implemented to fight social exclusion -in particular the income support allowance (RMI), the single parent allowance (API) and the allocation disabled adult (AAH)- were criticized for favoring unemployment and working poverty, exclusion and precariousness. Indeed, the government claimed the gains from return to work, {{after a period}} of unemployment, were offset by the reduction of social benefits paid in the previous period. That led to threshold effects and to <b>inactivity</b> <b>trap</b> situations. The National Observatory of Poverty and social exclusion said that the number of excluded people was deteriorating, while the number of working poor's was increasing (1.7 million in 2005).|$|E

40|$|Until the {{introduction}} of the RSA (Revenu de solidarité active -i. e. Active Solidarity Income) on 1 st June 2009 in metropolitan France and 1 st January 2011 in overseas territories, poor single-parent families were entitled either to the RMI (Revenu minimum d'insertion – i. e. Minimum Income Integration) or to the API (Allocation de parent isolé – i. e. Lone Parent Benefit). By merging these two benefits, the government gives up the logic of specific policy for low-income single parents with young children. To assess the empirical relevance of <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps</b> that single parents living on transfer income face, we used data from the DREES survey covering a sample of the RMI or API recipients. The survey was conducted in May-June 2008 when the rSa was tested in some areas. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the study population in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, earlier career paths and career paths during the observation period (October 2007 -May 2008). We also show that the probability of access to employment is highly dependent on individual characteristics (age, educational level, health status, having two or more children and having experienced long inactivity periods). Family responsibilities, lack of qualifications and health or transportation problems are the main barriers to get a stable and good job. rSa (Active Solidarity Income), lone parents, minimum incomes, <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps,</b> in-work benefits, activation policies. ...|$|R

40|$|The RSA follows two objectives: to {{increase}} the living standard of the working poor and to eliminate <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps</b> that result from low financial incentives to work. Because of its familialized nature, the RSA targets relatively well the poorest workers but also creates ambiguous effects in terms of financial incentives. We estimate the redistributive and incentive effects by microsimulation. We find that 65 % of ?RSA activity? benefits are perceived by households {{in the first two}} deciles of living standards; nearly 400   000 individuals could surpass the poverty threshold. We also consider the impact of RSA activity on the labour supply of women: participation would be reduced by 12   000. In conclusion, we consider ways to reform the RSA.

The cases of the Netherlands and Finland, two countries that have succeeded in reversing the early exit trend in recent years, prove that only a radical change in paradigms that govern social protection may turn the vicious circle of welfare without work for aging workers into a virtuous circle of active aging.

40|$|With high unemployment, low {{participation}} of specific {{groups such as}} the low-skilled and those nearing retirement age, and relatively low average hours worked, France is far from using its full labour potential. Improving the labour market situation would not only increase living standards and growth potential but also reduce social exclusion and ease pressures on public spending. This paper analyses various characteristics of the French labour market that may explain the low utilisation of labour potential. It puts forward the need for a comprehensive reform of the labour market aiming at: i) shifting the burden of social protection in the labour market away from employers towards the state by reducing and streamlining employment protection legislation; ii) removing incentives that lead to early withdrawal from the labour market; iii) allowing employers and employees more freedom to negotiate working hours; and iv) improving efficiency in job placement services. employment protection legislation, France, labour costs, minimum wage, <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps,</b> working time reduction, wage bargaining, public employment services...|$|R

In this paper we use a sample of administrative data from the “Datawarehouse labour market and social protection” and the microsimulation model MIMOSIS to assess the labour supply effects of this reform proposal.

Subsequently we model the proposed reform in the tax and benefit rules and predict the change in desired labour supply of the targeted group.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, EU {{institutions}} have been increasingly concerned with the issues of unemployment reduction and job creation. The EU has recommended that member states develop welfare systems that moderate {{the negative effects of}} market relationships on the one hand, and enhance the efficiency of market performance on the other. This paper provides an overview of labour market policies to protect individuals from unemployment. It shows that in the context of EMU and EU enlargement, policies such as unemployment insurance could improve welfare, {{to the extent that it}} encourages labour mobility, but has negative effects on individuals’ job search efforts. To counter welfare and <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps,</b> member state governments are asked to reform benefit and tax systems towards more employment-friendly policies. Further, the effect of population ageing on the labour force is considered, along with options to sustain labour force supply and state pension provision. The paper concludes that measures to expand the range and quality of employment opportunities available to older workers will become increasingly important and that governments will have an important educational and coordinating role to play in facilitating these adjustments. ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{assistance}} and <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps</b> {{have long been}} considered amongst the main causes of the poor employment performance of EU countries. The success of New Labour has triggered a growing interest in instruments capable of combining the promotion of responsibility and self-sufficiency with solidarity with less skilled workers. Making-work-pay (MWP) policies, consisting of transfers to households with low earning capacity, have quickly emerged as the most politically acceptable instruments in tax-benefit reforms of many Anglo Saxon countries. This chapter explores the impact of introducing the British Working Families' Tax Credit in three EU countries with rather different labor market and welfare institutions: Finland, France and Germany. Simulating the reform reveals that, while first round effects on income distribution is considerable, {{the interaction of the}} new instrument with the structural characteristics of the economy and the population may lead to counterproductive second round effects (i. e. changes in economic behavior). The implementation of the reform, in this case, could only be justified if the social inclusion (i. e. transition into activity) of some specific household types (singles and single mothers) is valued more than a rise in the employment per se...|$|R
40|$|Generous social {{assistance}} {{has been held}} responsible for <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps</b> and social exclusion in several European countries, hence the recent trend of promoting employment through in-work transfers. Yet, the relative consensus {{on the need for}} 'making work pay' policies is muddied by a number of concerns relative to the design of the reforms and the treatment of the family dimension. Relying on EUROMOD, a EU- 15 integrated tax-benefit microsimulation software, we simulate two types of in-work benefits. The first one is means-tested on family income, in the fashion of the British Working Family Tax Credit, while the second is a purely individualized policy. Both reforms are built on the same cost basis (after behavioral responses) and simulated in three European countries suspected to experience large poverty traps, namely Finland, France and Germany. The potential labor supply responses to the reforms and the subsequent redistributive impacts are assessed for each country using a structural discrete-choice model. We compare how both reforms achieve poverty reduction and social inclusion (measured as the number of transitions into activity). All three countries present different initial conditions, including existing tax-benefit systems and distribution of incomes and wages. These sources of heterogeneity are exploited together with different labor supply elasticities to explain the cross-country differences in the impact of the reforms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{transitions}} of social assistance beneficiaries to employment in Croatia. Data was sourced from the social welfare register for 208 persons from the 2015 cohort of new, unemployed social assistance recipients in one Centre for Social Welfare, their outcomes tracked until June 2017. About {{a quarter of the}} recipients became employed within one year, in most cases with wages slightly higher than the statutory minimum. Out of them, about a quarter relapsed into social assistance status within a year. Following the World Bank Employment Barriers approach, we examine whether outcomes are associated with disincentives to work (<b>inactivity</b> <b>trap),</b> lack of work-related capabilities, or gendered engagement with in-household work. We found the average participation tax rate (PTR) for recipients to stand at 57 %, yet no effect of PTR, benefit level, debt or PTR level on transition to employment was identified. With respect to capabilities, the role of human capital (vocational in particular), work experience and age turned out to be consistent with prior research. Substitution of inhouse work is consistent with the finding that women are less likely to get employed if living in a household with dependents...|$|E
40|$|Since 1995, French governments {{implemented}} a specific strategy aiming at lowering unemployment or inactivity of so called unskilled workers, in fact of low wage workers. This strategy used two tools: cuts in employers' social contributions reduce companies' costs for hiring low-wage workers; the Prime Pour l'Emploi, PPE, raises low-wage workers' incomes, {{and increases the}} gap between wage and assistance benefits {{in order to increase}} incentives for low-wage workers to take a job. The paper provides a description of the situation of unskilled workers in France. It describes the history of measures lowering employers' contributions on low wages, presents and discusses the studies that have tried {{to assess the impact of}} such measures on employment. These cuts cost approximately 18 billion euros in 2007. An average estimate of about 550, 000 jobs created would have an ex post cost of 9 billion euro, i. e. 176, 000 euros per created job.

40|$|This paper aims at build a {{multiple}} matching model, {{in which the}} decision of activity on the labour market is endogeneous. Most of works on the labour market concern the only demand side. The policies applied {{on this side of}} the labour market do not consider the supply side as endogeneous. Thus, no policy can be explorated to improve the labour market situation. The supply policies seem to be the new way of action of the different governments among the European Union. In particular, in France, a policy which increases the level of earned incomes on the low wages is led since 2002, as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the United States. This principle, called "Prime Pour l'Emploi" (PPE), is supposed to incite unskilled unemployed to take a job. In this paper, I explain that, with an endogeneous activity choice, such policies may have ambiguous effects on unemployment and social accounts. Indeed, new unemployed workers are attracted on the effective labour market by these job-taking incentives. The unemployement duration increase and the consequences on the social accounts are not obvious. Furthermore, <b>inactivity</b> <b>traps</b> phenomena can appear. I modelize the effects of an alternative policy: tax cuts on low wage associated with minimum wage increase. I show that it improves employment and production at a lower cost for the government.
