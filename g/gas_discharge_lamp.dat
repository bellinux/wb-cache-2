5000|$|In photography, and {{particularly}} in digital photography, purple fringing (sometimes called PF) is the term for an out-of-focus purple or magenta [...] "ghost" [...] image on a photograph.

5000|$|The bulb's [...] "turn on" [...] voltage Vb {{is higher}} than its [...] "turn off" [...] voltage Ve. This property, called hysteresis, allows the bulb to {{function}} as an oscillator.

50|$|In <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps,</b> such as flashlamps, {{current density}} plays an {{important}} role in the output spectrum produced. Low current densities produce spectral line emission and tend to favour longer wavelengths. High current densities produce continuum emission and tend to favour shorter wavelengths. Low current densities for flash lamps are generally around 10 A∙mm−2. High current densities can be more than 40 A∙mm−2.|$|R

Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|R
2500|$|Atoms emit {{and absorb}} light at {{characteristic}} energies. This produces [...] "emission lines" [...] in {{the spectrum of}} each atom. Emission can be spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> (such as neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself—so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light).

50|$|A corona {{discharge}} is an electrical discharge {{brought on by}} the ionization of a fluid such as air surrounding a conductor that is electrically charged. Spontaneous {{corona discharge}}s occur naturally in high-voltage systems unless care is taken to limit the electric field strength. A corona will occur when the strength (potential gradient) of the electric field around a conductor is high enough to form a conductive region, but not high enough to cause electrical breakdown or arcing to nearby objects. It is often seen as a bluish (or other color) glow in the air adjacent to pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages, and emits light by the same property as a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{neon lamp}} (also neon glow lamp) is a {{miniature}} <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> The lamp typically {{consists of a}} small glass capsule that contains a mixture of neon and other gases at a low pressure and two electrodes (an anode and a cathode). When sufficient voltage is applied and sufficient current is supplied between the electrodes, the lamp produces an orange glow discharge. The glowing portion in the lamp is a thin region near the cathode; the larger and much longer neon signs are also glow discharges, but they use the [...] which is not present in the ordinary neon lamp. Neon glow lamps are widely used as indicator lamps in the displays of electronic instruments and appliances.|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} type of {{flashlight}} uses a High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamp as the light source. An HID <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> uses a mixture of metal halide salts and argon as a filler. HID lamps produce more light than an incandescent flashlight using {{the same amount of}} electricity. The lamp will last longer and is more shock resistant than a regular incandescent bulb, since it lacks the relatively fragile electrical filament found in incandescent bulbs. However, they are much more expensive, due to the ballast circuit required to start and operate the lamp. An HID lamp requires a short warm-up time before it reaches full output.A typical HID flashlight would have a 35 watt lamp and produce more than 3,000 lumens.|$|E

50|$|A {{discharge}} lamp has a glass or silica envelope containing two metal electrodes {{separated by a}} gas. Gases used include, neon, argon, xenon, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The core operating principle {{is much the same}} as the carbon arc lamp, but the term 'arc lamp' is normally used to refer to carbon arc lamps, with more modern types of <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> normally called {{discharge lamp}}s. With some discharge lamps, very high voltage is used to strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit called an igniter, {{which is part of the}} ballast circuitry. After the arc is struck, the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level, and the ballast limits the current to the operating current. Without a ballast, excess current would flow, causing rapid destruction of the lamp.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its discovery, Raman spectroscopy was used to provide the first catalog of molecular vibrational frequencies. Originally, heroic measures were required to obtain Raman spectra due to the low sensitivity of the technique. Typically, the sample was held in a long tube and illuminated along its length with a beam of filtered monochromatic light generated by a <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> The photons that were scattered by the sample were collected through an optical flat {{at the end of}} the tube. To maximize the sensitivity, the sample was highly concentrated (1 M or more) and relatively large volumes (5 mL or more) were used. Consequently, the use of Raman spectroscopy dwindled when commercial IR spectrophotometers became available in the 1940s. However, the advent of the laser in the 1960s resulted in simplified Raman spectroscopy instruments and also boosted the sensitivity of the technique. This has revived the use of Raman spectroscopy as a common analytical technique.|$|E
5000|$|A metal-halide lamp is an {{electrical}} lamp that produces light by an electric arc through a gaseous mixture of vaporized mercury and metal halides (compounds of metals with bromine or iodine). It {{is a type}} of high-intensity discharge (HID) <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp.</b> [...] Developed in the 1960s, they are similar to mercury vapor lamps, but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube, which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light.The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide. Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature, the sodium dissociates from the iodine, adding orange and reds to the lamp's spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes.As a result, metal-halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75-100 lumens per watt, which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light. Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours. [...] As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light, metal halides [...] were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry. [...] They are used for wide area overhead lighting of commercial, industrial, and public spaces, such as parking lots, sports arenas, factories, and retail stores, as well as residential security lighting and automotive headlamps (xenon headlights).|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} arc in metal-halide lamps, {{as in all}} <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> has a negative resistance property; meaning that as the current through the bulb increases, the voltage across it decreases. If the bulb is powered from a constant voltage source such as directly from the AC wiring, the current will increase until the bulb destroys itself; therefore, halide bulbs require electrical ballasts to limit the arc's current. There are two types: ...|$|R

All three lamps show a definite continuum over the entire wavelength range from 0. 185 to 0. 6 micrometers. Considerable line emission is superimposed on much of the continuum for wavelengths greater than 0. 35 micrometers. These sources were used to make transmittance measurements on quartz samples in the near ultraviolet wavelength range...|$|R

A particular host material is chosen {{in order to}} obtain a desired combination of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. Nd:YAG lasers and variants are pumped either by flashtubes, continuous <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps,</b> or near-infrared laser diodes (DPSS lasers).
