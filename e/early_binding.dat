40|$|AbstractA {{binding time}} {{analysis}} imposes {{a distinction between}} the computations to be performed early (e. g. at compile-time) and those to be performed late (e. g. at run-time). For the λ-calculus this distinction is formalized by a two-level λ-calculus. We present an algorithm for static analysis of the binding times of a typed λ-calculus with products, sums, lists and general recursive types. Given partial information about the binding times of some of the subexpressions it will complete that information such that (i) <b>early</b> <b>bindings</b> may be turned into late bindings but not vice versa, (ii) the resulting two-level λ-expression reflects our intuition about binding times, e. g. that <b>early</b> <b>bindings</b> are performed before late bindings, and (iii) as few changes as possible have been made compared with the initial binding information. The results can be applied in the implementation of functional languages and in semantics directed compiling...|$|R

Because the exact type of the object being referenced is known before execution, <b>early</b> <b>binding</b> (or [...] "static dispatch") can be used instead of late binding (also called [...] "dynamic dispatch" [...] or [...] "dynamic binding"), which requires one or more virtual method table lookups depending on whether multiple inheritance or only single inheritance are supported in the programming language that is being used.|$|E

Interfaces are described in Microsoft Interface Definition Language. Type libraries can be viewed using various tools, such as the Microsoft OLE/COM Object Viewer ( [...] , part of the Microsoft Platform SDK) or the Object Browser in Visual Basic (up to version 6) and Visual Studio [...]NET.
