5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> {{rather than a}} right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer {{the existence of the}} right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and {{from the fact that it}} is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{she left}} the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, to which the {{majority}} of Finns belong, to protest against its policy of taxing church members and its stance against female priests. Today, the church accepts women as priests and Halonen has stated that she has no personal reason not {{to return to the}} church but refrains from doing so in order not to give a signal that might be misinterpreted. In the 1990s, Halonen acted as the chairman of Suomen setlementtiliitto, a Christian social work organization. After her presidential term, Halonen rejoined the Evangelical-Lutheran Church. According to her statements, she had previously refrained from it as it might have been considered an attempt to garner political support. Since then, Halonen has even preached publicly in a divine service of her home parish of Kallio. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> that the parish priest may grant only in exceptional cases to persons known for their Christian conviction.|$|E
25|$|Small Group Housing (SGH) is {{an option}} for juniors and seniors on Goshen's campus. Started in the 1970s, SGH offers {{students}} the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege,</b> and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict. Other factors considered in the application process include house cumulative GPA, extracurricular involvement, median age of the group, and personal faculty recommendations. Houses are then rewarded to applying groups who exemplify high academic, moral, and volunteer efforts, based on objective and subjective review.|$|E
500|$|Thio {{noted that}} in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission had {{considered}} it [...] "necessary and wise" [...] to constitutionally entrench {{the right to vote}} by making it removable only by a majority of two-thirds of the electorate voting at a national referendum. In addition, she cited the case of Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1988), where the High Court had made a statement which seemed to indicate that the right to vote <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> rather than a right.|$|E

"Unbroken" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by OneRepublic leader Ryan Tedder, {{who was behind}} singles such as Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007). [...] "Unbroken" [...] was recorded at Artisan Studios in Birmingham, England, and Phil Tan mixed the record at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Walker was honoured by the opportunity to record a piece of Tedder's work. Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. I am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I was like this is a beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E
500|$|Chambers {{was named}} in the British squad for the 2012 London Olympics after the {{selectors}} took into account his trials win and his times from the previous year. Given the abrupt turnaround in his fortunes, he said: [...] "For me representing my country in an Olympics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> that should never be taken for granted. To {{be given the opportunity}} to do so in my home town has been a dream that at times has seemed very distant and is now a reality." [...] He returned to the British relay team at the 2012 European Athletics Championships after a six-year absence but a botched baton change saw the team disqualified. At the Olympics he won his 100 metres heat in a season's best of 10.02seconds, with a legal 2.0m/s following wind, in his first Olympic race in twelve years. He was drawn in the same semi-final as Usain Bolt but Chambers' run of 10.05 seconds for fourth meant he did not make the final. His Olympics came to an end in the 4×100 metres relay heats as the British team made an illegal baton exchange.|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> and an experience I will always take pride in. I {{will continue to be a}} leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E

500|$|... "to willingly allow {{anyone to}} hijack this {{tradition}} that means {{so much to}} millions of Americans {{and so many of}} our own fans for any cause would effectively be just as disrespectful as doing it ourselves." [...] Rapinoe expressed displeasure with this move saying [...] "it was incredibly distasteful, four days before one of the worst tragedies in our country, to say I tried to hijack this event." [...] She continued the protest on September 15, 2016 during the national team game against Thailand. [...] U.S. Soccer then issued a statement saying: [...] "Representing your country <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> and honor for any player or coach that is associated with U.S. Soccer's National Teams. Therefore, our national anthem has particular significance for U.S. Soccer. In front of national and often global audiences, the playing of our national anthem is an opportunity for our Men's and Women's National Team players and coaches to reflect upon the liberties and freedom we all appreciate in this country. As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played." ...|$|E
500|$|Gay's 200m {{performance}} at the 2006 IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart {{was the culmination of}} a highly successful year. He became the World Athletics Final champion with another improved personal best of 19.68s, making him the joint third-fastest 200m sprinter with Namibian Frankie Fredericks. Gay was pleased that Fredericks was on site to see his best equaled: [...] "To run that time in front of Frankie <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege.</b> He's someone I admire a great deal both as an athlete and as a man." [...] Gay also won a bronze medal in the 100m, finishing behind Powell and Scott. However, Gay proved himself over 100m at the 2006 IAAF World Cup, taking gold with a 9.88s run. At the end of the season, with Gatlin banned from competition, Gay dominated the Track and Field News US 2006 list, having run six of the seven fastest 100m, with Scott in third, and four of the top six 200m times (behind Carter and Spearmon). Furthermore, he was the second fastest 100m runner in the world that year, second only to world record holder Powell. Having proven himself to be adept at both 100 and 200m, Gay reflected upon his development as a sprinter: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{power of}} our {{citizens}} to vote cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>privilege,</b> because that would imply {{that there is some}} institution superior to the body of citizens which <b>is</b> in <b>a</b> position to grant such <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> to the citizens. But in a free country, there is no institution that can <b>be</b> in such <b>a</b> position to grant such <b>a</b> <b>privilege</b> to the citizens.
