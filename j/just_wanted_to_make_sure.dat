500|$|A {{portion of}} Beghe's {{criticism}} of Scientology originally uploaded to YouTube by Mark Bunker was shown on Nightline {{in a piece}} about David Miscavige's niece, Jenna Miscavige Hill, and her criticism of Scientology. Beghe has turned down television appearances to speak about his experiences, stating: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the story isn’t about me. It’s not about me. It’s about helping others who are still lost in the cult, or toying {{with the idea of}} getting involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Before filming began, {{several of}} the main cast members were sent to a boot camp in South Africa and went through {{intensive}} and rigorous military training by former SAS and SBS soldiers. Stapleton and Winchester had more training than Birthistle, who <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> she could at least be a believable soldier. The actors were trained in several aspects including running, teamwork, and weapons. Mealing meanwhile, did not go through as much training as the other actors, but did spend mornings training with a commander for the SBS {{who is also a}} military adviser on the show. Winchester recalled, [...] "Sully and I would meet every morning at 6am. We would run to a chosen location and on the way we had to memorise street names and directions and then our trainers would say 'that car that you just passed what was the licence plate number?' Our trainers were ex-SAS guys who made us study everything in detail, for example, we learnt step by step how to enter a room in twos, then alone. At the same time, we had to be constantly aware of where our weapon was trained." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

I feel like we're getting to that point where I felt comfortable with putting something out." [...] Speaking {{of the types of}} records she was making, in a separate interview with Rap-Up, Norwood compared her album to previous records. [...] "It’s just gonna be a different album, but of course expressing the love that I feel now and the struggles and different situations that I’ve gone through in the past,... My music always tends to be the soundtrack to my life and definitely inspired by what I see other people go through as well—gritty, edgy, different." [...] Then touching the subject matter of songs on the album, Norwood said she felt like the past failures in her life should be addressed, ...|$|E
