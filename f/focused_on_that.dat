5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} nearly universally positive {{reviews in}} Britain, while protests at the cinemas {{broke out in}} Vienna and Milan. Liddell Hart watched the film {{with a group of}} high-ranking British officers and reported being [...] "pleasantly surprised". Patrick Major argues that the desert war indeed proved a suitable space to effect the reconciliation among the former enemies. The British popular history <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> theatre of war, almost to the exclusion of all others. He states that The Desert Fox had a [...] "catalytic effect" [...] in creating an image of the German armed forces that would be acceptable to the British public. Rommel was thus successfully integrated into the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.|$|E

He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> single character for months of their lives, if not years.

Drew Goddard, {{who had been in}} the running to direct the film, consulted on the script. Filming began in Vancouver in June 2017, with Reynolds returning alongside Baccarin, T. J. Miller, Uggams, Hildebrand, and Kapičić. After an extensive search, Josh Brolin was cast as Cable in April. The film explores the team X-Force, which includes Deadpool and Cable.

500|$|Produced as a {{side project}} by Kial Natale, Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub, the concept {{originated}} in December 2008 from the desire to produce a live-action version of a series, with Natale wishing to focus on Grand Theft Auto, and Majdoub suggesting a film based upon Dragon Ball Z. After {{another member of the}} group suggested Pokémon as a possibility, they <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> concept instead. Kial quickly wrote a script for the short film, while Majdoub and executive film producer Innes contributed additional material to flesh it out. Originally intended to be a film in the vein of CollegeHumor's parody productions, more scenes were added and visual effects improved due to Kial's love for the series and his desire for the film to be [...] "more and more". Planning of the film took four months, while filming and production took a year and a half. Varying crew sizes were used for the four different filming periods with the majority of filming occurring within one weekend. Majdoub noted he was surprised at {{the number of people that}} came forth for auditions that were not actors, but fans of the series.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nirvana's success, Michael Azerrad wrote in a 1992 Rolling Stone article, Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a {{spokesman}} for a generation." [...] Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an [...] "anthem-of-a-generation" [...] status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. The New York Times observed that Smells Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation’s version of the Sex Pistols' 1976 single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.', if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title," [...] and added, [...] "As Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, shrink-wrapped and sold." [...] The band grew uncomfortable with the song's success, and in later concerts often pointedly excluded it from the set list. Prior {{to the release of}} the band's 1993 follow-up album In Utero, Novoselic remarked, [...] "If it wasn't for 'Teen Spirit' I don't know how Nevermind would have done," [...] and observed, [...] "There are no 'Teen Spirits' on In Utero." [...] Cobain said in 1994, [...] "I still like playing 'Teen Spirit,' but it's almost an embarrassment to play it [...] Everyone has <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> song so much." ...|$|E

Bahá'í observers were welcomed at an Inter–American Indian Congress {{in the city}} of Guatemala in 1959 thanks to their contacts with local versions of inter–American Indian institutes in the region and included opportunities for sharing native and Spanish translations of Bahá'í pamphlets.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Sydney Morning Herald, Phil Rice stated that the ideas in Male Restroom Etiquette were based on observational humor that he had first seen in 2000 on the collaborative Internet site Everything2. In 2006, {{he decided to take}} a temporary hiatus from making machinima and to produce a short humorous work when he returned. He felt that the ideas about restroom behavior on Everything2 were well-suited for visual humor and adapted them into a screenplay. According to Rice, the film [...] "is rooted in the Juvenile humor that most men retain a secret fondness for, but don't get many opportunities to celebrate but if the movie is too <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> kind of humor, you'd lose the intelligent audience that I wrote the film for." [...] Intending to make a parody of educational and social guidance films, Rice considered distributing the film in black-and-white, but decided against it.|$|E

Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life.
