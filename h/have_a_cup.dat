25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1607, the English colonists were still living in {{temporary}} housing. The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain Edward Maria Wingfield, president of the council, chose the Jamestown site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> or two of grain-meal per day. Due to swampy conditions and widespread disease, someone died almost every day. By September, more than 60 of the 104 brought by Newport were dead. The men may well have died from drinking brackish creek water and from poor nutrition.|$|E

Though Jerry does not want to go—he has made plans, he doesn't know the people—his mother coerces him: [...] "At least come and say hello, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee, then you'll leave."

500|$|The {{origins of}} L.A. Takedown lay in real life. Michael Mann, the film's {{producer}} and screenwriter, cited producer, screenwriter and Chicago ex-police officer Chuck Adamson as {{an inspiration for}} the character of Vincent Hanna. Mann, who collaborated with Adamson on Miami Vice and Crime Story and several minor projects, was told of an investigation Adamson partook in. In 1963, he was investigating Neil McCauley, a professional robber. According to Mann, [...] "one day they simply bumped into one another. [...] didn't know what to do: arrest him, shoot him or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee." [...] Adamson later killed McCauley in a stand-off after a failed robbery.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2000s, major renovations {{were made}} to the Mahane Yehuda Market, {{including}} infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. [...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the [...] "new generation" [...] wants a place with entertainment, a place to sit and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee, and a place to shop for gifts.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2009, Yusuf Islam {{stated that}} the song {{is very similar to}} his song [...] "Foreigner Suite," [...] {{recorded}} under his former stage name, Cat Stevens. He said [...] "My son brought it to my attention and said: 'Doesn't that sound like 'Foreigner Suite?'" [...] Islam said that any legal action he might take [...] "depends on how well Satriani does." [...] Coldplay drummer Will Champion denied the claim, stating, [...] "We're confident we haven't done anything wrong." [...] In June 2009, Islam later said, [...] "They did copy my song but I don't think they did it on purpose," [...] adding, [...] "I don't want them to think I am angry with them.

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where we could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band. As is explained by Dave Lewis, [...] "By moving into Headley Grange for the whole period of recording, many of the tracks [...] were made up on the spot and committed to tape almost there and then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inuit {{often are}} {{relentless}} in making known {{that they are}} not like Qallunaat {{in the sense that they}} do not eat the same food and they are communal with their food. Qallunaat believe that the person who purchases the food is the owner of the food and is free to decide what happens to the food. Searles describes the Inuit perspective on food by saying that [...] "in the Inuit world of goods, foods as well as other objects associated with hunting, fishing, and gathering are more or less communal property, belonging not to individuals but to a larger group, which can include multiple households." [...] Food in an Inuit household is not meant to be saved for the family who has hunted, fished, gathered, or purchased it, but instead for anyone who is in need of it. Searles and his wife were visiting a family in Iqaluit and he asked for permission to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of orange juice. This small gesture of asking was taken as offensive because Inuit do not consider food belonging to one person.|$|E

2500|$|Commonwealth Stadium has a seating {{capacity}} of 56,302, in an all-seater configuration. The stadium has two twin-tier grandstands along each side, and single-tier {{stands on the}} corners and end zones. The sides feature 44,032 seats, with the remaining 12,386 in the corners and end zones. The side seats are [...] wide and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> holder, a feature lacking on the narrower end zone seats. The seating is {{laid out in a}} colorized mosaic pattern, with dark [...] "Eskimo" [...] green at the bottom, yellow in the middle and lighter green at the top. In the sides there are 14,203 dark green seats, 19,019 yellow seats and 10,810 light green seats. In the corner and end zones there are 8,672 dark green and 3,713 yellow seats. There are 15 executive suites on the east stand, 7 on the west stand and 8 on the south end zone. There is a limited amount of covered seating on the upper sections of the lower tier on the sides; half of this section on the east stand is a media center.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] said Jonathan Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of tea instead." ...|$|E
