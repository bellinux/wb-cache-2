Because these devices dissipate significant power, the relay may drop-out faster than it would with a simple rectifier diode. An advantage to using a transorb over just one diode {{is that it will}} protect against over voltage with both polarities, if connected to ground, forcing the voltage to stay between the confines of the breakdown voltages of the Zener diodes. A Zener diode connected to ground will protect against positive transients to the value of the Zener breakdown, and will protect against negative transients greater than a normal <b>forward</b> <b>diode</b> drop.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} the {{application}} of channel hot-carrier (CHC) stress applied at 4. 2 K to SOI nMOS transistors are investigated. As will be shown, a reduction of the threshold voltage is observed for typical stressing conditions, while simultaneously the maximum transconductance increases. Similar changes can be obtained nearly immediately by applying a strong pulse into multiplication, i. e. by pulsing the drain voltage beyond the kink. At 4. 2 K this 'low'-threshold-voltage (V(T)) state is metastable. These phenomena can be explained by considering hole trapping in the frozen-out film, yielding a reduction of the depletion charge and an increase in the film potential. This results in a reduction of V(T) and of the transverse electric field. Due to the slow re-emission and to the steep <b>forward</b> <b>diode</b> characteristic, trapped charge will remain for a considerable time in the film, explaining the metastability of the hole-trapping-induced low-V(T) state at 4. 2 K. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Recently we {{reported}} {{the existence of}} two opposing diodes inheterojunction ZnO/PbS quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) : a desirable <b>forward</b> <b>diode</b> at the heterojunction formed between a ZnO nanocrystal (NC) layer and the PbS QD layer, while a Schottky barrier forms between the PbSQD layer and the anode in the opposite direction. 1, 2 Holes accumulate at the PbS/anode interface due to the Schottky barrier Φb as shown in Figure 1 a. The Schottky-barrier height depends onQDsize, such that the hole extraction barrier increases as theQDdiameter decreases. Thus the undesired barrier can be reduced by using larger QD sizes (smaller band gap). However, the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) then suffers from a reduced open circuit voltage (Voc). Therefore, we have investigated avenues toward a hole extraction layer that blocks electrons and works well with anyQD bandgap.
