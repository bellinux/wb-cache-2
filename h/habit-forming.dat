5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically <b>habit-forming</b> (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause <b>habit-forming</b> dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines possess anti-anxiety {{properties}} {{and can be}} useful for the short-term treatment of severe anxiety. Like the anticonvulsants, {{they tend to be}} mild and well tolerated, although there is a risk of <b>habit-forming.</b> Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally for the treatment of anxiety; however, occasionally lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of panic attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health {{stated that}} meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, {{methyprylon}} and chlordiazepoxide as drugs whose usefulness {{can hardly be}} questioned. However, Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction, like barbiturates, whose <b>habit-forming</b> qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.|$|E
500|$|Further {{regulation}} of cannabis followed in Massachusetts (1911), New York (1914), and Maine (1914). In New York, reform legislation began under the Towns-Boylan Act, which targeted all [...] "habit-forming drugs", restricted their sale, prohibited refills {{in order to}} prevent habituation, prohibited sale to people with a habit, and prohibited doctors who were themselves habituated from selling them. Shortly after, several amendments were passed by the New York Board of Health, including adding cannabis to the list of <b>habit-forming</b> drugs.|$|E
500|$|Vlambeer {{developed}} Radical Fishing, an Adobe Flash-based {{game where}} a fisherman {{sits in a}} boat and casts his line into the water, pulls up fish into the air, and shoots them with a gun. It was built to take [...] "everything good" [...] from <b>habit-forming</b> browser games without artificially extending its length just to hook players. The game was designed with a feedback loop, where performance in one minigame led to a more rewarding experience in the next minigame. Vlambeer designer Jan Willem ("JW") Nijman developed the idea based on a television show about tuna fishermen {{that led him to}} consider an intersection between catching big fish, slow-motion photography, and Duck Hunts game mechanics. Nijman immediately drafted the design, which never changed. The company sold the Flash game to a browser games website in 2010 but kept the rights to produce an iOS version, which they would call Ridiculous Fishing. They began production on the iOS version on December 7, 2010, with the intention of a [...] "2012/2013 equivalent" [...] of the original.|$|E

2500|$|Zopiclone {{is known}} colloquially as a [...] "Z-drug". Other Z-drugs include {{zaleplon}} (Sonata) and zolpidem (Ambien and AmbienCR) and were initially {{thought to be}} less addictive or <b>habit-forming</b> than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat {{in the last few}} years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis, usually a week or less. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with antidepressants, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|Ludlow’s {{endeavor}} {{to end his}} “addiction” to cannabis is puzzling. The intoxicating chemicals in marijuana and hashish are not considered addictive {{in the strict sense}} of the word, and are only thought to be <b>habit-forming</b> {{in the same way as}} tennis, ice cream, or soap operas. Yet Ludlow was earnest in his description of the horrors of withdrawal, adding that “f, from a human distaste of dwelling too long upon the horrible, I have been led to speak so lightly of the facts of this part of my experience that any man may think the returning way of ascent an easy one, and dare the downward road of ingress, I would repair the fault with whatever of painfully-elaborated prophecy of wretchedness may be in my power, for through all this time I was indeed a greater sufferer than any bodily pain could possibly make me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in New York, Bankhead {{discovered}} that her contest win was fleeting: she was paid $75 for three weeks' work on Who Loved Him Best {{and had only}} a minor part, but she quickly found her niche in New York City. She soon moved into the Algonquin Hotel, incidentally a hotspot for the artistic and literary elite of the era, where she quickly charmed {{her way into the}} famed Algonquin Round Table of the hotel bar. She was dubbed one of the [...] "Four Riders of the Algonquin", consisting of Bankhead, Estelle Winwood, Eva Le Gallienne, and Blyth Daly (all lesbians or bisexual). The Algonquin's wild parties introduced Bankhead to cocaine and marijuana, of which she later remarked, [...] "Cocaine isn't <b>habit-forming</b> and I know because I've been taking it for years." [...] Bankhead did abstain from drinking, but only because she had promised her father that she would stay away from alcohol. At the Algonquin, Bankhead befriended actress Estelle Winwood. She also met Ethel Barrymore, who attempted to persuade her to change her name to Barbara. Bankhead declined, and Vanity Fair later wrote, [...] "she's the only actress {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic to be recognized by her first name only." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place I would propound a certain view of the general {{question}} of habits. My own private observations in psychology incline {{me to believe that}} people vary very much in their power of acquiring habits and in the strength and fixity of the habits they acquire. My most immediate subject of psychological study, for example, is a man of untrustworthy memory who is nearly incapable of a really deep-rooted habit. Nothing is automatic with him. He crams and forgets languages with an equal ease, gives up smoking after fifteen years of constant practice; shaves with a conscious effort every morning and is capable of forgetting to do so if intent upon anything else. He is generally self-indulgent, capable of keen enjoyment and quite capable of intemperance, but he has no invariable delights and no besetting sin. Such a man will not become an habitual drunkard; he will not become anything [...] "habitual." [...] But with another type of man habit is indeed second nature. Instead of the permanent fluidity of my particular case, such people are continually tending to solidify and harden. Their memories set, their opinions set, their methods of expression set, their delights recur and recur, they convert initiative into mechanical habit day by day. Let them taste any pleasure and each time they taste it they deepen a need. At last their habits become imperative needs. With such a disposition, external circumstances and suggestions, I venture to believe, may make a man either into an habitual church-goer or an habitual drunkard, an habitual toiler or an habitual rake. A self-indulgent rather unsocial <b>habit-forming</b> man may very easily become what is called a dipsomaniac, no doubt, {{but that is not the}} same thing as an inherited specific craving. With drink inaccessible and other vices offering his lapse may take another line. An aggressive, proud and greatly mortified man may fall upon the same courses. An unwary youth of the plastic type may be taken unawares and pass from free indulgence to excess before he perceives that a habit is taking hold of him.|$|E
