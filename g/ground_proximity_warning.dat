40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of GNSS to {{radio frequency interference}} and spooﬁng {{becomes more and more}} of concern for navigation applications which require a high level of accuracy and reliability, e. g. for safety of life applications in aviation, railway and maritime environments. Besides pure power jamming with CW, noise or chirp signals, intentional or unintentional spooﬁng with faked GNSS signals is considered as a potential threat. The simplest kind of spooﬁng, so- called meaconing, is the spooﬁng by repeaters, which retransmit received GPS signals. Cases of unintentional spooﬁng by airport repeaters have already been reported, where GPS repeaters used in airport hangars, had unintentionally transmitted their signals to outside and caused <b>ground</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> at aircrafts during take-off [1]. More advanced spooﬁng techniques try to force a target receiver to a wrong position by transmission of simulated GNSS-signals. In some experiments it was already demonstrated, {{that it is possible to}} take over the control of the receiver tracking loops with advanced spooﬁng techniques [2]. Hardware simulations with GNSS-signal generators allow investigating the impact of radio interference and spooﬁng on real GNSS receivers in a systematic, parameterized and repeatable way. The behaviour of different receivers and receiver algorithms for detection and mitigation can be analyzed in dependence of interference power, distance of spoofers and other parameters. In a previous study [1] the impact of repeaters on the measured GPS position was investigated by hardware simulations and ﬁeld experiments. In this paper we concentrate on simulations of meaconing and spooﬁng and their impact on the Galileo receiver performance. The focus was to examine, analyse and explore the impact on the receiver raw observables in the E 1 and E 5 a bands, in particular the C/N 0 and pseudorange measurements. The simulations were carried out within the frame of SESAR WP 15. 3. 7 on multi-frequency/multi constellation GBAS. Disturbed or biased pseudorange measurements would cause the transmission of erroneous pseudorange corrections by the GBAS stations. The knowledge about the behaviour of the raw observables in dependence of different spooﬁng scenarios is also important for the development of monitors for spooﬁng detection at the ground stations. The paper describes different spooﬁng scenarios, the simulation setup and data processing and presents exemplary measurements for the results obtained. Three different spooﬁng scenarios are considered: meaconing, simplistic attack and intermediate up attack...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} workers' responses to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> of static safety hazards on construction sites using a location-based <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> system named the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS). A method of evaluating workers' responses to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> is proposed. The method consists of six variables: warning time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to a hazard when a worker receives a warning), dangerous time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to the hazard when the worker comes close to the hazard), and response time and distance (the difference between dangerous time and warning time, {{and the difference between}} dangerous distance and warning distance). Finally, whether a worker responds to a warning is evaluated against a two-second threshold and a two-meter threshold in terms of response time and distance respectively. The experiment was conducted over 17 workdays with the participation of 72 workers and resulted in 5391 warnings on a real-life construction project in Shanghai, China. The workers' responses were analyzed with respect to two factors: building trades and a-priori risk levels. The research found that workers responded to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> actively, but slightly differently across the selected building trades; carpenters had longer response latency in hazardous areas than ironworkers did, and response percentages were high for hazardous areas with high risks. The results also show evidence that PCMS has the potential to improve workers' safety performance. The limitations of the present study and future research directions are also addressed.

The unit was previously fitted in Atlasjet's other MD-83 aircraft (registered TC-AKN) but it had been switched a week prior to the accident.

25|$|An inquest in the United Kingdom {{stated that}} the {{accident}} report determined {{that the cause of}} the accident was the failure of the captain to maintain adequate clearance from terrain. The crew contacted air traffic control to ask for permission to descend, and the air traffic controller asked the crew to maintain their current altitude, but the plane began its descent in bad weather into a mountainous area. ATC did not warn the crew they were descending too quickly and into danger. Additionally, the crew misunderstood a <b>ground</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> system alert, either due to language problems or because of previous false alerts.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his conceptual contributions to accident prevention, Vette also recommended necessary instrumental improvements.

These recommendations were a factor in the development of enhanced <b>ground</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> systems (EGPWS) in the 1990s and terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) with forward-looking capabilities since then. TAWS systems are widely recommended by international airline safety organizations such as the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and TAWS systems were installed in 95% of commercial jets worldwide by 2007.|$|E
40|$|Quickly {{changing}} and complicated workplace conditions, which {{are typical of}} construction projects, have always been contributing to the poor safety record of the construction industry. However, few of the existing approaches to reviewing control measures take into account or effectively tackle these conditions. This paper introduces a three-level (i. e., individual hazards, hazard types, and generic hazards) hierarchical Bayesian model based on workers' responses to <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> of safety hazards to address the problem. The proposed model distinguishes between two uses of <b>proximity</b> <b>warnings</b> (i. e., as the primary control measure and as the secondary measure), uses observational response rates as input, takes into account prior knowledge of workers' responses to similar hazards, and produces estimated response rates (ERRs). These ERRs are the primary indicator {{of the effectiveness of}} a given control measure {{as well as of the}} validity of a previously identified safety hazard. A 17 -day field experiment was conducted to test the proposed approach, preliminarily using a location-based <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> system to warn workers of safety hazards and record their responses to warnings. The experimental results demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach. The limitations of the present analysis and the directions for future research are also discussed.

25|$|Flight 5719 {{was cleared}} {{for a landing}} on runway 31 at Hibbing, but the flight crew {{requested}} an approach to runway 13 instead {{because there was a}} tailwind on the approach to runway 31 and 31 was covered with precipitation. The flight crew initiated the approach procedure by joining the HIB 20 DME arc from the HIB VOR and intercepting the localizer at 8000 feet MSL.This delayed the start of the descent and thus required an excessive rate of descent.

The crash was caused by inadequate control inputs of the captain following a go-around after the first attempted approach.

40|$|The use of {{cambered}} hull {{shapes in}} the next generation of lighter-than-air vehicles to enhance aerodynamic performance, together with optimized take-off manoeuvre profiles, will require a more detailed understanding of <b>ground</b> <b>proximity</b> effects for such aircraft.

40|$|There {{has been}} almost fifteen years of {{political}} controversy surrounding changes to the rules and procedures by which aircraft conduct their flight within regional Australia. Decisions based on a predominately heuristic (rule of thumb) approach to design have had many adverse consequences for {{the integrity of the}} <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> function. A sound mathematical model is required to establish this function on a mature engineering foundation. To achieve this, the <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> function has been investigated as a hybrid-system. This approach recognises the dual nature of the design: that aircraft dynamics give rise to continuous mathematical models while the communication protocols controlling proximity require discrete mathematical approaches. The blending of each aspect has yielded a deeper insight into the operational limitations and failure modes of this function. The presentation of the thesis follows a design thread through the function. It begins with a description of existing standards and implementations. Risk models are then developed. The pilot interface is recognised as a primary design constraint. Mathematical models are then developed to describe the topology of flow, proximity dynamics, and the scheduling constraints associated with visual, voice, and data-link communications required by the <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> function. These analyses show that many aspects of design can be bounded by analytical formulae that bring new robustness to the design and resolve some of the misconceptions arising from the often inaccurate perceptions of present airspace operations. Failure modes, unaccounted for in existing designs are found to actually aggravate failure in the very situations in which the airspace design should be robust and should act to prevent collisions. In particular, there are divergences of performance between the demands required by the system design and the ability of the pilot to deliver such performances. In some cases, these failures may be traced to policy decisions such as service between Instrument Flight Rule and Visual Flight Rule category aircraft. On the basis of the conclusions of this research, a formal engineering review of the <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> function is required to assure the containment of the likelihood of mid-air collision for all future operations...|$|R

25|$|The {{autopilot}} {{reached the}} limits of its programming and disengaged. After checking their circuit breakers {{for the source of}} the warnings, the crew then reduced thrust to lower the speed. This immediately triggered the 757's stick-shaker stall alert, warning the confused pilots that the aircraft was flying dangerously slow, seconds after it was warning them that the speed was too high. The co-pilot and the relief pilot Muhlis Evrenesoğlu both seemed to recognise the approaching stall and tried to tell the captain, but did not intervene directly, possibly out of deference to the captain's age and experience. The captain then tried to recover from the stall by increasing the plane's thrust to full, but the plane was still in a nose up attitude, preventing the engines from receiving adequate airflow to match the increase in thrust. The left engine flamed out, which caused the right engine, still at full power, to throw the aircraft into a spin. Moments later, the plane inverted. At 11:47p.m., the <b>Ground</b> <b>Proximity</b> <b>Warning</b> System sounded an audio warning, and eight seconds later the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the <b>Ground</b> <b>Proximity</b> <b>Warning</b> System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{visibility}} near {{earthmoving equipment}} resulted in six fatalities in U. S. surface mining operations during 2003. These accidents {{were the result}} of either a piece of equipment striking another vehicle or worker, or the equipment traveling over the edge of an embankment. Figure 1 {{is an example of a}} recent accident that resulted in serious injuries to one worker and fatal injuries to two others when a van parked in front of a haul truck. Two fatalities occurred in separate incidents when front-end loaders struck workers. Another two workers were killed when their equipment backed over the edge of a highwall or dump point [1]. There is clearly a need to provide better information to equipment operators regarding their surroundings. [] Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Spokane Research Laboratory, are working to reduce these accidents by developing systems that sense obstacles and changes in terrain near the equipment and provide this information to the operator. Many off-the-shelf <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> systems that were developed for automobiles, light trucks, and recreational vehicles were evaluated on off-highway dump trucks [2]. Many limitations were found with existing systems, including frequent false alarms, limited detection range, a lack of specific information on an obstacle (e. g., location, identity), difficulties in finding suitable mounting locations, and an inability to withstand the environment. These limitations have necessitated the development of new systems designed specifically for large, off-highway, earthmoving equipment. New off-the-shelf systems available for mining equipment include radar and tag-based detection systems. Prototype systems now being developed include a <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> system based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and a computer-assisted stereovision system. Development of these new systems was accomplished by working with manufacturers to modify existing systems to meet the needs of surface mining and through cooperative research with organizations to develop completely new solutions. A typical <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> system consists of a sensor or antenna mounted on the equipment that detects the presence of obstacles and an alarm interface in the cab of the equipment. Some systems, as described in more detail below, also require that other vehicles and personnel on the ground be outfitted with electronic tags that transmit an I m here signal back to the system (e. g., radio signal detection systems or GPS). Many types of <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> systems are on the market, but they are not all discussed in this paper. APPROACH In past work, engineers at NIOSH evaluated several off-the-shelf <b>proximity</b> <b>warning</b> technologies in order to verify their effectiveness on off-highway dump trucks [2].
