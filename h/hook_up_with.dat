5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee.

They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts to saying he loves Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E
5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, the {{ownership}} of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music for Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and Still Life was released on October 18, 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. Still Life was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called Still Life a [...] "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." [...] As explained by Åkerfeldt, Still Life is a concept album: [...] "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith {{as the rest of}} the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back...
