50|$|Farm Credit Bank of Texas is a federated {{cooperative}} {{owned by}} the local Farm Credit association cooperatives, which directly finance rural real estate, agricultural production, country homes and agribusiness firms. Together with the other three banks of the Farm Credit System (AgFirst Farm Credit Bank, Columbia, South Carolina; AgriBank FCB, St. Paul, Minnesota; and CoBank, ACB, Denver, Colorado), the bank generates funds from the issuance of debt securities in the national and international financial markets through the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, a joint subsidiary of {{the banks of the}} Farm Credit System. These debt securities are the <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the banks of the Farm Credit System and are neither guaranteed by the federal government nor backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.

40|$|This note {{proposes a}} new set-up for the fund backing the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The {{proposed}} fund is a Multi-Tier Resolution Fund (MTRF), restricting the <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> supranational <b>liability</b> {{to a limited}} range of losses, bounded by national liability at the upper and the lower end. The layers are, in ascending order: a national fund (first losses), a European fund (second losses), the national budget (third losses), the ESM (fourth losses, as a backup for sovereigns). The system works like a reinsurance scheme, providing clear limits to European-level <b>joint</b> liability, <b>and</b> therefore confining moral hazard. At the same time, it allows for some degree of risk sharing, which is important for financial stability if shocks to the financial system are exogenous (e. g., of a supranational macroeconomic nature). The text has four parts. Section A describes {{the operation of the}} Multi-Tier Resolution Fund, assuming the fund capital to be fully paid-in (“Steady State“). Section B deals with the build-up phase of the fund capital (“Build up“). Section C discusses how the proposal deals with the apparent incentive conflicts. The final Section D summarizes open questions which need further thought (“Open Questions“) ...|$|R
40|$|Due to an {{emerging}} Brazilian doctrine of environmental liability, lenders now {{face the prospect}} of lawsuits that seek remediation of, or compensation for, environmental damages resulting from their borrowers 2 ̆ 7 activities. Unprecedented judicial decisions (based on a strict, <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> environmental <b>liability</b> for lenders) broad standing, and ongoing initiatives of the government portray financial institutions as the best target to pursue environmental protection in the country. That scenario, however, may represent a detour from the imperative improving the functionality of the public administration. This article examines how legal actors are shaping Brazil 2 ̆ 7 s environmental law enforcement {{and the extent to which}} it affects financial institutions, and also the grounds where the lender environmental liability scheme applied in the United States was tailored to sound banking practices. This article concludes that placing lenders as substitutes for the public administration should not be misunderstood as consistent with a modern business model based on accountability, and will impose political and economic costs on the sustainable development of the country. This article also suggests practices that might be employed to enhance deals in Brazil, but in a safer manner for lenders...|$|R
40|$|Article I {{courts are}} the other federal courts, {{infrequently}} studied despite their {{important role in the}} judiciary. This article focuses on the United States Tax Court, an Article I court that hears approximately 95 percent of litigated federal tax cases. The article argues that the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s current tendency to apply equitable doctrines when necessary to avoid harsh outcomes dictated by statute lacks constitutional authority. First, the article examines the role of Article I courts in the federal judicial system and under the Constitution. Next, it considers the historical and modern meanings of equity and equitable powers {{in the context of the}} distinction between law and equity. The article then discusses the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s use of equity, focusing on the doctrines of equitable recoupment, equitable estoppel, and equitable relief from <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> tax <b>liability</b> for an innocent spouse. Finally, it examines possible sources of equitable power for the Tax Court, including applicable statutes, and the possible equity-like ancestry of Tax Court overpayment claims. The article concludes that Article I courts have limited sources of equitable power, and that for the Tax Court to apply equitable principles as it has been doing, Congress will need to take appropriate action - within constitutional limits - to broaden or redefine the jurisdiction of the court...|$|R
2500|$|Having {{established}} liability, {{the litigation}} {{turned to the}} remedy. [...] In 1999, McCurn ruled on the appropriate method to calculate damages. [...] The court rejected the state's arguments that damages {{should be limited to}} the fair market value of the land {{at the time of the}} transaction, without pre-judgement interest (the approximate method used by the Indian Claims Commission for statutory claims against the federal government). That same year, the court rejected ejectment as a remedy, thus ensuring that the Cayuga would be unable to recover possession of the lands; their remedy would be limited to monetary damages. The court also determined that <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> would be inappropriate, and thus that the defendants would require separate trials. Finally, the court determined that the state would be able to offset from the eventual damages any amount of consideration paid in the original conveyances as well as the value of infrastructure improvements; moreover, the plaintiff's anthropologist's testimony would not be admissible on the question of valuation, the jury would not be able to hear evidence on laches from either party, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar damages, and the plaintiffs would not be able to claim emotional, psychological, or cultural damagesonly the economic value of the land.|$|E
2500|$|All {{directors}} owe {{the same}} fiduciary duties and directors each have <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference. [...] Independent {{research has found}} that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships. [...] This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.” [...] This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio. [...] Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time. [...] It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.|$|E

It is highly encouraged by governments and businessmen. The traditional legal techniques known and frequently used in Canada appear however to be inadequate in some cases.

40|$|In Heneghan v Manchester Dry Docks Ltd {{and others}} [2016] EWCA Civ 86; [2016] 1 W. L. R. 2036, James Heneghan {{had been exposed}} to {{asbestos}} by multiple employers throughout his working life. At the age of 74, he died of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Between 1961 and 1974, he was employed sequentially by six employers, all of whom were the defendants in the instant case. Although he had worked for other employers prior to 1961, none of these was sued. Mr Heneghan was a smoker, and it is accepted that smoking is a potential cause of the cancer from which he suffered. Nevertheless, the defendants had already conceded liability on the basis that occupational asbestos exposure had increased Heneghan’s risk of developing cancer fivefold during his working life. The only remaining issue for the Court of Appeal, therefore, was whether the Fairchild exception (see Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22; [2003] 1 A. C. 32), formulated to deal with mesothelioma,should apply to a case involving lung cancer, or whether there is a valid legal distinction to be made between the two conditions. Somewhat counter-intuitively, it was the defendant who was arguing here for the Fairchild exception to apply, despite that principle normally being advantageous to claimants. The claimant’s appeal in turn was based on an argument that the trial judge should have applied the orthodox causal test of material contribution to injury. There is good reason for this: the consequence of applying Fairchild in cases not involving asbestos and mesothelioma is aliquot liability (Barker v Corus [2006] UKHL 20; [2006] 2 A. C. 572; IEG vZurich [2015] UKSC 33; [2016] A. C. 509), as opposed to the <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> nature of <b>liability</b> reached on orthodox causal grounds. So, on the facts of Heneghan, the application of Fairchild would mean that each defendant would be liable only to the extent of their respective contributions (£ 61, 600 in aggregate, instead of full liability at £ 175, 000). The Court of Appeal affirmed the result reached at trial (by Jay J. [2014] EWHC 4190 (QB)), and did so for very similar reasons, applying the exception to reach a conclusion of aliquot liability...|$|R
