50|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} that conduct electric current efficiently contain strong <b>electrolytes,</b> while ones that conduct poorly {{are considered to}} have weak <b>electrolytes.</b> Those strong <b>electrolytes</b> are substances that are completely ionized in water, whereas the weak <b>electrolytes</b> exhibit only a small degree of ionization in water.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{number of}} iodide-based <b>electrolytes</b> (LiClLiI, LiIKI, LiClLiBrLiI, LiClLiIKI and LiFLiClLiI) were {{considered}} to be used in thermal batteries. Ionic conductivity of multi-cation and all-lithium <b>electrolytes</b> were evaluated. They were compared to the classical <b>electrolytes</b> (LiClKCl, LiFLiBrKBr and LiFLiClLiBr) used in thermal battery applications. Measurements were realised by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (E. I. S.). It was shown that some all-lithium iodide-based <b>electrolytes</b> exhibit interesting ionic conductivities and are suitable as <b>electrolytes</b> in thermal batteries. It was pointed out that activation energy Ea was close to 11 kJ mol − 1 for multi-cation <b>electrolytes,</b> whereas it was equal to 7 kJ mol − 1 for all-lithium <b>electrolytes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{solvation}} {{structure of}} several lithium and sodium based <b>electrolytes</b> are explored {{as a function}} of salt concentration over a wide range via a detailed PM 7 computational study. The cation coordination shells are found to be well-defined and solvent rich for dilute <b>electrolytes,</b> while disordered and anion rich for the more concentrated <b>electrolytes.</b> The Na-based <b>electrolytes</b> display larger cation coordination shells with a more pronounced presence of fluorine as compared to the Li-based <b>electrolytes.</b> The origins of the structural differences are discussed as well as their consequences for properties of battery <b>electrolytes</b> and battery usage-especially targeting the current large interest in highly concentrated <b>electrolytes...</b>|$|R
5|$|The CSF {{is derived}} from blood plasma and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free {{compared}} with plasma and has some different <b>electrolyte</b> levels.

5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which {{use the same}} basic reaction, but a different <b>electrolyte</b> mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.|$|E

30|$|Owing to {{its unique}} hybrid network structure, quasi-solid-state <b>electrolytes</b> always possess, simultaneously, both the {{cohesive}} property {{of a solid}} and the diffusive transport property of a liquid [16]. Namely, quasi-solid-state <b>electrolytes</b> show better long-term stability than liquid <b>electrolytes</b> do and have the merits of liquid <b>electrolytes</b> including high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial contact property [17, 18].|$|R
5|$|When the zona glomerulosa {{produces}} excess aldosterone, {{the result}} is primary aldosteronism. Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth) of the glands, or aldosterone-producing adenomas (a condition called Conn's syndrome). Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and <b>electrolyte</b> imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.|$|E
5|$|Chromic acid {{anodizing}} (or Type I anodizing) {{of aluminium}} is another electrochemical process, {{which does not}} lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses chromic acid as <b>electrolyte</b> in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of <b>electrolyte,</b> blood glucose and calcium levels is {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes.

40|$|The {{fire safety}} and {{temperature}} stability {{is very important}} property of solvents used in <b>electrolytes.</b> This question is discussed in these days because of more and more use of lithium ion batteries in industry.

5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an <b>electrolyte</b> and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, <b>electrolyte</b> problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E

The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an alkaline <b>electrolyte</b> (potassium hydroxide).

High potassium levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, <b>electrolyte</b> imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an <b>electrolyte</b> and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E

5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and <b>electrolyte</b> imbalances; intravenous rehydration or <b>electrolyte</b> replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
5|$|Very pure lead can be {{obtained}} by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an <b>electrolyte</b> of lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.|$|E
