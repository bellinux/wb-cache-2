50|$|A French {{study by}} Binet et al., 1979, {{compared}} 0.1% Amcinonide ointment to equal strength <b>Fluocinonide</b> ointment, a similar corticosteroid {{already on the}} market. A double-blind comparative analysis was conducted to determine if Amcinonide was bioequivalent {{for the treatment of}} psoriasis and eczema. Each group contained both males and females of varying ages (mean = 54.8) and compared objective criteria (crust, scales, swelling, etc.) and subjective criteria (itching, burning, pain). It was found that treatment of dermatitis with Amcinonide achieved significant improvement over the one-week trial period, thus demonstrating adequate efficacy in treating psoriasis, eczema, and even parapsoriasis.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} severe hair loss, limited {{success has been}} {{achieved}} by using the corticosteroids clobetasol or <b>fluocinonide,</b> corticosteroid injections, or cream. The cream is not as effective and it takes longer {{in order to see}} results. Steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost. Whether they are effective is uncertain. Some other medications that have been used are minoxidil, Elocon (mometasone) ointment (steroid cream), irritants (anthralin or topical coal tar), and topical immunotherapy ciclosporin, sometimes in different combinations. Topical corticosteroids frequently fail to enter the skin deeply enough to affect the hair bulbs, which are the treatment target, and small lesions typically also regrow spontaneously. Oral corticosteroids decrease the hair loss, but only for the period during which they are taken, and these drugs can cause serious side effects.|$|E
5000|$|Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, {{petroleum}} jelly, calcipotriol, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) {{were found}} to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques. Emollients {{have been shown to}} be even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy. However, certain emollients have no impact on psoriasis plaque clearance or may even decrease the clearance achieved with phototherapy. The emollient salicylic acid is structurally similar to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), commonly found in sunscreen, and is known to interfere with phototherapy in psoriasis. Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy. [...] Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids (i.e. desoximetasone), <b>fluocinonide,</b> vitamin D3 analogs (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used. The use of the finger tip unit may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} topical <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream {{for the treatment of}} atopic dermatitis. Design: In this double-blind, vehicle-controlled study, patients were randomized to receive treatment with <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream applied once (n= 109) or twice daily (n= 102) or vehicle applied once (n= 50) or twice daily (n= 52) for two weeks. Setting: Multicenter, outpatient. Participants: Patients aged 18 years or older with atopic dermatitis affecting at least two percent but less than 10 percent of body surface area. Measurements: Efficacy and safety measures included lesion severity, pruritus, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, and adverse events. Results: <b>Fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream applied once or twice daily was more effective than cream vehicle. Both regimens were similarly efficacious after two weeks of treatment. At the end of treatment, lesions were cleared or almost cleared in 59 percent of subjects treated once daily and 57 percent of subjects treated twice daily with <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream. Further, considerable residual benefit remained after cessation of twice-daily versus once-daily treatment. Skin safety evaluations showed no significant adverse effects of treatment on signs or symptoms of skin atrophy. <b>Fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream and vehicle treatments did not differ significantly in their suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, nor did hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression differ significantly following once- or twice-daily treatment with <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream. <b>Fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream was well tolerated. Conclusion: Once- or twice-daily topical application of <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream for 14 days was safe and effective for treating atopic dermatitis in this adult patient population. The efficacy of once-daily application was comparable to twice-daily application...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>fluocinonide</b> {{ointment}} and 5 % crude coal tar on clearance of plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris by phototherapy was studied in 25 hospitalized patients using the bilateral comparison technique. All treated areas received ultraviolet radiation from Westinghouse fluorescent FS- 40 bulbs (290 - 400 nm) in doses calculated {{to produce a}} minimal delayed erythema. The topically applied compounds (<b>fluocinonide</b> ointment, 5 % Crude coal tar, white petrolatum) were applied individually or in combination. In nearly all comparisons clearance of psoriatic plaques was obtained after {{the same number of}} ultraviolet exposures, although many (8 of 14) of the areas treated with <b>fluocinonide</b> ointment had an accelerated early response.

40|$|Regenerative {{medicine}} {{holds the}} promise of replacing damaged tissues largely by stem cell activation. Hedgehog signaling through the plasma membrane receptor Smoothened (Smo) is an important process for regulating stem cell proliferation. The development of Hedgehog-related therapies has been impeded {{by a lack of}} US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved Smo agonists. Using a high-content screen with cells expressing Smo receptors and a β-arrestin 2 -GFP reporter, we identified four FDA-approved drugs, halcinonide, fluticasone, clobetasol, and <b>fluocinonide,</b> as Smo agonists that activate Hedgehog signaling. These drugs demonstrated an ability to bind Smo, promote Smo internalization, activate Gli, and stimulate the proliferation of primary neuronal precursor cells alone and synergistically in the presence of Sonic Hedgehog protein.

40|$|The local {{delivery}} of glucocorticoids to tissues significantly decreases mast cell number. This pharmacologic effect of glucocorticoids {{is believed to}} be one of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids regulate allergic inflammation. To determine the mechanism by which glucocorticoids are able to exert this effect, we first applied the glucocorticoid <b>fluocinonide</b> to mouse dermis and observed that the decrease in mast cell number was associated with an increase in mast cell apoptosis. This did not appear to be due to a direct effect of the glucocorticoid on mast cells, as the addition of 0. 01 - 1. 0 microM of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone into stem cell factor (SCF) -dependent mast cell cultures did not enhance mast cell death. However, addition of dexamethasone to cultured fibroblasts did result in a downregulation of SCF mRNA and a significant decrease in SCF protein production. Similarly, immunohistochemistry performed on fluocinonide-treated mouse dermis revealed a decrease in immunoreactive SCF. Administration of SCF at sites of <b>fluocinonide</b> administration to the dermis abolished the mast cell-depleting effect of this glucocorticoid. Thus, glucocorticoids decrease tissue mast cell number by downregulating tissue SCF production required for the survival of local mast cells. This observation may be applicable to the design of improved strategies to treat mast cell-mediated disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background: Discoid lupus {{erythematosus}} is a chronic formof cutaneous (skin) lupus {{which can cause}} permanent scarring if treatment is inadequate. Many drugs {{have been used to}} treat this disease and some of these are potentially very toxic. Objectives: To assess the effects of drugs for discoid {{lupus erythematosus}}. Search strategy: In June 2009 we updated our searches of the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and online ongoing trials registers. The reference lists of relevant reviews were searched. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials. Selection criteria: We included all randomised trials of drugs to treat people with discoid lupus erythematosus. Drugs included in the search were azathioprine, chloroquine, clofazimine, corticosteroids, (oral and topical), dapsone, gold, interferon alpha- 2 a, methotrexate, phenytoin, retinoids, sulphasalazine, thalidomide, topical calcineurin blockers (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), and biological agents (etanercept,efalizimab, infliximab, and rituximab). Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility. Main results: Two trials involving 136 participants were included. No new trials were included in this update. In a cross-over study of 12 weeks duration, <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 05 % cream (a potent topical corticosteroid), appeared to be better than hydrocortisone 1 % cream (a mild corticosteroid) when the first arm of the trial involving 78 participants was analysed at 6 weeks. Clearing or excellent improvement was seen in 27 % of people using <b>fluocinonide</b> and in 10 % of those using hydrocortisone, giving a 17 % absolute benefit in favour of <b>fluocinonide</b> (95 % CI 0. 0 to 0. 34, NNT (Number needed to treat) 6). In the second trial, acitretin (50 mg/day) was compared with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day) in 58 people in a parallel trial of 8 weeks duration. There was marked improvement or clearing in 46 % of people using acitretin and in 50 % of those on hydroxychloroquine but {{there was no significant difference}} between the 2 interventions. The adverse effects were more frequent and more severe in the acitretin group. In this trial clearing of erythema was measured and found to be better in the hydroxychloroquine group (RR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 36 to 1. 06). Authors' conclusions: <b>Fluocinonide</b> cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in treating people with discoid lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy, although adverse effects are more frequent and more severe with acitretin. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat discoid lupus erythematosus. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Revie...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{thermodynamic}} acitvity {{of drugs}} in topical vehicles is considered to significantly influence topical delivery. In vitro diffusion across a synthetic membrane was shown to be correlated {{to the degree of}} saturation of the drug in the applied vehicle and therefore offers a potential for increased topical drug delivery. <b>Fluocinonide</b> a topical corticosteroid, was chosen as a model compound to investigate in vitro and in vivo availability from formulations with different degrees of saturation. Methods. Sub-, as well as, supersaturated drug solutions were prepared using PVP as an antinucleant agent. In vitro membrane diffusion experiments across silicone membrane and in vivo pharmacodynamic activity assessments, using the human skin blanching assay, were carried out. Results. Over the concentration range studied, the in vitro membrane transport of <b>fluocinonide</b> was proportional to the degree of saturation of the respective formulations. The in vivo pharmacodynamic response in the human skin blanching assay was related to the concentration of the drug in the vehicle irrespective of the degree of saturation. Conclusions. From the membrane permeation experiment it can be concluded, that the drug flux might be increased supra-proportionally with increasing donor concentration, drug (super-) saturation (proportional), beyond what would be anticipated based on ideal donor concentration and partition coefficient considerations only. These findings could not be confirmed in the in vivo investigation, probably due to additional vehicle effects (e. g., enhancement, irritation, drug binding) which have to be expected and could have altered the integrity of the stratum corneum and therewith topical bioavailability of the drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to develop a validated, specific and stability-indicating reverse phase liquid chromatographic method for the quantitative determination of <b>fluocinonide</b> and its related substances. The determination was done for active pharmaceutical ingredient and its pharmaceutical dosage forms in the presence of degradation products, and its process-related impurities. The drug was subjected to stress condi- tions of hydrolysis (acid and base), oxidation, photolysis and thermal degradation per International Confer- ence on Harmonization (ICH) prescribed stress conditions to show the stability- indicating power of the method. Significant degradation was observed during acid, base hydrolysis, and peroxide degradation. The major degradants were identified by LC-MS, FTIR and 1 H/ 13 C NMR spectral analysis. The chromatographic conditions were optimized using an impurity-spiked solution and the samples generated from forced degra- dation studies. In the developed HPLC method, the resolution between <b>fluocinonide</b> and its process-related impurities, (namely imp- 1, imp- 2, imp- 3, imp- 4, imp- 5, imp- 6, imp- 7 and imp- 8) and its degradation products was found to be greater than 2. 0. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18, 250 mm × 4. 6 mm, 5 µm column. The LC method employed a linear gradient elution and the detection wavelength was set at 240 nm. The stress samples were assayed against a qualified reference standard and the mass balance was found to be close to 99. 3 %. The developed RP-LC method was validated with respect to linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness...|$|E

The other regimen, called traditional dose, consisted of four-times-a-day topical application of the same steroid. Patients were {{assigned to one of}} the two regimens and observed for six weeks. Confidence intervals for the difference in true mean response under these two regimens provide good evidence that for these patients the traditional dose was not clinically superior to the reduced dose...|$|E
40|$|Topical {{application}} of 400 μg of cantharidin to the rat's ear caused an approximate doubling {{in the mean}} weight of uniform ear punch samples when compared to vehicle-treated controls at 72 hr, and produced a maximal response at 7 days.

Hydrocortisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, flurometholone, paramethasone acetate, fluocinolone acetonide, <b>fluocinonide,</b> and flurandrenolide showed significant suppression of cantharidin-induced inflammation. Cholesterol, diphenhydramine, tripelennamine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, cyproheptadine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, alpha-tocopherol, indomethacin, and bufexamac were inactive.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{solvolysis}} of newly synthesized fluocinolone acetonide C- 21 esters was analysed {{in comparison with}} <b>fluocinonide</b> during a 24 -hour period of time. The solvolysis was performed in an ethanol-water (90 : 10 v/v) mixture using the excess of NaHCO 3. The solvolytic mixtures of each investigated ester have been assayed by a RP-HPLC method using isocratic elution with methanol-water (75 : 25 v/v); flow rate 1 mL/min; detection at 238 nm; temperature 25 °C.

40|$|Topical steroids {{have been}} widely used in the {{treatment}} of symptomatic oral lesions to reduce pain and inflammation. Potent topical steroids such as clobetasol propionate, fluocinolone acetonide (FA), and <b>fluocinonide</b> {{have been widely}} used in the treatment of severe oral mucosal lesions. Many reports have demonstrated that these steroids were effective in treating oral lesions with only minor side-effects. This review describes the effectiveness and side-effects of using FA 0. 1 % in the treatment of symptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP), oral lichenoid drug reaction (OLDR), oral pemphigus, and herpes associated erythema multiforme (HAEM). FA 0. 1 % was effective and safe in the treatment of patients with multiple systemic diseases and a pregnant patient with HAEM. Moreover, this topical steroid rapidly reduced pain, inflammation, and enhanced lesion healing with no serious side-effects other than pseudomembranous candidiasis, which is easily treated. In some cases, a long-term treatment with FA 0. 1 % resulted in hyperpigmentation at the areas of previously healed oral lesions; however, this hyperpigmentation was gradually resolved after discontinuing topical steroid treatment...|$|E
40|$|Diflorasone diacetate, a new topical corticosteroid, was {{generally}} more potent than three high potency reference standards {fluocinonide, beta-metlwsone Π-valerate and fluocinolone acetonide) when the compounds were dissolved in 95 % alcohol and applied in vasoconstrictor assays in healthy volunteers. On {{the basis of}} additional vasoconstrictor assay results, a 0 · 05 % concentration of the steroid in a cream vehicle containing 15 % propylene glycol was developed for therapeutic evaluation. In a double-blind comparison in 384 patients with dermatoses, 0 - 05 % diflorasone diacetate cream was as eflfective as 0 · 05 % <b>fluocinonide</b> cream in the therapy of lesions of psoriasis or atopic/neurodermatitis. I n t r o d u c t i o n In systematic vasoconstrictor screening tests of new topical corticosteroids, diflorasone diacetate emerged as the best candidate for further clinical testing because of its high potency and optimal physico-chemical properties for topical action when applied with or without occlusion.

40|$|Background: Adherence in the {{treatment}} of chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is poor. Methods to improve adherence have proven difficult. Purpose: To determine whether a short course of treatment with a high-potency corticosteroid will improve adherence compared to longer treatment studies and if improvement in disease and itch continues after treatment. Methods: 10 patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis were instructed to apply <b>fluocinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream twice daily for 5 days. Adherence was self-reported and electronically monitored. Treatment outcomes were assessed in terms of Visual Analog Scale of Itch (VAS), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scores. Results: The median adherence rate was 40 % (range of 0 - 100). The median percent change in VAS from baseline measures on days 7 and 14 were 90 % (range - 13, 100, p= 0. 02) and 52 % (range 0, 100, p= 0. 004). On days 7 and 14, 20 % and 70 % patients achieved an EASI- 75 and 40 % and 60 % an IGA of 0 or 1. Limitations: Small sample size limited subgroup analyses. Conclusions: Adherence rates with short-term treatment were similar to previously reported rates in longer term treatment studies.

40|$|Background: Hailey-Hailey disease (familial benign chronic pemphigus) of the vulva {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant dermatosis characterized by malformation of desmosomes and bullae, particularly in intertriginous areas. Cases: We reviewed the cases of 5 women followed at a single academic institution {{over a period of}} 17 years. Of the 5 patients, 4 carried a diagnosis of Hailey-Hailey at the time of presentation to our institution, and one was diagnosed on biopsy. 3 were members of a family group. Initial treatment of choice was a topical steroid (betamethasone in 3, <b>fluocinonide</b> and hydrocortisone in 1 each), vulvar skin guidelines, tepid soaks, a skin protectant (A 2 ̆ 6 D ointment, zinc oxide) and additional treatment (crotamiton in 1, clotrimazole in 2, and Polysporin in 1). Final treatment regimens in 3 patients followed long term were zinc oxide/A 2 ̆ 6 D and betamethasone-clotrimazole ointment in all 3, nystatin-triamcinolone ointment in 2, oral minocycline in 1, oral fluconazole prn in 1, and topical tacrolimus in 1. Treatment courses were complicated by superimposed fungal infections, superimposed bacterial infections, and lichen simplex chronicus flares. These were treated with antifungals, topical clindamycin and metronidazole, and steroid-antifungal bursts, respectively. Three of five patients followed long term achieved successful remission with occasional flares. Discussion: Treatment of Hailey-Hailey disease must be tailored to the individual patient. Adherence to vulvar skin care guidelines is critical for the remission of Hailey-Hailey disease. Treatment is long-term and may be complicated by episodes of fungal and bacterial superinfection and lichen simplex chronicus...|$|E
40|$|The {{clonidine}} transdermal therapeutic system (clonidine-TTS) {{has been}} associated with a significant incidence of allergic contact sensitization. This incidence was not predicted by premarket skin sensitization testing in animals or humans. One possible explanation lies in recent findings in guinea pigs that clonidine exposure could inhibit the elicitation of skin reactions to unrelated strong contact sensitizers. However, these studies also showed that clonidine pretreatment did not appear to affect the induction of contact sensitization. On this basis, we sought to specifically evaluate the induction phase of sensitization to clonidine as an alternative means of assessing its sensitization properties. The method selected was the assay of in situ lymphocyte proliferation in lymph nodes draining the sites of clonidine exposure, a method recently promoted as an alternative means to assess contact allergenic potential. Utilizing various induction application techniques and regimens, we were consistently unable to demonstrate clonidine's allergenic potential through such an assessment of lymphocyte proliferation. We were also unable to demonstrate sensitization by in vivo ear swelling or in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay techniques. However, a subsequent assessment of the effect of clonidine exposure on the induction of sensitization to unrelated strong contact allergens demonstrated a consistent 40 - 70 % inhibition of the proliferative response to the contact allergens oxazolone and trinitrochlorobenzene. This was similar to the degree of suppression produced by the corticosteroids <b>fluocinonide</b> and Hydrocortisone when they were tested at 80 and 10 times lower concentrations. In addition, we observed a comparable inhibition of the ear swelling response to oxazolone. These data extend our knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of clonidine and offer additional mechanistic insights into the failure of short-term predictive patch-test methods to detect this chemicals protential to induce allergic contact sensitization...|$|E
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 31 -year-old male {{presented}} to the emergency department (ED) with worsening constant left sided throat pain {{over the past four}} months. The patient reports that he was brushing his teeth when his dog jumped onto his back causing his toothbrush to puncture the back of his throat, resulting in immediate bleeding and discomfort. The bleeding subsided and the patient did not seek medical care. The pain radiated to his left ear and the back of the neck. He also noted a change in his voice. The day before presenting to the ED the patient noted subjective fevers, hemoptysis and drooling, which led him to seek medical care. Significant findings: The photograph demonstrates an area of ulcerative tissue at the left palatine tonsil without surrounding erythema or purulent drainage. The computed tomography (CT) scan shows a large ulceration of the left soft palate and palatine tonsil (red arrow). There is no evidence of skull base osteomyelitis. There is suppurative lymphadenopathy with partial left jugular vein compression due to mass effect (yellow highlight). There is mild nasopharyngeal airway narrowing with architectural distortion (blue arrow), but no other evidence of airway obstruction. Discussion: The oral cavity is prone to trauma leading to the formation of superficial ulcerations. There are many causes of mechanical trauma, most commonly accidental biting. Chemical, electrical and thermal insults are also possibilities. Poor fitting dental devices and fractured or malformed teeth can also be etiologies. 1 Traumatic ulcerations are most common in children given bruxism and thumb sucking. However, a broad differential must be considered including malignant and premalignant lesions, infections of the oral mucosa, aphthous ulcerations and autoimmune diseases. 2, 3 Chronic ulcerations are associated with superimposed infection, but there has not been established an association of malignant transformation of the oral mucosa after trauma. If there is an unclear history at presentation, the provider must consider referral for a biopsy to exclude malignancy. Most ulcerations from mechanical or thermal trauma resolve in ten to fourteen days. Antibiotics can be considered to prevent secondary infection if the ulceration is severe; however, most resolve without antibiotics. Supportive measures to consider include removal of irritant, mouth guards, soft diet, sodium chloride mouth rinse, topical corticosteroids or anesthetics. Triamcinolone acetonide and <b>fluocinonide</b> gel are recommended for analgesia. 2 The patient discussed here was discharged home after his visit with a plan to follow up for further evaluation by a specialist. He returned to the emergency department three months later with worsening symptoms. He was admitted and otolaryngology performed biopsies, which demonstrated an advanced stage human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer. The patient is currently in a clinical trial receiving treatment. Again, this stresses the importance of follow up and further evaluation of concerning lesions...|$|E
