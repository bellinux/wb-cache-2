40|$|Background] The {{evolution}} of species boundaries {{and the relative}} impact of selection and gene flow on genomic divergence are best studied in populations and species pairs exhibiting various levels of divergence along the speciation continuum. We studied species boundaries in <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbels,</b> Barbus and Luciobarbus, a system of populations and species spanning a wide degree of genetic relatedness, as well as geographic distribution and range overlap. We jointly analyze multiple types of molecular markers and morphological traits to gain a comprehensive perspective {{on the nature of}} species boundaries in these cyprinid fishes. [Results] Intraspecific molecular and morphological differentiation is visible among many populations. Genomes of all sympatric species studied are porous to gene flow, even if they are not sister species. Compared to their allopatric counterparts, sympatric representatives of different species share alleles and show an increase in all measures of nucleotide polymorphism (S, H d, K, π and θ). High molecular diversity is particularly striking in L. steindachneri from the Tejo and Guadiana rivers, which co-varies with other sympatric species. Interestingly, different nuclear markers introgress across species boundaries at various levels, with distinct impacts on population trees. As such, some loci exhibit limited introgression and population trees resemble the presumed species tree, while alleles at other loci introgress more freely and population trees reflect geographic affinities and interspecific gene flow. Additionally, extent of introgression decreases with increasing genetic divergence in hybridizing species pairs. [Conclusions] We show that reproductive isolation in Iberian Barbus and Luciobarbus is not complete and species boundaries are semi-permeable to (some) gene flow, as different species (including non-sister) are exchanging genes in areas of sympatry. Our results support a speciation-with-gene-flow scenario with heterogeneous barriers to gene flow across the genome, strengthening with genetic divergence. This is consistent with observations coming from other systems and supports the notion that speciation is not instantaneous but a gradual process, during which different species are still able to exchange some genes, while selection prevents gene flow at other loci. We also provide evidence for a hybrid origin of a barbel ecotype, L. steindachneri, suggesting that ecology {{plays a key role in}} species coexistence and hybridization in <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbels.</b> This ecotype with intermediate, yet variable, molecular, morphological, trophic and ecological characteristics is the local product of introgressive hybridization of L. comizo with up to three different species (with L. bocagei in the Tejo, with L. microcephalus and L. sclateri in the Guadiana). In spite of the homogenizing effects of ongoing gene flow, species can still be discriminated using a combination of morphological and molecular markers. <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbels</b> are thus an ideal system for the study of species boundaries, since they span a wide range of genetic divergences, with diverse ecologies and degrees of sympatry.

Detailed velocity measurements made using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) at the upstream end {{and over the}} spillway in the stream wise-wall-normal plane were used to characterize flow and link fish behaviour with local hydrodynamic variables. A distinct recirculation pattern was found upstream of the 90 º spillway, which was not observed {{in the other two}} spillways. This recirculation area seemed to have a strong impact on individuals of both species. Fish exhibited strong avoidance behaviour to turbulence as well as to rapid changes in flow velocity, in particular <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel.</b> Interspecific variations on behaviour were evident. Eel moved downstream and passed the spillway headfirst. They were predominantly thigmotactic exhibiting a more structure–oriented behaviour and responded after physical contact with the spillway. Barbel moved downstream head?rstbut switched orientation at points of rapid velocity variation and passed over the spillway tail first without contacting the structure. Geometry-related differences were found for the eel, which exhibited the highest rates of passage success in experiments conducted with upstream inclinations of ? = 45 º and 30 º, and the greatest times of passage and resident times when tested under spillway designs of ? = 90 º. Overall European eel had a higher passage success (80 %) when compared to <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> (32 %) which spent more time in the test section and took longer to pass the spillway. Results indicate that the design of spillways and associated hydrodynamics strongly impact downstream movements of these two species which have distinct biomechanical capabilities and behaviour. The observed reduction of delay time before passage and the highest passage success rates for the modified spillways suggest that these facilitate appropriate timing of migration and enhance passage survival.

The establishment of a cause–effect relationship is hindered in natural systems by the existence of confounding factors (i. e. biotic interactions). Here we analysed the effects that anthropogenic stressors have on a mono-specific fish community (<b>Iberian</b> redfin <b>barbel</b> population, Barbus haasi) inhabiting the northern edge of its distribution range. In Spring 2004, a total of 40 consecutive sampling sites were surveyed in Vallvidrera creek, and 1, 331 specimens were measured and weighed. A principal component analysis was performed to synthesize the information provided by 22 environmental variables. Analysis of variance, bivariate correlation analyses and multiple linear regressions were then used to determine the influence of the environmental gradients built (water quality, hydromorphology, woods and macrophytes, and degree of silting) on fish population features (fish size, body condition status, density and biomass). The findings revealed that water quality was the most significant environmental gradient for this fish population. In particular, fish density decreases and fish length increases in those sites exposed to sewage. Additionally, our results showed the best body condition of those specimens inhabiting fast flow reaches which confirms the rheophilous condition of B. haasi. However, these findings were unnoticed for the current version of the index of biotic integrity using fish as bioindicators in Catalonia. Resource managers need to refine diagnostic tools in order to detect subtle deleterious changes on fish communities before they become evident at population scale. Conservation measures should be focused in these small streams in where the best preserved native fish populations usually inhabit.

Understanding how these factors shape organism performance can help to identify the most vulnerable species and develop effective management strategies. This is particularly important for ichthyofaunas with high endemicity and low diversity, {{such as those of}} the Iberian Peninsula. We explored the suitability of a novel and simple condition index, the scaled mass index (SMI), based on mass–length relationships, for analysis of the effects that abiotic and biotic pressures have on the body condition of four fish taxa widely distributed in Mediterranean rivers in north-eastern Spain: brown trout (Salmo trutta), <b>Iberian</b> redfin <b>barbel</b> (Barbus haasi), Ebro barbel (Luciobarbus graellsii) and minnows (Phoxinus spp.). The SMI performed better in explaining spatial variation in body condition than the Fulton Index, a traditional method for fish studies. For all taxa, anthropogenic stressors influencing water quality and physical habitat explained more variance in SMI than other factors. Variation partitioning and GLM approaches consistently showed that SMI increased with altitude, reduced concentrations of toxic nitrogenous compounds, and well-preserved riparian canopy and natural channel morphology, despite the fact that three of the study taxa are in expansion and generally considered ‘tolerant’. In addition, the application of SMI to an independent fish data set showed that SMI provides a novel indicator of ecosystem health, which performs better than the current index of biotic integrity developed in this region. We discuss the likely mechanisms behind the strong effects of habitat quality on SMI and the implications for our understanding of tolerance. Incorporating SMI into studies of fish monitoring is likely to improve the value of fish studies as indicators of river quality and ecological change. Further studies should compare the response of SMI to specific fish health indicators such as parasite load, haematological assays and pollutant bioaccumulation to improve our understanding of the value of SMI as a non-lethal diagnostic procedure.

To improve the knowledge about the species distribution and habitat requirements, nonlinear modelling was carried out to predict the presence/absence and density of the Eastern <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel,</b> based on 155 sampling sites distributed throughout the Júcar River Basin District (Eastern Iberian Peninsula). In this case study, we used multilayer feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN) to represent nonlinear relationships between L. guiraonis descriptors with biological and habitat variables. The gradient descent algorithm was implemented to find the optimal model parameters {{and the importance of}} the ANN's input variables was determined by the partial derivatives method (PaD). The predictive power of the model was evaluated with the Cohen's Kappa (k), the correctly classified instances (CCI), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots. The presence/absence of L. guiraonis was predicted by the ANN model with a high performance (k= 0. 66, CCI= 87 % and AUC= 0. 85); the prediction of density was moderate (CCI = 62 %, AUC= 0. 71 and k= 0. 43). The most significant variables that described the presence/absence were: solar radiation (its highest contribution was observed between 2000 and 4200 WH/m 2), drainage area (with the strongest influence between 3000 and 5. 000 km 2), and proportion of exotic fish species (with relevant contribution between 50 and 100 %). In the density model, the most important variables were coefficient of variation of mean annual flows (relative importance of 50. 5 %) and proportion of exotic fish species (24. 4 %), but the partial derivative method was unable to identify a positive or negative relationship between these variables and fish density. The models provide important information about the relation of L. guiraonis with biotic and abiotic variables, this new knowledge could be used to support future studies and practical decisions about the management and conservation of this species in the Júcar River Basin District, and potentially for the conservation of other endemic fish species of Barbus and Luciobarbus in Mediterranean rivers...|$|E

During 1 year, we collected bimonthly and fortnightly samples from four populations of <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel,</b> inhabiting permanent and temporary Mediterranean rivers with non-regulated and regulated flow regimes. We analysed data for fish age, growth and reproduction to (i) compare barbels’ life cycles between permanent and temporary non-regulated rivers; (ii) assess the effect of two types of flow alteration in these traits; and (iii) identify flow variables significantly related with growth and reproductive cycles. Regional differences were related with the age of first maturation, growth rate and timing and duration of the reproductive season. Flow regulation promoted a decrease of fish growth rates, condition and gonad activity and an increase of maximum length and longevity.

A total of 267 adult barbels were seasonally collected in four nonregulated and regulated rivers from permanent and temporary basins, and their gut content was analysed. Locally available food sources were evaluated across sites and seasons. Ba rbels from the permanent nonregulated river exhibit a more variable and diversified diet in which invertebrates assumed a large importance, especially during high flow s. Barbels from the temporary nonregulated river presented a more uniform diet composed of plant material and detritus, particular ly in drought seasons. Flow regulation affected different flow components in both systems, but the effects on food resourc es and barbels’ diet were similar, resulting in an intra-annual stabilisation of resource availability and fish diet, with a higher consumption of plants and detritus. Changes in fish diet and feeding activity in both nonregulated and regulated rivers were strongly associated with the seasonal variability of streamflow components, particularly between low- and high-flow periods, and with the reduction in flow variability in the case of dam regulation.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the structure of fish assemblages in the modified Lima basin (Northern Portugal), two distinct datasets concerning the presence and abundance of fish species were subjected to multivariate analysis. On the River Lima two types of flow modification are present within kilometres of one another: (a) a reduced and constant flow due to hypolimnetic release; and (b) an intense and irregular flow. A comparison of their influence on fish assemblages revealed a gradient of assemblage types from tributaries to main river sites. The latter were characterised by a strong dominance of cyprinids, particularly <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus bocagei). The former harboured two kinds of fish assemblages: those closer to the river mouth were dominated by the cyprinids Iberian chub (Squalius carolitertii) and Iberian nase (Chondrostoma polylepis), which were also frequently present in the main river; while in those further upstream the predominant species was the brown trout (Salmo trutta). Although explanatory variables such as distance from source, altitude, substrate coarseness and width were the primary correlates of fish assemblage composition, dam construction and flow regulation also had a significant effect upon assemblage structure, particularly by: i) reducing the importance of migratory species; ii) constraining the presence of trout in the regulated segments; and iii) simplifying the community, {{especially in the case of}} the constant and reduced flow regime...|$|E

Barbel from the non-regulated river had to search for suitable refuges, with specific habitat characteristics, in which they remained aggregated during harsh summer conditions. Conversely, barbel from regulated river kept a continuous distribution along the river. This study contributes to the management of regulated rivers by providing insights about which flow components are more altered by hydropeaking operations and which are the most critical annual periods for fish movements. It also suggests several restoration actions, such as the protection of fish summer refuges, the restoration of large-scale temporal streamflow variability and the reduction of daily rates of discharge rise and fall, which should be continuously monitored in order to increase their efficiency and provide new knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of fish {{presence}} {{is needed in}} many branches of regulated river management, including the definition of environmental flows and habitat restoration measures for wildlife conservation. Research on river ecology has indicated that fish species distribution {{can be related to}} habitat attributes, and models with high predictive performance can be obtained by combining biotic and abiotic habitat descriptors. In four selected reference sites of the Cabriel River (province of Cuenca, Spain), the presence of Eastern <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Luciobarbus guiraonis) was related to environmental variables linked to different mesohabitat characteristics. By means of Random Forest (RF), the data collected in the field were used to predict fish presence for two key bioperiods: migration and spawning (April-June) and rearing and growth (July-September). The aims of this study are (i) to select the most important habitat attributes for the fish presence (ii) to evaluate how biotic interactions among fish species affect habitat use and (iii) to examine the feasibility of using RF in building habitat suitability models for fish. Random Forest provided an indicator of variables' importance and the most parsimonious model was selected to define the lowest number of variables to be surveyed for future model applications, e. g. habitat restoration measures and prediction of areas with high habitat suitability which should be conserved. The preliminary results of this research were discussed, as well as possible future developments, showing potentials and limitations of Random Forest in building habitat models for fis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Knowing the {{swimming}} ability of fish {{is important to}} detect movement limitations through hydraulic structures: fish passes weirs and slots, gauging stations, culverts, bridges foundations and other. All these obstacles are collectively referred to 2 ̆ 2 velocity barriers 2 ̆ 2. Fish behavior will determine the passage of these structures through combination of fish swimming performance and motivation. Once the fish decides to enter the barrier, must swim faster {{than the speed of}} the flow to advance. Thus, {{the swimming}} performance depends on the fish speed and fatigue time. To estimate these values, we experimented in an open channel flow with fish samples of different size, swimming volitionally against several high-velocity flows and water temperature range. The movement of fish was controlled by PIT telemetry systems and video record. The information obtained (fish speed, ascend time and distance traveled) was processed using survival analysis techniques and the results can be applied to practical problem solving velocity barriers. We have worked with two species of Iberian fish: <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Luciobarbus bocagei) and Northern straight-mouth nase (Pseudochondrostoma duriense). The biometrics parameters, flow velocity and water temperature have a significant influence in fish behavior. Endurance and swimming ability of these species do not differ greatly between them and is much higher than the values which are obtained using other methods as respirometers. The results challenge established fish passage guidelines, suggesting that in some cases these species are capable of passing much higher velocities than was previously believed...|$|E
40|$|Decline in {{fish species}} populations due to river {{regulation}} by dams and weirs promoted {{the development of}} fishways, which are {{becoming one of the}} most common measures for the restoration of connectivity in rivers. Fishways efficiency can be species specific and thus monitoring and evaluation, and subsequent adjustments to design and hydraulic features, are required to inform potential users prior to installation. In this study we tested the applicability of electromyogram telemetry to study the swimming behavior of a cyprinid potamodromous species, the <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> Luciobarbus bocagei Steindachner, 1864, in an experimental pool-type fishway. In total, 24 barbels were used in the experiment, 12 of which were tagged with EMG radio transmitters equipped with electrodes that register muscle activity, while the other 12 untagged fish were used as control. For tagged fish, a relationship between swimming speed and EMG telemetry signals was developed in a swimming tunnel, which was later used to assess barbels swimming behavior within the experimental fishway. Tagged fish exhibited high passage success and anaerobic burst swimming was only required to move through the submerged orifices of the fishway. Barbels spent successively less time when transversing the pools in the upstream direction. Measured hydraulic variables that were related with barbels’ swimming speed within the fishways were the water velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulence intensity and, especially, the horizontal component of Reynolds shear stress, highlighting the importance of these parameters when designing pool-type fishway...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the structure of fish assemblages in the modified Lima basin (North-ern Portugal), two distinct datasets concerning the presence and abundance of fish species were subjected to multivariate analysis. On the River Lima two types of flow modification are present within kilometres of one another: (a) a reduced and constant flow due to hypolim-netic release; and (b) an intense and irregular flow. A comparison of their influence on fish assemblages revealed a gradient of assemblage types from tributaries to main river sites. The latter were characterised by a strong dominance of cyprinids, particularly <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus bocagei). The former harboured two kinds of fish assemblages: those closer to the river mouth were dominated by the cyprinids Iberian chub (Squalius carolitertii) and Iberian nase (Chondrostoma polylepis), which were also frequently present in the main river; while in those further upstream the predominant species was the brown trout (Salmo trutta). Al-though explanatory variables such as distance from source, altitude, substrate coarseness and width were the primary correlates of fish assemblage composition, dam construction and flow regulation also had a significant effect upon assemblage structure, particularly by: i) re-ducing the importance of migratory species; ii) constraining the presence of trout in the regu-lated segments; and iii) simplifying the community, {{especially in the case of}} the constant and reduced flow regime. Key words: River regulation – flow patterns – multivariate analysis – fish assemblages – River Lima – Portuga...|$|E
40|$|In {{a survey}} of the west-central Italian rivers Ombrone, Fiora, Albegna and Bruna, among {{established}} exotic species, the <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> Barbus graellsii was recorded in Italian fresh waters for the first time. Morphological identification was supported by comparison of cytochrome b sequences with those from related barbel species. Other exotics of particular note were Barbus barbus. Pseudorasbora parva and Leuciscus cephalus, together with the Padano-Venetian Chondrostoma genei and Padogobius bonelli. Native species still present included Leuciscus lucumonis, Telestes muticellus, Rutilus rubilio and Padogobius nigricans, but were now more restricted to upper reaches and smaller watercourses. The deleterious effect of alien species on native forms is discussed with particular reference to probable competition between C. genei and L. lucumonis, and between the two gobies. The checklist of species introduced to the fresh waters of Italy is now, updated to 34. For the Italian freshwater fish fauna in general, the conservation status of three native species (Acipenser naccari, Salmo marmoratus and Knipowitschia punctatissima) has been improved but five species are believed to he at risk (Salmo carpio, L lucumonis, Scardinius scardafa, Gobio benacensis and P. nigricans) and four anadromous species (Petromyzon murinus, Lampetra fluviatilis, Acipenser sturio and Huso huso) no longer breed in Italian fresh waters. The processes of change in the composition of the Italian freshwater fish fauna as a whole may be summarized as successively 'padanization', 'danubization' and now 'globalization'.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{distribution}} of species life stages at multiple spatial scales is fundamental to both a proper assessment of species management and conservation programmes and the ability to predict the consequences of human disturbances for river systems. The habitat requirements of three native cyprinid species—the <b>Iberian</b> <b>barbel</b> Barbus bocagei Steindachner, the Iberian straight-mouth nase Pseudochondrostoma polylepis (Steindachner), and the Northern straight-mouth nase Pseudochondrostoma duriense (Coelho) —were examined at 174 undisturbed or minimally disturbed sites in 8 river catchments across western Iberia, by modelling occurrence and counts of species life stages at two spatial scales— large (regional) and instream (local) —using hurdle models. All the life stages of the barbel showed a negative association with upstream high-gradient river reaches, whereas juvenile P. duriense favoured such areas. Stream width and openness were negatively related with the occurrence of juvenile and small adult barbel, but not with large adults. Juvenile nase, on the other hand, were found to be mainly confined to fast-flowing habitats with high instream cover and coarser substrata. Advanced life stages of the barbel were mainly associated with the ‘‘pure’’ regional and shared components, whereas the purely local attributes accounted for much of the model variation among nases, in particular juveniles, and juvenile barbel. The results of this study are useful for setting or refining management goals, and highlight the need to separately consider life stages when performing conservation-related studies of species distribution...|$|E
