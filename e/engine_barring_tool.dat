5000|$|The first <b>barring</b> <b>engines</b> or <b>barring</b> gear were manual. At their simplest, {{they were}} a hefty {{engineer}} with a crowbar (hence the term [...] "barring"). The engine's flywheel could be provided {{with a series of}} holes or teeth and a roller fulcrum set into the frame at a convenient place. Later manual <b>barring</b> <b>engines</b> had geared drives and a crank handle. With suitable reduction gears, even very large <b>engines</b> could be <b>barred</b> by hand. This only needed to be done once a day and was not a hurried operation, so speed was not crucial.|$|R
5000|$|For large <b>engines,</b> muscle powered <b>barring</b> is {{sufficiently}} difficult that <b>barring</b> <b>engines</b> are frequently installed. [...] These are small engines with gear teeth cut {{to mate with}} the teeth on the flywheel. Generally, the drive gears of the <b>barring</b> <b>engine</b> are designed to automatically disengage if the engine begins running under its own power while the barring gears are engaged.|$|R

2500|$|Thomas {{moved back}} to the East Coast in 1851, {{settling}} in New York City. He opened a saloon below Barnum's American Museum; {{it would be the first}} of four saloons he would run in New York City over his lifetime. [...] After running this first bar, Thomas went on the road for several years, working as the head bartender at hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a set of solid-silver <b>bar</b> <b>tools.</b> [...] He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed elaborate and flashy techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers. [...] He often wore flashy jewelry and had his <b>bar</b> <b>tools</b> and cups embellished with precious stones and metals. [...] At the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week—more than the Vice President of the United States.|$|R

In 1957, Bill's younger son John joined the North <b>Bar</b> <b>Tool</b> company as the first full-time salesman.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were developed for night journeys and operations on the North-South Railway. In {{order to increase}} {{the area of the}} evaporator, the boiler was increased in length to 3,080 mm and in diameter to 1,219 mm. In addition, the weight and the boiler overpressure were raised. These were the first engines to have an outside frame with outside cylinders. This class was used widely, especially in south Germany and in Austria. All the <b>engines</b> <b>bar</b> one were retired by 1883. The survivor was initially converted to a 0-6-0, and later a 0-4-2 wheel arrangement.|$|R

As industry recovered, 'North Bar Tools' went back its roots in the aerospace industry, manufacturing a range of specialist fitting tools, along with torque wrenches.|$|R
30|$|A spruce {{specimen}} was rubbed {{with the}} metal round <b>bar</b> <b>tool</b> under pressure using our previously reported method [2]. The wood specimen was clamped on a unidirectional movable stage {{in contact with}} the tool and moved in the feed direction under pressure. The pressure of the round <b>bar</b> <b>tool</b> with a diameter of 12  mm on the wood specimen was controlled by the reduction rate, t. The wood specimen was rubbed at a rotation speed of R =  13, 000  rpm at a constant feeding speed of f =  0.2  mm/s. The tool rotated and the feeding direction was set in parallel to L direction. The temperature was measured with an infrared thermal imaging camera as previously reported [2]. The specimen was either rubbed at t =  0.3  mm with the S-tool, or it was first rubbed at t =  0.3  mm and then seven times at t =  0.1  mm. The specimen was finished by rubbing with the MP-tool twice at t =  0.1  mm. To prevent from adhering to the tool surface, linseed oil in the marketplace(Simamoto Inc, Fukuoka, Japan)was applied to each specimen.|$|R

In order {{to solve the}} difficult process of composite materials, this paper proposes to use a method of ultrasonic milling on the composite materials processing, we mainly studies {{the effect of the}} length of the arbor, arbor diameter and arbor end milling platform on the acoustic resonant frequency, amplitude, and anti-resonance frequency. With the decreased in the length of the <b>tool</b> <b>bar,</b> <b>tool</b> <b>bar's</b> resonant frequency increased，and the oscillation amplitude also obviously increased. In the vicinity of 35 KHz amplitude of vibration are largest. Along with <b>tool</b> <b>bar</b> diameter's increasing, the resonant frequency is increases gradually.

50|$|Flair bartending is the {{practice}} of bartenders entertaining guests, clientele or audiences with the manipulation of <b>bar</b> <b>tools</b> (e.g. cocktail shakers) and liquor bottles in tricky, dazzling ways. Used occasionally in cocktail bars, the action requires skills commonly associated with jugglers. It has become a sought-after talent among venue owners and marketers to help advertise a liquor product or {{the opening of a}} bar establishment. Competitions have been sponsored by liquor brands to attract flair bartenders, and some hospitality training companies hold courses to teach flair techniques.|$|R
50|$|There were {{instances}} where a daughter {{was left to}} marry without a dowry, whereas her sisters were given dowries, an indication of paternal control over marriage choices. During the 18th century, as inheritances decreased in size, litigation among siblings became more common. Dowries could include land, {{a house in the}} city, cash, gold dust, gold <b>bars,</b> <b>tools</b> and machinery, cattle, or horses. By the 19th century, economic changes meant that men, typically merchants, brought more to the marriage materially, and the economic dynamics of marriage changed.|$|R

50|$|As mill engines {{became more}} powerful, from around 1870 {{there was a}} shift from single belt drives to {{multiple}} rope drives. The <b>barring</b> <b>engine</b> needed to turn these rope drives over as well (although they were disconnected from the machinery at the remote end) and a simple manual gear was no longer sufficient. Around 1881-1883 there was a shift {{to the use of}} steam-powered <b>barring</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
