40|$|With {{a series}} of {{conformal}} arrays {{it is possible to}} create asymmetric substrates, and it was previously shown that when an ac drive is applied parallel to the asymmetry direction, a pronounced ratchet effect occurs with a net dc flow of vortices {{in the same direction as}} the ac drive. Here we show that when the ac drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction, it is possible to realize a transverse ratchet effect where a net dc flow of vortices is generated perpendicular to the ac drive. The conformal transverse ratchet effect is distinct from previous versions of transverse ratchets in that it occurs due to the generation of non-Gaussian transverse vortex velocity fluctuations by the plastic motion of vortices, so that the system behaves as a noise correlation ratchet. The transverse ratchet effect is much more pronounced in the conformal arrays than in random <b>gradient</b> <b>arrays,</b> and is absent in square <b>gradient</b> <b>arrays</b> due the different nature of the vortex flow in each geometry. We show that {{a series of}} reversals can occur in the transverse ratchet effect due to changes in the vortex flow across the pinning gradient as a function of vortex filling, pinning strength, and ac amplitude. We also consider the case where a dc drive applied perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction generates a net flow of vortices perpendicular to the dc drive, producing a geometric or drift ratchet that arises due to non-Gaussian dynamically generated fluctuations. The drift ratchet is more efficient than the ac driven ratchet and also exhibits a series of reversals for varied parameters. Our results should be general to a wide class of systems undergoing nonequilibrium dynamics on conformal substrates, such as colloidal particles on optical traps. Comment: 16 pages, 21 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{conformal}} transformation of a uniform triangular pinning array produces a structure called a conformal crystal which preserves the six-fold ordering {{of the original}} lattice but contains a gradient in the pinning density. Here we use numerical simulations to show that vortices in type-II superconductors driven with an ac drive over <b>gradient</b> pinning <b>arrays</b> produce the most pronounced ratchet effect {{over a wide range}} of parameters for a conformal <b>array,</b> while square <b>gradient</b> or random <b>gradient</b> <b>arrays</b> with equivalent pinning densities give reduced ratchet effects. In the conformal array, the larger spacing of the pinning sites in the direction transverse to the ac drive permits easy funneling of interstitial vortices for one driving direction, producing the enhanced ratchet effect. In the square array, the transverse spacing between pinning sites is uniform, giving no asymmetry in the funneling of the vortices as the driving direction switches, while in the random array, there are numerous easy-flow channels present for either direction of drive. We find multiple ratchet reversals in the conformal arrays as a function of vortex density and ac amplitude, and correlate the features with a reversal in the vortex ordering, which is greater for motion in the ratchet direction. The enhanced conformal pinning ratchet effect can also be realized for colloidal particles moving over a conformal array, indicating the general usefulness of conformal structures for controlling the motion of particles.

By leveraging microfabrication techniques, this work aims to build biophysical stimuli into cellular substrates through discrete microtopographic features to study cellular responses. Here, uniform and <b>gradient</b> <b>arrays</b> of circular microposts have been geometrically tuned {{to change the}} apparent rigidity of a substrate and the placement of available cellular attachment sites. Three areas of cellular interaction with these micropost array substrates have been investigated: (i) single cell motility, (ii) maintenance and inhibition of collective cell behavior, and (iii) reprogramming and differentiation processes of {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs). Single cell migration was induced through gradients in substrate stiffness and spacing of available attachment sites - phenomena known as durotaxis and herein referred to as spatiotaxis, respectively. Unidirectional micropost <b>arrays</b> <b>gradients</b> were designed with increasing stiffnesses at low and high gradient strengths of 0. 5 nN/&# 956;m and 7. 5 nN/&# 956;m, respectively. On these surfaces, bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were found to preferentially migrate toward the direction of increasing micropost stiffness. In 18 -hour studies, with more than 12 single cells in each case, BAECs had average displacements of 26. 5 ± 8. 7 &# 956;m and 41. 9 ± 14. 7 &# 956;m for the low and high gradient strengths, respectively. Furthermore, BAECs were found to migrate in favor of the direction of decreasing interpost spacing over the direction of increasing stiffness in the prototype micropost arrays, demonstrating that spatial cues can dominate stiffness cues in the migratory response of cells. The maintenance and inhibition of collective cell behavior was studied through changes in substrate stiffness and spacing via uniform and <b>gradient</b> micropost <b>arrays</b> with stiffnesses in the range of 24 - 106 nN/&# 956;m. BAEC collectives directly cultured on these surfaces exhibited area contraction or expansion, which corresponded to maintenance and inhibition of group behavior on soft and stiff substrates, respectively. The micropost mechanical stiffness required for collective-to-single cell transitions was characterized as 30 ± 6 nN/&# 956;m. Effects of spacing on collective cell behavior were also explored, and results showed that BAEC collectives were unable to maintain group behavior with favorable stiffness cues, demonstrating again the significance of micropost spacing. The effects of microtopography on the reprogramming and differentiation of iPSCs was investigated through uniform micropost arrays of varying radii and heights with mouse ear fibroblasts (mERFs) on micropost arrays with stiffnesses in the range of 24 - 2900 nN/&# 956;m. Preliminary results have shown that microtopography had influence over the formation of iPSC colonies and the number of colonies that exhibited beating. Specifically, beating colonies were observed as early as 10 days after the infection of mERFs on micropost surfaces, suggesting that microtopography might direct the differentiation of iPSCs.

Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey using the multi-electrode <b>gradient</b> <b>array</b> was carried out along sixteen radial profiles around the lake to determine the sediment/bedrock contact, impact related structures and the impact direction of the meteorite. The data were corrected for topography and inverted using the L 1 –norm. The subsurface images highlighted areas that are characterized by faults, fractures, lake sediments and impact related breccias such as allochthonous and parautochthonous breccias and dikes. The sediment/bedrock contact, which marks the crater geometry, was successfully mapped and it shows symmetry in the NE–SW direction and dips between 16 0 in the NE to 36 0 in the SW. The faults were mostly delineated {{in the west and}} they dip averagely 60 0 to the east and 80 0 to the west. The dips of the faults were statistically treated and were found to have a preferred direction. The results of the crater geometry and the orientation of the faults indicate that the meteorite came from the NE.

50|$|Microfluidics can {{leverage}} its microscopic {{volume and}} laminar flow characteristics for spatiotemporal control of biochemical factors delivered to stem cells. Microfluidic gradient generators {{have been used}} to study dose-response relationships. Oxygen is an important biochemical factor to consider in differentiation via hypoxia-induced transcription factors (HIFs) and related signaling pathways, most notably in the development of blood, vasculature, placental, and bone tissues. Conventional methods of studying oxygen effects relied on setting the entire incubator at a particular oxygen concentration, which limited analysis to pair-wise comparisons between normoxic and hypoxic conditions instead of the desired concentration-dependent characterization. Developed solutions include the use of continuous axial oxygen <b>gradients</b> and <b>arrays</b> of microfluidic cell culture chambers separated by thin PDMS membranes to gas-filled microchannels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} the width of inter-pixel double {{boundary}} trench isolation on the response resolution of a two dimensional CMOS compatible stacked <b>gradient</b> homojunction photodiode <b>array</b> was simulated. Insulation and P-doped double boundary trench isolation were compared. Both geometries showed improved crosstalk suppression and enhanced sensitivity compared to photodiode geometries previously investigated, combined with a reduction in fabrication complexity for the insulation DBTI configuration. Keywords- CMOS; crosstalk; double boundary trench isolation; inter-pixel nested ridges; quantum efficiency; SiO 2; stacked gradient homojunction photodiode. I...|$|R
