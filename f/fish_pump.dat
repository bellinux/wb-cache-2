The air pump which was a simple idea of using an aquarium <b>fish</b> <b>pump</b> to increase the fluid into the eye in bimanual phaco and co-axial phaco has helped prevent surge. This built the basis of various techniques of forced infusion for small incision cataract surgery. He was also the first to use trypan blue for staining epiretinal membranes and publishing the details in his 4 volume textbook of ophthalmology. He has also discovered a new refractive error called Aberropia. He has also been the first to do a combined surgery of microphakonit (700 micron cataract surgery) with a 25 gauge vitrectomy in the same patient thus having the smallest incisions possible for cataract and vitrectomy. He is also the first surgeon to implant a new mirror telescopic IOL (LMI) for patients suffering from age related macular degeneration. He has also been the first in the world to implant a Glued IOL. In this a PC IOL is fixed in an eye without any capsules using fibrin glue. The Malyugin ring for small pupil cataract surgery was also modified by him as the Agarwal modification of the Malyugin ring for miotic pupil cataract surgeries with posterior capsular defects. Dr.Agarwal’s eye hospital has also done for the first time an Anterior segment transplantation in a 4 month old child with anterior staphyloma.

40|$|Abstract: The low lying {{parts of}} Holland are {{vulnerable}} to flooding and are therefore heavily protected by dykes and several pumping stations. These however cause serious obstacles to migratory <b>fish.</b> <b>Pumping</b> stations can be lethal barriers for fish migration. Currently a lot of pump manufacturers are developing new <b>fish</b> friendly <b>pumps.</b> To fit these new pumps in existing pumping stations, usually civil adjustments are required at considerable costs. A more cost effective alternative would be to perform a fish friendly upgrade of the existing pumps. During the last 3 years Flowserve conducted excessive research to increase their knowledge on <b>fish</b> friendly <b>pump</b> design. This research project led to a comprehensive calculation method to predict survivability rates of <b>fish</b> passing <b>pumps.</b> With this knowledge Flowserve has developed a very cost effective retrofit program to upgrade existing pumping stations equiped with fish unfriendly concrete volute pumps that have open axial flow screw impellers, also known as BVOP pumps. Currently Flowserve has executed several retrofit projects proving fish friendly upgrade possibilities at relatively low costs, lowering the investment threshold to solve fish migration barriers.

40|$|AbstractImproved {{equipment}} and husbandry practices {{are required to}} effectively grade and harvest fish in large land-based culture tanks. The objective of our work was to develop and evaluate several types of relatively inexpensive, portable, and efficient fish handling equipment to reduce the labor requirement for grading and harvesting fish from large circular culture tanks. This {{equipment and}} husbandry practices also had to provide for worker safety and minimize the stress or damage to the fish. Two techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the entire population from a large and deep circular tank, i. e. (a) purse seine and (b) carbon dioxide avoidance response. Two other techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the fish from a large (150 m 3) and deep (2. 44 m) circular culture tank after they had been top-graded in situ using a 3 -panel clam-shell grader: (c) an airlift <b>fish</b> <b>pump</b> and hand sorting/dewatering box and (d) a sidewall drain box for hand sorting/dewatering. Some of these technologies are new, while others (such as the purse seine) {{have been used in}} other applications. Our commercial-scale evaluation of these technologies provided insight into {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each option. With use of the clam-shell grader, the majority of the fish in the culture tank were never lifted from the water during the self-sorting process, which minimized stress, perhaps enhancing final product quality. In contrast, harvesting the tank using the purse seine and hand brailing was much more labor intensive and increased the stress on the fish, as indicated by a nearly 10 -fold increase in fish mortality compared to the mortality observed when the clam-shell type crowder/grader system and an airlift <b>fish</b> <b>pump</b> or sidewall drain box were used during fish harvest. The combination of the clam-shell crowder/grader with the sidewall drain harvest box was our preferred harvest method, because of its low labor requirement, relatively low fish mortality, and rapid harvest rate. We also think that the carbon dioxide avoidance harvest technique can be used effectively, with little labor input and practically zero mortality when the entire fish population must be removed from a fish culture tank, but not during a selective harvest using in situ grading. Ultimately, the more effective technologies and practices should help fish farmers overcome scale-up issues and improve land-based fish farm profitability...|$|E

40|$|After 1971 {{the squid}} T. sagittatus {{did not return}} to Norwegian coastal waters until the autumn of 1977. In August it was {{observed}} near Bergen and Cape Stad farther north, and in September in Vesterålen, North Norway. The fishery started in October in North Norway, lasting till November; near Cape Stad it lasted until the middle of March 1978. The fishery yielded about 200 tonnes. Single squid were still being caught in July. Material for investigation was collected from the fishery and during research cruises (Table 1). Results from earlier investigations (WIBORG 1972) were confirmed. The mean mantle length increased from 28 cm in October to 39 cm in March, the mean weight from 400 g to 1500 g in the same period. The liver weight was usually 10 - 1470 of the total weight, decreasing during winter. Near Cape Stad the squid had a higher weight percentage of liver, maximum 22, with averages of 14 - 15 in October, decreasing to 10 - 12 in January - March. The males constituted about 12 - 14 % of the stock off North Norway in October, decreasing to 7 - 9 % in November. Farther south, males were scarce, in some samples entirely absent. All squid were immature, but a female caught in May had nidamental glands 13 cm long, and eggs in the ovary were 1. 2 - 1. 5 mm in diameter, corresponding to developmental stage III (of four). The same food items were identified in the stomachs as earlier. Fish dominated, mostly herring and saithe, but squid were also usual. The shrimp (Crangon almanni) was very common in the stomachs during winter near Cape Stad. The degree of filling was as a rule low, but near Cape Stad nearly 30 % of the stomachs were full or distended in October, making up to 17 % of the total weight. Information on the occurrence of T. sagittatus in other areas is still scarce. None or very few are taken during the squid fisheries near Ireland and Spain. A few have been caught with pelagic trawls in the Bay of Biscay. Introduction of T. sagittatus as food and snacks on the Norwegian market has met with success.

WATER PRODUCTION: The current combined well and river water supply to the complex is 14, 756 gallons/min. The river pumps are supplying 13, 571 gallons per minute. Well pumps No. 2 and No. 4 are operating and supplying 1, 185 gallons/min. More on well pumps in the well field maintenance section of this report. ACCLIMATION SITES: Preparation of acclimation sites for fish transfer was the main focus for the month of December. Each week thermographs that record water temperature have the data disc changed at the acclimations sites. Ford Excavation with assistance from YKFP maintenance has started clearing snow out of the Easton acclimation site. VEHICLE MAINTENANCE: The snowmobiles were taken in to have annual maintenance performed. The full-size John Deere tractor needed and was taken to Barnet Implement in Yakima. The tractor needed a new clutch installed and was picked up on the 31 st. SHOP BUILDING MAINTENANCE: On the 12 th the facility domestic water hydro pneumatic tank and its system malfunctioned. The problem persisted and had to be dealt with multiple times; first it caused the tank to over flow and floods the shop. Wallace Electric was called and after extensive monitoring of the tank, compressor and electrical operations an electrical relay switch was replaced. Weekly cleaning and tool inventory continues to be a priority. The shop is home to our liberation truck along with fish transfer equipment, <b>fish</b> <b>pump</b> and seine nets. ELECTRICAL BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The large generator is located in the electrical building and is checked daily for routine inspections. HATCHERY BUILDING MAINTENANCE: The incubation building is being used to clean and repair isolation buckets, egg incubation baskets and troughs. An experiment involving remote site incubators (RSI's) continued through the month. Chad Stockton, WDFW, records flows and monitors emergence of fry on a daily basis. Chad is working with Steve S. and Curt K. on the RSI's research along with spawning channel fry emergence. RIVERWATER COOLING FACILITY: The one pump in operation in this building is checked daily during our routine inspections, the variable pump is supplying water to the artificial spawning channel. RIVER PUMP STATION MAINTENANCE: All four river pumps are in operation and pumping {approx} 13, 571 gallons/min to the facility. The building is cleaned monthly and the air burst system is cycled daily during the morning checks. The crew continued weekly changing of the graph paper on the river temperature thermograph throughout the month, continuing this activity as part of the daily checks routine. WELL FIELD MAINTENANCE: Wells No. 1 and No. 4 were in operation and supplying 1, 185 gallons/minute to the facility and incubation building. Weekly test well readings are recorded and sent via fax to CH 2 MHILL. Also weekly well meter readings are recorded. Well No. 5 had been determined to have a faulty drain valve while trying to operate the pump for emergency water usage.

Lack of migration (eels), presence of fish or insufficient species composition with a narrow range in length class at the moment of the research leads to unreliable conclusions. Therefore a guideline is developed, based on forced exposure of fish, to test and evaluate <b>fish</b> friendly <b>pumps</b> with a standardized method: “VisAdvies protocol for testing and evaluating pumping station <b>pumps</b> on <b>fish</b> survivability”. The protocol serves two purposes. First, the guideline gives direction to the way the test should be performed.

40|$|Many pumping {{stations}} in drainage & irrigation applications are currently equipped with conventional (not <b>fish</b> friendly designed) <b>pumps.</b> Field tests {{have been performed}} [1] for several pump types of a certain size at certain pumping conditions to assess survival rates of <b>fish</b> passing through <b>pumps.</b> In order to compare different pump types of different sizes at different pumping conditions, a general criterion is required. Testing of <b>fish</b> friendliness of <b>pumps</b> is expensive and involves animal tests with living fish for which permits are required. Therefore, pump manufacturers prefer to perform fish friendliness tests for a single pump size. In order to convert such results to other pump sizes, a scaling law is desired. Van Esch [2, 3] made a first attempt to address scaling principles for <b>fish</b> friendliness of <b>pumps.</b> In {{the current study a}} general criterion is described to predict <b>fish</b> friendliness of <b>pumps</b> by means of models of mortality rates of <b>fish</b> passing through <b>pumps.</b> The criterion is validated with literature data [1 – 3] and experimental full-scale test data from the newly developed fish-friendly axial flow concrete volute pump by Flowserve with an impeller diameter of 850 mm. The full-scale tests involved a total of 1800 roach, perch and eel deployed over 7 pumping conditions, including 3 different heads and 5 different rotational speeds. The fish-friendliness criterion includes different aspects that together predict the survival rate of <b>fish</b> passing through <b>pumps.</b> The first and most important contributor is the impeller, which can have an axial, mixed or radial flow design. The criterion involves the leading edge shape of the blades. Secondly, the diffuser or volute is considered, which provides a strike probability with diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s). In case the gap between the trailing edge of the impeller vanes and {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s) is small relative to the fish size, there is the possibility of a “scissor” effect. Research in the USA for fish friendliness of hydropower turbines [4 – 7] showed that shear velocity and pressure drops can be of importance. Also cavitation (involves pressure drop & vapor bubble implosions), recirculation and turbulence can influence survival rates. At this stage these flow effects are roughly captured using the pump performance curve. This way, extensive CFD calculations to evaluate detailed flow effects can be avoided. For open impellers, the gap between the impeller vanes and wear ring is included in the criterion. In addition, fish species-dependent effects are taken into account, since fish vary widely in their internal and external building plan. For instance salmonid, percid and cyprinid fish respond differently to the same pump design than for example eel. Sharp edges and rough surfaces (for example caused by cavitation, erosion or corrosion) can also be harmful to fish but are not included at this stage...|$|R

At {{the end of their}} live set, during the [...] "Iron Maiden" [...] song, a <b>fish</b> tank <b>pump</b> was used to squirt fake blood out of the mask's mouth, which typically covered their then-drummer Doug Sampson. After this initial incarnation, Beasley constructed a larger mask out of fibreglass, equipped with flashing eyes and the ability to release red smoke from its mouth.|$|R
40|$|A 41 cm {{diameter}} Wemco-Hidrostal pump {{was evaluated}} for fish passage {{as part of}} research to improve salvage operations at the Bureau of Reclamation 2 ̆ 7 s Tracy Fish Collection Facility, Tracy, California. Immediate and 96 -hour mortality, descaling, and injury rates were evaluated for striped bass, Morone saxatilis, steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, wakasagi, Hypomesus nipponensis, and delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus. Test fish inserted into the intake of the Hidrostal pump were compared to control fish that were inserted into the exit. The pump had to significant effect on immediate or 96 -h mortality for all species tested, with immediate and 96 -h mortality below 3 percent for all trials. Averaged scale loss was below 2. 6 percent for all species. Some non-lethal injuries to the head, eyes, skin, and fins of <b>pumped</b> <b>fish</b> occurred; however, these injuries {{were not significantly different}} among quality control, control, and treatment fish. No statistically significant relationships were detected between <b>fish</b> motility and <b>pump</b> speed, injected <b>fish</b> density, or debris load. Wakasagi appeared to be more tolerant to pump passage than delta smelt and may not be an appropriate surrogate species for delta smelt. Our results suggest that large Hidrostal pumps have the capacity to transport live fish with low mortality and minimal body injury...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of mercury vapour lights as an attractant of fish to the modified <b>fish</b> handling <b>pump</b> (Tempering pump No 8) in the Nanticoke TGS forebay was assessed. Acoustic fish census equipment {{was used to}} assess attraction of fish to the lights while a trawl net was used to collect fish passing through the pump. The mercury vapour lights successfully attracted fish in the forebay to the area of the bar racks. Although it appeared that many fish escaped capture in the trawl net due to mesh size and flow characteristics, catches were higher when mercury vapour lights were used to illuminate the outside and inside of the bar racks for 5 minutes. Although further tests should be conducted, it appears that in the absence of tempering, a combination of mercury vapour and strobe lights will increase the quantity of fish passing through Tempering Pump No 8...|$|R
40|$|None supplied. From introduction: Vertically {{rotating}} screens are {{utilized in}} power plant screenwells for removal of trash from the cooling water upstream of the circulating <b>pumps.</b> <b>Fish</b> in the screenwell will eventually impinge on the screens and get washed {{off with the}} trash. A full scale screenwell model was built and operated by Alden Research Laboratories so that Stone and Webster could test the feasibility of such a scheme with fish. Detailed hydraulic testing {{had not yet been}} initiated and results of fish testing are discussed in {{the main body of the}} report...|$|R
5000|$|Often {{the reason}} for having a pond in a garden is to keep fish, often koi, though many people keep goldfish. Both are hardy, {{colorful}} fish which require no special heating, provided the pond is located in an area which does not have extremes of temperature that would affect the fish. If <b>fish</b> are kept, <b>pumps</b> and filtration devices are usually {{needed in order to}} keep enough oxygen in the water to support them. In winter, a small heater may need to be used in cold climates to keep the water from freezing solid. Examples of common pond fish include: ...|$|R
