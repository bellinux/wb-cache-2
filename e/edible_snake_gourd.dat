Results of the proximate analysis of fresh <b>snake</b> <b>gourd</b> and tomatoes show that the essential minerals such as protein, ash, fibre, lipid, phosphorus and niacin contents were higher in <b>snake</b> <b>gourd</b> but low in carbohydrate, calcium, iron, vitamins A and C {{when compared to the}} mineral fractions of tomatoes which has high values of calcium, iron, vitamins A and C. The mycoflora predominantly associated with the fruit rot of tomato were Fusarium oxysporium, Fusarium moniliforme, Rhizopus stolonifer and Aspergillus niger, while other fungi isolates from <b>Snake</b> <b>gourd</b> include Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tamari, Penicillium ita/icum and Neurospora crassa. Rhizopus stolonifer and Aspergillus niger were common spoilage fungi to both the Tomato and <b>Snake</b> <b>gourd.</b> All the fungal isolates were found to be pathogenic. The duration for storage of the fruits at room temperature (28 ± 1 °C) showed that Tomato could store for 5 days while <b>Snake</b> <b>gourd</b> stored for as much as 7 days.

Hence, in the present study, a tissue culture-independent genetic transformation system for <b>snake</b> <b>gourd</b> was developed using seed as an explant. <b>Snake</b> <b>gourd</b> seeds were infected with three A. tumefaciens strains harbouring pGA 492 plasmid, and the transformants were selected against BASTA(A (R)).
