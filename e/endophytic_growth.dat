40|$|A {{variety of}} {{verrucous}} and papillary lesions affect the oral mucosa. Those which are benign and reactive, e. g. squamous papilloma, verruciform xanthoma, usually present little diagnostic difficulty.

Methods: A retrospective, non-comparative, observational {{case study of}} patients diagnosedwith retinal capillary hemangiomas was conducted. Twelve patients(13 eyes) at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital of Kaohsiung from July 1987 toJune 2001 were reviewed. Pre- and post-treatment visual acuity and ocularcomplications are described. Results: One patient had bilateral and another had unilateral juxtapapillary hemangiomas. All of the other 10 patients were diagnosed with peripheral retinalcapillary hemangiomas. More patients had retinal capillary hemangiomaslocated in the temporal peripheral retina and all had <b>endophytic</b> <b>growth</b> patterns.

Because {{of its high}} annual biomass production rates and its characteristics as a low-input crop, an expansion of field cultivation can be anticipated to cover increasing demands for sustainable biomass production. However, knowledge about pathogens that could {{have an impact on}} biomass production is still limited for M. giganteus. Here, we report about the isolation of the filamentous fungus Apinisia graminicola from necrotic leaf lesions of M. giganteus grown on a field trial plot in Northern Germany. Inoculation assays with the isolated A. graminicola strain confirmed its capacity to cause a leaf spot disease on M. giganteus. Additional inoculation assays revealed that A. graminicola also caused necrotic lesions on leaves of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. Generally, symptoms of A. graminicola-caused leaf spot disease were stronger on B. distachyon compared to M. giganteus. Incubation temperatures above 22 °C during A. graminicola infection resulted in stronger disease symptoms on both, M. giganteus and B. distachyon leaves. Microscopic analysis of cross sectioned, infected leaf tissue revealed an epiphytic mycelium formation on the surface and an endophytic colonization of the mesophyll leave tissue, especially in M. giganteus. Our results revealed that the isolated A. graminicola strain is a causal agent of a leaf spot disease on grass leaves.

Here we report cytological and molecular evidence for maize resistance to head smut. During early stages of root infection, S. reilianum mycelium was capable of penetrating the root epidermis of both resistant (Ji 1037) and susceptible (HZ 4) inbred lines. S. reilianum hyphae were observed in the root–stem junction at 6 days after inoculation. In an attempt to monitor hyphal spread within the maize plant, a highly specific and sensitive real-time PCR method was established to estimate the hyphal content in infected maize tissues. During the upward <b>growth</b> of <b>endophytic</b> S. reilianum, the extent of hyphal spread was markedly different between Ji 1037 and HZ 4.

The qPCR results showed that the resistant lines contained little P. brassicae DNA and there seemed to be little to no change in the amount of DNA over time. In contrast, there was a considerable increase in pathogen DNA in susceptible lines from 0 to 24 days post inoculation (dpi). These results were also reflected in observations made by a fungal staining method. In addition, leaf samples of these DH lines, collected at three different times from winter oilseed rape field experiments, were analysed using qPCR.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{evaluated}} the clinical significance and prognostic value of histopathological features of bladder cancer, such as subepithelial growth patterns and tumor growth pattern at the invasion front. Methods In total, 130 patients newly diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and underwent transurethral resection between 1998 and 2009 were enrolled. Subepithelial growth patterns consisting of <b>endophytic</b> <b>growth</b> pattern (EGP) and von Brunn's nest involvement (VBNI) were investigated using hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and their frequency of occurrence, prognostic value, and correlation with other clinicopathological features was evaluated. Results EGP and VBNI {{were found in}} 40 (30. 8 %) and 5 (3. 9 %) of the 130 cases, respectively. Of the 26 pT 1 tumors, the growth pattern at the invasion front was trabecular in 17 (65. 4 %) and infiltrative in 9 (34. 6 %). Although 8 (47. 1 %) of 17 trabecular tumors coexisted with EGP, no cases with infiltrative tumors had EGP (p = 0. 023). VBNI correlated with high tumor grades (p = 0. 006) and lymphovascular involvement (p = 0. 026). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that tumor diameter less than 3 cm (p = 0. 04) and intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin therapy (p = 0. 004) were independent favorable prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival, whereas tumor stage was an independent poor prognostic factor for disease progression (p = 0. 006). Conclusions Subepithelial growth patterns were not a significant prognostic factor in this study. Additionally, no tumors with an infiltrative growth pattern coexisted with EGP, suggesting that determining the presence of EGP might be helpful for managing non-muscle invasive bladder cancers. </p...|$|E

We examined histologic features and undertook immunohistochemical staining and UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine whether these methods could aid in making this distinction. We examined histologic sections from 15 inverted papillomas and 29 urothelial carcinomas with an inverted growth pattern. Each tumor was stained with antibodies to Ki- 67, p 53, and cytokeratin 20. In addition, each tumor was examined with UroVysion FISH for gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and for loss of chromosome 9 p 21 signals. None of the inverted papillomas stained positively for Ki- 67 or for cytokeratin 20. Only 1 of 15 inverted papillomas stained positively for p 53. By contrast, 66 %, 59 %, and 59 % of urothelial carcinomas with an inverted growth pattern stained positively for Ki- 67, p 53, and cytokeratin 20, respectively. Only 3 of the urothelial carcinomas stained negatively for all 3 immunohistochemical markers. UroVysion FISH produced normal results for all cases of inverted papilloma. By contrast, 21 of 29 cases (72 %) of urothelial carcinoma with an inverted growth pattern demonstrated chromosomal abnormalities typical of urothelial cancer and were considered positive by UroVysion FISH criteria.

Fruit and seed of both epiparasites were small compared to those of their parasitic hosts. Seed of epiparasites was established on parasitic-host stems, leaves, and inflorescences. Shoots developed from the plumular region or from buds on the holdfast or subjacent tissue. The developing endophytic system initially consisted of multiple separate strands that widened, merged, and often entirely displaced its parasitic host from the cambial cylinder.

Crop plants and pathogens interact in response to changes in environmental conditions. Recent predictions made by combining climate model data with an oilseed rape growth model and a phoma stem canker model suggest that yield will increase in the UK, especially in Scotland, whereas potential losses from phoma stem canker will be greatest in southern England 2. Oilseed rape production in China is threatened by the possible arrival of Leptosphaeria maculans, a more virulent causal agent of phoma stem canker than the existing species Leptosphaeria biglobosa 3. A strong correlation found between sulphur dioxide concentration and the ratio of Phaeosphaeria nodorum to Zymoseptoria graminicola in archived wheat samples at Rothamsted Research (1844 to date) suggests that subtle environmental changes can also cause changes in pathogen populations 4.

40|$|Mycosphaerella graminicola causes one of {{the most}} {{damaging}} diseases of wheat. M. graminicola has a large arsenal of secreted proteins expressed during infection that includes Candidate Effectors (CE, n ≥ 171) 1. However, it remains unclear how CEs facilitate the initial symptomless phase, support fungal invasion and trigger the formation of necrotic sporulating lesions. Using the annotated IPO 323 reference genome 2, we selected 27 genes encoding small secreted proteins (i. e., MgSSPs) likely specifically expressed during infection according to EST data. We explored the temporal expression of these genes by quantitative RT-PCR during compatible and incompatible interactions. We have confirmed that most of the selected MgSSPs (75 %) are over-expressed (10 to 8000 fold) during plant infection compared to mycelium grown in vitro. Among these MgSSPs, we observed groups of CEs specifically expressed to each step of the infectious process. The peak of expression of most of these MgSSPs (75 %) was observed during the late symptomless phase (7 - 10 days postinoculation, dpi), with a dramatic decrease at early stages of lesion formation (≥ 14 dpi). This expression pattern was also observed for the known chitin-binding effector ECP 6 required for infection 3. Such effectors might be involved in <b>endophytic</b> <b>growth</b> or plant defense suppression during the symptomless phase. Few other MgSSPs (15 %) have their peak of expression during the early necrotic symptom phase associated with exponential fungal growth (≥ 12 - 14 dpi, n = 1) or later during the necrotic phase (15 - 21 dpi, n = 2). These effectors might play a role in triggering either necrotic symptoms, massive colonization of host tissues or pycnidia formation. The functional analysis of some of these genes is underway to validate their role during infection...|$|E
40|$|Enterobacter sp. 638 is an <b>endophytic</b> plant <b>growth</b> {{promoting}} gamma-proteobacterium {{that was}} {{isolated from the}} stem of poplar (Populus trichocarpa 6 deltoides cv. H 11 - 11), a potentially important biofuel feed stock plant. The Enterobacter sp. 638 genome sequence reveals {{the presence of a}} 4, 518, 712 bp chromosome and a 157, 749 bp plasmid (pENT 638 - 1). Genome annotation and comparative genomics allowed the identification of an extended set of genes specific to the plant niche adaptation of this bacterium. This includes genes that code for putative proteins involved in survival in the rhizosphere (to cope with oxidative stress or uptake of nutrients released by plant roots), root adhesion (pili, adhesion, hemagglutinin, cellulose biosynthesis), colonization/establishment inside the plant (chemiotaxis, flagella, cellobiose phosphorylase), plant protection against fungal and bacterial infections (siderophore production and synthesis of the antimicrobial compounds 4 -hydroxybenzoate and 2 -phenylethanol), and improved poplar growth and development through the production of the phytohormones indole acetic acid, acetoin, and 2, 3 -butanediol. Metabolite analysis confirmed by quantitative RT–PCR showed that, the production of acetoin and 2, 3 -butanediol is induced by the presence of sucrose in the growth medium. Interestingly, both the genetic determinants required for sucrose metabolism and the synthesis of acetoin and 2, 3 butanediol are clustered on a genomic island. These findings point to a close interaction between Enterobacter sp. 638 and its poplar host, where the availability of sucrose, a major plant sugar, affects the synthesis of plant growth promotin...|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some <b>endophytic</b> fungi, or <b>growth</b> by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|R
40|$|Classical {{biological}} control aims to actively manage threats that cause immense losses in biological diversity. The {{introduction of a}} {{biological control}} agent Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. miconiae (Cgm) in April 2000 to Tahiti, French Polynesia was intended to control the massive spread of an invasive weed Miconia calvescens. However, while Cgm has subsequently spread to Mo’orea, its impact on reducing M. calvescens remains uncertain. The main objectives of this study are: (1) to quantify {{the amount of the}} fungal pathogen infecting the M. calvescens plants at three elevation ranges on Mo’orea, (2) to understand the impact of moisture on the proliferation of disease development, and (3) to test the influence of endophytic fungal communities on the competitive ability of Cgm. Results from quantifying leaf damage showed that at higher elevations, Cgm disease development is more rampant. In laboratory experiments, varying moisture did not significantly affect the health of the seedling. While Cgm growth rate correlates with competitive ability, <b>endophytic</b> fungal <b>growth</b> rate does not, leading to speculation that other modes such as chemical interactions allow for endophytic competitive ability. Lastly, data supports the hypothesis that Cgm becomes a better competitor against the endophytic fungal species at higher elevations. Results {{of this study suggest that}} other microclimatic factors such as temperature and humidity may play a role in disease development. While Cgm may decelerate the growth of M. calvescens, Cgm alone is not likely to obliterate the massive damage M. calvescens has done on the native flora of Mo’orea and its surrounding islands. Conservation biologists must urgently attack this pest, or the fragile ecosystem of the islands will lead to massive losses in biological diversity...|$|R
40|$|Leptosphaeria maculans, {{the fungus}} {{responsible}} for stem canker of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), presents a particular genome structure divided into gene-rich and transposable element (TE) -rich regions. The latter are proposed to be heterochromatic domains, {{as they are}} gene-poor, TE-rich and present lower recombination rates than gene-rich regions. While overall gene-poor, TE-rich regions are enriched for putative effector genes specifically expressed {{during the early stages}} of plant infection (‘early’ effector genes). In contrast, effector genes expressed during the late stages of infection (<b>endophytic</b> <b>growth</b> and stem necrosis, ‘late’ effector genes) are located in gene-rich regions. We investigated the concerted expression of ‘early’ effector genes by assessing whether TE-rich regions could be targets of reversible chromatin modifications that affect the regulation of effector gene expression. We first examined the involvement of one histone modification, histone H 3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H 3 K 9 me 3) in chromatin-based regulation of effector gene expression. For this purpose, we silenced expression of two key players in heterochromatin assembly and maintenance, HP 1 and KMT 1, by RNAi. Silencing of HP 1 and KMT 1 led to an over-expression of ‘early’ effector genes in TE-rich regions during in vitro growth (but no induction of ‘late’ effector gene expression). The increase of expression was associated with a reduction of H 3 K 9 tri-methylation at two effector-encoding gene loci. Our data strongly suggest that a chromatin-based control, mediated by HP 1 and KMT 1, represses the expression of {{at least part of the}} ‘early’ effector genes located in TE-rich regions during growth in axenic culture. We are currently investigating the role of another key player in heterochromatin assembly, KMT 6, involved in the heterochromatic-associated histone modification H 3 K 27 me 3, on the control of effector gene expressio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pseudomonas syringae is {{pathogenic}} to a {{large number}} of plant species. For host colonization and disease progression, strains of this bacterium utilize an array of type III-secreted effectors and other virulence factors, including small secreted molecules such as syringolin A, a peptide derivative that inhibits the eukaryotic proteasome. In strains colonizing dicotyledonous plants, the compound was demonstrated to suppress the salicylic-acid-dependent defense pathway. Here, we analyze virulence factors of three strains colonizing wheat (Triticum aestivum) : P. syringae pathovar syringae (Psy) strains B 64 and SM, as well as P. syringae BRIP 34876. These strains have a relatively small repertoire of only seven to eleven type III secreted effectors (T 3 Es) and differ in their capacity to produce syringolin A. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the contribution of various known virulence factors in the context of a small T 3 E repertoire. Results: We demonstrate that syringolin A production enhances disease symptom development upon direct infiltration of strains into wheat leaves. However, it is not universally required for colonization, as Psy SM, which lacks syringolin biosynthesis genes, reaches cell densities comparable to syringolin A producer P. syringae BRIP 34876. Next, we show that despite the small set of T 3 E-encoding genes, the type III secretion system remains the key pathogenicity determinant in these strains, and that phenotypic effects of deleting T 3 E-coding genes become apparent only when multiple effectors are removed. Conclusions: Whereas production of syringolin A is not required for successful colonization of wheat leaves by P. syringae strains, its production results in increased lesion formation. Despite the small number of known T 3 Es encoded by the analyzed strains, the type III secretion system is essential for <b>endophytic</b> <b>growth</b> of these strains...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to assess}} the {{parameters}} characterizing {{a relationship between the}} histological and growth patterns and grade of a malignant tumor, the nature of regional and distant metastases, patient gender and age, and the type of urgent complications in colorectal cancer. Subjects and methods. Information on 1098 patients with urgent colonic cancer types treated in Smolensk and its region in the period 2001 to 2013 was studied. This information was given from the records of the Clinical Emergency Medical Care Hospital, City Clinical Hospital One, the Smolensk Regional Clinical Hospital, Smolensk Regional Oncology Clinical Dispensary, and the central district hospitals of the Smolensk Region. Morphological examinations were made at the Smolensk Regional Institute of Pathology. Results. Among the examinees, the proportion of women and men was 54. 4 % (n = 597) and 45. 6 % (n = 501), respectively. The investigation recorded exophytic, endophytic, and mixed tumor growth patterns in 46. 5, 52. 3, and 1. 2 %, respectively. The endophytic cancer growth pattern was most commonly complicated by acute intestinal obstruction, perifocal inflammation, tumor perforation, and concomitant complications. At the same time, the exophytic growth pattern was characterized by enteric bleeding in 89 % of cases. Complications, such as tumor perforation and enteric bleeding, are more commonly attended with tumor ulceration that was usually detected on the left side (in as high as 80. 2 % of cases). A malignant tumor was most frequently recorded to grow into the retroperitoneal fat, small bowel, mesentery, and other colonic segments (15. 0, 15. 3, and 14. 5 %, respectively). The most common complications in moderate-grade adenocarcinoma were enteric bleeding and tumor perforation (80. 8 and 76. 5 %, respectively; p < 0. 05). Regional colorectal cancer metastases were generally usually recorded in patients aged less than 60 years (64 %). Higher distant metastasis rates were noted in those aged over 80 years (44. 7 %). Conclusion. Colon cancer is most commonly complicated by ileus, perforation, and concomitant complications and mainly characterized by the left-sided location, obvious local extent, and poor survival prognosis of the <b>endophytic</b> <b>growth</b> pattern, ulceration, moderate and highgrade of cancer. </p...|$|E
