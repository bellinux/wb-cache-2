Patton, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex. Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans <b>into</b> <b>believing</b> that the main attack would take place at Calais. Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there.
