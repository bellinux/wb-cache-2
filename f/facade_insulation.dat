The calculation of energy savings in the production of the insulation material is based on ISO 14025 Principles and Procedure of Environmental Labels and Declarations. The calculation of energy savings in the process of building operation is based on comparing the heat energy losses through the external walls of a model Moscow apartment building before and after <b>façade</b> <b>insulation.</b> The insulation material used is 100 -mm ISOVER's staple glass wool with synthetic binding agents. The insulation system type is hinged ventilated facade. The calculations yield a decrease in heat leakage through II- 18 / 12 buildings’ external walls over heating period, achieved through <b>façade</b> <b>insulation.</b> Based on the calculated decrease in transmission loss, we were able to evaluate the energy savings potentially achieved over the life cycle of the insulation. The energy used to produce a unit of insulation material was compared to the amount of energy saved throughout the life cycle...|$|E

Results refer to the complete building stock of the Italian school buildings based on a census of the Italian Ministry of Education. The selected school sample consists {{of more than one}} hundred Italian schools of all levels (from nursery to upper secondary school) located in three Italian regions, built in different time periods and with different building techniques. The selected sample is representative of typical Italian schools. The <b>façade</b> sound <b>insulation</b> and the reverberation time of each school have been measured. The average outdoor noise level of about half the investigated schools has been measured and, for each school, the age of the building and the main characteristics of the façade have been listed (kind of glass, kind of ventilation, windows size, etc.). Based on these data, the correlations between both the main characteristics of the façades and the year of construction and the <b>façade</b> sound <b>insulation</b> have been investigated. Moreover, the influence of the noise coming from outdoor on the indoor noise level, speech intelligibility and speech to noise ratio have been analysed with reference to the situations {{both before and after the}} works carried out to improve the acoustic performances of façades. Results show that the indoor sound pressure level due to traffic noise is considerably reduced after the improvement of the <b>façade</b> acoustic <b>insulation,</b> while further treatments to indoor surfaces should be necessary to reduce internal reverberation time and to improve speech intelligibility...|$|R
30|$|The {{negative}} effects of the noise may be reduced through legislation, e.g. requirement of less noisy technology, investments, such as noise barriers, or infrastructure use charges that punish more noisy vehicles and lead to a reduction of the noise level.

40|$|Abstract. Various facade facings – systems made {{of thermal}} {{insulation}} materials with the finishing facade renders which are directly {{applied to the}} facade walls are simple for construction and are applied in the newly built structures, and they are also suitable for the application {{in the cases of}} the energy revitalization of the existing buildings. The exterior walls, and especially their outer layers, are exposed to various atmospheric influences. They cause different effects in the walls, one of them being the occurrence of the water vapor condensation. In the walls with the <b>facade</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> systems, the occurrence of the water vapor condensation may be caused by the vapor diffusion characteristics of the exterior render. At certain temperatures and humidity of the external and internal air, there are several conditions for the occurrence of the water vapor condensation in the wall with the <b>facade</b> thermal <b>insulation</b> system, when the exterior render is of higher relative resistance to the water vapor diffusion. Therefore, it is useful to determine the vapor diffusion characteristics, that is, highest values of the relative resistance to the water vapor diffusion of the exterior renders which will not cause the condensation of the water vapor in the wall, or at least those that will not cause the impermissible dampening of the wall material, and will allow for the possibility of moisture drying. 1...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the last}} five years energy {{efficiency}} measures, including additional thermal insulation of the building façade as well as replacement of old wooden frame windows for polyvinyl chloride ones, were implemented in majority of Latvian daycare centers. However, these actions alone possess great risk of indoor air quality problems, since buildings became more airtight leading to insufficient air exchange indoors. Since Latvian {{children under the age of}} 7 can spend up to 60 hours per week in daycare centers it is very important to establish a healthy and comfortable daycare environment that children will find pleasant and stimulating to stay in. Therefore the main aim of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of <b>façade</b> <b>insulation</b> on indoor air quality in Latvian daycare centers. The study’s three major tasks include: 1. Indoor air quality assessment in selected six daycare centers (old, renovated and new-built), using carbon dioxide, air temperature and relative humidity as indicators. 2. Comparison of building <b>façade</b> <b>insulation</b> methods. 3. Estimation of correlation between indoor air parameters and heating energy demand, in moderate climate zone of Latvia. Measurements of carbon dioxide, air temperature and relative humidity were carried out during the period of one week in October 2010, and data regarding daycare center characteristics and maintenance activities was collected via combination of field visits, record analysis and interviews. The field study showed that different types of building construction as well as ventilation strategies employed by daycare centers can cause significant variations in atmospheric and thermal environment. It was found that carbon dioxide concentrations exceeded 1000 ppm in 75 % of daycare centers studied, with the highest (1356 ppm) measured in a renovated facility with the natural ventilation system. Thus installation of more efficient ventilation system (mechanical) is recommended to provide acceptable indoor air quality, since opening of windows itself cannot provide the optimal conditions indoors. In all facilities the temperature was kept above 20 °C and the average relative humidity was 40 ± 5 %, creating comfortable thermal environment for children. Thesis project also includes use of building simulation tool BSim to create model of typical daycare center space, and consequently further examine the effect of different energy efficiency improvement measures on indoor air quality and comfort. The results of this thesis could be further applied for future renovation projects of daycare centers, as well as schools etc...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the building acoustic prediction models in EN 12354 started twenty years ago, since the CPD made it necessary within Europe to link the acoustic performance of building products and elements {{to the performance of}} buildings.

But drafting these prediction models made clear what type of input data was still missing and what type of product quantities and measurement methods should be added.

The environmental impacts were allocated to single building elements. Ventilation, heat losses through roofs and external walls are important for a majority of single- and multi-family houses. Three improvement options were identified: additional roof insulation, additional <b>façade</b> <b>insulation</b> and new sealings to reduce ventilation. The measures yield a significant environmental improvement potential, which, for a majority of the buildings types analyse represent at least 20 % compared to the base case.

A solution to the problem would be a mechanical ventilation system, but several problems are experienced when implementing it - no place for installing air ducts, cold air inflow or additional energy needed for incoming air preheating. Ventilation using heat recovery units is the one method out of many other energy saving measures. The advantage of using heat recovery units is energy saving, and as a result, savings on costs of the operation of the ventilation system. This paper describes the renovation carried out in 4 -storey apartment buildings. In the course of the study, two buildings were analysed, both belonging to the series buildings of the Soviet Era (103 series), built in 1970 using the same materials, the same construction solutions. The renovation was carried out by one company, using the same materials and the same renovation principles for both buildings. The only difference after the renovation is that a new centralized mechanical ventilation system with a heat recovery unit is installed in one of the buildings, while in the second building the natural ventilation system is preserved. The arrangement of the mechanical ventilation system is rather innovative as the ventilation ducts in the building for fresh air supply are integrated into the <b>facade's</b> <b>insulation</b> layer and enter the living room through the wall directly behind heating radiators. The main questions studied {{in the course of the}} research are the efficiency of the mechanical ventilation system heat recovery, the building's air tightness, and the overall system efficiency...|$|R
