25|$|Schmeling's {{study of}} Louis' style {{led him to}} openly say, in days before the fight, {{that he had found}} the key to victory; fans thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> raise {{interest}} in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.|$|E
500|$|Dworsky was {{eventually}} told {{to stop working}} on the drawings before he completed them, but he defended himself against Gehry's criticism. [...] "Knowledgeable people were supportive of us. They were saying it's a very complex and unusual design, and they can understand the difficulties in trying to achieve this within a limited budget and a limited schedule. It was unfortunate that Frank came out with his criticism, {{but he was the}} center of the storm, having designed the building, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> lessen the blame on himself." ...|$|E
5000|$|As Bobby {{is walking}} back to town Jake pulls up beside him and offers him a lift. After a casual {{conversation}} about Grace, Jake asks Bobby if he would kill her for a price.

6000|$|... "Nothing! What can I! There isn't {{anything}} to do anything about. If it's there, he knows it, and he's left it there because he didn't care what we thought. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> something. <b>He's</b> always treated me like a perfect--child. That's all there is of it, and you know it." ...|$|R

500|$|During the {{immediate}} post-UDI period Beadle, {{in his role}} as Chief Justice, occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all the main players—Gibbs, Smith and Wilson. He became the main intermediary between them, and received a dormant commission from the UK government to replace Gibbs as Governor in case of necessity. He visited London in January 1966 and, according to Wilson's Attorney General Elwyn Jones, was [...] "scornful of the 1965 constitution". Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London, or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith. The Chief Justice insisted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do his best for Rhodesia, a claim Smith accepted, saying Beadle [...] "thought more of his country than of his position". The UK Foreign Office remained wary, speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia [...] "in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented, racial attitudes changed, and the path to majority rule firmly laid," [...] the Chief Justice [...] "would be content to see a 1961-type constitution, without independence, remain for a long time".|$|E
60|$|But when Blacky {{showed that}} nest of Hooty's to Farmer Brown's {{boy with the}} hope that Farmer Brown's boy would steal those eggs, there was {{blackness}} in his heart. He was doing something then which was pure meanness. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make trouble for Hooty, to get even because Hooty had been too smart for him. He had sat in the top of a tall pine-tree where he could see all that happened, and he had chuckled wickedly as he had seen Farmer Brown's boy climb to Hooty's nest and take out an egg. He felt sure that he would take both eggs. He hoped so, anyway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{all this}} time some one had been {{watching}} him, though he didn't know it. It was Old Mother Nature. One day she stopped {{him as he was}} trotting along a path. 'What is this you are doing when you think no one is watching?' she demanded, looking very cross. 'Haven't I given you beauty and speed? And yet you are not satisfied!' Mr. Deer hung his head. Then suddenly he threw it up proudly and told Old Mother Nature that he had not complained, but that through his own efforts <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> add to the blessings which he did have, and he explained why he wanted to learn to jump. Old Mother Nature heard him through. 'Let me see you jump over that bush,' she snapped crossly, pointing to a bush almost as high as Mr. Deer himself.|$|E

Unfortunately Greer buys this and has the company march around barefoot all day, but they are neither imprisoned nor fined.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the pranks are so humiliating," [...] {{continued}} the lady. [...] "When the minister called yesterday and {{rang the bell}} a big card appeared {{on the front door}} on which was printed the words: 'Busy; Call Again.' Fortunately Helen saw him and let him in, but when I reproved Robert for the act <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> the sign to see if it would work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{to my mind}} there's a {{breed of}} humility which is itself a species of showing off {{when you get down}} to the marrow of it; and when a man is able to afford two slop-tubs in his parlour, and doesn't do it, it may <b>be</b> that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> truly humble-minded, but it's a hundred times more likely that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> to strike the public eye. In my judgment, your Mr. Vanderbilt knows what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> about.' ...|$|R
60|$|Jimmy Skunk {{just laughed}} and {{stepped in front}} of poor Old Mr. Toad. Mr. Blacksnake coiled himself up in the path and darted his tongue out at Jimmy in the most impudent way. Then he tried to make himself look very fierce. Then he jumped {{straight}} at Jimmy Skunk with his mouth wide open, but he took great care not to jump quite far enough to reach Jimmy. You see, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> scare Jimmy. But Jimmy didn't scare. He knows all about Mr. Blacksnake and that really he is a coward. So he suddenly gritted his teeth in a way not at all pleasant to hear and started for Mr. Blacksnake. Mr. Blacksnake didn't wait. No, Sir, he didn't wait. He suddenly turned and glided back up the Crooked Little Path, hissing angrily. Jimmy followed him a little way, and then he went back to Old Mr. Toad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now it {{happened}} that one fine morning Mr. Otter took it into his head {{to take a walk}} in the Green Forest. It was a beautiful morning, and Mr. Otter went farther than he intended. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make up his mind whether to turn back or go just a little farther, when he heard stealthy footsteps behind him. He looked over his shoulder, and what he saw helped him to make up his mind in a hurry. There, creeping over the frozen snow, was Mr. Lynx, and the sides of Mr. Lynx were very thin, and the eyes of Mr. Lynx looked very hungry and fierce, and the claws of Mr. Lynx were very long and strong and cruel looking. Mr. Otter made up his mind right away that the cold, black water of that open spring-hole was the only place for him, and he started for it without even passing the time of day with Mr. Lynx.|$|E

50|$|Thirty {{years after}} leaving {{national}} politics, Wiegel is still mentioned {{often as a}} potential Prime Minister. <b>He</b> still <b>is</b> very popular among People's Party for Freedom and Democracy party members in the Netherlands. He has 'threatened' to return to national politics a number of times, usually resulting in the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy going up in the polls.

5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the story}} Jack London is {{referred}} to again in regard to his story [...] "To Build a Fire." [...] This is a metaphor for the main character and for J.P. drying out.

5000|$|In {{the book}} The Official Splatter Movie Guide, Volumes: 1963-1992: Hundreds of the Goriest, Grossest, Most Outrageous Films Ever Made by John McCarty, he states [...] "Writer-director Wes Craven {{must have thought}} we all suffer from amnesia, too, because he fills the sequel with clips from the first film to help us {{remember}} what happened in it. Either that or, because he really didn't have anything new up his sleeve, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> pad out the running time. The movie is so bad that it was shelved for two years, never released theatrically, then sold to video and pay TV to help recoup some of the costs." ...|$|R
