5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the <b>direct</b> <b>loss</b> of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{modeling}} framework {{to investigate the}} consequences of nat-ural disasters and the following reconstruction phase. Based on Input-Output tables, its originalities are (1) the taking into account of sector production capacities and of both forward and backward propagations within the economic system; and (2) the introduc-tion of adaptive behaviors. The model is used to simulate {{the response of the}} economy of Louisiana to the landfall of Katrina. The model is found consistent with available data, and provides two important insights. First, economic processes exacerbate <b>direct</b> <b>losses,</b> and total costs are estimated at $ 149 billion, for <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> equal to $ 107 billion. When exploring the impacts of other possible disasters, it is found that total losses due to a dis-aster affecting Louisiana increase nonlinearly with respect to <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> when the latter exceed $ 50 billion. When <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> exceed $ 200 billion, for instance, total losses are twice as large as <b>direct</b> <b>losses.</b> For risk management, therefore, <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> are insufficient measures of disaster consequences. Second, positive and negative backward propagation mechanisms are essential for the assessment of disaster consequences, and the taking into account of production capacities is necessary to avoid overestimating the positive effects of reconstruction. A systematic sensitivity analysis shows that, among all parameters, the over-production capacity in the construction sector and the adaptation characteristic time are the most important...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{case study}} assessing the seismic sustainability of two reinforced concrete structures, a frame structure and a wall structure, {{was conducted to}} determine which structural system is more seismically sustainable. The two structures were designed to the same standards and were assumed to be located in Christchurch, New Zealand. A component-based probabilistic seismic <b>loss</b> assessment, considering <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> only, was conducted for two ground motion records, regarded to approximately represent a 1 in 500 year earthquake event and a 1 in 2500 year earthquake event, respectively. It is shown that the wall structure results in lower <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> than the frame structure in the less severe ground motion scenario. However, in the more severe ground motion scenario, the frame structure results in lower <b>direct</b> <b>losses.</b> Hence, this study demonstrates that which structural system has the lower <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> depends on the ground motion intensity level...|$|R

[...] However, this {{decision}} was reversed on appeal by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the ruling judges being Sonia Sotomayor. [...] The court ruled that the holder claims did not satisfy the SLUSA requirement that the fraud claims be brought [...] "in connection with the purchase or sale" [...] of securities. Though recognizing the typically broad interpretation that language has been given, the Second Circuit believed Congress meant to incorporate the Supreme Court's limitation from Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975), which ruled that only those suffering <b>direct</b> <b>loss</b> from the purchase or sale of stock had standing to sue under federal securities law. [...] To the extent that Dabit's amended complaint [...] alleged that Merrill Lynch had fraudulently induced the stockholders to retain their stock and not to purchase or sell it, the Second Circuit determined that his class action fell outside SLUSA's preemptive scope. [...] The case was nonetheless remanded for dismissal with leave to amend again, because the amended complaint still did not necessarily exclude purchaser claims.|$|E

60|$|The {{report of}} the Secretary of the Treasury, which by law is made {{directly}} to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the receipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year, the amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out {{for each of the}} Departments of Government. It will be observed from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but $2,344,882.30 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the estimated receipts over expenditures will not much exceed $9,000,000. In view of the large national debt existing and the obligation to add 1 per cent per annum to the sinking fund, a sum amounting now to over $34,000,000 per annum, I submit whether revenues should not be increased or expenditures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for the sinking fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made in rates of taxation and in the number of articles submitted to taxation; the question may well be asked, whether or not, in some instances, unwisely. In connection with this subject, too, I venture the opinion that the means of collecting the revenue, especially from imports, have been so embarrassed by legislation as to make it questionable whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the <b>direct</b> <b>loss</b> of the Treasury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers and taxpayers.|$|E

Who has not heard of souls being delivered from spiritual darkness and brought into spiritual light by means of song?--a benefit which will last through eternity as well as time.

60|$|But {{her mind}} misgave her, {{not because the}} house was {{outwardly}} dreary, but in fear of the inward dreariness of the people--or in fear rather of their dreariness and pride combined. Old Lady Ball, though naturally ill-natured, was not ill-mannered, nor did she give herself any special airs; {{but she knew that}} she was a baronet's wife, that she kept her carriage, and that it was an obligation upon her {{to make up for the}} poverty of her house by some little haughtiness of demeanour. There are women, high in rank, but poor in pocket, so gifted with the peculiar grace of aristocracy, that they show by every word spoken, by every turn of the head, by every step taken, that they are among the high ones of the earth, and that money has nothing to do with it. Old Lady Ball was not so gifted, nor had she just claim to such gifts. But some idea on the subject pervaded her mind, and she made efforts to be aristocratic in her poverty. Sir John was a discontented, cross old man, who had succeeded greatly in early life, having been for nearly twenty years in Parliament, but had fallen into adversity in his older days. The loss of that very money of which his niece, Miss Mackenzie was possessed, was, in truth, the one great misfortune which he deplored; but that misfortune had had ramifications and extensions with which the reader need not trouble himself; but which, altogether, connected as they were with certain liberal aspirations which he had entertained in early life, and certain political struggles made during his parliamentary career, induced him to regard himself as a sort of Prometheus. He had done much for the world, and the world in return had made him a baronet without any money! He was a very tall, thin, gray-haired, old man, stooping much, and worn with age, but still endowed with some strength of will, and great capability of making himself unpleasant. His son was a bald-headed, stout man, somewhat past forty, who was by no means without cleverness, having done great things as a young man at Oxford; but in life he had failed. He was a director of certain companies in London, at which he used to attend, receiving his guinea for doing so, and he had some small capital,--some remnant of his father's trade wealth, which he nursed with extreme care, buying shares here and there and changing his money about as his keen outlook into City affairs directed him. I do not suppose that he had much talent for the business, or he would have grown rich; but a certain careful zeal carried him on without <b>direct</b> <b>loss,</b> and gave him perhaps five per cent for his capital, whereas he would have received no more than four and a half had he left it alone and taken his dividends without troubling himself. As the difference did not certainly amount to a hundred a-year, it can hardly be said that he made good use of his time. His zeal deserved a better success. He was always thinking of his money, excusing himself to himself and to others by the fact of his nine children. For myself I think that his children were no justification to him; as they would have been held to be none, had he murdered and robbed his neighbours for their sake.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> {{from natural}} hazards {{are on the}} rise with hurricanes, flooding, and severe storms {{contributing}} about three quarters of the total damages. While losses from severe storms have been stable over the past fifty years, hurricane and flood losses have tripled. Per capita losses are also increasing showing that impacts outpace population growth with high per capita losses occurring largely in the Southeast and Midwest. If the loss escalation {{of the past two decades}} continues into the future, then <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> of $ 300 to $ 400 billion within a single decade are possible. In order to reverse this trend, sustainable development, vulnerability reduction, and hazard mitigation must become priorities and current loss reduction efforts need to be evaluated and re-assessed in terms of their effectiveness. These conclusions are drawn from the analysis of spatial and temporal trends in <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> from natural hazards using SHELDUS TM data from 1960 through 2009.

40|$|In 1999, Italy {{experienced}} a devastating epidemic of high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) {{caused by an}} H 7 N 1 virus subtype. After this epidemic, a ministerial decree was passed to implement control measures for low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) due to H 5 and H 7 subtypes. We investigated whether these control measures have decreased the public expenditure associated with epidemics of LPAI and HPAI by comparing the <b>direct</b> and consequential <b>losses</b> of the 1999 epidemic to the losses associated with successive epidemics. The estimated total economic burden of the epidemics was about € 650 million (€ 217 million in <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> and € 433 million in consequential losses). The 1999 epidemic accounted for most of these losses (€ 507 million: € 112 million in <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> and € 395 million in consequential losses), whereas the total economic burden for the 5 successive LPAI was € 143 million (€ 105 million in <b>direct</b> <b>losses</b> and € 38 million in consequential losses). These results demonstrate that {{the implementation of a}} coordinated set of diseasecontrol measures, which included both emergency and prophylactic vaccination, was able to reduce the overall costs associated with avian influenza epidemics.
