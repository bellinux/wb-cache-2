5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to improve their own lot.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the award depends on, in part, {{the value of the}} salved vessel, the degree of risk {{involved}} and the degree of peril the vessel was in. Legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights. To reduce the amount of a claim after an accident, boat owners or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel; they <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in. If another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not apply.|$|E

25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{points of}} the {{agreement}} included the exchange of technical advisers, cooperation on coastal patrols, and the aerial photographing of strategic areas within Colombia. On the issue of aerial photography, Colombia {{made it clear that}} it would only be accomplished by Colombian aircraft and American cameramen. Colombia also made it clear that, although it was fully supportive of the fight against the Axis, it would <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to limit the amount of American military activity taking place on or from its territory. The Colombians did not invite the United States to build its own military bases within their country, as Ecuador and other South American countries did. They felt that the defense of Colombia should be carried out by Colombians, and the United States did not object.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} {{published}} in The Hill, Higgins and fellow Alliance for Charitable Reform co-founder Dan Peters responded to discussion of legislative regulatory proposals, saying that, [...] "ACR believes that every dollar of tax increases on foundations {{is to the}} federal government rather than a dollar to charities, and the ACR is troubled by that notion.... We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all solution that disadvantages smaller organizations. We must <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to encourage philanthropy and not create barriers to charitable giving." ...|$|E

I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose {{that they were going}} to turn around and attack the United States.

500|$|By {{finishing}} as runners-up in the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset {{qualified to}} compete in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, the first global club cricket tournament. Media attention surrounded Trescothick, who had returned home early from his last overseas tour in 2006–07 with a [...] "stress-related illness". Brian Rose stressed that there was no pressure on Trescothick {{to take part in the}} tournament, and that the county would <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to support him. The former England batsman did take part in the tournament, arriving three days after the rest of the squad. He played in both of Somerset's matches in the group stage of the competition, though he only managed to score 17 runs between his two innings.|$|E
500|$|Given {{that the}} Second Polish Republic was a {{multicultural}} state, German policies and propaganda {{also sought to}} create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups, fueling tension between Poles and Jews, and between Poles and Ukrainians. In Łódź, the Germans forced Jews to help destroy a monument to a Polish hero, Tadeusz Kościuszko, and filmed them committing the act. Soon afterward, the Germans set fire to a Jewish synagogue and filmed Polish bystanders, portraying them in propaganda releases as a [...] "vengeful mob." [...] This divisive policy {{was reflected in the}} Germans' decision to destroy Polish education, while at the same time, showing relative tolerance toward the Ukrainian school system. As the high-ranking Nazi official Erich Koch explained, [...] "We must <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> so that when a Pole meets a Ukrainian, he will be willing to kill the Ukrainian and conversely, the Ukrainian will be willing to kill the Pole." ...|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{arose in}} Germany for the film's {{television}} premiere on ProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each. Ignatz Bubis, {{head of the}} Central Council of Jews in Germany, said: [...] "It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials". Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added [...] "It {{is obvious that the}} film could have a greater impact [...] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to broadcast the film without interruption." [...] As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing [...] "The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York" [...] prior to broadcast and [...] "The survivors of the Holocaust" [...] afterwards.|$|E
500|$|The OUN {{decided to}} attack Polish civilians, who {{constituted}} {{about a third}} of the population of the disputed territories. The OUN equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely. By February 1943 the OUN began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians. OUN forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the Przebraże Defence) and fights between the Home Army and the OUN. The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; Erich Koch said: [...] "We have to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, will be ready to kill him, and conversely, a Ukrainian will be ready to kill the Pole." [...] A German commissioner from Sarny, when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other." [...] In massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, beginning in the spring of 1943, between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles were killed.|$|E
500|$|At the {{hospital}} of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, {{which had been}} a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Dr. Louis {{was one of the}} fathers of the méthode expectante, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician's role is to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country's leading proponents of the méthode expectante. Holmes was awarded his M.D. from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute pericarditis. His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book's introduction, he mused: [...] "Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found time to adjust my own mantle; and I now willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude".|$|E

2500|$|According to Yuriy Kirichuk the Germans were {{actively}} prodding {{both sides of}} the conflict against each other.
