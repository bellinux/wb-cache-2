40|$|In many {{digital control}} applications, data {{acquisition}} and process control are time-critical actions, {{assumed to be}} instantaneous and strictly periodic. However, aspects related to real-time scheduling algorithms may postpone the task execution and, consequently, delay the data acquisition and process control. We consider the acquired data from sensors as valid if acquired inside a timeinterval that surrounds an <b>ideal</b> <b>instant</b> which {{is the point of}} maximum system's benefit. The data acquired before or after this time-interval are considered useless to the controller We propose a new task model to deal with the variation in the execution time of a specific point inside tasks. In this model, tasks have an <b>ideal</b> <b>instant</b> to present their results or acquire data from sensors (QoS metric). 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{measurement}} system and an associated processing signal for determining of the accurate instant angular {{speed of a}} crankshaft is presented in this PhD thesis. The used method {{is based on the}} recalculation of the angular velocity from intervals of passing marks, e. g. gear tooth on the flywheel, along a sensor. The detailed analysis of errors was carried out. Systematic errors are those of quantization due to the non-uniform distribution of the teeth along the flywheel circumference and due to the wear of them. Possibilities of their suppression are discussed, principles of suitable selection of the sensor arrangement in the relation to the measured marks are presented and an optimal alternative was chosen. The random errors are excited with the engine and sensor vibrations of different frequencies. An original method based on subtraction of the reference record from the measured record is used. The reference record is in ideal case a signal gained from the uniform rotational motion exerted by a foreign energy source. This <b>ideal</b> <b>instant</b> was realised in the practical form as the rotational motion of an engine with the zero fuel, when only centrifugal forces of the inertial masses and the compression pressures are present. This kind of the evaluation affords an essentially better accuracy. The possibility of using of non-dismantling diagnosis was proved by means of signals measured on a two-cylinder engine, with the crank turned through an angle of on which the representative defects in praxis usually occurred were simulated.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 45 - 47). My {{body of work}} {{is concerned}} with the constructed promise of telecommunication - that is, the promise to connect {{people all over the world}} via telephone lines, computer networks and, most recently, satellite signals. The development of and access to networked systems has brought about this "utopian promise" (Mitchell 2005 : 305), an <b>ideal</b> of <b>instant</b> connectivity that allows a user to be in contact with others through technological devices over vast distances. Connectivity supposedly enables users to develop and sustain relationships on the Internet. However, the question arises whether telecommunication technologies are living up to their promise. My title, Reprocessing Inte/ference: An artistic exploration of the visual material generated by inte/terence, refers to the concepts pertaining to this promise and also to the failure of the promise, focusing on the notions of distance and interference. It further encapsulates my working method, a process of degrading and filtering both my own and found footage...|$|R

Due to anisotropy of thermal motion, {{the placement of the}} atoms in the linear mols. of the mesogenic materials no longer corresponds to an <b>ideal</b> at each <b>instant.</b> The scattering by such anisotropically vibrating mols. which can be treated as diffraction by standing waves, essentially alters the diffraction condition, which is the reason for certain diffusion spots to pick up diffuse tails or streaks depending upon the anisotropy of vibration of the mols.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a Farrow-based variable FIR filter to compensate distortions in digital-to-analog converters (DACs) that {{are due to}} two-periodic nonuniform holding signals. Without compensation such holding signals introduce distortions that reduce the DAC performance considerably. By utilizing a discrete-time model of a zero-order hold, we first derive the ideal frequency responses of the compensation filters. Then we exploit the spectral properties of the ideal frequency responses to introduce {{the design of a}} variable FIR filter that approximates the ideal response with low implementation complexity. Finally, a design example is provided.

5000|$|In March 1967 Ampex {{introduced}} the HS-100 video disc recorder. The system {{was developed by}} Ampex {{at the request of}} the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for a variety of sports broadcast uses. It was first demonstrated on the air on March 18, 1967, when “ABC’s Wide World of Sports” televised the “World Series of Skiing” from Vail, Colorado.http://www.digitrakcom.com/literature/HS-100%20Press.pdf The video was recorded on analog magnetic disc. The disc weighed 5 pounds/2.3 kg and rotated at 60rps, 3600rpm (50rps in Pal). One NTSC unit could record 30 seconds of video, PAL units 36 seconds. The video could then be played back in slow motion, stop action to freeze frame.http://www.vtoldboys.com/slomo_3.htm A more deluxe version, the HS-200, was introduced around 1971, and provided a large control console with variable speed playback. This made it <b>ideal</b> for <b>instant</b> replay for sports events and precise timing control in post production service. CBS-TV was the first to use the technique during live sportscasts, though it was quickly adopted by all American TV networks. The HS-200, which was an HS-100 connected to a control console when combined called the HS-200, had greater precise frame and timing control capability, lending itself to post-production applications like special effects and titles. The HS-200 had a frame accurate timing computer that enabled frame-accurate cuts and dissolve transitions by way of a two-input video switcher. Slow-motion sequences could likewise be programmed and could be [...] "triggered" [...] to begin via an external control pulse such as might come from an external VTR editor like the Ampex VR-2000 VTR with Editec. The HS-200 was the first system capable of single-frame video animation recording, using magnetic discs as opposed to videotape. The HS-200 also provided a readout with specific frame numbers showing from the 900 frames available (NTSC version.) Sequences could be triggered to start from any of these 900 frames with frame-accurate repeatability for creative fine tuning of sequence start and end points.|$|R
