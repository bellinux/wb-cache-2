5|$|From {{the early}} 1990s to the mid-2000s, Winnipeg had a {{significant}} auto-theft problem, with the rate peaking at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents in 2006 compared to 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents for Canada as a whole. To combat auto theft, Manitoba Public Insurance established financial incentives for motor vehicle owners to install ignition immobilizers in their vehicles, and now requires owners of high-risk vehicles to install immobilizers. The auto-theft rate {{has been on a}} constant drop since 2006. Other types of property crime have also decreased, but rates are still <b>fairly</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{flight of}} the Fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats, and {{frequent}} calling. It tends to fly <b>fairly</b> <b>high,</b> landing in the tree tops, then descending to seek food. Its call is a high, thin seep or peep, {{similar to those of}} other parrotfinches such as blue-faced and red-throated, and is often repeated in bursts of varying length. The song is a long whistled double note similar to, but less urgent, than that of the orange-breasted myzomela, a Fijian endemic honeyeater.|$|E

Although he left the company, Bassah remained active in social movements. He was {{an active member of the}} Sarekat Rakyat (People's Union), an organization with communist leanings, and helped that group in its mission of social service.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a <b>fairly</b> <b>high</b> magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E

5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS), {{developed by}} Blizzard Entertainment {{and published by}} Blizzard and Interplay Productions. The MS-DOS version was released on 23 November 1994 and the Macintosh version in early 1996. Sales were <b>fairly</b> <b>high,</b> reviewers were mostly impressed, and the game won three awards and was a finalist for three others. There was a CD re-release, namely version 1.21 (CD version), that didn't have the word-from-the-user-manual copy protection of prior versions.

5|$|Fantastic Universe {{published}} {{its first}} {{issue in the}} midst of this publishing boom. The issue, in digest format, was dated JuneJuly 1953, and was priced at 50 cents. This was higher than any of its competition, but it also had the highest page count in the field at the time, with 196 pages. The initial editorial team was Leo Margulies as publisher, and Sam Merwin as editor; this was a combination familiar to science fiction fans from their years together at Thrilling Wonder Stories, which Merwin edited from 1945 to 1951. The publisher, King-Size Publications, also produced The Saint Detective Magazine, which was popular, so Fantastic Universe enjoyed good distribution from the starta key factor in a magazine's success. The first issue included stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, and Ray Bradbury. According to Donald Tuck, the author of an early SF encyclopaedia, the magazine kept a <b>fairly</b> <b>high</b> quality through Merwin's departure after a year, and through the subsequent brief period of caretaker editorship by Beatrice Jones. Margulies took over the editor's post with the May 1954 issue.|$|E
5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a <b>fairly</b> <b>high</b> standard.|$|E

5|$|The farmer, or {{specifically}} the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and {{officials in the}} social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a <b>fairly</b> <b>high</b> social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a <b>fairly</b> <b>high</b> fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeletal}} remains {{of more than}} 100 individuals have been excavated at Iximche, {{some of which were}} very well preserved. Unfortunately the bones became mixed when warehoused near the site after excavation and their original locations are no longer clear. Thirty-six skulls were analysed by archaeologists, of these 25 show evidence of decapitation, a sacrificial practice commonly represented in Maya art from the Classic Period. Thirteen of these sacrifices were male, seven were female and five were of indeterminate gender. Most of the sacrifices were of young adults, ten were aged between 15 and 21 years old and eleven were aged little more than 21 years old, based on skull development. It is likely that these sacrificed individuals were not Kaqchikels but were captives taken from enemy states. Less than 3% of the analysed skulls showed evidence of iron deficiency anemia, a very low percentage compared with remains recovered from Copán and Altar de Sacrificios (64% and 88% respectively). This low percentage indicates that these individuals were not exposed to particular dietary stress and were likely to belong to the elite class. 31% of the skulls had evidence of infection, about half of which were active infections at the time of death, although none were serious. Half of these infections left evidence in the maxillary sinus, this suggests a <b>fairly</b> <b>high</b> level of airborne pathogens in the environment. Tooth enamel analysis was carried out on 19 individuals and revealed hypoplasia in the teeth of 89% of these, indicating a high level of poor health in the first 7 years of childhood.|$|E
