2500|$|Bearer bond is an {{official}} certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, {{the person who}} has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen. Especially after federal income tax began in the United States, <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets. [...] U.S. corporations stopped issuing <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> were prohibited in 1983.|$|R

According to the Wall Street Journal, <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> went out of favor in the U.S. in 1982 when their treatment under U.S. law was changed to discourage their use, {{as they had been}} an ideal vehicle for tax evasion. The unfavorable tax treatment and penalties enacted in 1982 discouraged the use of <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds,</b> which made the possible use of such securities by UBS clients suspect. UBS employees allegedly discussed the legal ramifications of the use of <b>bearer</b> <b>bonds</b> with their clients. The purpose of the investigation was U.S. investigators trying to determine the exact nature of those alleged discussions and whether they amounted to a criminal effort to conceal what had allegedly already been done.|$|R
