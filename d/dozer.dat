5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} from the beach, {{a job that}} had to be performed quickly before the tide came in at 10:30, was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight <b>dozer</b> tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The <b>dozer</b> tanks pushed the wreckage out of the way to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|E
5|$|The third wave, {{arriving}} at 06:45, included 16 conventional M4 Sherman tanks and 8 <b>dozer</b> tanks of the 70th Tank Battalion.

5|$|Experience during {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including the fitting of wire mesh screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a microphone and headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank <b>dozer,</b> a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. The Frog was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, the Frog proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve the endurance of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including the fitting of a small number of <b>dozer</b> variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E

30|$|Smaller <b>dozers</b> will exert less {{compaction}} than larger <b>dozers</b> {{and should}} be used for spreading and grading of topsoil as a means of avoiding soil compaction during reclamation. Surface materials should be spread and graded when in a relatively dry condition. When establishing forest trees as a post-mining land use, the best way to limit soil compaction is to avoid using any equipment that runs over the finished surface. An excavator, for example, can level spoil piles left by haulers, but would not be capable of smoothing surface soils as needed for agricultural hay lands or areas surrounding building structures.|$|R
