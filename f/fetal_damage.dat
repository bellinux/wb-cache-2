Many physicians do not promote alcohol consumption, however, given the many health concerns associated with it, some suggest that alcohol should be regarded as a recreational drug, and promote exercise and good nutrition to combat cardiovascular disease.

40|$|Ischemic reperfusion (IR) {{during the}} {{perinatal}} period is a known causative factor of <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage.</b> So far, both morphologic and histologic evidence {{has shown that}} <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage</b> can be observed only several hours to days after an IR insult has occurred. Therefore, to prevent <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage</b> under these circumstances, a more detailed understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved during an acute response to IR is necessary. In the present work, pregnant mice were exposed to IR on day 18 of gestation by clipping {{one side of the}} maternal uterine horn. Simultaneous fetal electrocardiography was performed during the procedure to verify that conditions resulting in <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage</b> were met. <b>Fetal</b> brain sampling within 30 minutes after IR insult revealed molecular evidence that a fetal response was indeed triggered in the form of inhibition of the Akt-mTOR-S 6 synthesis pathway. Interestingly, significant changes in mRNA levels for both HIF- 1 a and p 53 were apparent and gene regulation patterns were observed to switch from a HIF- 1 a-dependent to a p 53 -dependent process. Moreover, pre-treatment with pifithrin-a, a p 53 inhibitor, inhibited protein synthesis almost completely, revealing the possibility of preventing <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage</b> by prophylactic pifithrin-a treatment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring pregnancy, both ischemic reperfusion and {{bacterial}} agent LPS {{are known}} {{risk factors for}} <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage.</b> However, {{there is a lack}} of evidence to explain whether vaginal LPS affects the fetus response to ischemic reperfusion.

As our previously reported, ischemic reperfusion induces P 53 -dependent <b>fetal</b> brain <b>damage</b> was based on a molecular mechanism: the transcriptional pattern was changed from HIF- 1 alpha-dependent to P 53 -dependent immediately. In the present work, only with vaginal LPS precondition, phosphorylation of activated transcriptional factor (ATF) 2 at Thr 71 appeared in response to ischemic reperfusion. Moreover, this phosphorylation was completely blocked by pre-treatment with a P 53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α. We concluded that vaginal LPS precondition trigged the p 53 -dependent phosphorylation of ATF 2 in response to ischemic reperfusion, which played an important role of increasing vulnerability to hemorrhage in fetus...|$|R

Late {{pregnancy}} {{usage of}} {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may cause severe oligohydramnios due to fetal renal impairment.
