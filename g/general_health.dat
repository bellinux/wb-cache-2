5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The <b>general</b> <b>health</b> of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His <b>general</b> <b>health</b> was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E

After briefly attempting {{to return to his}} duties, he became bedfast, and died on May 23, 1914. His official cause of death was listed as uraemia. Upon Bradley's death, both houses of Congress passed resolutions expressing their sympathy, and promptly adjourned out of respect. His body was returned to Frankfort for burial, but in accordance with the wishes of Bradley and his family, did not lie in state. He was buried in the state cemetery in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's <b>general</b> <b>health</b> and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given.

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the <b>general</b> <b>health</b> condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E

It recognised that Sing's disability {{were the result of}} service, was permanent, and recommended that he be discharged as permanently unfit for service.

5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was {{surprised to hear that}} his brother, who had been strong and in good <b>general</b> <b>health,</b> could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E

40|$|The aim was {{to define}} post-caesarean {{dyspareunia}} as a sexual and pelvic-perineal symptom. Post-caesarean (80 elective, 104 emergency) and 100 vaginally delivered primiparae had domiciliary interviews at 10 months postpartum. A total of 50 (28 % and 27 %) post-caesarean and 46 (46 %) vaginally delivered, reported dyspareunia. Severely impaired <b>general</b> sexual <b>health</b> occurred in 82 (24 % elective, 25 % emergency, 35 % vaginally delivered) as category 3 (dyspareunia with sexual symptoms) and 27 (10 % elective, 7 % emergency, 12 % vaginally delivered) as category 4 (reduced frequency < 6). The risk of dyspareunia (RR 1. 14, CI 0. 73, 1. 77) or impaired <b>general</b> sexual <b>health</b> (RR 0. 93, CI 0. 32, 2. 74) was similar among those with or without perineal trauma. Both caesarean and perineal scars were associated with sexual malfunction. Primiparae with new incontinence had a lower risk of dyspareunia than impaired <b>general</b> sexual <b>health.</b> Awareness of the associations of post-caesarean dyspareunia and impaired <b>general</b> sexual <b>health</b> with incontinence would facilitate appropriate obstetric decision-making.

5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor <b>general</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and <b>general</b> <b>health.</b> For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the <b>general</b> <b>health</b> {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
