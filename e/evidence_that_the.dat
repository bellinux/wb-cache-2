There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.

There is also no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.|$|E
