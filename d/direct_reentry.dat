30|$|After 7 {{years and}} a 6 -billion-km {{challenging}} journey in the solar system, the Hayabusa (formerly called MUSES-C; the first sample-return explorer to a Near Earth Asteroid) returned to Earth on June 13, 2010. Following the reentries of the Genesis in 2004 (ReVelle et al., 2005; Jenniskens et al., 2006) and the Stardust in 2006 (Edwards et al., 2007), {{the return of the}} Hayabusa Sample Return Capsule (H-SRC) was the third <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> event from the interplanetary transfer orbit to the Earth at a velocity of over 11.2 km/s. In addition, it was the world’s first case of a <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> of the spacecraft (H-S/C) itself from the interplanetary transfer orbit.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{high-power}} lasers {{is suggested}} {{for the removal}} of small orbital debris of up to 10 cm in diameter. Assuming data for a most probable collision orbit and for realistic ejection speeds of debris vapor under laser irradiation, calculations show the feasibility of tre ating a debris object like a laser-propelled rocket. The acceleration of the debris during irradiation allows to change its orbit for a <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> into the earth atmosphere. An autonomous orbital vehicle could eventually clear the whole low earth orbital environment from small debris. In a modification of this method a laser could be used on short note to divert the flight path of a piece of debris to avoid a collision...|$|E
40|$|There exist several {{classes of}} high energy trajectories that are {{injected}} from Earth centered orbits to deep space destinations {{and return to}} the vicinity of the Earth sometime later due to the direct influence of a third body perturbation. These trajectories can be designed to flyby the moon or near Earth asteroids and comets. The appealing characteristic of these trajectories is that they require a single injection maneuver at the Earth and no further translational control thereafter. A spacecraft on such a trajectory can take observations and measurements of the flyby body and download the data once it returns to the vicinity of the Earth. The return trajectory could place the spacecraft into a <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> path through the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere or an elliptical or hyperbolic Earth flyby that will be completely passive since no maneuvers are made. This type of trajectory is applicable to passive spacecraft missions such as student built micro satellites that have no on board propulsion for attitude or translational control. Issues addressed are the dispersions in the return trajectory due to errors in the injection maneuver and other orbit parameters. The characteristics of an Earth return lunar flyby mission for small satellites are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In-space {{propellant}} re-supply {{has been}} proposed to extend space vehicle lifetimes, but only qualitative arguments supporting development have been made; this study focuses on quantitative support. Two basic concepts for propellant re-supply are propellant transfer and tank replacement. A quantitative assessment and comparison to no re-supply alternatives is necessary to choose the most cost-effective architecture. The analysis is primarily accomplished {{through the use of}} a new tool that facilitates propulsion system sizing and broad trade studies. The program was co-created by the author under a grant from NASA Langley Research Center and has been used at NASA Langley for lunar architecture studies to support the Vision for Space Exploration. For less than 100 missions, the preferred scenario is without re-supply, using <b>direct</b> Earth <b>reentry.</b> For more than 100 missions, tank replacement requires 38 % fewer missions than propellant transfer to become more cost effective than no re-supply...|$|R
5000|$|The {{orbits of}} {{spacecraft}} in low Earth orbit (LEO) decay to {{lower and lower}} altitudes due to the resistance from the friction between the spacecraft's surface (i.e. , drag) and the outer layer of the Earth's atmosphere (a.k.a. the thermosphere and exosphere). Eventually, a LEO spacecraft falls out of orbit and towards the Earth's surface. Many spacecraft launched {{in the past couple}} of decades have the ability to fire a small rocket to manage their orbits. The rocket can increase altitude to extend lifetime, to <b>direct</b> the <b>reentry</b> towards a particular (marine) site, or route the satellite to avoid collision with other spacecraft. Such maneuvers require precise information about the orbit. A geomagnetic storm can cause an orbit change over a couple of days that otherwise would occur over a year or more. The geomagnetic storm adds heat to the thermosphere, causing the thermosphere to expand and rise, increasing the drag on spacecraft. The 2009 satellite collision between the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 demonstrated the importance of having precise knowledge of all objects in orbit. Iridium 33 had the capability to maneuver out of the path of Cosmos 2251 and could have evaded the crash, if a credible collision prediction had been available, ...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to answer}} basic {{questions}} regarding {{the origin of the}} Solar System will motivate robotic sample return missions to destinations like Pluto, its satellite Charon, and objects in the Kuiper belt. To keep the mission duration short enough to be of interest, sample return from objects farther out in the Solar System requires increasingly higher return velocities. A sample return mission involves several complicated steps to reach an object and obtain a sample, but only the interplanetary return phase of the mission is addressed in this paper. Radioisotope electric propulsion is explored in this parametric study as a means to propel small, dedicated return vehicles for transferring kilogram-size samples from deep space to Earth. Return times for both Earth orbital rendezvous and faster, <b>direct</b> atmospheric <b>reentry</b> trajectories are calculated for objects as far away as 100 AU. Chemical retro-rocket braking at Earth is compared to radioisotope electric propulsion but the limited deceleration capability of chemical rockets forces the return trajectories to be much slower.

40|$|Stardust, the 4 th Discovery mission {{launched}} in February 1999, will collect coma {{samples from the}} recently deflected comet 81 P/Wild 2 on 2 January 2004 and return them to Earth on 15 January 2006 for detailed laboratory analyses. Stardust {{will be the first}} mission to bring samples back to Earth from a known comet and also the first to bring back contemporary interstellar particles recently discovered. These samples should provide important insights into the nature and amount of dust released by comets, the roles of comets in planetary systems, clues to the importance of comets in producing dust in our zodiacal cloud as well as circumstellar dust around other stars, and the links between collected meteoritic samples with a known cometary body. Samples are collected in newly invented continuous gradient density silica aerogel. Stardust is facilitated by a magnificent trajectory designed to accomplish a complex and ambitious flyby sample return mission within the Discovery program restrictions. The remaining science payload, which provides important context for the captured samples, includes a time-of-flight spectrometer measuring the chemical and isotopic composition of dust grains; a polyvinylidene fluoride dust flux monitor determining dust flux profiles; a CCD camera for imaging Wild 2 coma and its nucleus; a shared X band transponder providing two-way Doppler shifts to estimate limits to Wild 2 mass and integrated dust fluence; and tracking of the spacecraft's attitude sensing for the detection of large particle impacts. The graphite composite spacecraft brings the collected sample back to Earth by a <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> in a capsule...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} design of nanospacecraft based on advanced multifunctional microsystems building blocks. These systems bring substantial improvements {{of the performance of}} nanosatellites and enable new space exploration, e. g. interplanetary science missions using minute space probes. Microsystems, or microelectromechanical systems, allows for extreme miniaturization using heritage from IC industry. Reducing mass and volume of spacecraft gives large savings in terms of launch costs. Definition and categorization of system and module level features in multifunctional microsystems are used to derive a spacecraft optimization algorithm which is compatible with commonly used concurrent engineering methods. The miniaturization of modules enables modular spacecraft architectures comprising powerful multifunctional microsystems, which are applicable to satellites between 10 and 1000 ’s of kg. This kind of complete spacecraft architecture has been developed for the NanoSpace- 1 technology demonstrator satellite. The spacecraft bus uses multifunctional design to enable distributed intelligence and autonomy, graceful degradation, functional surfaces, and distributed power systems. The increase in performance of the new spacecraft architecture as compared with conventional nanosatellites is orders of magnitudes in terms of power storage, scientific payload mass ratio, pointing stabilization, and long time space operation. This high-performance system-of-microsystems architecture has been successfully employed on two space robotic concepts: a miniaturized submersible vehicle for Jupiter’s Moon Europa and a miniaturized spherical robot. The submersible is enabled by miniaturization of electronics into 3 -dimensional, vertically integrated multi-chip-modules together with new interconnection methods. These technologies enabled the submersible vehicle tube-shaped design within 20 cm length and 5 cm diameter. The spherical rover was developed for long range and networked science investigations of interplanetary bodies. The rover weighs 3. 5 kg and is shown to endure <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> on Mars, which increases the ratio between the landed mobile payload mass and the initial mass in Mars orbit by a factor of 18...|$|E
40|$|Selenium Technologies {{has been}} {{conducting}} preliminary design work on a manned lunar lander for use in NASA's First Lunar Outpost (FLO) program. The resulting lander is designed to carry a crew of four astronauts to a prepositioned habitat on the lunar surface, remain on the lunar surface for up to 45 days while the crew is living in the habitat, then return the crew to earth via <b>direct</b> <b>reentry</b> and land recovery. Should the need arise, the crew can manually guide the lander to a safe lunar landing site, {{and live in the}} lander for up to ten days on the surface. Also, an abort to earth is available during any segment of the mission. The main propulsion system consists of a cluster of four modified Pratt and Whitney RL 10 rocket engines that use liquid methane (LCH 4) and liquid oxygen (LOX). Four engines are used to provide redundancy and a satisfactory engine out capability. Differences between the new propulsion system and the original system include slightly smaller engine size and lower thrust per engine, although specific impulse remains the same despite the smaller size. Concerns over nozzle ground clearance and engine reliability, as well as more information from Pratt and Whitney, brought about this change. The power system consists of a combination of regenerative fuel cells and solar arrays. While the lander is in flight to or from the moon, or during the lunar night, fuel cells provide all electrical power. During the lunar day, solar arrays are deployed to provide electrical power for the lander as well as electrolyzers, which separate some water back into hydrogen and oxygen for later use by the fuel cells. Total storage requirements for oxygen, hydrogen, and water are 61 kg, 551 kg, and 360 kg, respectively. The lander is a stage-and-a-half design with descent propellant, cargo, and landing gear contained in the descent stage, and the main propulsion system, ascent propellant, and crew module contained in the ascent stage. The primary structure for both stages is a truss, to which all tanks and components are attached. The crew module is a conical shape {{similar to that of the}} Apollo Command Module, but significantly larger with a height and maximum diameter of six meters...|$|E
