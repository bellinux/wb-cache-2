40|$|Nowadays, {{a higher}} demand {{on a lot}} of metals exists, but the {{quantity}} and purity of the ores decreases. The amount of scrap, on the other hand, increases and thus, recycling becomes more important. Besides recycling, it is also necessary to improve and optimize existing processes in <b>extractive</b> and recycling <b>metallurgy.</b> One of the main difficulties of the overall‐plant recovery are metal losses in slags, in both primary and secondary metal production. In general, an increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing these losses could help further improve production efficiencies. This review aims to summarize and evaluate the current scientific knowledge concerning metal losses and pinpoints the knowledge gaps. First, the industrial importance and impact of metal losses in slags will be illustrated by several examples from both ferrous and non‐ferrous industries. Throughout the remainder of this review, the main focus will be put on the particular issues in copper industry. In a second section, the different types of metal losses in slags will be discussed. Generally, metal losses in slags can be subdivided into two types: chemical losses and physical losses. The fundamental insights concerning the responsible mechanisms will be discussed for each type. Subsequently, an overview of the most frequently used techniques for research investigations of the losses will be given. In a fourth section, a more detailed overview will be given on the post‐processing treatment of metal‐containing slags, i. e. performing slag cleaning operations. The most frequently applied methods will be discussed. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Aspects {{of early}} Greek <b>extractive</b> iron <b>metallurgy</b> are {{investigated}} here, {{for the first}} time, with particular emphasis on Macedonia, Greece's most metals-rich province. The subject is approached experimentally by considering equally the ores, slag and artefacts of iron in Macedonia, through the analytical examination of archaeological slag and artefacts, the experimental smelting of Macedonian ores and subsequent analytical investigation of the slag and blooms produced. The mineral resources geology of Macedonia is presented. The historical background to mining and metal working in Macedonia from the Early Iron Age (tenth century BC) to {{the turn of the}} present century is documented. The literature on the introduction of iron into Greece, and the East Mediterranean more generally, is critically reviewed, and in the light of results obtained, especially from Thasos, it is argued that the origins of iron making in Macedonia, if not elsewhere in Greece, should be sought locally during the Late Bronze Age. Despite the absence of excavated furnace remains, it has been possible, through analytical examination of metallurgical waste, to trace the operation of the bloomery in Macedonia continuously for nearly thirty centuries. That a considerable variety of iron ores were exploited was elucidated by the analysis of slag inclusions in a large number of iron artefacts from Vergina and from sites on Thasos and the East Macedonian Mainland, spanning chronologically the Early Iron Age to the Byzantine period. The titanium-rich magnetite sands on Thasos and at Vrontou on the Mainland were shown to have been worked from the Hellenistic/Roman to the turn of this century. A second century BC nickel-rich bloom found at the Hellenistic site at Petres in West Macedonia testified, for the first time, to the smelting of nickel-rich iron laterites in Greece, while the manganese-rich iron deposits in Palaia Kavala district were worked for their precious metals content, probably during Ottoman times and perhaps as early as the Classical period. It is suggested that the Skapte Hyle of the classical texts may be located in the Palaia Kavala district. A fresh appraisal of the depiction of furnaces on Black and Red Figure Attic vases of the sixth and fifth centuries BC suggests that the bloomery process may have developed at that time to a level not previously suspected. The classical texts, the function of the cauldron on the furnace top and experimental meltings carried out in the process of this work all point to the production of wrought iron/steel through the decarburisation of high carbon iron in a fining hearth. It is argued that the furnaces depicted on the vases are themselves fining hearths, the cauldron sealing the furnace top in order for the air blast to be directed over the molten mass...|$|R
25|$|Mineral {{processing}} (or mineral dressing) is {{a specialized}} {{area in the}} science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (<b>extractive</b> <b>metallurgy)</b> of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste material). Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as sluice boxes. Only minor shaking or washing {{may be necessary to}} disaggregate (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.|$|E

500|$|Zinc is {{the fourth}} most common metal in use, {{trailing}} only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 10 million tonnes. Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc metal is produced using <b>extractive</b> <b>metallurgy.</b> Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide: For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at [...] into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid: After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.|$|E
