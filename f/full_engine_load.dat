50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, a variable-length intake manifold (VLIM),variable intake manifold (VIM), or variable intake system (VIS) is an automobile {{internal combustion}} engine manifold technology. As the name implies, VLIM/VIM/VIS can vary {{the length of the}} intake tract - in order to optimise power and torque across the range of engine speed operation, as well as help provide better fuel efficiency. This effect is often achieved by having two separate intake ports, each controlled by a valve, that open two different manifolds - one with a short path that operates at <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load,</b> and another with a significantly longer path that operates at lower load. The first patent issued for a variable length intake manifold was published in 1958, US Patent US2835235 by Daimler Benz AG.|$|E
40|$|Digestate {{from the}} {{anaerobic}} digestion conversion process {{is widely used}} as a farm land fertiliser. This study proposes an alternative use {{as a source of}} energy. Dried digestate was pyrolysed and the resulting oil was blended with waste cooking oil and butanol (10, 20 and 30 vol. %). The physical and chemical properties of the pyrolysis oil blends were measured and compared with pure fossil diesel and waste cooking oil. The blends were tested in a multi-cylinder indirect injection compression ignition engine. Engine combustion, exhaust gas emissions and performance parameters were measured and compared with pure fossil diesel operation. The ASTM copper corrosion values for 20 % and 30 % pyrolysis blends were 2 c, compared to 1 b for fossil diesel. The kinematic viscosities of the blends at 40 C were 5 – 7 times higher than that of fossil diesel. Digested pyrolysis oil blends produced lower in-cylinder peak pressures than fossil diesel and waste cooking oil operation. The maximum heat release rates of the blends were approximately 8 % higher than with fossil diesel. The ignition delay periods of the blends were higher; pyrolysis oil blends started to combust late and once combustion started burnt quicker than fossil diesel. The total burning duration of the 20 % and 30 % blends were decreased by 12 % and 3 % compared to fossil diesel. At <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load,</b> the brake thermal efficiencies of the blends were decreased by about 3 – 7 % when compared to fossil diesel. The pyrolysis blends gave lower smoke levels; at <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load,</b> smoke level of the 20 % blend was 44 % lower than fossil diesel. In comparison to fossil diesel and at full load, the brake specific fuel consumption (wt.) of the 30 % and 20 % blends were approximately 32 % and 15 % higher. At <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load,</b> the CO emission of the 20 % and 30 % blends were decreased by 39 % and 66 % with respect to the fossil diesel. Blends CO 2 emissions were similar to that of fossil diesel; at <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load,</b> 30 % blend produced approximately 5 % higher CO 2 emission than fossil diesel. The study concludes that on the basis of short term engine experiment up to 30 % blend of pyrolysis oil from digestate of arable crops {{can be used in a}} compression ignition engine...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{expected}} {{depletion of}} natural petroleum {{resources in the}} near future and pollution of the environment due to excessive carbon dioxide emissions by fossil fuel and its adverse effect on global warming constitute two major problems facing the whole world. In view of these problems, much research work is now directed worldwide to find fuels alternative to those derived from petroleum which should be renewable and more environmentally friendly fuels. Biodiesel fuel which is a blend of fatty acid esters with alcohols is considered the most suitable alternative fuel for diesel engines. In this scope of research work, a previous study (Soliman et al., 2013) has been made to explore the opportunity of utilizing the fatty acids that can be obtained from the waste of edible oil industry in Egypt to produce biodiesel fuel by direct esterification with methanol as well as ethanol in the presence of sulfuric acid as a catalyst. This paper is a continuation of that work where two other alcohols of a chain length longer than ethanol have been used being propanol and butanol. The performance of a diesel engine running using a 50 % blend of regular diesel fuel and each of the two biodiesels prepared was compared to that using regular diesel fuel. The results have shown that the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the brake thermal efficiency at <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>loading</b> were almost the same in all cases. This indicates that the produced fuel could be used as an efficient fuel substitute for diesel engines. By comparing {{the results of the present}} work to those reported in our previous work, it appeared that methanol which has the shortest carbon chain length is the most recommended in view of the brake thermal efficiency of a diesel <b>engine</b> at <b>full</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R

The model is a Mixing Controlled Combustion type with enhancements to account for wall impingements, pilot injections, charge dilution caused by EGR at part load. The model was parameterised in two steps using a small set of measured data: the majority of model parameters were identified without EGR before identifying additional EGR related constants. The model performance was assessed based on key metrics: start of combustion; peak heat release and point of peak heat release and cylinder pressure. The model was evaluated over the <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> speed, <b>load</b> and EGR operating envelope and cylinder pressure metrics were predicted with R 2 values above 0. 94.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines, {{used for}} driving of different cars, occurs {{not only at}} full load, but mostly at the part load. The relative load exchange work at the <b>full</b> (nominal) <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> is significantly low. At the part load of the IC engine its energy efficiency ηe is significantly lower than in the optimal (nominal field) range of the performance parameters. One of the numerous reasons of this effect is regular growing of the relative load exchange work of the IC engine. It is directly connected with the quantitative regulation method commonly used in the IC engines. From the thermodynamic point of view - the main reason of this effect is the throttling process (causing exergy losses) occurring in the inlet and outlet channels. The known proposals for solving of this problem are based on applying of the fully electronic control of the motion of inlet, outlet valves and new reference cycles. The idea presented in the paper leads to diminishing the charge exchange work of the IC engines. The problem can be solved using presented in the paper a new concept of the reference cycle (called as eco-cycle) of IC engine. The work of the engine basing on the eco-cycle occurs in two 3 -stroke stages; the fresh air is delivered only once for both stages, but in range of each stage a new portion of fuel is burned. Normally the charge exchange occurs once during each engine cycle realized.

This fuel presents differences in chemical composition and on physical properties as compared to standard biodiesel produced from vegetable oils. Tests were performed on a single cylinder, air cooled, direct injection diesel engine at 1500 rpm, performance and pollutant emissions were measured and the combustion parameters were analyzed. The use of AFRBD in the engine resulted in similar performance with slight brake thermal efficiency decrease at low loads and a slight increase at high loads. A decrease of 9 % of power output at 1500 rpm was also detected. As per pollutant emissions, a drastic reduction of unburned hydrocarbons between 32 % and 45 % was obtained with AFRBD (animal fat residue biodiesel). Particulate matter emissions were also reduced at low and medium load ranges, but no differences were detected at high loads.

The present work is an experimental study conducted on a DI diesel engine running with either pistacia lentiscus (PL) biodiesel or its blends with conventional diesel fuel. PL biodiesel is obtained by converting PL seed oil via a single-step homogenous alkali catalyzed transesterification process.

The exhaust particles sampled were analysed using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). In general, the particle number concentration increased with increasing engine load using both measurement systems. Comparing the particle number and volume concentrations, the MDTS system measures a lower level in the nanoparticle range, Dp< 50 nm, but a higher level in the accumulation mode size range, 50 <D p< 670 nm, than the EDS system. The measurements also showed that the MDTS system shifted the particle count median diameter (CMD) to larger particle diameter and the particle number size and volume distribution for all engine load conditions. It is mainly because the mini-dilution tunnel leads to the particle transformations of nucleation and condensation taking place simultaneously when the exhaust particle emissions are cooled and diluted. However, the effect of coagulation on the total number particle concentration was shown to be negligible. On the other hand, the EDS measurement system can minimise the particle transformations taking place on the exhaust particle number and size distributions during the heated dilution process. Hence, the EDS measurement system can provide more reliable diesel exhaust particle number and size distributions than MDTS measurement system. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

A heat recuperator is installed to improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the organic Rankine cycle. The potential use of EGR and charge air cooler as major components of Rankine cycle system is also examined. A turbocompounding simulation model has been developed by including operating charts for turbocharger and power turbine. Thus, an estimation of the power turbine operation on turbocharger and engine performance. A separate finite element model has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of a thermoelectric generator installed in a diesel engine. A thermodynamic simulation model for Rankine cycle has been developed including a sub-model for the description of heat transfer between the hot fluid and the working medium. The developed simulation tool provides the optimum Rankine cycle operating points at each engine load. Thus, the model estimates the dimensions of the system heat exchangers. The theoretical analysis provided the following results: # The electrical turbocompound improves the overall bsfc when the turbocharger efficiency increases. # The installation of a power turbine downstream of the turbocharger turbine reduces further the overall bsfc compared to the previous technique at all engine loads. # The improvement of specific fuel consumption is negligible when using thermoelectric generators for exhaust gas heat recovery. # The maximum reduction in the overall bsfc is achieved with the installation of the organic Rankine cycle system for heat exploitation from exhaust gas, EGR and charge air cooler. # The significant increase of the total rejected heat from Rankine cycle and diesel engine to the ambience is the major disadvantage of the system. The size reduction of the required cooling system is feasible with the modification of Rankine cycle operation at <b>full</b> <b>engine</b> <b>load.</b> # The use of Rankine cycle system for exhaust gas temperature management proved to be beneficial for the improvement of SCR catalyst efficiency and its protection during active filter regeneration. # The size estimation of the Rankine cycle components proved that the installation of the system on a heavy duty truck is feasible. ...|$|E

In this paper, engine {{simulation}} tool is used {{to investigate}} the effect of variable intake manifold and variable valve timing technologies on the <b>engine</b> performance at <b>full</b> <b>load</b> <b>engine</b> conditions. Here, an engine model of 1. 6 litre four cylinders, four stroke spark ignition (SI) engine is constructed using GT-Power software to represent the real engine conditions. This constructed model is then correlated to the experimental data {{to make sure the}} accuracy of this model. The comparison results of volumetric efficiency (VE), intake manifold air pressure (MAP), exhaust manifold back pressure (BckPress) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) show very well agreement with the differences of less than 4 %. Then this correlated model {{is used to}} predict the engine performance at various intake runner lengths (IRL) and various intake valve open (IVO) timings. Design of experiment and optimisation tool are applied to obtain optimum parameters. Here, several configurations of IRL and IVO timing are proposed to give several options during the engine development work. A significant improvement is found at configuration of variable IVO timing and variable IRL compared to fixed IVO timing and fixed IRL...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>engine</b> <b>loading</b> on {{emission}} of particulate matter was studied {{by using an}} Otto engine (Honda astrea grand 110 cc). In the experiment, the characteristics of <b>loading</b> <b>engine,</b> fuel consumption and composition of particulate matter were investigated. The <b>engine</b> <b>loading</b> was determinated in term of engine transmittion, the fuel consumption was measured by using plastic tube scale, and composition of deposit particulate matter was analyzed by using spectrophotometer. The experimental results show that the quantity and fuel consumption was increased by the increasing <b>engine</b> <b>loading.</b> The deposite of particulate matter was generally characterized by organic carbon content.

However, BTE for all biodiesel blends as compared with HSD was reduced on average by 2.09 % at full load, and it was further reduced to 3.41 % at 20 % <b>engine</b> <b>loading</b> due to higher losses.|$|R
40|$|The {{match of}} an {{injector}} with the combustion chamber was studied through {{computational fluid dynamics}} simulation under four different <b>engine</b> <b>loads.</b> Four design parameters including the start of injection, spray angle, injector protrusion length and swirl ratio were examined. The Latin hypercube together with a non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian algorithm {{were used in the}} optimisation. Comparisons were made in the <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> in terms of the optimisation history, objectives, sub-objectives and design parameters. The commonalities of the design parameters of the optimums were summarised. Additionally, a detailed combustion process comparison was conducted on the same <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> (100 % and 25 % <b>engine</b> <b>loads)</b> between the optimum and baseline designs, respectively. Finally, the effects of the design parameters on the objective were investigated by the response surface methodology. The results indicate that the non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian method is an effective algorithm to spot the optimums with the best trade-off between nitrogen oxides and soot emissions. The optimisation process presents better qualities at 100 % and 75 % <b>engine</b> <b>loads</b> than in the case of 50 % and 25 % <b>engine</b> <b>loads.</b> The design parameters of the optimum under each <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> have something in common, namely, that they all prefer late injection, low swirl, large injection angle and slightly smaller nozzle protrusion length. Besides, start of injection and swirl ratio have larger influence on the objective as opposed to the nozzle protrusion length and spray angle. The large start of injection together with the small swirl ratio can reduce the objective significantly and vice versa. A large nozzle protrusion length with a small spray angle contributes to the reduction of the objective and so does the combination of a small nozzle protrusion length with a large spray angle...|$|R

40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} {{is composed}} of spherical or nearly spherical primary particles. In this study, the primary particle size and nanostructure were investigated at five engine operating conditions for a medium-duty direct injection diesel engine, using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). The diesel particles were collected from diluted exhaust gas and an ultrasonic extraction method was used for obtaining the TEM samples. The TEM images reveal that primary particle size and nanostructure depend on the engine operating conditions. The mean diameter of the primary particles is in the range 23. 8 - 28. 5. nm, depending on the engine speed and <b>engine</b> <b>load.</b> The nanostructure could reflect the particle formation processes. The larger primary particles are formed at low engine speed and high <b>engine</b> <b>load.</b> They have irregular shape and distinguishable trace of pre-formed particle, indicating the combined effect of particle coalescence and surface growth. Primary particles with core-shell structure are common at high <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> with different <b>engine</b> speeds. The particles exhibit disorder structure at low <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> and high <b>engine</b> speed due to lower in-cylinder gas temperature and shorter combustion duration. Quantitative analysis of the nanostructures indicates that graphitization of primary particles is affected by <b>engine</b> <b>load</b> but not by engine speed.
