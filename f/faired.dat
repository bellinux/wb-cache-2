5|$|During {{the course}} of the fly-off, the gun turrets proved troublesome, their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered. As a result of these problems, the XB-21's nose turret was <b>faired</b> over, while the dorsal turret was removed.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was <b>faired</b> into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also <b>faired</b> into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its <b>faired</b> main gear legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings {{to ensure that the}} aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the tail section. The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, <b>faired</b> into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest <b>faired</b> into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|Three B-29s {{based on}} Guam, which had spotless mission records and no {{mechanical}} difficulties, {{were selected for}} the mission. In a ten-day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa, the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets, and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were <b>faired</b> over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag. Blister-type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones, painted group markings were removed, and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster, all {{in order to achieve}} the least possible drag. Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder. The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600-gallon (2,300L) fuel tanks; added to the normal B-29 fuel tanks, this made a total of 10,000 gallons (38,000L) of fuel capacity, as much as a railroad tank car. Filled with fuel and 12 men, each ship weighed —it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B-29 at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{powered by a}} version of the de Havilland Gipsy Major 4-cylinder inverted inline engine, licence built by Alfa Romeo, which produced 90kW (120hp) and drove a two blade propeller. Aft of the pilot's side windows, two further rectangular windows on each side lit the passenger cabin, the forward one on the port side incorporated into a cabin access door. The Z.1010 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with enclosed, <b>faired</b> mainwheels on <b>faired</b> half axles mounted on the lower fuselage. Tall, <b>faired</b> shock absorbing legs ran from wheels to wing roots.|$|E
25|$|Team X-Tracer Switzerland won the $2.5 million Alternative Tandem {{competition}} with their 205.3MPGe <b>faired</b> electric motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|X-Tracer Team Switzerland – An aerodynamically <b>faired</b> {{electric}} feet forwards motorcycle with outrigger wheels which deploy when {{stopped and}} retract at speed.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{to ride the}} 'Dustbin' <b>faired</b> Norton for Joe Potts, from Bellshill near Glasgow, and {{continued to}} win races other than the TT. The 1956 TT saw retirements with mechanical problems.|$|E
25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, <b>faired</b> interplane strut on each side braced the rear spar of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, <b>faired</b> diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|E
25|$|The VE-8 variant {{completed}} in July 1919 had a 340hp Wright-Hispano H engine, reduced overall dimensions, increased wing area, a shorter <b>faired</b> cabane, and two Vickers guns. Two were completed. Flight test results were disappointing, the aircraft was overweight, with heavy controls, inadequate stability and sluggish performance.|$|E
25|$|The Navy-Wright NW-1 was an {{unconventional}} streamlined design, {{based on a}} sesquiplane with main wheels <b>faired</b> into the lower wing, and bracing minimized to further reduce drag. Lamblin radiators were suspended beneath the fuselage and wire bracing was incorporated for the mid-fuselage mounted main wing and tailplane.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{primarily}} wooden, with plywood-skinned spruce frames. The cantilever oleo-pneumatic fixed main undercarriage legs were <b>faired</b> with spats. The undercarriage, tail unit and outer wing panels were {{adapted from the}} Parnall Heck 2C. The propeller was a de Havilland fixed-pitch type. Student and tutor sat in open, tandem cockpits, but the rear cockpit was later enclosed.|$|E
25|$|An {{armament}} subsystem {{providing a}} single M195 20mm cannon {{on the port}} inboard pylon of the AH-1G. 950 rounds of ammunition were stored in boxes <b>faired</b> {{to the side of}} the aircraft. The system was primarily pilot controlled, but featured dual controls to be either pilot or gunner controlled. For this purpose the pilot was provided with a M73 sight.|$|E
25|$|Standards {{usually do}} not come with {{fairings}} or windscreens, or if they have them, they are relatively small. Standard is often a synonym for naked bike, a term that became popular in the 1990s {{in response to the}} proliferation of fully <b>faired</b> sport bikes. The standard seemed to have disappeared, fueling nostalgia for the return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which were admired for their simplicity, quality, and versatility.|$|E
25|$|The Breguet 670's wing had a {{constant}} thickness centre section, with wing roots <b>faired</b> into the fuselage on its trailing edges, and two outer panels, tapering in both thickness {{and plan to}} semi-elliptical tips. It was a two spar structure, with sheet duralumin, I-section spars which had extruded webs, and was duralumin skinned. Narrow chord slotted ailerons occupied the outer two-thirds of the span and the rest fitted with similar flaps.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} during the {{reconstruction}} the fixed axle undercarriage was replaced with a more refined arrangement where the wheels were separately mounted on hinged and <b>faired</b> V-struts from the fuselage underside and with vertical shock absorber struts to the wing underside, allowing much larger wheel deflections on landing than with the less than half wheel-diameter allowed by end-sprung rigid axle mountings. Unusually, the wheels, which had three-ply centres, were ash-tyred because rubber was expensive in postwar Germany.|$|E
25|$|The slim {{fuselage}} of the Nautilus did {{not have}} its keel aligned with the lower wing, as on most biplanes; rather, the centreline was at mid-gap. Blackburn used the gap between keel and wing to insert a <b>faired</b> radiator with a shutter-controlled front intake. This rather enhanced the Nautilus' pointed appearance. The wings were of two-bay construction with parallel struts, staggered and swept. Only the lower wing had dihedral. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The wings were foldable for carrier storage.|$|E
25|$|Although Gull {{variants}} were {{powered by}} five different engines, those were all inverted inline air-cooled types driving two-bladed propellers, making for a neatly <b>faired</b> installation. The rear fuselage was of square cross section with a rounded top. The glazed cabin joined smoothly into a raised dorsal fairing, {{and placed the}} pilot in front and two passenger seats, slightly staggered behind. Entry into the early models was via the sliding canopy. The main undercarriage was fixed and spatted, each wheel mounted on three struts in the early models; {{there was a small}} steerable tail wheel.|$|E
25|$|The Gull was {{assembled}} at the Kirkham {{facility in}} Garden City, New York and Mitchel Field. It used conventional landing gear, a mid-wing arrangement, corrugated aluminum skins, and a radial engine. The cockpit featured a large streamlined greenhouse bubble with two seats. The large tailwheel was steerable and fully <b>faired.</b> The tail used small vertical stabilizers, with large elevators {{that could be}} swept back in flight. The aircraft profile was not unusual for the era {{with the exception of}} the highly tapered and swept back wings with a large dihedral and large tapered tail surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Improvements {{were made}} to the {{original}} design and new models were introduced. The 1948 Vespa 125 had rear suspension and a bigger engine. The headlamp was moved up to the handlebars in 1953 and had more engine power and a restyled rear fairing. A cheaper spartan version was also available. One of the best-loved models was the Vespa 150 GS introduced in 1955 with a 150cc engine, a long saddle, and the <b>faired</b> handlebar-headlamp unit. Then came the 50cc of 1963, and in 1968 Vespa 125 Primavera {{became one of the most}} durable of all.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{attacks were}} made by Allied forces, the first on 21 August and the second on 27 August. The first assault {{resulted}} in limited gains around the lower parts of the hill, but the Ottoman defenders managed to hold the heights even after the attack was continued by a fresh Australian battalion on 22 August. Reinforcements were committed, but nevertheless the second major assault on 27 August <b>faired</b> similarly, and although fighting around the summit continued {{over the course of}} three days, {{at the end of the}} battle the Ottoman forces remained in possession of the summit.|$|E
25|$|AJS {{pulled out}} of racing, and Bob was soon riding the 'Dustbin' <b>faired</b> Potts Norton, and winning. The TT looked to be within reach, and in the 1955 Isle of Man Junior TT he did lead for four of the seven laps, but brake {{overheating}} and suspension problems forced him to slow, allowing Bill Lomas on a Moto Guzzi to pass, {{and go on to}} victory. Bob came second. In the Senior he managed fifth, with an average of , very good for a private entant among works teams. Giulio Carcano offered him a Guzzi ride after, but he did not accept.|$|E
25|$|The E.1 was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} with spruce frames and plywood covering. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with straight, thick section, constant chord wings of quite high aspect ratio (8.45). The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped <b>faired</b> underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} {{aircraft in}} the contemporary sense, with a structure of duralumin but largely fabric covering. A parasol wing, with a cut-out in the trailing edge over the open cockpit, ensured the pilot a good all round view. The wing was straight edged with constant chord and was fitted with long span ailerons. It was braced to the lower fuselage on each side {{with a pair of}} parallel, <b>faired</b> struts to about half span. The wing section to half span was moderately thick but thinned outboard, giving an overall maximum lift to drag ratio of almost 20.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{requirement}} in Europe for headlamps of standardized size or shape, and lamps could be designed in any shape and size, {{as long as}} the lamps met the engineering and performance requirements contained in the applicable European safety standards. Rectangular headlamps were first used in 1961, developed by Cibié for the Citroën Ami 6 and by Hella for the German Ford Taunus. They were prohibited in the United States where round lamps were required until 1975. Another early headlamp styling concept involved conventional round lamps <b>faired</b> into the car's bodywork with aerodynamic glass covers, such as those on the 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and on pre-1967 VW Beetles.|$|E
25|$|It had a circular-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical inlet cone {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was <b>faired</b> into the spine that {{ran the length of}} the top of the fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a single wheel on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
25|$|Weight-saving was a {{priority}} across the aircraft; the airframe, {{other than the}} steel tube engine mount and cowling, featured a wooden rectangular monocoque structure. It had a glued plywood skin, fixed to the mahogany longerons and struts forming the internal structure, which was <b>faired</b> throughout {{to result in a}} low-drag extensions. A conventional fixed undercarriage was used; it had been deemed of greater importance to reduce the aircraft's weight than its drag, thus a retractable undercarriage was seen as counterproductive. The wings, which were constructed in three sections, had a center section integral with the fuselage; the internal structure used three main spars with plywood webs and mahogany flanges, which were covered with plywood sheeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{all-metal}} rotor blades, {{through which}} the compressed air travelled to be ejected at the blade tips, consist of a spar of ing thickness, a honeycomb-filled trailing edge, and feature <b>faired</b> roots in order to the increase their lift coefficient. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the blades possessed a highly homogenous structure, a highly finished surface and a constant profile, and could be easily dismantled to facilitate inspection of the main spar. Additionally, the blade had no risk of icing {{as a consequence of}} the internal current of warm air passing though. The Djinn used relatively standard flight controls, such as the collective pitch control (upon which the throttle was positioned) and adjustable friction trims.|$|E
25|$|Jack Riley Sr. {{built the}} first model {{with a team of}} four. With {{encouragement}} from Lycoming, the 125hp Lycoming O-290 four-cylinder engine was selected for the project. Design changes from the basic Navion structure included strengthened wing spars, that supported engine mounts and other components from Piper PA-18 Super Cub, plus new engine nacelles, a <b>faired</b> nose section that replaced the existing engine and cowling, and a new vertical tail and rudder based on the existing horizontal stabilizer. During testing in 1952, the aircraft was initially named the X-16 Bi-Navion. On 10 November 1952, it was granted certification by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), after which it was renamed as the D-16 Twin Navion.|$|E
25|$|The 'Camel' may be {{regarded}} as the prototype of the Consolidated response to the USAAS's 1924 requirement for a new primary trainer. In the early summer of 1924, the USAAS tested a prototype unofficially designated TW-8 and placed an order for 50 examples of the Consolidated Model 1 production variant for service with the designation PT-1. Early production models had flat dorsal turtledecks, soon replaced by a <b>faired</b> version, and some of the first ones were likely built at the Gallaudet plant in Norwich before production began at Buffalo. The first 171 of the 221 produced used a streamlined nose radiator, the remainder used the unfaired installation. One PT-1 airframe was completed as XPT-2 with a 220hp (164kW) Wright J-5 radial engine.|$|E
25|$|Like the P.V.2, the new design, the Port Victoria P.V.9 was a single-engined {{sesquiplane}} (i.e. a biplane {{with its}} lower wing {{much smaller than}} its upper wing) braced with <b>faired</b> steel tubes. The fuselage, wider {{than that of the}} P.V.2, was mounted between the upper and lower wings, almost filling the inter-wing gap, giving an excellent view for the pilot. Armament was a Vickers machine gun synchronised to fire through the propeller disc, with a Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing firing over the propeller. Power was provided by a Bentley BR1 rotary engine. While the designers had hoped to use the same high-lift aerofoil section as used in the P.V.2, this was rejected by the Admiralty, who demanded the use of the more conventional RAF 15 aerofoil, which resulted in a larger aircraft with a reduced climb rate and ceiling.|$|E
25|$|From the F-4 onward, the new 20mm Mauser MG 151/20 with 200 rounds {{was used}} as the Motorkanone. The first F-4s reached {{frontline}} units in June 1941. Production lasted exactly a year between May 1941 and May 1942, with 1,841 of all F-4 variants produced. Some of the later models were capable of mounting two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons under the wing in <b>faired</b> gondolas with 135 rpg. These were designated F-4/R1 and 240 of them were produced by WNF {{in the first quarter of}} 1942. This optional additional armament was standardized as field kit for later G and K series. A special high-altitude variant, the F-4/Z featuring GM-1 boost, was also built with a production run of 544 in the first quarter of 1942 and saw extensive use. Finally, the Erla factory produced 576 tropicalized F-4 trop in the first half of 1942.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{consisted of}} retrofitting a bulbous bow, <b>faired</b> {{to the existing}} icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by KaMeWa, to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker to ballast water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated heeling tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to , which substantially increased the ships' deadweight tonnage. Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new incinerator {{to deal with the}} shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the Wärtsilä Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|In April/May 1942, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) {{operated}} 15 Whitley Mk V aircraft {{which had}} been converted into freighters. The conversion process involved the removal of all armaments, the turret recesses were <b>faired</b> over, additional fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bay, {{the interior of the}} fuselage was adapted for freight stowage, and at least one aircraft was fitted with an enlarged cargo door. The type was typically used for night supply flights from Gibraltar to Malta; the route took seven hours to traverse, and would often require landing during Axis air attacks on the island. Whitley freighters also flew the dangerous route between Leuchars Station, Scotland and Stockholm, Sweden. The Whitley consumed a proportionally large quantity of fuel to carry a relatively small payload, and there were various other reasons making the type less than ideal, so in August 1942 the type was replaced by the Lockheed Hudson and the 14 survivors were returned to the RAF.|$|E
