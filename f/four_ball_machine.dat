The {{results show that the}} novel B, N, S-containing TMP esters have excellent thermal stability and possess good friction-reducing behavior when they are used as additives in rapeseed oil. Intorduction Recently, vegetable oils have been found {{to play an important role}} and put into practice in some engineering fields, because of its natural, non-toxic, biodegradable, and relatively cheaper. Their chemical stability and triboligical properties also can be improved by additives. Much effort has been done and development of new types of friction-reducing additives for vegetable oils, such as benzotriazole derivatives, 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole derivatives, thiazole derivatives and triazine derivatives [1, 2]. Tri(hydroxymethyl) propane (TMP) esters exhibit several advantages as lubricating fluids. It has been well known that TMP esters show excellent thermal stability, good friction-reducing and antiwear properties, non-toxic and biodegradable [3]. These properties can be improved by selection elements such as boron, nitrogen and sulphur in TMP esters.

The test parameters are: load 100, 200 and 300 N, sliding speed 0. 461, 0. 576 and 0. 691 m/s, test time being 60 minutes. The friction coefficient was higher for the two vegetable grades, but its values kept in the range of 0. 025 – 0. 095 for these vegetable oils, suggest a mixed or boundary regime that could be practically accepted. The WSD was lower for these two vegetable oils under lower load. For 300 N, WSD was higher than 0. 4 mm for all tested oils. Flash temperature parameter (FTP) was better for the two grades of soybean oil at tests with 200 N.

40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{that are}} used today by Sandvik Materials Technology AB in the cold pilger process contain chlorinated paraffins. Due to environmental, economic and health reasons, these lubricants have to be replaced. The method for trying out new pilger lubricants today is full scale trials in cold pilger mills. The main aim of this thesis has been to investigate whether {{it is possible to}} evaluate pilger lubricants by using some standard laboratory tribological test methods. In addition to this, a review of published literature and a description of the cold pilger process in tribological terms have also been conducted. The literature review included the published work pertaining to cold pilgering in tribology related scientific journals and books. This review indicated that only very limited information is available in open literature and the survey was therefore broadened to include other similar metal working processes. The test methods that have been used are the sliding four ball test machine and the SRV (Schwingung Reibung Verschleiß) reciprocating friction and wear tester. The test specimens for the <b>four</b> <b>ball</b> <b>machine</b> were standard bearing steel balls. In the SRV tests, cylinder on disc and a ball on disc test specimen configurations were used. The cylinder specimens were manufactured from the tube material and the disc specimens were made of mandrel material. The balls for the SRV were made of standard stainless steel. In the <b>four</b> <b>ball</b> <b>machine,</b> both the wear preventive characteristics and extreme pressure properties have been evaluated. In the SRV Optimol machine, seizure and wear tests have been performed. To analyse the surfaces, Wyko 1100 NT optical surface profiler has been used. A more thorough analysis of test specimen surfaces was also carried out by using SEM/EDS at SMT. The results show that the SRV cylinder on disc and ball on disc seizure tests are very representative of the cold pilger process. The ranking of various lubricant formulations from these tests correlate very well to the ranking from the full scale cold pilger trials. The surface damage modes and material transfer in the tests correspond well with those observed in the actual process. The SRV wear test corresponds only to a limited extent and {{the reason for this is}} that the ranking of cold pilger lubricants is not based on wear. The four ball EP tests do not correlate that well with the real ranking. This is attributed to the use of different test specimen material in four ball tests as compared to that actual tube/mandrel materials and the test method may not reproduce the conditions prevalent in the cold pilger process. The four ball wear tests do not correlate at all to the actual ranking of lubricant formulations owing to the same reasons and also in view of the fact that the ranking is not based on wear.

The practical advantages of thermal spray coatings like high deposition rates, low cost and tribological properties of high wear resistance have enabled these coatings to {{become an integral part}} of aircraft and automobile industry. Recent advancements in thermal spraying techniques like high particle speed and temperature call for new applications for these coatings. This experimental study addresses the Rolling Contact Fatigue performance of thermal spray coatings deposited by a variety of techniques like High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF), Detonation Gun (D-Gun) and Plasma spraying. RCF tests were conducted using a modified <b>four</b> <b>ball</b> <b>machine</b> in conventional steel ball bearing and hybrid ceramic bearing configurations. Tribological conditions during the RCF tests were varied by changing the test lubricant and the lubrication mechanism, contact load and shape of the drive coated rolling element to vary the roll/slip ratio.

Experimental and theoretical studies of the ball kinematics have also been included. These tests revealed that the performance of the coated rolling elements was dependent upon the coating and the substrate properties. The coating thickness, substrate hardness, tribological conditions during the test, coating and substrate material as well as the coating process and the substrate preparation significantly affect the coating performance and the failure modes.

Rolling contact fatigue RCF tests were conducted using a modified <b>four</b> <b>ball</b> <b>machine</b> in conventional steel ball bearing and hybrid ceramic bearing configurations. These tests were conducted under various tribological conditions of contact stress and lubrication regimes at room temperature. Failure modes were investigated on the basis of surface and subsurface observations of failed coated rolling elements. Surface observations were made using conventional scanning electron Ž. microscopy SEM and light microscopy. Subsurface observations were made using fluorescent dye penetrant technique. Observations of Ž. debris generated during the RCF tests, changes in topography of lower planetary balls, electron probe microscope analysis EPMA, microhardnessrfracture toughness investigations and, coating microstructural studies are also included to aid the discussion. Two modes of failures, i. e., surface wear and coating delamination, were observed during this investigation. Coated rolling elements failed in either one or a combination of these two modes depending upon the tribological conditions during the RCF test. Surface wear was associated with asperity contact in the presence of microsliprsliding within the contact region. The process was accelerated in the later stages of RCF tests in the presence of wear debris due to additional mechanism of three body abrasion. Coating delamination was associated with the initiationrpropagation of subsurface cracks, which resulted due to defects in the coating microstructure. These cracks propagated a...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Ceramic/ceramic and ceramic/steel contacts under lubricated rolling conditions are studied. This work is of interest to ball bearing manufacturers {{as the use of}} ceramics in the design of these components has some advantages over traditional bearing-steel materials. Low density and increased stiffness are the mechanical properties which gas-turbine and machine tool manufacturers are most likely to realise. Much research {{over the past two decades}} on material structure, quality control and manufacturing techniques has produced a material which can seriously challenge bearing steel in ball-bearing design. This is especially the case for hybrid ball-bearings, ie ceramic balls with steel bearing races which are now used as standard components. The purpose of this study is to examine the rolling contact fatigue failure modes of ceramics. This study concentrates on silicon nitride as this material has most potential for use by industry. The primary reason for studying ceramic balls is because of interest in ball-bearing applications, hence a modified four-ball machine is employed which correctly models ball motions and precisely defines ball load. Experimental and theoretical kinematic analysis of ball motion during modified <b>four</b> <b>ball</b> <b>machine</b> tests is presented. The kinematic analysis reveals that in practice, lower ball tracking exists at high speeds. Test conditions of lubricated contacts under high compressive stress show delamination type failures. Delamination failures are classified in terms of propagation and initiation from scanning electron microscope observations. Residual stresses are measured on delaminated surfaces, which implies plastic deformation of the ceramic. Also, chemical analysis implies that disruption of silicon, nitrogen and oxygen levels may take place on delaminated surfaces. Experiments illustrating various fatigue failure modes using artificially pre-cracked ceramic balls in contact with a steel upper ball are presented...|$|E

An experimental ball-on-flat test configuration was employed for both static and dynamic contact fatigue testing. In house designed test rig was used to study static cyclic loading contact fatigue behaviours of brittle polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in contact with balls made of different materials, i. e.

A modified <b>four</b> <b>ball</b> test <b>machine</b> was used to study dynamic rolling contact fatigue behaviours of thermally sprayed molybdenum and titanium coatings in contact with steel balls in dry and seawater conditions.

In static contact fatigue, adhesive strength of the interface was the key factor controlling damage of the PMMA plate in both dry and oil-lubricated conditions. In dry conditions, three failure modes, i. e. adhesive wear, ring cracks, and radial cracks controlled the damage of PMMA to a different degree for each combination of materials. Whereas, the damage of each combination in oil-lubricated conditions was affected by the extent of three failure modes, i. e. adhesive wear, radial cracks and abrasive wear.
