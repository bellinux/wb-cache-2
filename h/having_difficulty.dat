5|$|By late 1941, Pontecorvo was <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{securing}} the radioisotopes that he needed. Unbeknown to him, the Manhattan Project, the wartime {{effort to build}} atomic bombs, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, were {{suffering}} serious logistics problems which {{prevented them from}} supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical care.

Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that they would soon have more water.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel Mazes and Monsters and later made into a TV movie. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists, the first being that of Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of D.|$|E

5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The {{album was}} an instant hit, selling over seven million copies in the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> coping with the band's newfound fame and started to dislike it. Frusciante often argued with his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett wanted a large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as he wanted a Discworld game to be developed by a company with a reputation and who cared about the property. An original story was created due to Barnett <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Aged 19, Harvey was the {{youngest}} player of the touring party. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, he had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score a Test century by compiling 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer of 1947–48. However, Harvey struggled {{early on in the}} tour, <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team {{in the first half of}} the tour, Harvey's performances improved with his increasing familiarity with local conditions and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Sid Barnes. Harvey scored 112 in a first innings counter-attack to keep Australia in contention after they had suffered a top-order collapse. Harvey hit the winning boundary in the second innings as Australia won the match with a Test world record successful run-chase of 3/404. He retained his place for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 133 runs at a batting average of 66.50.|$|E

5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a few basic tracks, when Kiedis began <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E

5|$|Tallon {{was then}} rested and Saggers {{took his place}} for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested {{for the next two}} matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted {{steadily}} with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the northwest, and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming. Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained very broad, with Reconnaissance Aircraft <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> pinpointing the center. In addition, an upper level low located over Brownsville, Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system, which limited outflow to the east side. Forecasters predicted the upper level low to weaken, allowing {{for the possibility of}} Grace to intensify to a 65mph (100km/h) tropical storm over warm waters. However, the upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system. A new center of circulation reformed 115miles (185km) north of the original center, and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm. Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land, and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{there was}} a renewal of football at Maryland. Fullback Grenville Lewis was elected as team captain and head coach. He instituted a strict physical training regimen involving calisthenics and long-distance running, and banned smoking, drinking, and eating pie during the football season. This was unpopular with the team, but Lewis was embraced by the students and faculty. In the game to decide the state championship, Maryland Agricultural faced Maryland-Baltimore. Late in the scoreless game, the Aggies pushed to their opponents' two-yard line. With darkness approaching and Maryland Agricultural <b>having</b> <b>difficulty</b> scoring, the referee called the game. It became clear that Maryland-Baltimore had sneaked three extra players onto the field, but the referee refused to award the Aggies the win. Two days later, the Maryland–Baltimore players voted to forfeit the game, {{and with it the}} championship, to Maryland Agricultural.|$|E
