Results show that shallow cumulus clouds can significantly enhance vertical transport of the tracer in both cases. In the case with surface-borne pollutants, cloudy regions {{are responsible for the}} upward transport, due to the intense updrafts in cumulus clouds. In the case where pollutants are aloft, cloud-free regions are responsible for the <b>downward</b> <b>transport,</b> but the <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> mainly occurs in thin regions around cloud edges. This is consistent with previous aircraft measurements of downdrafts around cumulus clouds and indicates that the <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> is also cloud-induced.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{importance}} of individual transport processes for the winter polar <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the thermosphere to the mesosphere. The <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> of NOx produced by energetic particle precipitation induces chemical alterations in the middle atmosphere and influences ozone chemistry. However, it remains unclear how much each transport process contributes to the <b>downward</b> <b>transport.</b> We use simulations of the atmospheric general circulation and chemistry model HAMMONIA (Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere) for the extended winter 2008 / 2009 with a passive tracer. The model enables us to separate the contributions of advection, eddy and molecular diffusion on the total transport by switching off processes. The results show that molecular diffusion and resolved vertical mixing due to advection effectively transport NOx to the mesosphere. While the impact of molecular diffusion on the transport rapidly decreases below 0. 001 hPa, the impact of advection increases. Around the central date of the sudden stratospheric warming in January 2009, advection is strongly enhanced in the thermosphere and mesosphere and the <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> through the mesopause region is almost entirely driven by advection. Eddy diffusion has limited impact on the transport in the upper mesosphere and negligible impact on the transport in the thermosphere. If eddy diffusion is enhanced as suggested by observations, it can potentially have a larger impact on transport through the mesopause than was previously assumed...|$|E

It was found that both O 3 and CO peaked in spring while the minima of O 3 and CO occurred in summer and winter, respectively. A normalized indicator (marked as " Y ") {{on the basis of}} the monthly normalized O 3, CO and water vapor, is proposed to evaluate the occurrence of O 3 <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> from the upper, O 3 -rich atmosphere. This composite indicator has the advantage of being less influenced by the seasonal or occasional variations of individual factors. It is shown that the most frequent and effective transport occurred in winter (accounting for 39 % of the cases on the basis of a threshold of the Y value larger than 4) and they can make a significant contribution to surface O 3 at Xianggelila.

We investigate direct and indirect nitric oxide (NO) response to the electron precipitation.

This corresponds to electrons depositing their energy at atmospheric altitudes 60 – 120 km. Based on the electron energy deposition, taking into account loss due to photolysis, the accumulated NO number density is estimated. When compared to NO measured at these altitudes by the Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment instrument on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite, the NO direct effect was detected down to 55 km.

40|$|Quantifying crustal {{deformation}} {{is important}} for evaluating mass balance, material transfer, and the interplay between tectonism and magmatism in continental arcs. We present a dataset of > 650 finite strain analyses compiled from published works and our own studies with associated structural, geochronologic, and geobarometric information in central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, to quantify the arc crust deformation. Our results show that Mesozoic tectonism results in 65 % arc-perpendicular bulk crust shortening under {{a more or less}} plane strain condition. Mesozoic arc magmatism replaced ∼ 80 % of this actively deforming arc crust with plutons requiring significantly greater crustal thickening. We suggest that by ∼ 85 Ma, the arc crust thickness was ∼ 80 km with a 30 -km-thick arc root, resulting in a ∼ 5 km elevation. Most tectonic shortening and magma emplacement must be accommodated by downward displacements of crustal materials into growing crustal roots at the estimated downward transfer rate of 2 – 13 km/Myr. The downward transfer of crustal materials must occur in active magma channels, or in “escape channels” in between solidified plutons that decrease in size with time and depth resulting in an increase in the intensity of constrictional strain with depth. We argue that both tectonism and magmatism control the thickness of the crust and surface elevation with slight modification by surface erosion. The <b>downward</b> <b>transported</b> crustal materials initially fertilize the MASH zone thus enhancing to the generation of additional magmas.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{produced}} by energetic particle precipitation (EPP) in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) region, and during the polar winter, NO can descend to stratospheric altitudes where it destroys ozone. In this paper, we study the general scenario, {{as opposed to a}} case study, of NO production in the thermosphere due to energetic particles in the auroral region. We first investigate the relationship between NO production and two geomagnetic indices. The analysis indicates that the auroral electrojet index is a more suitable proxy for EPP-produced NO than the typically used midlatitude Ap index. In order to study the production and <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> of NO from the lower thermosphere to the mesosphere, we perform superposed epoch analyses on NO observations made by the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment instrument on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite.

The effect is observed down to an altitude range of about 50  km to 65  km, depending on the hemisphere and the occurrence of stratospheric warmings.

Long-lasting ionization enhancements (days) are typically produced by solar proton events or by the descent of thermospheric NOX during periods of sustained <b>downward</b> vertical <b>transport</b> associated with a strong underlying polar vortex. Using a new application of ground-based low-frequency radio wave remote sensing, we study the mesospheric ionization conditions during the Northern Hemisphere winters spanning 2003 - 2004, 2004 - 2005, and 2005 - 2006. The winter 2003 - 2004 subionospheric radio wave propagation data from a transmitter in Iceland shows signatures of the descent of NOX through 80 km altitude starting on 13 January 2004, during the occurrence of a strong polar vortex, indicating a thermospheric source for the NOX. Similar analysis of radio wave propagation data in the Northern Hemisphere winter of 2004 - 2005 does not show a NOX descent event passing through the mesosphere, {{due to a lack}} of <b>downward</b> vertical <b>transport</b> as a result of a weak underlying polar vortex, despite the occurrence of significant solar proton ionization during January 2005.

We model the signature of the descent of NOX seen in the radio wave propagation data using the Sodankyla Ion Chemistry model, confirming that the levels of NOX in the mesosphere are similar to 100 times the usual background levels. The combination of strong NOX sources in the thermosphere and also a strong polar vortex is required for NOX to descend into the stratosphere with significant concentration levels...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurements from Whitehorse upper-air {{and nearby}} mountaintop {{stations}} were analyzed {{with a focus}} on wind energy development in the region. Fifty years of measurements indicate the region has become warmer and windier. Measurements at the upper-air station have shown increases of 2. 7 ˚C for surface temperature and 1 m s- 1 for mid-valley winds over the past 50 years (1956 – 2005). The winters have warmed more dramatically than the summers. Winter temperature inversions have become shallower, and a mid-valley winter jet has become a predominant feature. Wind data for 2001 – 05 indicate that a minimum annual mean wind speed of 6 m s- 1 begins at about 150 m above the Whitehorse valley floor, or 850 m above sea level. At this elevation and higher, wind speeds reach a maximum in December and a minimum in July. The predominant wind direction above the mountaintops was from the southwest, while stations within the Whitehorse Valley recorded winds from the south-southeast. Stations that were more exposed to the southwest reported more predominant winds from this direction. An analysis of the relationship between geostrophic and valley winds concluded that, relative to winds aloft, valley winds were as strong in parallel valleys as they were in perpendicular valleys. The pressure gradients associated with the winds aloft were the dominant forcing mechanism for winds in a perpendicular valley. Geostrophic winds that were parallel to the valley forced the valley winds along the same direction through a <b>downward</b> momentum <b>transport.</b> Wintertime inversions suppress the <b>downward</b> momentum <b>transport,</b> but pressure-driven winds are only indirectly modulated by stratification (because of turbulent friction, which is likely to be suppressed by stable stratification) and so are less sensitive to that factor.

Passive tracers initialised at pre-storm times indicate the <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> of air from the stratosphere to the upper troposphere as well as upward transport from the boundary layer into the cloud anvils and overshooting tops. For example, a passive ozone tracer (i. e. a tracer not undergoing chemical processing) shows an enhancement in the upper troposphere of up to about 30 ppbv locally in the cloud, while the in situ measurements show an increase of 50 ppbv. However, the passive carbon monoxide tracer exhibits an increase, while the observations show a decrease of about 10 ppbv, indicative of an erroneous model representation of the transport processes in the tropical tropopause layer. Furthermore, it could point to insufficient entrainment and detrainment in the model. The simulation shows a general moistening of air in the lower stratosphere, but it also exhibits local dehydration features.

The latter finding contradicts the accepted view of a uniformly descending dry environment.

When Ri is finite, the optimal phase difference across the troposphere for maximum surface velocity intensifications is found to be slightly greater than Pi. As Ri increases, the optimal phase difference decreases with Ri and approaches the limiting value Pi. This implies that waves approximately reverse phase between the surface and the tropopause for maximum wave intensifications in most physically realistic atmospheric situations.

40|$|Energetic {{particles}} enter Earth’s {{atmosphere at}} the poles. The charged particles are either from solar or magnetospheric origin and alter {{the chemistry of}} {{the middle and upper}} atmosphere. Most importantly, they enhance the production of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrogen oxides (HOx) in the winter mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Both components are powerful ozone destroyers. The impact of HOx on ozone is limited to the mesosphere, because HOx has a short chemical lifetime (up to hours). In contrast, NOx can persist up to several months in the winter polar middle atmosphere and can be transported downward to the stratosphere. Models covering the middle and upper atmosphere underestimate this <b>downward</b> <b>transport.</b> This may lead to an underestimation of potential climate effects from energetic particle precipitation. This thesis investigates the polar winter transport from the lower thermosphere to the stratosphere. Several observational studies confirmed the <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> (e. g., Randall et al. 2009; Semeniuk et al. 2005). However, it remains unclear which processes cause the transport from the lower thermosphere to the mesosphere. This thesis quantifies, for the first time, the contribution of advection, eddy diffusion and molecular diffusion for the transport through the mesopause. Advection and molecular diffusion dominate the transport through the mesopause. Eddy diffusion has a negligible impact on the transport. However, if eddy diffusion is enhanced as suggested by observations, it can significantly contribute to the transport. This leaves advection being responsible for the underestimation of the <b>downward</b> <b>transport.</b> Gravity waves are the key driver for the advective downwelling in the polar winter mesosphere. This thesis shows that weakening gravity waves enhances the mesospheric transport bringing it close to satellite observations. The altitude of the mesospheric momentum deposition is identified to be key for the polar downwelling. In addition to the analysis of the winter polar <b>downward</b> <b>transport,</b> climate effects of energetic particles are studied. Energetic particle precipitation reduces significantly ozone in the mesosphere and stratosphere. An ozone loss potentially influences the atmospheric temperature and the strength of the polar vortex. It has been shown that large variations in the polar vortex strength can propagate from the stratosphere down to the surface and force the surface temperature (Baldwin and Dunkerton 2001). This thesis presents the climate impact of a mesospheric and of a stratospheric ozone loss. No statistically significant changes in atmospheric winds are found neither for a mesospheric ozone loss nor for a stratospheric ozone loss. Hence, the influence of energetic particles is too weak to force significantly changes in the surface temperature. In summary, this thesis advances the understanding of energetic particle precipitation. Processes relevant for the winter polar <b>downward</b> <b>transport</b> from the lower thermosphere to the stratosphere are identified. Two novel findings are the importance of advection in the thermosphere and the impact of weaker gravity waves on the dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere.

While the layers have nearly constant salinity, potential temperature, and potential density, each property decreases very slightly downward through the layer so that it appears that salinity, heat, and density are being put into the top of each layer and then convectively mixing downward through the layer. Such observations are consistent with salt finger processes that transport salinity, heat and density downward through the halocline-thermocline. Using repeat occupations of stations across the southern western Mediterranean Sea in 2006, 2008, and 2010, we have calculated <b>downward</b> salt <b>transport,</b> FS,of 5. 35 × 10 ? 8 psums? 1, and <b>downward</b> heat <b>transport,</b> FT,of 12. 4 × 10 ? 8 ? Cms? 1. After multiplying these fluxes by haline contraction (?) and thermal expansion (?) coefficients respectively, the buoyancy flux ratio, ?FT/?FS, is found to be 0. 74 and there is a downward density flux of 1. 0 × 10 ? 10 Wkg? 1. The halocline-thermocline in this region between 600 and 1, 400 dbar has a background vertical salinity gradient of 0. 95 × 10 ? 4 m? 1 and a vertical temperature gradient of 4. 1 × 10 ? 4 ?Cm? 1 so the background density ratio is R?=(? d? /dz) /(? dS/dz) is 1. 28. Dividing the downward fluxes by the background vertical gradients yields vertical diffusivities kS= 5. 6 × 10 ? 4 m 2 s? 1 and kT= 3. 0 × 10 ? 4 m 2 s? 1. These downward fluxes of salt and heat are compared with estimates based on salt finger experiments and theory and with the long-term increases in salinity and temperature in the deep western Mediterranean Sea over the past 40 years...|$|R
40|$|An optimum leaf {{shape and}} vein pattern is {{necessary}} for vascular plant success. The isolation of leaf morphological mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana {{has been used for}} leaf development studies. Auxin is a signal molecular that regulates plant development and growth processes. I have analyzed four mutations in detail, and I suggest that they all have defects in auxin regulated plant development processes. Mutant 115 - 11 - 21 - 4 is an allele of FKD 1 with frequent distal free-ending veins. Mutant 31 - 83 - 4 - 3 likely has increased auxin flux through secondary veins and increased <b>downward</b> auxin <b>transport</b> through the shoot, possibly due to increased PIN 1 expression and/or altered PIN 1 localization. Mutant 32 - 2 - 4 likely has increased auxin activity at marginal auxin convergence points resulting in the formation of increased leaf serrations. Mutant 33 - 7 - 5 (4) may have a global reduction in auxin biosynthesis or response, thus the whole plant is weak and pale, with slower shoot and root growth rate and gravitropic response...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{behind the}} collapse of turbulence in the evening as a precursor to {{the onset of the}} very stable boundary layer is investigated. To this end a cooled, pressure-driven flow is investigated by means of a local similarity model. Simulations reveal a temporary collapse of turbulence whenever the surface heat extraction, expressed in its nondimensional form h/L, exceeds a critical value. As any temporary reduction of turbulent friction is followed by flow acceleration, the long-term state is unconditionally turbulent. In contrast, the temporary cessation of turbulence, which may actually last for several hours in the nocturnal boundary layer, can be understood {{from the fact that the}} time scale for boundary layer diffusion is much smaller than the time scale for flow acceleration. This limits the available momentum that can be used for <b>downward</b> heat <b>transport.</b> In case the surface heat extraction exceeds the so-called maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF), the near-surface inversion rapidly increases. Finally, turbulent activity is largely suppressed by the intense density stratification that supports the emergence of a different, calmer boundary layer regime.
