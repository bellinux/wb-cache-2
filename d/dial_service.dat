25|$|Automatic exchanges, or <b>dial</b> <b>service,</b> {{came into}} {{existence}} in the early 20th century. Their purpose was to {{eliminate the need for}} human switchboard operators who completed the connections required for a telephone call. Automation replaced human operators with electromechanical systems and telephones were equipped with a dial by which a caller transmitted the destination telephone number to the automatic switching system.|$|E
25|$|The Bell System <b>dial</b> <b>service</b> {{implemented}} a feature called automatic number identification (ANI) which facilitated services like automated billing, toll-free 800-numbers, and 9-1-1 service. In manual service, the operator knows where a call is originating {{by the light}} on the switchboard jack field. Before ANI, long distance calls were placed into an operator queue and the operator asked the calling party's number and recorded it on a paper toll ticket.|$|E
25|$|Los Gatos {{is served}} by three central offices. Historically, these were called the Six Office, the Four Office, and the Mountain Office. The first two of these designations come from the {{historic}} exchange names when the town converted from manual to <b>dial</b> <b>service.</b> Phone numbers in these two offices were ELgato-6 and ELgato-4 numbers, respectively (dialed as ELx-xxxx.) As the area migrated to seven-digit numbers, these changed to 356- and 354-numbers. In their earlier life, all numbers for the segment of town served by each office had the respective prefix or office code related to that office.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the late}} 1980s {{and the arrival}} of {{cellular}} and PCS mobile phone service, GTE offered Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) on VHF (152MHz) and UHF (454MHz) frequencies in Los Gatos. The service included full-duplex <b>dial</b> <b>service.</b> There were tight restrictions on call lengths because {{there were only a few}} channels available. In the late 1970s, daytime calls longer than three minutes were billed at over $1 per minute to discourage the long-winded. The VHF equipment was located near the Santa Clara Valley Water District's Rinconada Water Treatment Plant on More Avenue at NAD27 coordinates [...] The IMTS system included General Electric mobile radio voting equipment. (Voting is a form of diversity combining used in mobile radio systems on land.) One receiver for at least one of the voted IMTS channels was located in a pole mount-cabinet on a utility pole along Montevina Road off California State Route 17. These IMTS systems were dismantled after cellular systems became available to subscribers in the Bay Area.|$|E

50|$|For direct inward <b>dialing</b> <b>service,</b> the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with <b>Dialed</b> Number Identification <b>Service</b> (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring {{only a limited number of}} physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.|$|R
