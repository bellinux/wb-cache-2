25|$|Dancers {{organize}} {{themselves into}} rank and file. The front rank comprises the most proficient dancers, the best {{being in the}} center. Each rank back from the one in front contains dancer who are less proficient. All the dancers face forward. This allows dancers to learn {{from those in the}} rows ahead. The back rank is often populated with beginners <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> the moves, while the front rows are well-coordinated.|$|E
25|$|In competition, divers {{must submit}} their lists beforehand, and once past a {{deadline}} (usually when {{the event is}} announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).|$|E

25|$|While {{borrowing}} from Expressionist ideology {{and other products}} of modern German literature, Aderca adopted and promoted styles associated with the other new trends of Western Europe. A modernist colleague, the literary critic Perpessicius, noted that Aderca was one of Romania's writers most inspired by psychoanalysis, {{at a time when}} Romanians were <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> about its existence. Crohmălniceanu also drew attention to Aderca's adoption of internal monologues. Aderca's unconventional style, like those of Ion Călugăru, Ion Vinea or Maniu, was associated by some with the trademark style of Urmuz, a maverick figure of the 1920s Romanian avant-garde scene. This suggestion was criticized by Perpessicius, who concluded that Urmuz was virtually unknown to the world by the time Aderca began writing his prose.|$|E
25|$|The {{clothing}} industry in New York City was staffed by many immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Historian Witold Kula {{found that many}} Jewish immigrants, and to a much lesser extent, Italians, were identified upon their arrival to the United States as having work background as tailors {{even if they did}} not. Kula identified several letters written by Jewish immigrants back to their families in Poland indicating that they were <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> the trade, when in fact, they had papers stating that it was their native profession. The new immigrants generally did not speak English nor did the immigration agents speak any Polish, Yiddish, or Italian. Kula suggests that the Immigration agents were influenced by the demands of the workforce and essentially staffed the industries based on their expectations of each ethnic group. By 1912, the needle trades were the largest employer of Polish Jews in the United States, and 85% of the needle trade employees were Eastern European Jews.|$|E
500|$|Ellen Page as Ariadne, a {{graduate}} student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a [...] "perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years". Page said her character acts as a proxy to the audience, as [...] "she's <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience in learning about dream sharing". Evan Rachel Wood was Christopher Nolan's first choice to play Ariadne, but she turned it down. Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role, Nolan considered casting Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Jessy Schram, and Carey Mulligan.|$|E

500|$|The cinematographer for Loves of a Blonde was Miroslav Ondříček, like Forman a {{graduate}} of the national Czech film school. [...] Ondříček and Forman had met at Czechoslovakia's Barrandov Studios in the early 1960s when Ondříček was <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> to shoot feature films and Forman was struggling to create his own early projects. Ondříček was in full accord with Forman's reliance on non-professional actors, adopting a cinéma-vérité style compatible with orthodox socialist realism. Ondříček was schooled in documentary filmmaking and, as a result, he insisted on performing all photographic tasks, like focus, lighting and composing, personally. while refusing access to the set by all film editors, saying: [...] "The editor can only edit what I am filming. He can't use a master shot if he doesn't have it. He can't make a close-up if he doesn't have it. This is our [...] job." [...] Critics have often admired Ondříček's success in sustaining low-contrast lighting throughout the film, rendering [...] "a sweetly mysterious softness, as if a principle of compassion existed in the world alongside its cruelty".|$|E
500|$|Ariel has {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the character, writing that [...] "Ariel is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny". James Bernardelli of Reelviews wrote that Ariel {{can be viewed as}} a template for future Disney heroes and heroines. He also praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance for the character. In an article for Empire, Levi Buchanan stated that Ariel is [...] "powerful and self-reliant". Janet Maslin of The New York Times complimented Ariel, stating that [...] "teenagers will appreciate the story's rebellious heroine" [...] and went on to praise Ariel's wit. Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend wrote favorably about Ariel although he believed that the character was eroticized, stating, [...] "The scene where Ursula rips out her throat and gives her extremely naked parts below the waist is almost titillating, though I'm sure to little kids it seems entirely innocent". Similarly, reviewer John Puccio said that [...] "Ariel is perhaps the sexiest-looking animated character the Disney artists have ever drawn". In his review of Ariel's Beginning, James Plath of DVD Town wrote, [...] "For little girls, Ariel is one of the most beloved of Disney princesses, and she holds a warm place in the hearts of parents as well". Rory Aronsky of Film Threat praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance in Ariel's Beginning, writing that [...] "Benson adds more to the appeal of Ariel for older fans, and younger girls <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> about her, as well as generations not born yet who will undoubtedly become attached to her, ensuring the continued existence of the franchise".|$|E
500|$|Charlotte's {{discovery}} of a polar bear with a Dharma Initiative collar caused fan speculation about her connection with the island. Mader herself was unaware of Charlotte's backstory beyond the flashback in [...] "Confirmed Dead"she noted [...] "I feel like I'm almost in the same seat as the audience, like 'What {{the hell is going}} on?' and 'What the hell is going to happen next?', it's really exciting actually". She found it freeing to not know her character's history, and felt it made her give a natural performance. Mader felt Charlotte's relationship with Faraday allowed her character to develop and show a softer, more human side, and thought their relationship resonated with the audience as she and Jeremy Davies had good chemistry. Eight episodes of season four were written before production stopped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Once the strike was resolved, a further six episodes were written, two less than originally planned for the season, and as a result Charlotte's role continued into season five. She enjoyed speaking Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and wished the full scene had been aired. Mader was excited when she discovered that Charlotte grew up on the island, and hoped to have scenes with Nestor Carbonell who plays Richard Alpert, as his character also has a history on the island. However when negotiating contracts in June 2008 she found out that her character would die during season five; Mader summed up Charlotte's season five arc as her demise. Charlotte's death scene was written by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and was amongst their favourite scenes they wrote during season five. Horowitz loved the emotion in the scene due to the audience only <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> Charlotte's backstory, and Kitsis thought Mader's performance [...] "elevate the words to a whole other level". Mader called it [...] "the best thing [...] ha ever done in [...] entire career" [...] and enjoyed playing a significant role within the episode.|$|E

[...] Flourishes are usually omitted with those <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> to dance, as they may obscure the standard movement.

[...] He calls this kind of imitative learning [...] "cultural learning because the child is not <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> about things from other persons, she is also learning things through them— in the sense that she must know something of the adult's perspective on a situation to learn the active use of this same intentional act." [...] He concludes that the key feature of cultural learning is that it occurs only when an individual [...] "understands others as intentional agents, like the self, who have a perspective on the world that can be followed into, directed and shared." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enormous thrones and stelae {{attest to}} the might and splendor of [...] "Miraflores" [...] Kaminaljuyu. Stela 10, a {{fragment}} of a gigantic throne, is carved with a decapitation narrative scene showing a ruler masked and attired to impersonate an underworld jaguar deity wielding a flint axe over what likely was a kneeling captive; {{the head of a}} euhemerized jaguar deity floats {{to the right of the}} ruler/protagonist, invoked by the burning of blood in a sacrificial plate. The similarly gigantic Monument 65 is carved, on the front, with three seated, throned rulers, each one framed by two bound, kneeling, nude captives, each ruler and his paired victims vertically positioned within a lower, a central, and an upper register. Almost annually, fragments of once very large sculptural monuments are found in Guatemala City often during unregulated municipal demolition and construction. Many monuments were carved with Preclassic hieroglyphic texts (Kaplan 2011), underscoring the fact that, as Coe observes, [...] "the elite of [...] were fully literate at a time when other Maya were perhaps <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> that writing existed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "black flight" [...] {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} African-American parents in some cities moving their children from public schools to charter schools or suburban schools featuring open enrollment. This {{has taken place in}} a variety of places, including the Twin Cities and the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Other issues in the city proper of Dallas include an increase in immigration of Latinos. In the 1980s and 1990s, the school district had a majority of black students. Today it has a preponderance of Latino students, in a kind of ethnic succession that reflects residential changes in the city. Latinos constitute 68 percent of students, while blacks are 26 percent, and whites are 5 percent. In addition, 87 percent of the Latino students qualify as [...] "economically disadvantaged," [...] and many are <b>just</b> <b>learning</b> English. Middle-class blacks are moving to suburbs in a repetition of earlier migration of middle-class whites. The issues of schools and residential patterns are strongly related to economic class, as well as parents' preferring that their children go to schools with native speakers of English.|$|E
