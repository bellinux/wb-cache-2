5|$|The two seaports, {{which had}} been rivals {{for most of the}} 20th century but lost ground to nearby ports in British Columbia, {{proposed}} a merger of marine cargo operations in 2014.

5|$|Miskovsky {{left the}} CIA in 1964, {{and worked for}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Commission</b> and the Treasury Department for four years. In 1967, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead an investigation concerning the 1967 Detroit riot for the Kerner Commission. During the investigation, Miskovsky interviewed civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Miskovsky's report concluded that the United States was transitioning into two separate societies, one black and the other white, and that the societies were inherently unequal. In 1968, Miskovsky was appointed the director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization which gave legal aid to those whose civil liberties were violated. From 1977 to 1981, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, Miskovsky served as {{general counsel for the}} Federal Home Loan Bank Board.|$|E

President Gerald Ford later appointed Casey {{to direct}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Commission,</b> and Paul won an April 1976 special election to the vacant office after a runoff. Paul lost the next regular election to Democrat Robert Gammage by fewer than 300votes (0.2%), but defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch, and was reelected in 1980 and 1982. Gammage underestimated Paul's popularity among local mothers: [...] "I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, {{and the other one}} was his partner." ...|$|E

The FMC approved the planned alliance on July 23, 2015. On August 4, 2015, at the Federal Way city hall, the two port commissions unanimously approved a formal agreement creating The Northwest Seaport Alliance.

The <b>Federal</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Commission</b> has recognized the trend in increasing vessels size and U.S. ports have begun preparation {{in anticipation of the}} increased arrival of larger vessels. Major ports in the United States have begun dredging for 50ft berth/channel depths and heightening their crane fleets in order to accommodate the arrival of larger vessels ...|$|E
2500|$|Barr {{supported}} the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would amend laws that govern the activities of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation, and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Commission</b> (FMC). Barr testified in favor of the bill because it would [...] "remove the requirement that Valley View Ferry captains be licensed through the Coast Guard, and instead allow the state to implement its own licensing requirement." [...] At present, the local ferry has had to cut back on hours because the ferry has been unable to find a new captain for ferry due to the stringent Coast Guard requirements to get a merchant mariner license, {{despite the fact that the}} ferry only travels 500 feet on steel cables, without any steering capabilities. If the bill were to pass, the state government would be able to lower the licensing requirement for such a small ferry with only limited capabilities.|$|E

"Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, the United States <b>Maritime</b> <b>Commission</b> was {{established}} {{as an independent}} agency to direct and control all phases of overseas shipping and shipbuilding.

Thus WSA became the Governments ship operating agency and the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Commission</b> its shipbuilding agency." ...|$|R
