500|$|Madonna's further {{inspiration}} for the track came from the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. She introduced liturgical words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning. With superficial pop lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface, the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners. Leonard {{explained that he was}} not comfortable with the lyrics and the sexual innuendos present in it. He gave the example of the first verse for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] which goes [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer, I'm <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> I wanna take you there." [...] Leonard understood that the dual meaning referred to someone performing fellatio. Being aghast he requested that Madonna change the line, but she was adamant about keeping it.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony herself said, [...] "Work {{and worship}} are one with me. I {{can not imagine}} a God of the {{universe}} made happy by my getting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> and calling him 'great.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I got <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> and I did say 'thank you' to God. And {{right then}} and there joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be 'born again,' and the Bible which had been so dry to me before, became everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Them's {{your ideas}} about warming, are they, my dear?" [...] said the elderly gentleman. [...] "Do {{you come and}} sit <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> here {{for a few minutes}} or so, and that'd warm me better than all the 'tay' in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish Romer were here. I'd let him {{shoot at}} that bear," [...] I replied. Then I got <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> and aiming {{as closely as}} {{possible}} I fired. The report rang out in the stillness, making hollow echoes. We heard the bullet pat somewhere. So did the bear hear it. Curiously he looked around, as if something had struck near him. But scared he certainly was not. Then I shot four times in quick succession.|$|R
60|$|She {{stretched}} out her hand, and I went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> {{and put it}} to my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with both her hands on her crutch stick, standing {{in the midst of the}} dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, Ayọ {{started a}} concert tour through Germany and the United States. On her American tour she {{performed}} with Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds. On 10 January 2008 she appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and on 26 January 2008 The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, performing her song <b>Down</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Knees.</b> In June 2008 the singer started her second tour through the United States and Canada.|$|E

60|$|I entered, and {{crossing}} to his side, I went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> beside him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use talking o' that," [...] said poor Mrs. Tulliver, almost peevishly. [...] "If I {{was to go}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bare <b>knees</b> <b>on</b> {{the gravel}} to Tulliver, he'd never humble himself." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I got <b>down,</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{hands and}} <b>knees</b> {{and went on}} another {{exploring}} expedition.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{was running}} {{along by the}} side of the cliff, when my foot slipped. I came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> and hurt myself frightfully; I was in such pain that I could not stop myself from rolling over. I tried to swim, which, of course, would have been nothing for me, but I think <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> is smashed, and it hurt me so frightfully that I screamed out with pain, and had to give up. I could not have held on much longer, and should {{certainly}} have been drowned had you not seen me. I was never so pleased as when I heard your voice above.” ...|$|R
60|$|I confess at this I was so {{overcome}} that I fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> before the dear, good man, and sobbed on his own.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{give me a}} chance--you! Perhaps I'd {{better get}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> now! But in case I don't--just for argument's sake--what's going to happen, pray?" ...|$|E
60|$|Taking {{this as an}} intimation to {{obey the}} old man's commands, I went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> and touched my lips to the hand he extended.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you {{are under}} my hoof, for all that," [...] said he, turning upon her, with a savage grin; [...] "that's one comfort. So, sit <b>down</b> here <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>my</b> dear, and hear to reason," [...] said he, laying hold on her wrist.|$|R
6000|$|My letters! {{all dead}} paper, mute and white!

6000|$|... "There, there!" [...] he said, as if {{she were}} a child. [...] "Cuddle <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> Be brave. You'll get warmer soon as we turn south." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{were to go}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> to you, {{would you}} forgive me?" [...] said Mary, with a slight smile, but still {{speaking}} with that unaccustomed meekness.|$|E
6000|$|... "What! go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> {{here before}} all them Arabs? If I did, they'd not only laugh at me, but they'd soon rouse {{me up with}} their spears." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{horror and}} loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle, both confounded my senses, {{and made me}} {{discharge}} from my stomach in an excessive manner. I then returned towards my habitation; and, in my way thither, shedding floods of tears, and falling <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bended <b>knees,</b> gave God thanks for making my nature contrary to these wretches, and delivering me so long out of their hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what if I {{had brought}} him where I have brought you, and shown him what I have shown you, and, instead of {{standing}} as stiff as any Spaniard, as you do, he had thrown himself on his knees by that bedside, and wept and prayed, sir, till he opened my hard heart {{for the first and}} last time, and I fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sinful <b>knees</b> and wept and prayed by him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Schwantz:"At Jerez {{there was}} four laps {{to go and}} I was almost six seconds in front of Eddie. I had watched the race the {{previous}} year after the bike broke and I remembered watching him haul in Rainey and keep Rainey from winning his first Grand Prix. I was thinking to myself, come on you've just got to keep above those five seconds. Get it down to less than five laps with more than five seconds and there's no way he can catch you.' [...] ""I had got there and done that. I went over the line and {{around the back of}} the big Kodak box that is a scoreboard with all the times on it. As I went past the back it changed to show four laps to go and more than five seconds, I thought, 'yeah I've got it,' and immediately fell off. It was just a loss of concentration, I thought I had it in the bag. I went into the corner, didn't have it <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> where I needed to be. The front end pushed and before I could even think, 'Oh shit', I was sitting on the haybales." ...|$|R
6000|$|She said, 'I {{went to my}} room, trembling. I fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> {{and prayed}} to my heavenly Father to have mercy on them. I thought, [...] "What shall I do?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't {{you speak}} to me! Won't you answer me? See here! I'd get <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> to you if it would do you any good. Where will you talk with me?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was sundown. Chaka {{was sitting}} in the little {{courtyard}} in front of his hut. I went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> before him and gave the royal salute, Bayete, and so I stayed.|$|E
60|$|I went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{hands and}} <b>knees</b> {{to look for}} him, for I felt very curious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused.

5000|$|Initially, they brewed beer {{once per}} week. Working 12-hour shifts, Hickling {{said that his}} new career was [...] "a real contrast.

[...] However, the business grew quickly, with demand outstripping the supply capabilities.|$|R
6000|$|I went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{hands and}} <b>knees,</b> and {{threaded}} <b>my</b> {{way through the}} long grasses and matted boughs as noiselessly as I could. The two old hands watched me. When I emerged several yards off, much to their surprise, Colebrook turned to Doolittle. [...] "Might answer," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Major says, 'Choose your own men.' Anyhow, if they catch him, nobody's fault but his. Wants to go. Will do it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was useless}} {{for me to}} argue against his purpose, {{whatever}} that might be, for the fellow was determined, and even though I had gone <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> to him {{he would have done}} that which he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honourable!" [...] {{said the}} widow with bitter scorn. [...] "Oh, brother, {{what is this}} you call honour? If my boy has been guilty, he must marry her. I would go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> and pray him to do so." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides, {{what had}} I done {{to call for}} an apology? I had {{certainly}} treated him no worse than he deserved. He was a spoilt boy and a bully, and I would die rather than go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> to him.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Keep {{an eye on}} Clausel!’ I {{whispered to}} Laclas; and with that, got <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> elbows and <b>knees</b> took the rope in both hands, and worked myself, feet foremost, through the tunnel. When the earth failed under my feet, I thought my heart would have stopped; and a moment after I was demeaning myself in mid-air like a drunken jumping-jack. I have never been a model of piety, but at this {{juncture}} prayers and a cold sweat burst from me simultaneously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was but a}} worldly vanity,' quoth the Mayor; 'for, {{with all}} deference, Sir Gervas Jerome, a man's own hair {{arranged}} with some taste, and with perhaps a sprinkling of powder, is to my mind the fittest ornament to his head. It is the contents and not the case which availeth. Having donned this frippery, good Master Foster and I hired a calash {{and drove to the}} Palace. We were deep in grave and, I trust, profitable converse speeding through the endless streets, when of a sudden I felt a sharp tug at my head, and <b>my</b> hat fluttered <b>down</b> <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> I raised <b>my</b> hands, and lo! they came upon my bare pate. The wig had vanished. We were rolling down Fleet Street at the moment, {{and there was no one}} in the calash save neighbour Foster, who sat as astounded as I. We looked high and low, on the seats and beneath them, but not a sign of the periwig was there. It was gone utterly and without a trace.' ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{one point}} I {{reached down to}} touch La Peregrina and it wasn't there! I glanced over at Richard and thank God he wasn't looking at me, and I {{went into the bedroom}} and threw myself on the bed, buried my head into the pillow and screamed. Very slowly and very carefully, I retraced all my steps in the bedroom. I took my {{slippers}} off, took my socks off, and got <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands and <b>knees,</b> looking everywhere for the pearl. Nothing. I thought, [...] "It's got to be in the living room in front of Richard. What am I going to do. He'll kill me! Because he loved the piece.|$|R
