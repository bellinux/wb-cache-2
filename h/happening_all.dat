5|$|The {{personal}} experiences of many Londoners during the fire are glimpsed in letters and memoirs. The two best-known diarists of the Restoration are Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) and John Evelyn (1620–1706), and both recorded {{the events and}} their own reactions day by day, and made great efforts to keep themselves informed of what was <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> over the City and beyond. For example, they both travelled out to the Moorfields park area north of the City on the Wednesday—the fourth day—to view the mighty encampment of distressed refugees there, which shocked them. Their diaries {{are the most important}} sources for all modern retellings of the disaster. Books on the fire by Tinniswood (2003) and Hanson (2001) also rely on the brief memoirs of William Taswell (1651–82), who was a fourteen year-old schoolboy at Westminster School in 1666.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} all 19th century towns Liverpool was unsanitary. In 1832 {{there had been}} a cholera epidemic. As panic and fear of this new and {{misunderstood}} disease spread, eight major riots had broken out on the streets along with several smaller uprisings. In 1849 a second epidemic occurred. When Caine was thirteen the third outbreak of cholera occurred in July 1866. Memories of that time were to stay with him, the deaths, the large volume of funerals and prayer meetings in open spaces that were <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> around him.|$|E

[...] Ward had strong socialist sympathies and was a supporter of organized labor; the Boy expresses this union solidarity by abandoning the only job he could find rather than work as a strikebreaker.|$|E

[...] Galleries exhibiting his work have included Art in General, in New York City, Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Charlottetown, and Toronto galleries Zsa Zsa, Mercer Union, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Paul Petro Contemporary Art, and the Art Gallery of York University.

She said, [...] "I wanted something crazy that no one else has done and like really random because this song is kinda random." [...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out and I have no idea where these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random.

500|$|The seventh {{series of}} Beyond Our Ken {{finished}} in February 1964, {{with an average}} audience of ten million listeners per programme. In September that year Horne returned from holiday and was scheduled to appear {{in a number of}} programmes; Eric Merriman objected to Horne's activities, saying that Horne had been made into a star by the writer, and that [...] "no other comedy series should be allowed to use him". When the BBC refused to withdraw Horne from the second programme, Down with Women, Merriman resigned from writing Beyond Our Ken and the show came to an end. After some pressure from Horne to keep the remainder of the team together, the BBC commissioned a replacement series, Round the Horne, on similar lines. They turned to one of the original writers of Beyond Our Ken, Barry Took and his new writing partner, Marty Feldman. Horne remained the genial and unflappable focal figure, and the writers invented several new and eccentric characters to revolve round him. They included J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock, the walking slum; the Noël Coward parodies Charles and Fiona; the incompetent villain Dr. Chou En Ginsberg; the folk singer Rambling Syd Rumpo and the [...] "outrageously camp" [...] Julian and Sandy. The resulting programme was described by radio historians Andy Foster and Steve Furst as [...] "one of the seminal comedies {{to come out of the}} BBC", while The Spectator described it as [...] "one of the great radio successes". The first series of Round the Horne, consisting of 16 episodes, ran from March to June 1965. Horne's role was to provide [...] "the perfect foil to the inspired lunacy <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> around him": ...|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{opened to}} mixed reception, the {{consensus}} generally being {{that it was}} a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. Variety called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the [...] "monstrous" [...] house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had [...] "major shortcomings" [...] in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cited The Haunting as [...] "one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced" [...] but surmised that [...] "there is really no point to it". Writing in The Atlantic magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film [...] "moderately elegant and literate and expensive", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being [...] "feeble [...] cowardly-comic". She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, [...] "It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at The Haunting were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{recognition}} of her {{central role in}} organizing and sustaining the strike, Newman was appointed as the first woman general organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). From 1909 to 1913, she organized garment strikes around the country, organizing in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Boston, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. In addition, she stumped for the Socialist Party of America in the freezing, bleak coal-mining camps of southern Illinois and continued to campaign for [...] woman suffrage for the Women’s Trade Union League. Although, waves of successful strikes were <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> around the United States, it was a lonely and frustrating few years for Newman.

For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record {{is one of those}} things where there are a lot of little guitar parts <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> over the place and little textures -- and we want to hear that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto.

2500|$|Neely {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The A.V. Club that a major inspiration behind the premise of the series derives from his lack of college experiences: [...] "I had this very small slice of an understanding of how college life is. To me, it's high school for adults, and I guess I'm depicting it that way. My sister is a professor. ... I'm around professors, but I'm kind of misinformed a bit. My information is broken and that's what makes China wonky and interesting, because it's what's so fucking wrong about college." [...] Similarly, in the series, Neely parodies popular culture elements that he knows only through passing mentions. The season two episode, [...] "The Diamond Castle", parodies the Mad Men episode, [...] "The Other Woman", which Neely stated he had never watched before; he explained that [...] "We do that often where we'll just take my ignorance and run with it." [...] The A.V. Club interview also has Neely describe aspects of the series inspired by his Arkansan upbringing; he admits that he [...] "talk about [...] all the time, it turns out. The final episode of the season is about hog infestation. It's <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> over southern United States, where wild boars are just overpopulating—they tear up the land and land owners and cattle ranchers have to hunt these things and put Kevlar vests on their dogs because they have horns and shit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In their {{aptly named}} book, What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder, and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany, historians Eric Johnson and Karl-Heinz Reuband {{conducted}} an extensive set of interviews (over 3,000 Germans and 500 German Jews) for an unprecedented firsthand look at {{daily life in}} the Third Reich and analyzed it accordingly. They carefully selected interviews out of the samples, which they believed best represented their overall findings. From the Jewish questionnaires, the authors found that German society {{was not nearly as}} rife with anti-Semitism as one might otherwise have believed, but this changed dramatically with Hitler's ascension to power. German Jews claimed that they knew of the Holocaust {{from a wide range of}} sources, which included radio broadcasts from Italy and what they heard from friends or acquaintances, but they did not know these details until 1943. Responses from non-Jewish Germans indicate that [...] "the majority of Germans identified with the Nazi regime." [...] Contrary to many other accounts and/or historical interpretations, which portray rule under the Nazis as terrifying for German citizens, most of the German respondents who participated in the interviews stated that they never really feared arrest from the Gestapo. Concerning the mass murder of the Jews, the survey results were contingent to some degree on geography, but roughly 27–29% of Germans had information about the Holocaust at some point before the war's end, and another 10–13% suspected something terrible was <b>happening</b> <b>all</b> along. Based on this information, Johnson and Reuband surmise that one-in-three Germans either heard or knew that the Holocaust was taking place before the end of the war from sources which included family members, friends, neighbors or professional colleagues. Johnson suggests (in disagreement with his co-author) that it is more likely that about 50% of the German population were aware of the atrocities being committed against the Jewish people and other enemies identified by the Nazi regime.|$|E
