[...] Reeves joked that his playing style was something his friends called [...] "modal chromaticism, which is any note you want {{as long as you}} end on a right note." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} a critical and commercial disappointment, but has since received much stronger modern reviews. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a positive score of 75% {{based on a}} sample of 20 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. Siskel & Ebert were split, Siskel giving the film a [...] "thumbs up" [...] and Ebert giving it a [...] "thumbs down," [...] criticizing Allie Fox for being [...] "boring." [...] However, he did compliment Fords performance. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it [...] "utterly flat." [...] In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote, [...] "Sooner or later a man of invention will pollute paradise, a grand contradiction that gives Mosquito its bite and Ford inspiration for his most complex portrayal to date. As a persona of epic polarities, he animates this muddled, metaphysical journey into the jungle." [...] In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson wrote, [...] "Hes orchestrated The Mosquito Coasts action to match Foxs progressive mental state, from rage to explosion to squalls and finally to hurricane velocity; however, the film leaves us not with an apotheosis, but exhaustion." [...] In his review for The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "The Mosquito Coast {{is a work of}} consummate craftsmanship and its spectacularly acted, down to the smallest roles ... but its field of vision is as narrow and eventually as claustrophobic as Allies." [...] The negative reviews the film received prompted Harrison Ford to defend the film in the media: [...] "there have been mixed reviews and I think the film has been very unfairly treated in some quarters. I have never seen a serious film treated so badly by the critics. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> wrong. I dont mind saying Im here trying to counter those negative reviews ... Im not defensive about the picture, but I want the public to hear another point of view. Critics see a film and then rush to review it. This is the sort of movie that really doesnt sink home for about three days. It is disturbing and makes you think. It stays with you." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parents realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If Im just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say theyre going to be back at midnight and they dont come back, you immediately <b>think</b> <b>theyre</b> dead and you start to worry. If theyd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well <b>I</b> just dont <b>think</b> she would have been the same person again." ...|$|R
