Further to this, we intend to demonstrate that this kind of theatre can be –and in fact <b>it</b> usually <b>is-</b> an instrument for Catholic Counter-Reformation. 3) To carry out a new scientific approach to the le gend of Gregory pope, literary source for this comedy. Although some texts are wel l-known by the critics, there is not a major work in which the whole legend, its origin an d development plays an important role. Most of the research published in the past is focused on the study of one or two of the texts, without considering the entire textual d evelopment of this theme, revealed to be of fundamental transcendence for European literatur e. This new approach to the entire legend constitutes a necessary step to carry out an in-depth study of Lucistela : by our own hypothesis about the textual development and transm ission of this legend, we may be able to postulate which was the nearest source for this comedy. 4) To provide a new literary testimony for this leg end, a link which was missing from the chain until now: the comedy Lucistela, the first dramatic text known to use this legend as its source. 5) To compare this comedy with El marido de su madre, by Matos Fragoso, another comedy based on the same legend, but located around mid XVII Century, for a better knowledge of how the same topic was adapted at the origin and consolidation of the Comedia Nueva, respectively...|$|R

Almost predictably, the dysfunctional group, under Cotton’s guidance, set out to free a large herd of the bison, after they witness their perverted macho camp counselor “Wheaties” shooting the animals in a festive (and deeply disturbing) western lottery, which is given validation as a proper method to thin out the large numbers by eliminating the ‘weak’ or ‘sick’ buffalo. Of course, the buffalo are not the only targets of this destructive urge, as the Bedwetters-similarly-have been have also been “tamed,” “penned” and crushed in spirit. As a result of their parents’ neglect, they have been turned into psychological misfits. Ridiculed and rejected by the other boys in the camp, they are forced to cling even more strongly to their deviant behavior. The boys’ pilgrimage to free the buffalo is also a search for freedom.|$|E

But who will keep eye on employee?, because a human cannot keep track of thousands of employee. Besides this there is a prompt growth of smart phones. So by using smart phone, we are trying to keep track of employee. In this survey paper, we will have overview of ‘The Master Spy’. It is name of android application which is used to monitor the employee by using their android smart phones. It is needed to improve technical growth as well as standard of company or organization. This android application is user friendly. Requirement of this project is only smart phones. Every employee has given unique Id and password. By using ID employee can enter into organization and by using ID and password employee can check his or her profile. We can send memos to employee as well as urgent meeting calls on their ID. List of employee is stored in database. This project helps to improve accuracy in management and also used to save time of human being. By using this system, job performance will be improved as employee knows someone keeps eye on them. Thus we can deploy the project to customer in deadline. We can also meet to customer’s satisfaction. It is not costly as employee just has to install this application in mobile. We can also track the mobile of employee.

In offshore sediments the mean AS 04 :ANH 4 :ACP ratio is- 53 : 4. 6 : 0. 37; in shallow harbor sediment <b>it</b> <b>is-</b> 53 : 19 : 3. 3 and ANI 14 :AZP ratios are half the offshore ratio. These indicated shoreward changes probably rcflcct more rapid deposition, and thus less preferential stripping of P and N from organic material before burial in shallow water harbor sediments, or selective stripping in the heavily bioturbated upper sediment layers offshore, or both. The effects of differential diffusion and adsorption of ammonia and phosphorus are considered. Phosphate concentration maxima in ammonia- and phosphate-rich shallow harbor sediments yield evidence for possible equilibrium with respect to vivianite, Fc 3 (P 04) z* 8 Hz 0, and stru-vitc, MgNI 14 P 04 + 611 z 0.
