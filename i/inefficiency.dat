40|$|Purpose: This paper {{identifies}} cost <b>inefficiencies</b> in construction, thereby {{contributing to}} the current debate about unsatisfactory productivity in the industry. It suggests that {{by focusing on the}} reduction of cost <b>inefficiencies</b> it is possible to increase productivity. Methodological Approach: A comprehensive review of relevant literature. Results: Four key issues leading to cost <b>inefficiencies</b> have been identified: (1) a great deal of non-value adding activities (waste), (2) high degree of uncertainty, (3) lack of standardisation, and (4) resistance to change. The interrelatedness of these issues is discussed and an integrated model is presented for consideration. Contribution: Awareness of how to reduce cost <b>inefficiencies</b> is important in order to improve profit margins in construction. Identifying, discussing, understanding their interrelatedness and addressing these cost <b>inefficiencies</b> are necessary steps towards improvement...|$|R
40|$|U. S. urban {{transit systems}} receive {{operating}} and capital subsidies from various levels of government. Each firm minimizes its cost net of subsidies subject to its production function. The first order conditions from this minimization give a set of equations that are estimated using a stochastic frontier approach. From the results are calculated technical and allocative <b>inefficiencies.</b> The allocative <b>inefficiencies</b> are further decomposed among two sources, subsidies and factors internal to the firm. The analysis reveals large allocative <b>inefficiencies</b> between labor, fuel, and capital. Furthermore, it finds that subsidies lead to excess use of labor relative to capital and excess use of fuel relative to capital and labor. Also, most allocative <b>inefficiencies</b> in firms are due to internal factors and not subsidies, and the sizes of the <b>inefficiencies</b> vary substantially among transit firms.

40|$|Using {{non-parametric}} methods, {{we estimate}} the foregone rents due to credit, allocative, and technical <b>inefficiencies</b> of subsistence farmers in Southern India. The lost rents are estimated {{directly from the}} Nerlovian efficiency index, and the results suggest the largest foregone rents derive from allocative <b>inefficiencies</b> and then credit <b>inefficiencies.</b> Also, results suggest that farms without well access experience larger losses than those with well access. Econometric results suggest education, the presence of tank water management efforts, and well access influence the level of foregone rent due to allocative and Nerlovian <b>inefficiencies.</b> Educational activities and policies to encourage better management of tanks are considered important for lowering the foregone losses...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to battling {{the armies of}} other European empires (and its former colonies, the United States, in the War of 1812), the British Army fought the Chinese {{in the first and}} second Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion, Māori tribes in the first of the New Zealand Wars, Nawab Shiraj-ud-Daula's forces and British East India Company mutineers in the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the Boers in the first and second Boer Wars, Irish Fenians in Canada during the Fenian raids and Irish separatists in the Anglo-Irish War. The increasing demands of imperial expansion and the inadequacy and <b>inefficiency</b> of the underfunded British Army, Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Force after the Napoleonic Wars led to the late-19th-century Cardwell and Childers Reforms, which gave the army its modern shape and redefined its regimental system.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} the statistical properties of nonparametric estimators of production functions obtained {{through the use}} of data envelopment analysis (DEA). For deterministic production models it is shown that DEA production functions are consistent nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators and generate technical <b>inefficiencies</b> that converge in dis-tribution. The asymptotic joint distribution of the estimated technical <b>inefficiencies</b> allows hypothesis testing in DEA. These results are due mainly to Banker (1993) and here they are refined and extended. Relaxing the assumption of equally distributed <b>inefficiencies</b> and allowing for an arbitrary scale of operation for the underlying technology, it is shown the strong consistency of the DEA production function and how one can model effects causing <b>inefficiencies</b> under the assumptions of half-normal, truncated normal or gamma distribu-tions for the <b>inefficiencies,</b> not ruling out heteroscedasticity. Measures of goodness of fit are also developed for the iid case assuming an exponential or a half-normal distribution.

Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's <b>inefficiency,</b> demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E
