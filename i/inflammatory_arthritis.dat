5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> {{characterized}} by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E

25|$|It {{presents}} with monoarthritis {{affecting the}} large joints {{such as the}} knees and sacroiliac spine causing pain and swelling.

500|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} {{is a form}} {{of chronic}} <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail psoriasis. It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and surrounding connective tissue and can occur in any joint, but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes. [...] This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees, spine (spondylitis), and sacroiliac joint (sacroiliitis). About 30% of individuals with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Skin manifestations of psoriasis tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75% of cases.|$|E

2500|$|Reactive arthritis, {{also known}} as Reiter's syndrome, {{is a form of}} <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> that {{develops}} in response to an infection {{in another part of the}} body (cross-reactivity). Coming into contact with bacteria and developing an infection can trigger the disease. By the time the patient presents with symptoms, often the [...] "trigger" [...] infection has been cured or is in remission in chronic cases, thus making determination of the initial cause difficult.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arthritis}} {{often is}} coupled with other characteristic symptoms; {{this has been}} called Reiter's syndrome, Reiter's disease or Reiter's arthritis. [...] The term [...] "reactive arthritis" [...] is increasingly used {{as a substitute for}} this designation because of Hans Conrad Julius Reiter's war crimes with the Nazi Party. The manifestations of reactive arthritis include the following triad of symptoms: an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis, and urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Arthritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive arthritis. Patients can also present with mucocutaneous lesions, as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate balanitis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum. Enthesitis can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain. Not all affected persons have all the manifestations.|$|E
2500|$|Unicompartmental {{arthroplasty}} (UKA), {{also called}} partial knee replacement, {{is an option}} for some patients. The knee is generally divided into three [...] "compartments": medial (the inside part of the knee), lateral (the outside), and patellofemoral (the joint between the kneecap and the thighbone). Most patients with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in {{two or more of}} the above compartments and are best treated with total knee replacement. A minority of patients (the exact percentage is hotly debated but is probably between 10 and 30 percent) have wear confined primarily to one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better post-operative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and blood clots, but a harder revision if necessary. While most recent data suggests that UKA in properly selected patients has survival rates comparable to TKA, most surgeons believe that TKA is the more reliable long term procedure. Persons with infectious or <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> (Rheumatoid, Lupus, Psoriatic), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.|$|E
50|$|GLA is {{converted}} to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), a precursor {{to a variety of}} the 1-series prostaglandins and the 3-series leukotrienes. It inhibits leukotriene synthesis to provide therapy in rheumatologic illness. Borage seed oil may therefore have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects and it has been studied for its potential to treat <b>inflammatory</b> disorders, <b>arthritis,</b> atopic eczema, and respiratory inflammation.|$|R

40|$|Selected {{studies of}} {{neutrophil}} chemotaxis have been reviewed. While {{the multiplicity of}} chemotactic factors for neutrophils is recognized, it is especially evident {{that many of these}} factors are derivatives of the complement system. Also striking is the diversity of enzymes capable of producing chemotactically active fragments from complement proteins. Four conditions are cited in which complement-derived chemotactic factors are found in body fluids or tissue extracts: rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>inflammatory</b> nonrheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> immunologic vasculitis and myocardial infarcts. The interactions of chemotactic factors with neutrophils have been described in terms of the three neutrophil-associated esterases required for chemotactic responsiveness of these cells. Finally, several drugs have been studied, some of which are chemosuppressive in the chemotaxis system. These findings provide some suggestions about the mechanisms of leukocyte chemotaxis and may be relevant to the anti-inflammatory activity of these drugs...|$|R
50|$|The {{worldwide}} {{prevalence of}} <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> is approximately 3%.

50|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> can be {{disabling}} to {{the point}} where people with the diseases can lose their jobs, which can cause psychological distress. Because it is typically progressive, those who lose their jobs are unlikely to re-enter the workforce after leaving due to their diagnosis. Programs now aim to retain those with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>arthritis</b> by preventing work-related injuries and by making necessary accommodations in the workplace.
