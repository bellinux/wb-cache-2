5|$|There {{are five}} {{drainage}} tunnels in the Catawissa Creek watershed: the Audenried, Oneida #1, Oneida #3, Catawissa, and Green Mountain. Audenried Tunnel drains the Jeansville Coal Basin {{on the eastern}} edge of the watershed. Oneida #1 <b>empties</b> into, Sugarloaf Creek, a tributary of Catawissa Creek. The Oneida #3 <b>empties</b> into Tomhicken Creek, another tributary of Catawissa Creek. The other two empty into Catawissa Creek itself, relatively close to each other. The Audenried Tunnel is responsible for 80% of the acid mine drainage flowing into Catawissa Creek.|$|E

5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which <b>empties</b> into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, the Continental Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which <b>empties</b> into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets the Continental Divide at Triple Divide Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's Flathead River tributary.

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of <b>empty</b> holes on blasting vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are <b>empty</b> holes between monitoring point and blast hole is less than that without <b>empty</b> holes. The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of <b>empty</b> hole, the diameter of <b>empty</b> hole, the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole and the rows of <b>empty</b> hole, are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of <b>empty</b> hole has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect on blasting vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of <b>empty</b> hole and the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of <b>empty</b> hole can enhance the damping effect on blasting vibration as well. The results in the present study may provide a reference for the application of <b>empty</b> hole to reduce the blasting vibration in practical engineering...|$|R

5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and <b>empties</b> into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and <b>empties</b> into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
