40|$|Weather-related {{delays in}} the {{aviation}} sector will always occur, however, through effective delay management and improved weather forecasting, the impact and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> can be reduced. The research examined the type of weather that caused departure delays, due to adverse weather at the departure station, namely O. R. Tambo International Airport (ORTIA), over the period 2010 to 2013. It {{was found that the}} most significant weather that causes such delays are thunderstorms, followed by fog. Other noteworthy elements are rainfall, without the influence of other weather elements, and icing. It was also found that the accuracy of a weather forecast does not impact on the number of departure delays, and thus departure delays due to weather at the departure station are largely unavoidable. However, the length and impact of such delays can be reduced through improved planning. The study highlights that all weather-related delays can be reduced by improved weather forecasts, effective assessment of the weather forecast, and collaborative and timely decision making. A weather impact index system was designed for ORTIA and recommendations for delay reductions are made. GeographyM. Sc. (Geography...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on how people evaluate _th~ir sequential expe~. iences makes two contrasting observations. On the one hand, the {{literature suggests that}} some of the key findings, such as the preference for an improving sequence, are persistent effects. On the other hand, an emerging, critical literature has pointed outÃ‚Â· that such effects are highly conditional on a number of factors, such as the sequence domain. The presence of such factors could moderate the preference for improvement. Ã‚Â· The objective of the studies in this thesis was to explore the role of such factors on people's evaluations of sequences of delays. The results of the studies suggested that gestalt theories such as the preference for improvement in a sequence of delays are not always applicable, but instead conditional on many factors, such as the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays,</b> the degree to which delays prevented task achievement, and people's expectations of how delays are usually experienced.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{inhibitory}} and excitatory synapses in delay-coupled Hodgkin [...] Huxley neurons that {{are driven by}} noise is studied. If both synaptic types are used for coupling, appropriately tuned delays in the inhibition feedback induce multiple firing coherence resonances at sufficiently strong coupling strengths, thus giving rise to tongues of coherency in the corresponding delay-strength parameter plane. If only inhibitory synapses are used, however, appropriately tuned delays also give rise to multiresonant responses, yet the successive delays warranting an optimal coherence of excitations obey different relations {{with regards to the}} inherent time scales of neuronal dynamics. This leads to denser coherence resonance patterns in the delay-strength parameter plane. The robustness of these findings to the introduction of delay in the excitatory feedback, to noise, and to the number of coupled neurons is determined. Mechanisms underlying our observations are revealed, and it is suggested that the regularity of spiking across neuronal networks can be optimized in an unexpectedly rich variety of ways, {{depending on the type of}} coupling and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays.</b> Comment: 7 two-column pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulatio...|$|E

The stability of PIAT {{and the relationship of}} PIAT to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment have not been fully characterized. MethodsWe performed serial pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in a cohort treated for {{pulmonary tuberculosis}} after 20 weeks of tuberculosis therapy and again on or after treatment completion to determine the stability of PIAT. PFTs were compared with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, as well as other demographic variables. ResultsThe median duration {{between the first and second}} tests was 15 (interquartile range 9 – 34) weeks. The mean change in FVC was − 0. 02 l (95 % confidence interval [CI] − 0. 09, 0. 06), and the % predicted was − 0. 02 (95 % CI − 2. 17, 2. 12). FEV 1 changes were 0 l (95 % CI − 0. 05, 0. 06), and the % predicted was − 0. 11 (95 % CI − 1. 82, 1. 60).

This study aimed to examine the duration and predictive factors <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in contact with a psychiatrist in depressive patients in Isfahan city of Iran. Methods: In This cross sectional study 156 depressive patients were recruited from various outpatient clinics in Isfahan city between January 2013 and February 2013. We used the Anderson Socio-Behavioral Model (ASBM) for examine the role of various factors influencing delay in help seeking. In this models there were three categories variables (predisposing, enabling and need factors). Quintile regression model was used to study the predictors. Results: The median duration between symptom onset and first contact with a psychiatrist was 1 year. In the first step (predisposing model), age at onset of depressive symptoms and never married were negative predictors for delay, but widowed or divorced statues was positive predictors for delay. In the enabling model past contact with health provider was positively associated with <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay.</b> In the need model, neither variable {{had a significant effect}} on <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay.</b> In the full model, younger age at onset, widowed or divorced statues and past contact with health provider increased <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay.</b> Conclusions: More <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> help seeking by children and adolescence and probability of maladaptive coping style such as substance use and complicating of situation need to earlier diagnosis of depression in young group and earlier treatment for decrease DALLY for MDD, Therefore we suggest the mental health awareness programs for adolescent in school, and more ever for the influenced roles of parent and other family members and teachers on teen and young person′s life, the education for families and teachers on adolescent mental health problems can be effective.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} animals to delay {{gratification}} {{is crucial for}} complex goal-directed action. It may help them in making effective decisions when facing a choice. We tested the ability of nine long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to delay gratification in several experiments. In exchange tasks, subjects had to keep {{a small piece of}} cookie before returning it to an experimenter {{in order to get a}} larger food amount. Results showed that animals could wait between 10 s and 10 min depending on individual and sizes of reward. In another experiment, subjects could immediately give back the initial piece of cookie then wait for the return. Their performances more than doubled, demonstrating the role of consumption inhibition in postponing gratification. Such achievements underscore delays of gratification which until now were not thought possible in monkeys. Finally, subjects were presented with an accumulation of food pieces added at short intervals until they seized them. They mostly waited between 30 s and 1 min, which points at the consistency of our data, compared to those of other studies. Our results indicate that long-tailed macaques anticipated the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays.</b> We may account for their remarkable performances by their achievements in the social context...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} estimate {{the extent to}} which the failure of a bank disrupts the financial system is very valuable for regulators of the financial system. One important part of the financial system is the interbank payment system. This paper develops a robust measure, SinkRank, that accurately predicts the magnitude of disruption caused by the failure of a bank in a payment system and identifies banks most affected by the failure. SinkRank is based on absorbing Markov chains, which are well-suited to model liquidity dynamics in payment systems. Because actual bank failures are rare and the data is not generally publicly available, the authors test the metric by simulating payment networks and inducing failures in them. The authors use two metrics to evaluate the magnitude of the disruption: the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> in the system (Congestion) aggregated over all banks and the average reduction in available funds of the other banks due to the failing bank (Liquidity dislocation). The authors test SinkRank on Barabasi-Albert types of scale-free networks modeled on the Fedwire system and find that the failing bank's SinkRank is highly correlated with the resulting disruption in the system overall; moreover, the SinkRank technology can identify which individual banks would be most disrupted by a given failure...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Prefrontal cortex and neostriatum constituting the prefrontal {{system are}} {{connected}} by glutamatergic neurones. The involvement of this corticostriatal projection {{in control of}} maze performance of rats was investigated. Glutamatergic transmission mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors was blocked by intrastriatal injections of dl- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (AP- 5) (50 nmole in 0. 5 ILl). In experiment 1, intrastriatal AP- 5 was found {{to increase the number}} of errors during acquisition of a delayed alternation task in a T-maze. In experiment 2, the effect of intrastriatal AP- 5 on acquisition of different 8 arm maze tasks was investigated. AP- 5 did not affect the number of reentries on spontaneous and reinforced alternation; pre- and postdelay errors on delayed alternation were not altered. Therefore, intrastriatal NMDA receptor blockade impairs acquisition of a delayed alternation in a T-maze, while intrastriatal blockade of NMDA receptors does not affect acquisition of different 8 arm maze tasks. The impairment in the T-maze task appears not to be due to deficient acquisition of spatial information per se, since 8 arm maze performance is intact. Instead, repeated delays in the T-maze task seem to be the critical component that gives difficulties in acquisition. These difficulties in bridging successive temporal discontiguities were attributed to an increased susceptibility to external and internal interfering stimuli during delays. Thus, striatal NMDA receptors within the prefrontal system may be involved in correct response retention over the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: In Slovenia, {{lung cancer}} {{is the second most}} common cancer among men and the fifth most common cancer among women. Fiveyear {{survival}} is 13 %, and at the time of diagnosis, only 16 % of patients have curable disease. Early cancer diagnosis is associated with better prognosis, so reducing the delay time might increase the number of tumours detected at early stages and might improve survival rates. The aim of our study was to measure the delays to diagnosis and treatment and assess whether the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> were acceptable with respect to other similar studies and recommendations. Methods: We identified all patients with suspicious lung lesions, who were referred to a specialised outpatient clinic (the “Tumour clinic”) in a one-year period. The Tumour Clinic was established to speed up lung cancer diagnosing. We also analysed time from the first symptoms to the patient’s first visit to a specialist, the time from the first visit to the final diagnosis, and time from the diagnosis of lung cancer to the beginning of treatment. Results: We examined the records of 159 patients with suspicious lung lesions, who were referred to the outpatient clinic between January and December 2008. The mean age of the patients was 67 years (range 20 – 88 yrs). Seventy-four (53 male, 21 female) of the patients were diagnosed with malignant disease, including 61 cases of lung cancer. The median time from the onset of symptoms to the first visit was 67 days, and the median time from the first visit until diagnosis was 10 days. Another 12 days (median time) passed from the time of diagnosis to the beginning of treatment. Conclusions: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer wait too long before seeking appropriate medical assistance. When referred to a specialised outpatient clinic, the diagnosis time of lung cancer and the time from diagnosis to the beginning of treatment were acceptable, but there is still room for improvement...|$|E
40|$|Falling {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of unintentional death or injury worldwide. People older than 65 years and people {{suffering}} from neurological disease have a higher chance of falling, which indicates the involvement of higher brain structures such as the cortex. For this reason, cortical activity underlying balance control has been subject of research using mobile neuroimaging methods during balance tasks. Often, the focus is on the moment balance is lost and a compensatory action is made. In this study, differences between two different strategies are investigated. Healthy, young participants receive balance perturbations by backward translation of a platform on which they stand, while recording high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to study task-related brain activity. EEG is the recording of changes of electric potential related to brain activity. Participants receive two instructions; in the first condition, they are instructed to respond naturally, which means they take a step. In the second condition, participants should try to inhibit their step. It is hypothesised that the second condition will reflect neural responses with a higher magnitude, because it is more difficult to respond by step inhibition. The dynamic nature of the task introduces a muscular and motion artefacts to which the EEG is sensitive. A blind-source separation algorithm (independent component analysis) in combination with an automatic outlier rejection algorithm is used to separate artefacts from neural sources. The obtained neural sources are divided into clusters based on their location on the scalp, dipole representation, power spectrum and timecourse. The resulting clusters represent the motor cortex (legs, left and right hand area), the prefrontal cortex, and the temporal-occipital areas for the left and right hemisphere. Analysis in time-domain shows a negative peak in the timecourse directly after the perturbation. In previous research, this peak has been related to error detection, which in this experiment is the loss of balance. In time-frequency domain, at the motor cortex, phase synchronisation is found at 5 - 25 Hz, followed by phase desynchronisation in the 8 - 15 Hz and 20 - 30 Hz frequency range. This is also in accordance with previous literature. However, there was no significant difference between the two conditions. The hypothesis is therefore rejected, at this point. One explanation to this result may be the small dataset used for this experiment. During preprocessing, up to 65 % of data was rejected for some participants. An increase in the number of trials and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> in between trials, may improve the quality of the dataset such that the hypothesis can be reconsidered. Nonetheless, the correspondence in results with previous research already indicate that the motion platform is suitable for EEG experiments.

However the desirability of general approach basing on concepts of quantum field theory and uniting two main problems, <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> at scattering and of formation of arisen states, seems evident. We show that the Ward-Takahashi identity allows the defining of general temporal function in the frame of QED, real part of which describes the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> scattered particle on scatterer and imaginary part describes the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> formation ("dressing") of outgoing bare particle.

The determination of temporal functions demonstrates also the instanton-type nature of tunneling processes, makes clear sense of the adiabatic hypothesis of quantum theory and some renormalization schemes. In an application to the problem of charge nullification they lead to a restriction of allowable number of fermions of the theory. Comment: 26 p...|$|R

The chicks were {{randomly}} assigned into three groups as follows: (1) chicks with immediate feed access; (2) chicks with 48 h delay in feed access, and (3) chicks with 72 h delay in feed access. For each group, chicks were assigned into 4 replications of 57 birds each. Prior to feed access, the chicks were weighed. Samples of chicks were used to weigh yolk sac at 1, 3 and 7 days and to collect blood at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 56 days. Also, reared chicks were weighed weekly. The results indicated that chick weights decreased during the holding period.

40|$|Background: Blood is {{routinely}} grouped and cross matched for elective adenoidectomy and, or, tonsillectomy at our institution. This practice {{has led to}} unnecessary <b>delay</b> and cancellation <b>of</b> surgery. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study conducted in children aged one and half to nine years scheduled for adenoidectomy and, or, tonsillectomy from January, 2012 to April 2013. We investigated the need for routine preoperative grouping and cross matching of blood, and the immediate complications following adenotonsillectomy. Data collected included the number of blood cross matched and transfused, pre- and postoperative haemoglobin, estimated blood loss, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in commencing surgery {{due to lack of}} blood and the immediate complications following adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. Results: A total of 129 patients were studied, adenotonsillectomy was performed in 88. 37 %, adenoidectomy in 7. 75 %, and tonsillectomy in 3. 88 %. The median estimated blood loss was 100 IQR (60 - 100 ml), 145 pints of blood were requested in all, one pint in 77. 93 % and two pints in 22. 07 %. The Cross-match to Transfusion Ratio, Transfusion Index and Blood ordering quotient were zero (0) respectively. The median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> before surgery commenced on account of lack of blood was 84 IQR (27. 5 - 119. 5) mls. Primary haemorrhage was observed in 4 (3. 1 %), accidental extubation in 13 (10. 07 %), hypoxia 5 (3. 88 %) and cardiac arrest in one patient (0. 78 %). Conclusion: The cross-match to transfusion ratio, transfusion index and blood ordering quotient were zero, which suggest that cross-matched blood is unlikely to be required, and there was low blood usage. Therefore, the routine practice of preoperative grouping and cross matching of blood seems unnecessary adenoidectomy and, or, tonsillectomy. It is recommended that group and save should be encouraged because of shortage of blood in our country...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Individuals with ADHD {{preferentially}} choose smaller sooner (SS) over larger later (LL) rewards, termed impulsive choice. This {{has been}} observed to different degrees on single-choice and more complex discounting tasks using various types <b>of</b> rewards and <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays.</b> There has been no direct comparison of performance of ADHD children using these two paradigms. Method: Two experimental paradigms, single-choice and temporal discounting, each including two delay conditions (13 and 25 s), were administered to 7 - to 9 -year-old children with ADHD (n = 17) and matched controls (n = 24). Results: Individuals with ADHD chose more SS rewards than controls on both tasks, {{but in the long}} delay condition only. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that delay durations rather than paradigm types determine laboratory-based measures of choice impulsivity in ADHD...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To provide data on {{rates and}} {{predictors}} of lifetime treatment for mental disorders in Belgium from the European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD). MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a cross-sectional population study of 1, 043 non-institutionalized adult (18 +) inhabitants from Belgium, The third {{version of the}} Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI- 3. 0) was administered to assess lifetime mental disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4 th version (DSM-IV), failure and <b>delay</b> <b>of</b> treatment for mental disorders, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>delay</b> between onset <b>of</b> the disorder and first treatment contact, {{and the proportion of}} persons seeking help in the same year as the onset of the disorder. RESULTS: Cumulative lifetime probability curves show {{that the vast majority of}} persons with mental disorders will eventually make a first treatment contact, although more so for mood (93. 7 %) and anxiety disorders (84. 5 %) than for alcohol disorders (61. 2 %). Median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in treatment was lowest for mood disorders (1 year), but peaked for anxiety (16 years) and alcohol disorders (18 years). Both older cohorts and late age of onset of the disorder predicted a higher probability of lifetime treatment. CONCLUSION: Although most disorders are eventually treated, the <b>delays</b> between onset <b>of</b> the disorder and first treatment contact are impressive, despite the high-density and high accessibility of primary and specialized care in Belgium. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: The prompt {{administration}} of coronary reperfusion therapy {{for patients with}} an evolving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is crucial in reducing mortality {{and the risk of}} serious clinical complications in these patients. However, long-term trends in extent <b>of</b> prehospital <b>delay</b> and factors affecting patient 2 ̆ 7 s care-seeking behavior remain relatively unexplored, especially in men and women of different ages. The objectives of this study were to examine the overall magnitude and 20 -year trends (1986 to 2005) in <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> prehospital <b>delay</b> in middle-aged and elderly men and women hospitalized with AMI. Methods and Results: The study sample consisted of 5967 residents of the Worcester, Mass, metropolitan area hospitalized at all greater Worcester medical centers for AMI between 1986 and 2005 who had information available about <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> prehospital <b>delay.</b> Compared with men 3 ̆c 653 ̆eyears, patients in other age-sex strata exhibited longer prehospital delays over the 20 -year period under study. The multivariable-adjusted medians <b>of</b> prehospital <b>delay</b> were 1. 96, 2. 07, and 2. 57 hours for men 3 ̆c 653 ̆eyears, men 65 to 74 years, and men ≥ 75 years and 2. 08, 2. 33, and 2. 27 hours for women 3 ̆c 653 ̆eyears, women 65 to 74 years, and women ≥ 75 years, respectively. These age and sex differences have narrowed over time, which has been largely explained by changes in patient 2 ̆ 7 s comorbidity profile and AMI-associated characteristics. Conclusions: Our results suggest that <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> prehospital <b>delay</b> in persons with symptoms of AMI has remained essentially unchanged during the 20 -year period under study and elderly individuals are more likely to delay seeking timely medical care than younger persons...|$|R
