Scout <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom.

500|$|Thus, {{although}} there are several dark powers in Earthsea (like the dragon, and the stone of Terrenon) the true evil {{was not one of}} these powers, or even death, but Ged's actions that went against the balance of nature. Although evil is present in the books, it is a non-Christian understanding of evil: evil is a [...] "misunderstanding of the dynamics of life". This is contrary to conventional Western storytelling, in which light and darkness are often considered opposites, and are seen as symbolizing good and evil, which are constantly in conflict. On two different occasions, Ged <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> try to defy death and evil, but eventually learns that neither can be eliminated: instead, he chooses not to serve evil, and stops denying death.|$|E
500|$|Following Karl's {{affair with}} Sarah, Susan {{goes out to}} dinner with Martin Chester (Gil Tucker), a former boyfriend and member of Karl's {{university}} band. Woodburne told Annette Dasey of Inside Soap that Karl knows Martin is taking Susan to dinner and he does not think she would be capable of any [...] "misconduct" [...] with him. The actress explained [...] "Susan is very attracted to Martin, but she wouldn't be aware of it if her marriage was more solid and she wasn't feeling so unloved." [...] Woodburne stated that Susan <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> have a fling, but she ultimately decides that she wants to save her marriage. Despite Karl's affair, she still loves him and they need to work through their problems. Woodburne was good friends with Tucker as they previously worked together on Cop Shop.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{references}} to Christian {{beliefs in the}} film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the Christian devil, complete with red skin and horns. Maul's facial tattoos were inspired by the indigenous peoples of Brazil. The Star Wars film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the [...] "chosen one"the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Forcewho was conceived of a virgin birth and <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> join the Sith. Anakin's fall from grace seemingly prevents him from fulfilling his destiny as the [...] "chosen one" [...] (until Return of the Jedi reveals the prophecy was ultimately true). The inspiration behind {{the story of the}} virgin birth parallels a concept developed by Joseph Campbell and his work on The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which heavily influenced Lucas' writing of the original Star Wars trilogy's outline.|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters {{described}} {{the story as}} a [...] "rebirth" [...] for The Adventures of Tintin and {{described the}} addition of Haddock as [...] "a formidable narrative element", one which [...] "profoundly changed {{the spirit of the}} series". Elsewhere, he asserts that it is Haddock's appearance which [...] "makes this book so memorable" [...] and that he <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> define the book by that character's début. Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline commented that The Crab with the Golden Claws had [...] "a certain charm" [...] stemming from its use of [...] "exoticism and colonial nostalgia, for the French especially, evoking their holdings in North Africa." [...] Michael Farr asserted that the arrival of Haddock was the most [...] "remarkable" [...] element of the story, offering the series [...] "tremendous new potential". He also thought that the dream sequences reflected the popularity of surrealism at the time, and that the influence of cinema, in particular the films of Alfred Hitchcock, is apparent in the story.|$|E
500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, one <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, {{and to some extent}} elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E
500|$|Riker makes {{a promise}} to Picard never to use the powers again and the ship arrives at Quadra Sigma. A rescue team beams down and discovers a young girl who has died. Riker <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> save her, {{but in the end}} he refuses to do so out of respect for his promise; however, he quickly shows signs of regret at this decision, which he expresses to the captain. Tension between Picard and his first officer grows as Riker now seems to be {{embracing}} his powers, and his behavior toward the crew begins to change. At Q's suggestion, and with Picard's blessing, Riker uses his powers to give his friends what he believes they want, turning Wesley into an adult, giving La Forge (LeVar Burton) his sight, and creating a Klingon female companion for Worf. [...] All the recipients reject their gifts, however, with Data (Brent Spiner) even anticipating and declining Riker's attempt to make him human. Picard declares that Q has failed, and when Q attempts to go back on his word, he is forcibly recalled to the Continuum. Picard is pleased to see Q gone, and praises Riker for confirming his trust in his [...] "Number One".|$|E

500|$|After taking office, Lois {{attempts}} {{to propose a}} tax raise, though when this fails, begins to use fear tactics to raise funds {{to clean up the}} lake. Her efforts are successful and life returns to the clean lake. She even has leftover cash afterwards, so she embezzles $600 to purchase a purse, much to Brian's disappointment. Peter has also succumbed to the perks of being the mayor's husband: he has rerouted the town's electrical system and caused rolling blackouts to bring late comedian Jim Varney back from the dead (he does nothing but talk, playing his character Ernest, [...] and repeatedly refer to [...] "Vern".) He then remembers he actually wanted John Belushi and takes Varney outside to shoot him, only for Varney to end up taking the gun from him and Peter running away from him warning Brian. [...] Later, Lois <b>is</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> buy a $4,300 fur coat, and Bob Grossbeard, president of the local oil company, offers to buy it for her if she will allow him to dump his oil runoff in the lake. Lois reluctantly accepts his offer, but as the opening of the new runoff pipe begins, Lois realizes the error of her ways and closes the valve to the pipe and resigns her position as mayor, stating that she was consumed by money and power, which led her to become the very same things she set out to destroy. Lois then allows West to have his job as mayor back, but a random bystander points out that neither Lois nor Mayor West has any jurisdiction to do so, and that the city has to have a whole new election to decide who gets to be the mayor of Quahog. This prompts West to pull out a gun and shoot him, as well as two others whom he believes objected.|$|E
