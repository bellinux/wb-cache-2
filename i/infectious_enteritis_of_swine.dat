40|$|Several {{etiological}} {{factors may}} be involved in <b>enteritises</b> <b>of</b> <b>swine.</b> The pathology may result from the presence of anyone or from a combination of these factors. Of the microorganisms etiologically involved, or at least predisposing, Salmonella choleraesuis is probably most common; however, both viruses and Virio species can predispose. Predisposition due to the added stress accompanying nutritional deficiencies is perhaps more important than any microbial species which has been incriminated, and in many cases of porcine enteric disorders a history of nutritional error exists. Inasmuch as swine enteritises may be either (or both) infectious or non-infectious, therapy should include specific medication and, in addition, instruction in correct management and feeding practices. Undoubtedly the more successful practitioners employ such an armanentarium rather than relying solely upon the so-called 2 ̆ 2 wonder drugs. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} 28 suckling, weanling, {{and young}} adult rabbits with lethargy, inappetence, and mucinous, semifluid feces. Sixteen of the rabbits had intestinal lesions. In eight of these rabbits, the primary changes were multifocal to diffuse epithelial proliferation and accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages, or {{both in the}} lamina propria of the small intestine, cecum, and sacculated colon. In two of these rabbits, the accumulation of macrophages in the lamina propria was extensive. The other eight rabbits had erosive and suppurative cecocolitis, and four of the rabbits with proliferative lesions also had suppurative cecocolitis. In Warthin-Starry-stained sections of affected intestine, curved or spiral bacteria were visible within degenerated or hyperplastic epithelium, in luminal exudate, or in both. Such organisms were sparse or {{not found in the}} other 12 rabbits, which did not have intestinal lesions. The bacteria ultrastructurally resembled intraepithelial Cam-pylobacter-like bacteria previously observed in proliferative enteritis in a variety of species and in acute typhlitis in young rabbits. In immunofluorescence tests, Campylobacter-like bacteria in epithelial cells, crypt lumina, and in luminal exudates in both proliferative and erosive lesions bound monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera prepared against intracellular bacteria found in proliferative enteritis in pigs, hamsters, and ferrets. These observations indicate that a condition similar to proliferative <b>enteritis</b> <b>of</b> <b>swine,</b> hamsters, and other species also occurs in laboratory rabbits...|$|R

30|$|In {{developing}} countries, bacterial acute gastroenteritis {{continues to}} be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among young children. Salmonellosis constitutes a major cause <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> worldwide, most <b>of</b> them associated to the consumption of contaminated food products. Traditionally, Salmonella has been classified in serovars based on varieties of O and H surface antigens. In the present work we generated and characterized a panel of anti-flagellin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in order to select antibodies useful for detecting the H surface antigen. Four different MAbs were obtained by somatic hybridization of splenocytes. We found two MAbs that recognised regions of flagellin conserved among different Salmonella serovars. Other two MAbs recognised structures restricted to Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium, being one of them suitable for agglutination tests. Using a diverse panel of S. enterica serovars with different H antigen varieties we confirmed that this MAb agglutinates specifically S. Typhimurium (antigenic formula: 4, 12 :i: 1, 2) or other serovars expressing flagellar factor i. In conclusion, we generated a valuable immunochemical tool to be used in simple assays for serotyping of epidemiologically relevant strains. The capacity to characterize specific strains and determine the primary sources of Salmonella contamination generate valuable information of the epidemiology of this microorganism, contributing to the improvement of public health.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to survey seroprevalence of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis in goats of Khuzestan province and its correlation with host and environmental determinants. In this study sera samples were collected randomly from 368 goats in Ahvaz, Hendijan, Izeh, Shushtar, Dezful and Susangerd cities and were tested by ELISA. Apparent and real seroprevalence of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis were 7. 07 % (95 % CI: 4. 47 - 9. 67 percent) and 13. 8 % (95 % CI: 10. 3 - 17. 3 percent), respectively. This study showed that infection increased with age and odds of infection between the age, based on year and disease is 1. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 86 - 1. 35) (p> 0. 05). Relative frequency of positive samples in females was more than males and the odds of infection in female goats was 1. 19 (95 % CI: 0. 4 - 3. 59) times the males (p> 0. 05). The odds of infection in goats with history of diarrhea was 4. 38 (95 % CI: 1. 92 - 9. 96) times more than goats without this history (p 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), a {{constituent}} of primary neutrophil granules, {{is a potent}} natural antibiotic and an antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) antigen in cases of vasculitis in which the target antigen is neither myeloperoxidase (MPO) nor proteinase- 3 (PR 3). AIM: To investigate BPI as a possible target antigen for ANCAs in inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: ANCAs were detected by routine immunofluorescence (IIF) and solid phase enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed for antibodies to the purified neutrophil granule proteins; MPO, PR 3, cathepsin-G, lactoferrin, and BPI in serum samples from 88 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (36 with Crohn's disease, 52 with ulcerative colitis). Thirty patients with bacterial enteritis acted as controls. RESULTS: Significantly more patients with ulcerative colitis were ANCA positive by IIF (60 %) than patients with Crohn's disease (28 %) or <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> (23 %) (p < 0. 001). IgG anti-BPI antibodies were present in 29 % of patients with ulcerative colitis, 14 % of patients with Crohn's disease, and 23 % <b>of</b> patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis,</b> occurring in 44 % of those patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were ANCA positive by IIF. Antibodies to other ANCA antigens were rare. The presence of ANCAs {{was not related to}} either disease activity or extent; presence of anti-BPI antibodies was significantly related to both a lower serum albumin concentration (p = 0. 001) and a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0. 02) in patients with ulcerative colitis, and to colonic involvement in patients with Crohn's disease (p = 0. 01). CONCLUSION: BPI is a significant minority target antigen for ANCAs in inflammatory bowel disease that seems related to colonic Crohn's disease and disease activity in ulcerative colitis.

Thus there is need for a better preoperative screening of patients with suspected appendicitis. This prospective single center single-blinded pilot study was conducted in the Department of surgery at the HELIOS Universitätsklinikum Wuppertal, Germany. Calprotectin was measured in pre-therapeutic stool samples of patients presenting in the emergency department with pain to the right lower quadrant. Fecal calprotectin (FC) values were analyzed using commercially available ELISA kits. Cut-off values for FC were studied using the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The Area under the curve (AUC) was reported for each ROC curve. The mean FC value was 51. 4 ± 118. 8 μg/g in patients with AA, 320. 9 ± 416. 6 μg/g in patients with <b>infectious</b> <b>enteritis</b> and 24. 8 ± 27. 4 μg/g in the control group.
