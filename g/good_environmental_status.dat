40|$|The {{effects of}} both habit {{formation}} and status concerns are analyzed within a model with short-lived households and a long-lived public <b>good,</b> <b>environmental</b> quality. <b>Status</b> seeking induces households to raise consumption {{of goods and}} leisure, and pollution, and to lower environmental quality. Habits exacerbate the social costs of status seeking. Efficient tax programs exist and are analyzed. Status seeking and habits are shown to raise efficient consumption and income tax rates. Moreover, an allocation induced by a sequence of short-lived governments is considered. The more important habits and status, to more mistakenly short-lived governments set tax rates relative to efficient rates. However, in case there exists a long-lived institution, when governments are short-lived, the competitive economy can be induced to attain the efficient allocation by a specific tax-transfer program.

40|$|Marine {{legislation}} world-wide has, as {{a recent}} final objective, {{the maintenance of a}} <b>good</b> <b>environmental</b> or ecological <b>status</b> for marine waters, habitats and resources. The concept of <b>environmental</b> <b>status</b> takes into account the structure, function and processes of marine ecosystems, bringing together physical, chemical, physiographic, geographic and climatic factors: subsequently, integrating such conditions, with anthropogenic impacts and activities undertaken in the area concerned. Such an approach is intended to permit an assessment of the <b>environmental</b> <b>status</b> at the ecosystem level, i. e. ‘ecosystem-based approach’, or ‘ecosystem-based management’. Such legislation emphasises the need for the development of methodologies, to assess <b>environmental</b> <b>status.</b> As such the knowledge acquired within Regional Seas, discussed at International Symposia and, finally, published as Special Issues, can {{serve as the basis for}} a regional ecosystem-based approach to management and the integrative assessment of marine systems. Hence, the Bay of Biscay is used in this contribution, as an example, to show past and present research, together with perspectives for the future. It is concluded that collaboration between institutions (marine research institutes, universities) and countries (France, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Ireland) could result in an interesting ‘case-study’, for the further implementation of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, at the level of this particular Regional Sea. In this way, the experience gained in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive within the ecoregion, together with the information collated in the eleven International Symposia of Oceanography of the Bay of Biscay, celebrated until now, can be very useful, for an ecosystem-based management approach for this Regional Sea. <br/...|$|R

Amongst others, they require the maintenance of biological diversity (descriptor 1), populations of all commercially exploited fish and shellfish to be within safe biological limits exhibiting a population age and size distribution that is indicative of a healthy stock (descriptor 3) and to ensure that sea-floor integrity is at a level that ensures that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded and benthic ecosystems, in particular, are not adversely affected (descriptor 6).|$|E

A directive guiding the development of such plans by European Union member states is currently being formulated. There is an undeniable need for marine spatial planning. However, we argue that considerable care must be taken with marine spatial planning, as the spatial and temporal scales of maritime activities and of <b>Good</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Status</b> may be mismatched.

Based upon current financial accounting standards, prospective payments for these costs are not always reported as liabilities on financial statements. Agribusiness lenders require complete information on the <b>environmental</b> <b>status</b> of agribusiness borrowers {{in order to assess}} the potential effects of environmental liability. In addition, agribusiness lenders have been held responsible by the judicial system for the environmental problems of their borrowers. Publicly available, financial and environmental data was used to develop models to quantify the effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>status</b> regardless of whether environmental liabilities are included in the financial statements. The results indicate that <b>environmental</b> <b>status</b> is dependent upon source of environmental hazard and company size, adjusted for industry affiliation.

40|$|The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) {{requires}} European Member States (MS) {{to develop}} strategies that {{should lead to}} programmes of measures that achieve or maintain <b>Good</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Status</b> (GES) in European Seas. As an essential step reaching <b>good</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>status,</b> MS should establish monitoring programmes for assessment, enabling {{the state of the}} marine waters concerned to be evaluated on a regular basis. As a follow up to the Commission Decision on criteria and methodological standards on <b>good</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>status</b> (GES) of marine waters (Commission Decision 2010 / 477 /EU), the Marine Directors requested the Directorate-General for the Environment (DG ENV) in 2010 to establish a Technical Subgroup (TSG) under the Working Group on <b>Good</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Status</b> (WG GES) for further development of Descriptor 10 Marine Litter (TSG-ML). TSG-ML in 2011 focused on providing advise through the EU Report 25009 “Marine Litter – Technical Recommendations for the implementation of MSFD requirements”. Within that report the options and available tools for the monitoring of marine litter in the different environmental compartments have been identified. Member States have then requested a follow-up through an additional mandate. One scope of this work is to provide harmonized protocols for the monitoring of marine litter for the European Seas. The present document is the Monitoring Guidance for Marine Litter in European Seas (Draft Report) and provides MS with the recommendations and information needed to commence the monitoring required this aspect of MSFD. This draft report divided in 8 sections/chapters presents a general overview of approaches and strategies dealing with marine litter monitoring and provides protocols for the monitoring of specifically: beach litter, floating litter, seafloor litter, litter in biota, microlitter.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) with its focus on an Ecosystem Approach places {{an emphasis on the}} human dimensions of environmental problems. Human activities may be the source of marine degradation, but may also be adversely affected should degradation compromise the provision of ecosystem services. The MSFD marks a shift away from management aiming to restore past, undegraded states toward management for <b>Good</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Status</b> (GEnS) based on delivery of marine goods and services. An example relating ecosystem services to criteria for <b>Good</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Status</b> is presented for eutrophication, a long recognised problem in many parts of Europe's seas and specifically targeted by descriptors for GEnS. Taking the North Sea as a case study the relationships between the eutrophication criteria of the MSFD and final and intermediate marine ecosystem services are examined. Ecosystem services are valued, where possible in monetary terms, in order to illustrate how eutrophication affects human welfare (economic externalities) through its multiple effects on ecosystem services. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Agriculture is responsible for a large share of the leaching of nutrients to watercourses, including groundwater lakes and finally the sea. The analysis of data presented in this paper concludes that specialized agriculture with its separation of crop and animal production results in a high load of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Baltic Sea. This agricultural specialization took place throughout the Scandinavian countries after World War II and has resulted in farms with a high density of animals and great surpluses of plant nutrients concentrated to certain regions. Examples from Sweden are presented in this paper. This trend of increasing products per animal and per hectare on fewer farms and a higher surplus of nutrients on each of them is continuing in Sweden and is likely to spread to new EU member countrie...|$|E
