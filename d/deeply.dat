5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, <b>deeply</b> cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species. The pinnae of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) are toothed and less <b>deeply</b> cut, and the dark color of the stipe continues partway up the rachis in that species. Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not as <b>deeply</b> cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms (scutes) {{covering}} {{the back of}} Deinosuchus were unusually large, heavy, and <b>deeply</b> pitted; some were of a roughly hemispherical shape. Deep pits and grooves on these osteoderms served as attachment points for connective tissue. Together, the osteoderms and connective tissue would have served as load-bearing reinforcement to support the massive body of Deinosuchus out of water. These <b>deeply</b> pitted osteoderms {{have been used to}} suggest that, despite its bulk, Deinosuchus could probably have walked on land much like modern-day crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|The rocks have metamorphosed and are <b>deeply</b> eroded and faulted.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1968 {{election}} {{had left}} him <b>deeply</b> disillusioned, Ochs continued {{to work for the}} election campaigns of anti-war candidates, such as George McGovern's unsuccessful Presidential bid in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less <b>deeply</b> lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more <b>deeply</b> cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|Because Faulks {{felt that}} much of the extant World War I {{literature}} was <b>deeply</b> influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Benigno Aquino III won the 2010 {{national}} elections {{and served as}} the 15th President of the Philippines. He was the third youngest person to be elected {{president and the first}} to be a bachelor, beginning with the 2010 Manila hostage crisis that caused <b>deeply</b> strained relations between Manila and Hong Kong for a time.|$|E
5|$|Bonham's Case was {{met with}} mixed {{reactions}} at the time, with King James I and his Lord Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere, were both <b>deeply</b> unhappy with it. One {{of the reasons for}} Coke's dismissal from the Common Pleas in 1613 was suggested to be the case.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{was baptized}} in the Anglican Church in December 1911 in England, and {{was raised in}} the Episcopal Church in the United States. While he was never an observant Christian during his adult life, many of his friends {{believed}} he had a <b>deeply</b> spiritual side.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his support}} for conscription, Gould was not {{endorsed}} by the new Nationalist Party to contest the 1917 election. <b>Deeply</b> offended, Gould nevertheless elected to retire rather than run as an independent and split the Nationalist vote.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the original upon its release, although it was generally critically well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been <b>deeply</b> divided. Modern critics and scholars have noted the strong lesbian overtones of the film, which Universal acknowledged {{from the start of}} filming and exploited in some early advertising.|$|E
5|$|During another {{courtship}} {{display the}} male bows <b>deeply</b> forward facing the female, reaching {{the ground with}} his bill and spreading and flattening his plumage in a near-horizontal plane for up to 20seconds. In this pose, the white plumage forms a striking white band across his darker plumage.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also <b>deeply</b> influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also <b>deeply</b> influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E
5|$|Each Antemoro clan was endogamous and {{marriage}} outside the clan was <b>deeply</b> taboo. Those who transgressed were mourned as if dead and were entirely {{cut off from}} the community.|$|E
5|$|Emily Shelby – Arthur Shelby's wife. She is a <b>deeply</b> {{religious}} {{woman who}} strives to {{be a kind}} and moral influence upon her slaves and is appalled when her husband sells his slaves with a slave trader. As a woman, she has no legal way to stop this, as all property belongs to her husband.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Boone {{worked as}} a {{surveyor}} and merchant, but fell <b>deeply</b> into debt through failed Kentucky land speculation. Frustrated with the legal problems resulting from his land claims, in 1799, Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where {{he spent most of}} the last two decades of his life (1800–20).|$|E
5|$|France, Egypt, the Soviet Union, Britain, Israel, {{and others}} were <b>deeply</b> {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} behind the scenes. Britain and the Soviet Union were the main military backers of the Nigerian government while France and others aided the Biafrans. Nigeria used Egyptian pilots for their air force.|$|E
5|$|His {{real estate}} {{interests}} in California flourished, {{and he was}} an early environmentalist as well as promoter of the new metropolis. He believed <b>deeply</b> in Los Angeles becoming a major city with a seaport. The city would use water from across local mountains, and would recreate Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
5|$|I am very disappointed, as {{any parent}} would be, after his son held {{a party in}} their home while his parents were away. I am more <b>deeply</b> distressed {{for the welfare of}} the young man who was injured in this fight.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, his three-year-old {{daughter}} Voahangy {{became ill}} and died. Rabearivelo was <b>deeply</b> {{affected by this}} loss and was plunged into grief from which he never recovered. His last daughter, {{who was born in}} 1936, he named Velomboahangy ("Voahangy Alive"). The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 at {{the height}} of his popularity, Donovan met actor-turned writer Tom Tryon and the two entered into a {{long-term}} relationship the following year. Tryon was <b>deeply</b> closeted and grew increasingly disturbed by Donovan's notoriety. Their relationship ended in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, The New York Times Book Review {{published}} a lengthy letter of hers {{in which she}} describes the origins of her <b>deeply</b> felt hatred of prostitution and pornography ("mass-produced, technologized prostitution") as her history of being violently inspected by prison doctors, and battered by her first husband and numerous other men.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died. He {{felt her}} loss <b>deeply,</b> and was plunged into {{depression}} and insomnia, even contemplating suicide. He left Paris {{and stayed in}} Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the science of sociology, Znaniecki was also <b>deeply</b> interested in the larger field of the sociology of science. He analyzed the social roles of scientists, {{and the concept of}} a school of thought.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} Beecher's legacy, Applegate {{states that}} His reputation has been eclipsed {{by his own}} success. Mainstream Christianity is so <b>deeply</b> infused with the rhetoric of Christ's love that most Americans can imagine nothing else, and have no appreciation or memory of the revolution wrought by Beecher and his peers.|$|E
5|$|Indium(I) {{compounds}} are not common. The chloride, bromide, and iodide are <b>deeply</b> colored, {{unlike the}} parent trihalides {{from which they}} are prepared. The fluoride is known only as an unstable gaseous compound. Indium(I) oxide black powder is produced when indium(III) oxide decomposes upon heating to 700°C.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that, although Otto failed, he <b>deeply</b> loved Greece {{as his own}} new homeland. His failure was mainly {{a result of the}} continuous intrigues and competition among the three Great Powers. Before his death, Otto asked to be buried in his own Greek traditional uniform.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's {{wife died}} in 1826 after a {{protected}} illness; {{the couple had}} no children. Jennings was <b>deeply</b> saddened by her loss and began to drink liquor more heavily. Later that year he married Clarissa Barbee, but his drinking condition only worsened and he was frequently inebriated.|$|E
5|$|Jones Valley, the Wisconsin River {{valley in}} which Taliesin sits, was formed during Pre-Illinoian glaciation. This region of North America, {{known as the}} Driftless Area, was totally {{surrounded}} by ice during Wisconsin glaciation, but the area itself was not glaciated. The result is an unusually hilly landscape with <b>deeply</b> carved river valleys.|$|E
