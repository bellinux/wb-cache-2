The reel is of a standard size and its revolutions are counted as the yarn is wrapped around it. Typically, a set number of revolutions will be used so that the hank is of a standard size — a skein or lea. For example, a skein of cotton would be 80 turns on a reel of 54 inches circumference, making 120 yards, while the standard length for wool worsted would be 80 yards.|$|R

40|$|Woven fabric as {{composite}} reinforcement {{structure has}} been profoundly investigated to be utilized in automotive, aircraft, agriculture, furniture and defense industry application. Woven fabrics are formed in particular by interlacing of yarns {{to form a}} fabric layer. This interlacing of fiber bundle offered advantages in terms of good dimensional stability and high packing density. Due to environmental issues, woven fabric sourced from natural fiber (NF) had gained greater attention. However the methods of woven preparation by means of NF yarns {{were found to be}} very limited. Most of the study is focusing on woven structure from fiber strand and it was prepared without specific device. Hence, the challenge addressed in the previous works had triggered research in designing and developing a weaving <b>device</b> suitable <b>for</b> <b>yarns</b> of thick and coarse natural fibers. In this research, a tabletop natural fiber weaving device was designed and fabricated which capable to weave NF yarns with different fabric degree of tightness.

The complete system comprises of <b>yarn</b> <b>guides</b> and tension control device, motor with gear box, monitor <b>for</b> displaying <b>yarn</b> parameters etc. The system enables to develop yarn diameter spectrogram and neps count present in the yarn in a single unit. The performance of the developed system is free from any fluctuation of ambient temperature or humidity. The available results are verified with that available from a powerful microscope. Results are available on the monitor showing diameter spectrogram calculated for a specific length of the yarn, counters displaying the number of neps available in that <b>yarn</b> <b>for</b> that specific length.

40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the yarn layer carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages <b>for</b> different <b>yarn</b> orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage <b>for</b> the oriented <b>yarns,</b> a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> openings at the layer, and the <b>yarn</b> <b>guides</b> (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The yarn layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The yarn layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to <b>guide</b> the weft <b>yarns,</b> to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|R
