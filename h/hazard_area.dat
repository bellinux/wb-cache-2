25|$|Class 4 is {{the highest}} and most {{dangerous}} class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class3B AEL. By definition, a class4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage {{as a result of}} direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite combustible materials, and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the beam path. Class4 lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular <b>hazard</b> <b>area</b> (NOHA).|$|E

5000|$|North Carolina {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{progressive}} states when it comes to addressing hurricane related land-use issues. This is probably because the state has received the second most direct hurricane strikes in the US. North Carolina pairs strong regional coastal management with intelligent hazard mitigation efforts to create an effective statewide emergency management program. It is important to initiate these actions during the recovery phase of a disaster in order to prevent repeat tragedies and wasted tax dollars. These mitigation efforts paired with restrictions on hard beach structures protect the natural ability of a coastal region to maintain itself, and protects future coastal developments. As a result of the federally mandated Coastal Zone Management Program, North Carolina passed CAMA, both of which produced a number of hurricane mitigation efforts in North Carolina. The Albemarle-Pamilico watershed is part of the National Estuary Program. CAMA requires a review and approval by an appropriate government body for areas designated as [...] "Areas of Environment Concern" [...] (AEC). These include estuarine <b>areas</b> and ocean <b>hazard</b> <b>areas.</b> Within the ocean <b>hazard</b> <b>areas</b> category of AECs are ocean erodible zones, high <b>hazard</b> flood <b>areas,</b> and inlet <b>hazard</b> <b>areas.</b> Each of these zones have general regulations that establish setbacks, erosion control projects, dune stabilization, and prevents all development in some areas.
