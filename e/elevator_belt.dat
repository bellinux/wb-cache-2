5000|$|Material {{transport}} elevators generally {{consist of}} an inclined plane {{on which a}} conveyor belt runs. The conveyor often includes partitions {{to ensure that the}} material moves forward. These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications. When such mechanisms (or spiral screws or pneumatic transport) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos, the entire structure is called a grain <b>elevator.</b> <b>Belt</b> elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of bulk carriers ...|$|E
50|$|In 1973, MRF started {{manufacturing}} Nylon tyres for {{the first}} time. The Company entered into with a technical know-how collaboration with B.FGoodrich in 1978. The Mansfield Tire & Rubber Co sold out its share in 1979 {{and the name of}} the company was changed to MRF Ltd in the year. The company finalized a technical collaboration agreement with Marangoni TRS SPA, Italy for the manufacture of pre-cured tread rubber for retreading industry. MRF tyres supplied tyres to Maruti 800, India's first modern small car. In 1989, the company collaborated with Hasbro International United States, the world's largest toy maker and launched Funskool India. Also, they entered into a pact with Vapocure of Australia to manufacture polyurethane paint formulations and with Italian tyre manufacturer Pirelli for conveyor and <b>elevator</b> <b>belt</b> manufacture. During the year 2004-05, the product range of the company expanded with Go-kart & rally tyres and tyres for two/three wheelers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} of hybrid systems with mode {{dynamics of}} different dimensions is described. The first part gives some deterministic {{examples of such}} multi-mode multi-dimensional (M 3 D) systems. The second part considers such models under sequential switching at random times. More specifically, the backward Kolmogorov equation is derived, and Lie-algebraic methods {{are used in the}} case where the modes are linear. For Poissonian switched equi-dimensional modes, the diffusion limit and its implication in vibrational stability are studied. The motion of a pebble on an <b>elevator</b> <b>belt</b> is given as an example...|$|E

50|$|Today {{there are}} {{different}} types of conveyor belts that have been created for conveying different kinds of material available in PVC and rubber materials. Material flowing over the belt may be weighed in transit using a beltweigher. Belts with regularly spaced partitions, known as <b>elevator</b> <b>belts,</b> are used for transporting loose materials up steep inclines. Belt Conveyors are used in self-unloading bulk freighters and in live bottom trucks. Belt conveyor technology is also used in conveyor transport such as moving sidewalks or escalators, {{as well as on}} many manufacturing assembly lines. Stores often have conveyor belts at the check-out counter to move shopping items. Ski areas also use conveyor belts to transport skiers up the hill.|$|R
5000|$|A bean harvester, {{also known}} as a bean {{thresher}} or bean combine, is a threshing machine which is used to harvest beans. It mainly consists of a pickup, several beaters, shakers, one or several fans, <b>elevators,</b> conveyor <b>belts,</b> a storage bin, and usually a spreader at the rear. Until recently, the only practical manufacturer of bean harvesters was The Bidwell Bean Thresher Company.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of discrete element simulations applied to a bucket elevator model with particular reference to the head pulley transition zone. This is the first stage in a larger study to better understand the mechanics of bucket elevator operation with reference to the discharge of particles at the head end. At the head end two issues arise; mechanically, the buckets are bolted to the conveying media (typically a fabric reinforced belt) and at the point of belt to headpulley tangency, the tip of the bucket undergoes a theoretical step change in velocity. This theoretical step change results in a classical under-damped response in the buckets tip velocity. In undergoing this motion, there are stresses that are passed to the carcass of the conveying media; understanding the magnitude of these stresses is one longer term goal of this research allowing a quantitative basis for the existing qualitative design guidelines such as (Handbook for conveyor and <b>elevator</b> <b>belting,</b> Apex Belting Pty Ltd). The discharge of the bulk material from the bucket has been addressed Beverly et al. (Bulk Solids Handling, 1983) but this analysis is dependent on simple, but common, bucket geometry and ignores the initial transition to the headpulley. Ignoring the transition with a low speed discharge elevator is not likely to impact on the predicted discharge pattern, however with high speed discharge elevators, the destabilising effect of the transition is expected to promote premature discharge of bulk material from the bucket. Depending on the design of the elevator casing this early discharge may or may not impact on the overall conveying efficiency...|$|R

25|$|In the mid 1780s Oliver Evans {{invented a}} fully {{automatic}} mill that could process grain with practically no human labor or operator attention. This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used bucket <b>elevators</b> and conveyor <b>belts,</b> which would eventually revolutionize materials handling, and 2) it used governors, a forerunner of modern automation, for control.|$|R
40|$|The Automated Product Delivery System (APDS) was {{developed}} to address a need in industrial manufacturing for {{a simple way to}} transfer materials between areas of a manufacturing environment. At the moment, most equipment used for such a task consist of some type of fixed system, such as conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>elevators,</b> etc. While adequate, they are not easily adaptable to any changes in their environment. Therefore, an automated unit would seem to be more successful in such an application...|$|R

50|$|Many renovations and reconstructions {{have taken}} place since the first major {{activities}} {{took place in the}} late 1950s. One of the first was funded by the Volkswagen company in Wolfsburg and later in 1972 by the community of Wendhausen {{with the help of the}} county of Braunschweig. Additional damage to the windmill came in 1975 during a storm when the windmill failed to turn into the wind and the sails were damaged. In 1980, the land and mill were purchased by the Municipality of Lehre and an association was founded by local citizens and politicians to preserve and promote the windmill. For the 150th anniversary in 1987, extensive restoration work on the milling operation, <b>elevators,</b> motor, <b>belt</b> protective cover were completed to demonstrate the millstone operation. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, continual renovations took place and many parts replaced and updated. Additional funds came from the greater European Community, the state of Lower Saxony, LB Public Foundation, and the United Brunswick monastery and study funds.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{treatment}} cycle {{will begin}} with the loading of unsorted waste material and end in the offload of a dry powder (product), which now possesses new characteristics and that the input material did not. The garbage is loaded into a chamber, also the conversion cell, by hand or {{through the use of}} a loading <b>elevator</b> or conveyor <b>belt,</b> depending on the application and toxicity/danger level associated with handling the waste. The previous batch of post-treatment product is removed and a new cycle is started through an electronic control panel. Modern converters are fully automatic and will finish the computer controlled cycle autonomously, unless a failure occurs.|$|R
40|$|The report {{presents}} {{results of}} the project {{in the field of}} qualitative and quantitative losses reduction possibilities during grain crops treatment and storage in agricultural enterprise. Part 1 presents summarised overview of the grain damage results during different methods of its transport by auger or belt conveyers and during pneumatic transport. After the conducted analysis can be stated, that the auger conveyers have rather tendency to the total mechanical damage than to creation of fractions in contrary to the bucket <b>elevators.</b> The <b>belt</b> conveyers are friendly to the transported grain and are suitable particularly for grain horizontal transport in lines for grain reception, treatment and storage. The pneumatic conveyers can be used for grain transport in the feed mixtures production plants because they needs more energy. Part 2 presents results of CO_ 2 concentration effect on stored maize quality. The maize grain harvested at higher moisture similarly like feeding grain of higher moisture or pea and other commodities for feeding mixtures production can be stored within 1 year in very good quality when all rules for their storage is maintained.

40|$|Electrical drives play an {{important}} role in rapidly growing industrial era, so the controlling of electrical drives is also important. Variable speed drives are the major part of power system, microelectronic, power plant and so on. Conventional controlling methods of electrical drives needed mathematical model of control process which was very tedious, that problem is solved by artificial intelligence which contains both hard computation and soft computation. Artificial intelligence has found high application in most nonlinear systems same as motor drive. As no mathematical model is needed for artificial intelligent system so efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of drives decrease. Soft starters are widely used with electronic motor as it provides improved operating characteristics and better control. Soft starter also reduces the wear and tear effects on motor and their associated drive systems which in turn reduces maintenance, conserve energy and plays a significant part in improving system performance so the escalators, pumps, <b>elevators</b> and conveyor <b>belts</b> can be operated more effectively with soft starter...|$|R

With this manner, efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of them decrease. Due to the improved operating characteristics they give to the equipment control, electronic motor soft starters are increasingly widely applied. Escalators, pumps, <b>elevators</b> and conveyor <b>belts</b> all operate more effectively if they are soft started. However, it is not simply the ergonomics of an airport, process plant or shopping mall that are improved by soft starters. A major factor in the growth in popularity of soft starters is the reduced wear and tear that they place on motors and their associated drive systems. In turn, this reduces maintenance, conserves energy and plays a significant part in improving plant performance and operating costs...|$|R
5000|$|Jamie King {{joined the}} tour on 2 May 2008 in Manchester, England. Before that date, {{the show was}} not on a central stage (except in Japan) for {{logistics}} reasons. After {{two and a half}} months, Dion rehearsed again to perfect the show for the [...] "in the round" [...] setup. Because of Dion's bilingual career and the restrictions of certain arenas and stadiums on the tour, King had to direct and choreograph three separate shows. One show featured a set-list mostly of English-language songs, and was performed in-the-round using the full system of mobile screens, <b>elevators,</b> and conveyor <b>belts.</b> A second show also featured the center stage arrangement, but included about ten French language songs for performances in Francophone countries. A third, less complex show was used where the center stage arrangement would not fit into the venue or where it would be impractical to transport the stage. An end stage setup was used in these cases, and featured a massive central video screen and a lighting system that engulfed the stage in brilliant blue and red from above on all three sides. Before the European leg, the central and end stage setups were redone, changing lights and cues, in order for the three separate shows to fit in these two stages. Dion premiered new costumes when the European tour began.|$|R
5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside bucket elevators, floors of enclosed areas containing grinding equipment and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside bucket elevators can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these bucket elevators purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. Bucket elevators must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These bucket elevators must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the <b>elevator</b> when the <b>belt</b> speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards. All filter collectors installed after March 1988 shall be located outside the facility or located in an area inside the facility protected by an explosion suppression system or located in an area that is separated from other areas by construction having at least a one-hour fire resistance rating and which is located next to an exterior wall vented to the outside.Install an effective means of removing ferrous material from grain streams so that such material does not enter equipment such as hammer mills, grinders and pulverizers.|$|R
