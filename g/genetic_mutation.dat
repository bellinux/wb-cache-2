5|$|A mutant with uncharted telepathic powers, {{and founder}} of Xavier's Institute for Gifted Mutants. Xavier is an {{authority}} on <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> and an advocate of peaceful relations between human and mutant kind. Stewart signed to the film without knowing Xavier would die, and not meeting original director Matthew Vaughn – both would meet in Manchester, where Stewart was filming Eleventh Hour, but eventually Brett Ratner called to introduce himself as the new director.|$|E
5|$|The film also rescues {{a central}} concept in the comics, {{the fact that}} {{radiation}} {{is one of the}} causes of <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> in the X-Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in the last years, as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.|$|E

5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name refers {{to the fact that}} it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset is the result of a <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx and Dumbo. The Dumbo, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for resemblance to the fictional Dumbo the Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation,</b> and was named for the Manx cat, which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation.|$|E
5|$|Goldfish, {{domestication}} of: In ancient China, {{various species}} of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) were domesticated {{and have been}} reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species {{have a tendency to}} produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420). During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. Goldfish were introduced into Europe during the 17th century, and into North America in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are an all-white, {{medium-sized}} sheep, prolific {{and able}} to breed out of season. The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece, which is free from dark fibers. Since its development, the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets. Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting. The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset, but that breed did not start as a <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation.</b> Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.|$|E

Thus, the interpretation of family-specific <b>genetic</b> <b>mutations</b> and/or network-level disruptions in the onset of a rare psychiatric disorder requires careful consideration of the motivations of participants included in the study.|$|R

5000|$|New {{ideas have}} a {{striking}} similarity to <b>genetic</b> <b>mutations.</b> Now, {{let us look}} {{for a moment at}} <b>genetic</b> <b>mutations.</b> Mutations are, it seems, brought about by quantum theoretical indeterminacy (including radiation effects). Accordingly, they are also probabilistic and not in themselves originally selected or adequate, but on them there subsequently operates natural selection which eliminates inappropriate mutations. Now we could conceive of a similar process with respect to new ideas and to free-will decisions, and similar things.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{discovers that}} the {{surgical}} staple gun was tampered with. The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one {{was given to}} Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third staple gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai trees on the staple guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen tampered with the staple guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up. Ethan and Curtis find out that Jessica had a <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> that caused a blood clot, so Ethan warns Karen that she might also have one. Megan confronts Gwen, who confesses to Megan. Gwen is eventually taken away by the police, after admitting to George's attempted, and Ted's accidental murder.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation</b> that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E

25|$|Presently it is {{relatively}} easy to characterise a specific antithrombin <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation.</b> However prior to the use of modern characterisation techniques investigators named mutations for the town or city where the individual suffering from the deficiency resided i.e. the antithrombin mutation was designated a toponym. Modern mutational characterisation has since shown that many individual antithrombin toponyms are actually the result of the same <b>genetic</b> <b>mutation,</b> for example Antithrombin-Toyama, is equivalent to Antihrombin-Kumamoto, -Amien, -Tours, -Paris-1, -Paris-2, -Alger, -Padua-2 and -Barcelona.|$|E
