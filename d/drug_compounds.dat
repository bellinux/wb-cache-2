2500|$|A {{proof-of-concept}} {{of using}} induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) to generate human organ for transplantation was reported by researchers from Japan. [...] Human ‘liver buds’ (iPSC-LBs) were grown from a mixture of three different kinds of stem cells: hepatocytes (for liver function) coaxed from iPSCs; endothelial stem cells (to form lining of blood vessels) from umbilical cord blood; and mesenchymal stem cells (to form connective tissue). This new approach allows different cell types to self-organize into a complex organ, mimicking the process in fetal development. [...] After growing in vitro for a few days, the liver buds were transplanted into mice where the ‘liver’ quickly connected with the host blood vessels and continued to grow. [...] Most importantly, it performed regular liver functions including metabolizing drugs and producing liver-specific proteins. [...] Further studies will monitor the longevity of the transplanted organ in the host body (ability to integrate or avoid rejection) and whether it will transform into tumors. [...] Using this method, cells from one mouse could be used to test 1,000 <b>drug</b> <b>compounds</b> to treat liver disease, and reduce animal use by up to 50,000.|$|E
