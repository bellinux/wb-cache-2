On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E

5000|$|He {{also held}} U.S. patent number 1,507,111 (September 2, 1924) for “a new and useful Lens System for Galilean Telescopes.” In {{previous}} lens systems for <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescopes,</b> “the {{elimination of the}} image defects was generally confined to {{the removal of the}} chromatic longitudinal aberration and the chromatic difference in magnification {{as well as to the}} elimination of the astigmatism for a certain definite locus of the eye.” But “a faultless image outside the axis can only be attained by simultaneously eliminating for the whole telescope the spherical longitudinal aberration and the condition of sine.” These requirements were fulfilled by the invention in question, in which the astigmatic difference no longer depended “so largely from the locus of the eye, as such has been the case in the <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescopes</b> hitherto known.” This was achieved by “making the objective consist of two collective members, each of which is composed of two cemented lenses, of which the one having the lower refractive index is facing the incident light, and by composing the ocular of three cemented lenses, the inner one being a flint lens.” ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the rehabilitative process and visual rehabilitation outcomes in patients with central vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Ninety-five subjects with AMD selected from the attendees of the National Centre of Services and Research for the Prevention of Blindness and Rehabilitation of Low Vision Patients—International Agency for Prevention of Blindness—IAPB Italia Onlus, were evaluated for this retrospective study. Low vision examination included psychological counseling, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), near visual acuity, Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity, and fixation stability analysis. Once the clinical assessment was completed, patients attended a low-vision rehabilitative pathway based on visual stimulation, devices training and, if needed, psychological support. Required magnification and reading speed were also evaluated. RESULTS: For the whole sample, the mean BCVA of the better eye was 0. 7 (± 0. 2) LogMAR and of the worse eye was 1 (± 0. 2) LogMAR. Restoring read-ing ability was the most important focus for the patients examined as it was requested by 85 % of the whole sample. Mean power of optical magnifying aids for near activities was 10. 6 (± 9. 1) positive spherical diopters. Mean reading speed for the whole sample was 33. 1 (± 18. 2) words per minute (wpm) before visual rehabilitation sessions and increased to 55. 2 (± 33. 1) wpm after visual rehabilitation path. To cope with distance difficulties, 78 distance refractive correction, 10 <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescopes,</b> and 7 Keplerian telescopes were prescribed. For intermediate distance activities, 22 compensation lenses and 10 <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescopes</b> were suggested. Moreover, PC magnifier softwares were prescribed to nine patients.

50|$|The design Galileo Galilei used in 1609 is {{commonly}} called a <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope.</b> It used a convergent (plano-convex) objective lens and a divergent (plano-concave) eyepiece lens (Galileo, 1610).

50|$|Besides {{combining}} a Keplerian telescope with a camera, {{there are}} also dedicated secondary lens afocal attachments that mount {{on the front of}} a camera lens to work in the role of a teleconverter, technically called teleside converters. These lenses are usually <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescopes</b> that alter the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio. There are models that are 6x or 8x and even Russian made 12x to 14x Gregorian maksutov designs that can be used as long lenses and microscopes. Like their Keplerian counterparts these can be universally adapted to most camera lenses with the proper type of adapter.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 17th century the modern {{version of the}} Duhem-Quine thesis had not been formulated, but commonsense {{objections}} to such elaborate and ad hoc implicit auxiliary assumptions certainly could be urged. To begin with, the mechanism of the (<b>Galilean)</b> <b>telescopes</b> had been {{explained in terms of}} geometrical optics {{and the nature of the}} objects that they imaged was consistent; for example a distant lake would not resemble a tree when seen through a telescope. The behaviour of telescopes on Earth denied any basis for arguing that they could create systematic artefacts in the sky, such as apparent satellites that behaved in the predictable manner of Jovian moons. Evidence also offered no basis to suggest that they could present yet other, more elaborate artefacts, fundamentally different from the satellites, such as Lunar mountains that cast shadows varying consistently with the direction of Solar illumination.|$|R

5000|$|Galileo greatly {{improved}} [...] on these designs the following year, and is generally credited {{as the first}} to use a telescope for astronomy. Galileo's telescope used Hans Lippershey's design of a convex objective lens and a concave eye lens, and this design is now called a <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope.</b> Johannes Kepler proposed an improvement on the design that used a convex eyepiece, often called the Keplerian Telescope.|$|E
5000|$|Galileo's {{objective}} lens {{is a specific}} {{objective lens}} held in the Museo Galileo, Florence, Italy. It was used by Galileo Galilei in the <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope</b> with which he discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter in 1610. The lens has a diameter of 38mm and a gilt brass housing. The frame is made of ebony and ivory and has dimensions of 410mm x 300mm.|$|E
50|$|Galileo’s best {{telescope}} magnified objects about 30 times. Because of {{flaws in}} its design, {{such as the}} shape of the lens and the narrow field of view, the images were blurry and distorted. Despite these flaws, the telescope was still good enough for Galileo to explore the sky. The <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope</b> could view the phases of Venus, and was able to see craters on the Moon and four moons orbiting Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|Spectacle mounted {{telescopic}} {{systems have}} been prescribed for visual impairment, providing magnified images of objects at farther distances. Typically, bioptic telescopes are mounted {{toward the top of}} spectacle lenses or above the frame with the telescope eyepiece positioned above the eye's pupil. This allows the wearer to alternate between the magnified narrow field of view available through the eyepiece and the unmagnified wide view through the carrier lens using head motion. The main obstacles to acceptance are the obvious appearance, limited field of the smaller <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescopes,</b> and weight of the larger Keplerian telescopes. We designed a spectacle-mounted wide-field Keplerian telescope built completely inside the spectacle lens. The design uses embedded mirrors inside the carrier lens for optical pathway folding and conventional lenses or curved mirrors. The small size of the ocular and its position with additional mirror tilt enable the user to view the magnified field simultaneously and above the unmagnified view of the uninterrupted horizontal field that is important for user's safety. This design enables the construction of cosmetic telescopes that can be produced as a commodity lens blank and surfaced to include the patient prescription. These devices may be also of utility in military and civilian use...|$|R
40|$|A 2. 5 × Selsi {{achromatic}} <b>Galilean</b> focusable <b>telescope</b> was calibrated for refraction at 6 m. In its calibration, minus power trial lens {{was placed}} at {{the objective of the}} telescope to simulate vergence of a target at a finite distance, before the back vertex power (BVP) of the telescope at each setting (telescope length) was measured by a focimeter. By using a graphical presentation of the results, the BVP of the telescope at each setting could be determined at different selected target distances. For a target vergence of − 0. 167 D or a distance of 6 m, the common testing distance in clinical practice, this calibrated telescope had a BVP or refraction measuring range of − 7. 27 –+ 7. 52 D. When this telescope was used to measure simulated manifest refractive errors at 6 m, it yielded a mean error of + 0. 13 D with a 95 % confidence limit of agreement of − 0. 38 –+ 0. 64 D. These results indicated that the accuracy and precision of telescopic refraction were comparable to that of retinoscopy. Therefore, the calibrated telescope could be considered as a reliable and inexpensive instrument for determining spherical refractive errors. Telescopic refraction is applicable in refracting economically disadvantaged population in under-served areas where modern equipment and electricity are not available. In addition, it provides an alternative subjective refraction method for low vision population because the magnification of this calibrated telescope has the advantage of allowing low vision patients to be refracted at the common 6 m testing distance in clinical practice.

50|$|An afocal {{attachment}} is a {{more sophisticated}} supplementary lens. It is a so-called <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope</b> accessory mounted {{to the front of}} a lens that alters the lens' effective focal length without moving the focal plane. There are two types: the telephoto and the wide angle. The telephoto type is a front positive plus rear negative cell combination that increases the image size; the wide angle has a front negative and rear positive arrangement to reduce the image size. Both have cell separation equal to cell focal length difference to maintain the focal plane.|$|E
5000|$|Telescopic beam {{expanders}} include refracting {{and reflective}} telescopes. [...] A refracting telescope commonly used is the <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope</b> which can {{function as a}} simple beam expander for collimated light. The main advantage of the Galilean design is that it never focuses a collimated beam to a point, so effects associated with high power density such as dielectric breakdown are more avoidable than with focusing designs such as the Keplerian telescope. When used as intracavity beam expanders, in laser resonators, these telescopes provide two-dimensional beam expansion in the 20-50 range.|$|E

50|$|A teleside {{converter}} (also {{known as}} a telephoto conversion lens or a front mount teleconverter) is a secondary lens which is mounted {{on the front of}} a photographic lens to increase the effective focal length of the lens they are attached to. They are used on cameras and video cameras with non-interchangeable lenses to increase the magnification of the image. Their design is usually that of an afocal <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope</b> that alters the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio. The down side to teleside converters is they will vignette the image on the wide angle setting if used on a zoom lens. Minimum Focal Length without vignetting will increase inline with higher power of the teleside converter. Before vignetting appears (four black corners), light fall-off will appear first and in general shooting this light fall-off may not be noticeable. The other concern is Minimum Working Distance, so the teleside converter cannot be used below minimum working distance and it depends on both the camera and the teleside converter being used.|$|E

40|$|VisionCare has {{developed}} and tested the first Implantable Miniaturized Telescope (IMT) for low vision. A small optical device with a configuration of a <b>Galilean</b> <b>telescope</b> is implanted {{in place of}} the crystalline lens. The IMT is inserted and held in position using a surgical procedure similar to a standard intraocular lens. Together with the cornea, the IMT acts as a telephoto lens that is in focus at a distance of 50 cm. For closer and further distance views, eyeglasses are needed. A nominal magnification of 3. 05 is achieved with the IMT. Even though higher relative distance magnification power may be provided with additional low diopter eyeglasses, distance vision may be provided also with negative lenses in the spectacles. The main advantage of the IMT over a spectacle or head-mounted low-vision telescope is the flexibility afforded by the ability to scan reading materials and other images using natural eye scanning movements. The fact that the magnification is in the eye completely eliminates the increased speed of motion and vestibular conflict, which impedes the use of other head-mounted low-vision telescopes. The IMT is designed for monocular use in patients with bilateral acuity loss due to macular diseases and other retinal pathologies. Prototype telescopes were built and tested to meet the specifications for 3. 05 magnification, a 6. 6 º visual field (20 º on retina), and excellent optical quality. The effective field of view of the IMT is much wider than an equivalent head mounted telescope, as scanning with eye movements only is required. Preliminary results of clinical trials are reported here...|$|E
