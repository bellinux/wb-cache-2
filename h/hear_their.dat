5|$|In August 2008, {{during the}} Democratic National Convention in Denver, Rage headlined the free Tent State Music Festival to End the War. The band was {{supported}} by Flobots, State Radio, Jello Biafra, and Wayne Kramer. Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans Against the War, led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a 6-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a 4-hour stand-off with police, Obama's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> demands.|$|E
5|$|In Islam: The Untold Story, Holland {{deals with}} {{the origins of the}} {{religion}} Islam. Travelling to Saudi Arabia, he visits Arabian Bedouins to <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> orthodox Islamic accounts of the religion's origins. Holland then talks to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a practising Muslim who teaches Islamic studies at the George Washington University, Washington D.C., and Patricia Crone, a non-Muslim historian of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The former defends the orthodox Islamic account of the faith's history, citing its development within oral history, but Crone challenges the reliability of oral history, and therefore the traditional account.|$|E
5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which {{was adopted by the}} Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions. Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> public grievances.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, 1832, {{a supply}} wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon. Around this time, Black Hawk and his 200-man war party also {{en route to}} the fort, had {{gathered}} at a gap in Terrapin Ridge. Black Hawk's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire. At around 4 p.m. four couriers from Galena bound for the army camp at Dixon's Ferry arrived at the fort. The fort's occupants were eager to <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> news from Galena and of the conflict with Black Hawk.|$|E

We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev was {{adept at}} the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He {{was a team}} player and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing to <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position equivalent to that of an executive president. While Kosygin remained Premier until {{shortly before his death}} in 1980 (replaced by Nikolai Tikhonov as Premier), Brezhnev was the dominant driving force of the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s to his death in 1982.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} days of the shutdown, many {{programs}} requested that their funding continue, especially social service organizations that relied on state funding. To <b>hear</b> <b>their</b> pleas, the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen Blatz as a special master. Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when the shutdown began, asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue. Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7, finding that some programs could start again, including criminal background checks, public schools, and local government aid. Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open. Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo, which asked to remain open despite the shutdown, and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee. While both pay for themselves at least during the summer, Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations, so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day.|$|E

25|$|The Chapel of Reconciliation is {{somewhat}} unusual in that no masses or other services take place there; instead it is given over {{entirely to the}} Sacrament of Reconciliation.
