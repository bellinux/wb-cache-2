5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.

5|$|The Belgians much {{preferred}} {{an alliance}} with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War {{in response to the}} German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its own interests, alone if necessary.|$|E
5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury {{that means they}} can no longer serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, using it as a time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E
5|$|After making six {{successful}} {{defenses of}} the World Boxing Organization (WBO) light welterweight title, Cotto moved up in weight class to the welterweight division and defeated Carlos Quintana on December 2, 2006 {{to win the}} World Boxing Association (WBA) welterweight title. Cotto's first title defense came against mandatory challenger Oktay Urkal in a bout that took place on March 3, 2007, at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A mandatory challenger is a boxer who is chosen by a boxing organization to <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> title. If the champion decides not to defend the title against the mandatory challenger, the boxing organization strips him of his title. In attendance for the bout was former undisputed welterweight champion Zab Judah, who {{was expected to be}} Cotto's next opponent as long as Cotto defeated Urkal and Judah won his fight in April. Cotto displayed a dominant performance against Urkal, eventually to the point where Urkal's corner retired in the eleventh round. On April 13, 2007, Judah's match with journeyman boxer Ruben Galvan ended in a no contest after a severe cut opened up around Galvan's hairline, which was ruled to have been caused by Judah's elbow. Despite the no contest, the bout between Cotto and Judah went ahead as planned, taking place at Madison Square Garden in New York City on June 9, 2007. In front of a sellout crowd of 20,658, Cotto defeated Judah by technical knockout in the eleventh round.|$|E
