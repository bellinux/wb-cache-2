Of the total impermeable area in the three layouts the portion attributable to streets ranges from 48 to 65 percent with the fused grid occupying the low end.

Draining a {{watershed}} of 8.2 sq mi, the lower {{portions of the}} stream were modified according to the local land uses, initially agriculture, and in the 1950s, suburban development. This involved straightening of the stream and elimination of wetlands and the reclamation of the former Lake Mathilda at the lower western zone with landfill. These changes, coupled with an increase of <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface</b> in the watershed has caused an increase in peak runoff levels, flooding and erosion of deeply incised channels up to 16 ft deep.

50|$|The {{field of}} EAPs {{is far from}} mature, which leaves several issues that {{still need to be}} worked on. The {{performance}} and long-term stability of the EAP should be improved by designing a water <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface.</b> This will prevent the evaporation of water contained in the EAP, and also reduce the potential loss of the positive counter ions when the EAP is operating submerged in an aqueous environment. Improved surface conductivity should be explored using methods to produce a defect-free conductive surface. This could possibly be done using metal vapor deposition or other doping methods. It may also be possible to utilize conductive polymers to form a thick conductive layer. Heat resistant EAP would be desirable to allow operation at higher voltages without damaging the internal structure of the EAP due to the generation of heat in the EAP composite. Development of EAPs in different configurations (e.g., fibers and fiber bundles), would also be beneficial, in order to increase the range of possible modes of motion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{geographical}} {{position of the}} Jukskei River in the built-up and densely populated landscape, it has been historically subject to many water quality problems, particularly of bacterial nature, {{as well as from}} other pollution sources. At one stage, between 1995 and 2005, this river was subject to increasing pH levels and variable concentrations of sulphates, potassium, phosphates and nitrates. The potential for flooding and changes in water quality are expected to have a direct correlation to the changes in surface coverage of the built environment surrounding the Jukskei River. Major storm water management concerns have arisen in urban areas as a result of increased severity and frequency of flooding, with detrimental consequences for society and the environment. There is therefore a dire need to constantly monitor water quality, as the pollution loads gathered in the Jukskei channel ultimately reach the Hartbeespoort Dam, which is already in a state of high eutrophication. In responding to these water management challenges, it is crucial to understand the relationship between land use change, rainfall trends and water quality, so that storm water runoff can be managed effectively and efficiently. Data which was obtained from the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) for the 28 year period from 1986 to 2014, shows overall concentrations of pollutants for three sites (Site A, Site B and Site C) along the Jukskei River. This correlates inversely to the increases in average water flows at these sites. The increased water flow and increased urban land use coverage over the period may be responsible for the decrease in pollutant concentrations at these sites. The reasons for the more marked decrease in pollutant concentrations at Site A than Site B may be that Site A is located downstream of Site B. This could be due to the increased incidence of development-related <b>impermeable</b> <b>surfaces</b> occurring in close proximity to Site B, whereas Site A is further from the urban edge. It appears that an increase in the area of <b>impermeable</b> <b>surfaces</b> over time is negatively correlated with pollutant concentrations. This would imply that increased <b>impermeable</b> <b>surfaces</b> provide increased flow into the Jukskei River and therefore allow for the dilution of pollutants entering this river. This negative correlation is expected to continue into the future and the dilution effect may possibly be enhanced with increased development of <b>impermeable</b> <b>surfaces</b> within Johannesburg, depending on other water quality inputs.

40|$|Until 2006, State of North Carolina {{stormwater}} officials considered permeable pavements {{to behave}} {{as if they were}} standard impermeable pavement, giving developers little incentive to use permeable pavement. Several studies, conducted by NC State University faculty since 1999, have led state officials to recently grant permeable pavements runoff reduction credit in the Sandhills and the sandy Coastal Plain. The state’s change of position is based upon research described in this paper. Equivalent grass percentages are employed by the state to count permeable pavement as if it were 40 % <b>impermeable</b> <b>surfaces</b> and 60 % permeable surfaces. The “ 60 % credit ” allows a developer to count only 40 % of permeable pavement as built upon area. Because of the credit, developers are now able to avoid installing other, more costly, stormwater practices such as wet ponds. 1.

50|$|On May 11 the Kasson Planning and Zoning Commission in a 6-1 vote {{recommended}} that the city council approve a conditional use permit (CUP) for the school property to allow multifamily housing on the site. The commission also {{recommended that}} the city council approve a variance to allow less than 50 percent green space on the property. The general consensus was that the project, which would remove some paved areas, increased permeability over the existing condition. The room was packed with people. Tom Anderson from Cohen-Esrey made a presentation. Before voting, the commission debated how {{to strike a balance}} with the citizens and neighbors of the building who opposed the project and those supporting the school's reuse. Neighbors who opposed the project stated the density of 24 multi-family units was too large for the single family residential neighborhood. Concerns about additional traffic and other issues were also discussed. However, Minnesota law states that a CUP cannot be denied based on citizen input if the CUP application meets the requirements listed in the city code. In the end the Commission decided that the CUP application met the approval requirements listed in the cities' code and the variance was approved allowing the installation of <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface</b> over 60% of the property. The Planning Commission put the following conditions on the CUP:1.

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{propagation}} of time harmonic circumferential waves in a two-dimensional hollow poroelastic cylinder with an inner shaft (shaft-bearing assembly). The hollow poroelastic cylinder and inner shaft {{are assumed to be}} infinite in axial direction. The outer surface of the cylinder is stress free and at the interface, between the inner shaft and the outer cylinder, it is assumed to be free sliding and the interfacial shear stresses are zero, also the normal stress and radial displacements are continuous. The frequency equation of guided circumferential waves for a permeable and an <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface</b> is obtained. When the angular wave number vanish the frequency equation of guided circumferential waves for a permeable and an <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface</b> degenerates and the dilatational and shear waves are uncoupled. Shear waves are independent of the nature of surface. The frequency equation of a permeable and an <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface</b> for bore-piston assembly is obtained as a particular case of the model under consideration when the outer radius of the hollow poroelastic cylinder tends to infinity. Results of previous studies are obtained as a particular case of the present study. Nondimensional frequency as a function of wave number is presented graphically for two types of models and discussed. Numerical results show that, in general, the first modes are linear for permeable and impermeable surfaces and the frequency of a permeable surface is more than that of an <b>impermeable</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E
