A basic reader simply sends card numbers to a panel and does not control an {{electric}} lock, <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> or exit button. If the control panel fails, the basic reader stops working. An IP reader has inputs for monitoring a <b>door</b> <b>contact,</b> exit button and a relay for controlling an electric lock.

50|$|Dual-loop {{allows the}} burglar alarm control panel {{to read the}} values of end-of-line {{resistors}} {{for the purpose of}} telling a zone's status. For example: if an alarm system's software uses 2K ohms as its non-alarm value, an inactive detector will give a reading of 2K ohms as the circuit is passing through just one resistor. When the detector goes into an active state (i.e. a <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> being opened), the circuit path has been altered and it must now pass through a second resistor wired in series with the first. This gives a reading of 4K ohms and will trigger an intruder alarm. If a resistance reading is not recognised by the system either due to short-circuit or open-circuit, an anti-tamper alarm will trigger.|$|E

In concrete, the test environment was the office kitchen of the Institute of Computer Technology (ICT) at the Vienna University of Technology [33, 34]. The kitchen comprises a table with eight chairs and a kitchen cabinet including a stove, a sink, a dishwasher, and a coffee machine. For testing the recognition model, the kitchen was equipped with sensors of different types: tactile floor sensors, motion detectors, <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> sensors, window contacts, light barriers, temperature sensors, a humidity sensor, brightness sensors, a microphone, and a camera. From these sensor data, different scenarios had to be perceived following the information processing principles proposed in Section 4.1.

40|$|The {{automatic}} detection of anomalies in Active and Assisted Living (AAL) environments {{is important for}} monitoring the wellbeing and safety of the elderly at home. The integration of smart domotic sensors (e. g. presence detectors) with those ones equipping modern mobile robots (e. g. RGBD camera) provides new opportunities for addressing this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to combine local activity levels detected by a single RGBD camera with the global activity perceived by a network of domotic sensors. Our approach relies on a new method for computing such a global activity using various presence detectors, based {{on the concept of}} entropy from information theory. This entropy effectively shows how active a particular room or environment’s area is. The solution includes also a new application of Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) to merge different information sources for local and global anomaly detection. The system has been tested with RGBD data and a comprehensive domotic dataset containing data entries from 37 different domotic sensors (presence, temperature, light, energy consumption, <b>door</b> <b>contact),</b> which is made publicly available. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach and the potential for complex anomaly detection in AAL settings...|$|E
40|$|Ageing-in-place, {{the ability}} to age holistically in the community, is {{increasingly}} gaining recognition {{as a solution to}} address resource limitations in the elderly care sector. Effective elderly care models require a personalised and all-encompassing approach to caregiving. In this regard, sensor technologies have gained attention as an effective means to monitor the wellbeing of elderly living alone. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of non-intrusive sensor systems to detect socially isolated community dwelling elderly. Using a mixed method approach, our results showed that sensor-derived features such as going-out behavior, daytime napping and time spent in the living room are associated with different social isolation dimensions. The average time spent outside home is associated with the social loneliness level, social network score and the overall social isolation level of the elderly and the time spent in the living room is positively associated with the emotional loneliness level. Further, elderly who perceived themselves as socially lonely tend to take more naps during the day time. The findings of this study provide implications on how a non-intrusive sensor-based monitoring system comprising of motion-sensors and a <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> sensor can be utilized to detect elderly who are at risk of social isolatio...|$|E
40|$|Occupancy {{monitoring}} and prediction as an influential {{factor in the}} extraction of occupants' behavioural patterns for the realisation of ambient intelligent environments is addressed in this research. The proposed occupancy monitoring technique uses occupancy detection sensors with unobtrusive features to monitor occupancy in the environment. Initially the occupancy detection is conducted for a purely single-occupant environment. Then, it is extended to the multipleoccupant environment and associated problems are investigated. Along with the occupancy monitoring, it is aimed to supply prediction techniques with a suitable occupancy signal as the input which can enhance efforts in developing ambient intelligent environments. By predicting the occupancy pattern of monitored occupants, safety, security, the convenience of occupants, and energy saving can be improved. Elderly care and supporting people with health problems like dementia and Alzheimer disease are amongst the applications of such an environment. In the research, environments are considered in different scenarios based on {{the complexity of the}} problem including single-occupant and multiple-occupant scenarios. Using simple sensory devices instead of visual equipment without any impact on privacy and her/his normal daily activity, an occupant is monitored in a living or working environment in the single-occupant scenario. ZigBee wireless communication technology is used to collect signals from sensory devices such as motion detection sensors and <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> sensors.

Our aim is to quantify criteria such as the international ADL or the French AGGIR scales, by automatically classifying the different Activities of Daily Living performed by the subject during the day. A Health Smart Home is used for this. Our Health Smart Home includes, in a real flat, Infra-Red Presence Sensors (location), <b>door</b> <b>contacts</b> (to control the use of some facilities), temperature and hygrometry sensor in the bathroom, and microphones (sound classification and speech recognition). A wearable kinematic sensor also informs on postural transitions (using pattern recognition) and walk periods (frequency analysis). This data collected from the various sensors, is then used to classify each temporal frame into one of the activities of daily living that was previously acquired (seven activities: hygiene, toilet use, eating, resting, sleeping, communication, and dressing/undressing). This is done using Support Vector Machines. We performed a one-hour experimentation with 13 young and healthy subjects to determine the models of the different activities and then we tested the classification algorithm (cross-validation) with real data...|$|R

30|$|The {{architecture}} {{consists of}} 5 layers including the (1) Interaction, Communication and sensing layer (ICS) were sensing, control of actuators and devices and interactions occur, (2) the data layer were sensor data is captured from the sensors, agent action data is recorded and contextual data is stored, (iii) {{the decision and}} logging layer were the people profile is processed and the actions {{carried out by the}} agents is logged, (iv) information layer were relationships between the agents, environment and person are managed and appropriate interventions decided, (v) context layer were contextual changes are detected and managed. Information is exchanged by the agents between layers (6 – 9). The sensor and sensor data agents work together to process sensor event data (A – B) and this results in a sensor event message being formed that contains the sensor type (PIR, bed-chair or <b>door</b> <b>contact),</b> time (in the format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) it was triggered and the event types (opening, closing and room visited) and the location of the sensor event (including the: bedroom, kitchen, main hall, Livingroom, Foodcupboard door, Fridgedoor…). The sensor event message (C) is sent to the context agent and this agent determines what has changed in the environment, for example if the back door has been opened and for how long it has been opened. The context agent sends a contextual event message is sent to the Intervention agent (D). Once the intervention agent receives this message, it determines the correct intervention to make to the person. This includes issuing a reminder to have meals at certain times of the day, alerting the person that the back door has been left open and during the night. The intervention message (F) is sent to the GUI agent, the appropriate method of putting forward the intervention is selected by the profile agent (F). Once the appropriate intervention has been selected, a record is stored (G) in the agent action data store. When feedback is requested by the person, this agent action data is analysed, patterns detected and appropriate feedback is selected (H). Interventions and feedback are presented to the person in the environment either with visual or auditory interactions (I) and (J). The MAS system is able to adapt the interventions that are provided to the person by tracking what the current contextual change, activity and what intervention has previously been issued. This is achieved by comparing the current event to the previous event throughout the current sensor event processing cycle. If the same event has previously occurred then how many times it has occurred and the time difference between the events is calculated. Events that logically follow each other (for example, door opening and door closing events) are recognised so that the context behind the event may be determined. For example, if the person is alerted that the back door has been opened for 10  minutes and did not close the door, the intervention issued for the door being open for 20  minutes would be different. This information is fed between layers (K) so that the most appropriate intervention is selected. The interface agent has been replaced with a GUI agent that offers more functionally and drives the interface during the multimodal interactions. The MAS consumes data from sensors that are located in the environment and these include bed-chair, <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> and PIR sensors as well as microphones for auditory interaction. The next section outlines the Multi-Agent system (MAS), what interventions and feedback are, and the underlying agent processes involved in forming the intervention and feedback messages.|$|E
3000|$|... (1) The Person: A fictional {{older person}} named Bob lives alone. He has several {{close friends and}} a son who visits several times a month. Bob is a keen baker and has an {{interest}} in history and genealogy. Bob has mild memory issues and has difficulty reading small text and therefore wears glasses. (2) The Environment: Bob’s home, a single story dwelling has been fitted with several types of sensors including <b>door</b> <b>contact</b> sensors that are attached to the back, cupboard and fridge doors and these generate door opening and closing events. PIR sensors are located in the hall, kitchen, living room, WC, master and guest bedrooms and these generate ‘room visited events’. Bed-chair pressure sensors have been placed in Bob’s bed, generating bed-chair in and out events. These sensors are used together to detect changes of context in the environment. Touch screen interfaces are located in the kitchen and beside the bed {{in the living room and}} each touch screen has a microphone and speakers. (3) Issues (DAY): Due to several health issues Bob sleeps in a bed in the living room and does not sleep in the Master bedroom and on occasion Bob will have trouble waking and may spend most of the day in bed. During the course of a typical day, Bob may forget to close the back door and this can sometimes result in security issues occurring as in the past a stray dog has wandered in and made a mess of the kitchen. On occasion he will open fridge and cupboard doors and forget to close them, resulting in several food items spoiling and an increase in energy use. When Bob visits the downstairs WC, he sometimes forgets to flush the WC and wash his hands. Bob likes to keep in contact with his primary care contact on a Monday, Wednesday and Saturday so that they can arrange any activities and outline any issues that he is having. Bob may forget to eat regular meals during the day and this has led to increased weight loss. (4) Issues (NIGHT) Bob often goes to bed at 10 : 00  pm and during the night he usually has several restless periods were he moves about a lot in the bed. In the early hours of the morning he may sit up in bed and feel disorientated and distressed. If Bob gets up and leaves the bed, he will go to the kitchen. While Bob is in the kitchen he will sit for a long period of time and drink cups of tea. When Bob eventually returns to the bedroom and goes back to bed he will often awake again after a short period of time and have to get out of bed and go to the downstairs WC.|$|E

It is shown that the resulting nonlinear dynamical system can be discretized using a numerical technique that allows efficient and accurate simula-tion. Applications {{in the context of}} interactive audio-visual anima-tion on low-cost general-purpose computers are demonstrated, and an approach to joint audio-visual synthesis is proposed that pro-vides fine-scale synchronization and high coherence between the two modalities.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{baseline}} {{to assess}} {{impact of a}} mass education-entertainment programme offered an opportunity to identify risk factors for domestic physical violence. Methods In 2002, cross-sectional household surveys in a stratified urban/rural last-stage random sample of enumeration areas, based on latest national census in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Working door to <b>door,</b> interviewers <b>contacted</b> all adults aged 16 – 60 years present {{on the day of}} the visit, without sub-sampling. 20, 639 adults were interviewed. The questionnaire in 29 languages measured domestic physical violence by the question "In the last year, have you and your partner had violent arguments where your partner beat, kicked or slapped you?" There was no measure of severity or frequency of physical violence. Results 14 % of men (weighted based on 1, 294 / 8, 113) and 18 % of women (weighted based on 2, 032 / 11, 063) reported being a victim of partner physical violence in the last year. There was no convincing association with age, income, education, household size and remunerated occupation. Having multiple partners was strongly associated with partner physical violence. Other associations included the income gap within households, negative attitudes about sexuality (for example, men have the right to sex with their girlfriends if they buy them gifts) and negative attitudes about sexual violence (for example, forcing your partner to have sex is not rape). Particularly among men, experience of partner physical violence was associated with potentially dangerous attitudes to HIV infection. Conclusion Having multiple partners was the most consistent risk factor for domestic physical violence across all countries. This could be relevant to domestic violence prevention strategies. </p...|$|R

Footgear contact was complete when the scope ratio was 3. 0 or more. Walleye pollock, sculpins, and flatfishes were the main catch in all tows, and the catch increased with scope ratio. There {{was no difference in}} the length frequency of n= 300 walleye pollock captured at 2. 5 and 3. 0 scope ratio. However, the length frequency at 3. 5 was significantly different from that of other scope ratios. These results suggest the following: at a scope ratio of 3. 0 or more, the trawl door will not leave the bottom at any depths. To compliment echo surveys for walleye pollock, a 3. 0 scope ratio would be optimal, since the catch data for a 3. 5 scope ratio was dissimilar from that of scope ratios...|$|R
