25|$|While {{finishing}} training exercises at Subic Bay {{the main}} <b>drive</b> <b>engine</b> alarms sounded {{on the bridge}} and during {{an investigation by the}} cutter's engineers it was found that major damage had occurred to one of the main drive engines. Overhaul parts were sent from Division 12 in Danang and the cutter engineers completed the overhaul and initial run-in of the engine in 72 hours, {{just in time for the}} scheduled departure of the division for Vietnam. The final break-in of the repaired engine was completed while in transit.|$|E
25|$|Another real-life LACoFD firefighter, Mike Stoker, {{appeared}} as himself {{throughout the entire}} run of the series as the driver/engineer of Engine 51. Since Stoker possessed a Screen Actors Guild card, it was helpful to Universal to have an actor who was also fully trained and qualified to actually drive and operate Engine 51. (Cinader had refused to have an actor who did NOT work for the LACoFD <b>drive</b> <b>Engine</b> 51, since fire engines then cost approximately $100,000 {{and would have been}} too expensive to insure in that case.) Stoker retired from the LACoFD as a Captain in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Point Hope {{was built}} to {{accommodate}} an 8-man crew. She was powered by two [...] VT600 Cummins diesel main <b>drive</b> <b>engines</b> and had two five-bladed [...] propellers. The main <b>drive</b> <b>engines</b> were later replaced by [...] VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was [...] and fuel tank capacity was [...] at 95% full. After 1990 she was refit with [...] Caterpillar diesel main <b>drive</b> <b>engines.</b> Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue {{work as well as}} a combat environment.|$|R

25|$|In 1957 Kiekhaefer {{introduced}} the Mark 75 motor, the industry's first 6-cylinder 60hp (horsepower) outboard motor. Two Mark 75 motors set an endurance record by running for 34 days, 11 hours, 47 minutes, and 5.4 seconds nonstop and over 25,000 miles. The motors were refueled on the run, and averaged 30.3mph (miles per hour). In 1961 Kiekhaefer Marine {{merged with the}} Brunswick Corporation. Later that year Kiekhaefer would use his NASCAR and boat engineering skills to develop the 100hp stern <b>drive</b> <b>engine</b> now known as MerCruiser. Kiekhaefer resigned {{as president of the}} company in 1969, and the company name changed to Mercury Marine.|$|E
25|$|The design {{specifications}} for Point Baker included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction {{was used to}} save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main <b>drive</b> <b>engine</b> spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces {{were a part of}} the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E

40|$|A backup {{flight control}} system for {{controlling}} the flightpath of a multi-engine airplane using the main <b>drive</b> <b>engines</b> is introduced.

25|$|The design {{specifications}} for the 82-foot cutter included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure to save weight. Ease of operation {{with a small}} crew size was possible because of the non-manned main <b>drive</b> <b>engine</b> spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one-man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. Berthing spaces were provided for 13 so that requirements were met for passengers and extra wartime manning needs. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an 18-knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Already part of the design, crews stationed in Vietnam found the air-conditioned interior especially helpful. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer but for Vietnam service the spaces quartered the commanding officer, the executive officer and chief boatswain's mate {{as well as the}} chief engineman. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck, which also included three bunks for first-class petty officers. A watertight door {{at the front of the}} mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was 10 feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.|$|E

2500|$|The Junkers L5 was a {{development}} of Junkers' first water-cooled engine, the L2, but at {{four times the}} swept volume was a much more powerful engine. [...] It was a water-cooled upright inline 6-cylinder unit, four-stroke and petrol-fuelled, with a capacity of nearly 23 litres. It adopted some of the L2 features, having twin exhaust and inlet valves in each cylinderdriven by an overhead camshaft, twin spark plugs and twin magnetos. [...] The splash component of the L2's lubrication was abandoned in favour of a completely forced recirculating system. [...] The twin carburettors of the L2 were replaced with a single float chamber, dual-venturi model. [...] Like the L2, the L5 was a direct <b>drive</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} to use the Point-class cutter was one of logistics. The [...] Cape-class cutter was initially considered an option by Roland since it had a greater speed because of its four main <b>drive</b> <b>engines.</b> The Point-class cutter had only two main <b>drive</b> <b>engines</b> but they were more consistent throughout the class than the Cape-class cutters, so {{it was easier to}} supply spare parts and maintain the engines. Additional factors favoring the Point-class cutter were an unmanned engine room with all controls and alarms on the bridge, and air-conditioned living spaces, a big factor in a tropical climate where crews were expected to live on the boat whether on or off duty. [...] The 40-foot utility boats were rejected because they lacked radar, berthing, and mess facilities for extended patrols offshore.|$|R
