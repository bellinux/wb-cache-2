5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a <b>dark</b> <b>site</b> owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the notion of {{tourists}} visiting sites associated with death and destruction has started to receive much attention within the associated literature, with issues coupled with visitor motivations being key to this research. The genre that probably best describes the study of this subject matter (death and destruction) is ‘dark tourism’. Lennon & Foley (1996, p 200) describe this as “the phenomenon which encompasses the presentation and consumption (by visitors) of real and commodified death and disaster sites”. The identification of those factors that guide the selection of such <b>dark</b> <b>sites</b> and a review of visitor’s on-site experiences and subsequent post visit behaviour is important and requires further attention. The main {{aim of this study}} is to better understand the motivations and on-site activities of visitors to contemporary <b>dark</b> tourism <b>sites.</b> In addition the methods associated with archiving the visit in terms of souvenir hunting, photography and other related actions will be investigated. From what is evidenced in the literature, it is clear to see that many of these dark locations can be broadly classified as ‘dark shrines’ (Stone, 2006); but there has been little empirical investigation relating to visitor motivations and behaviour of visitors whilst at these sites. The empirical data was collected using qualitative methods, primarily Means-End Chain (MEC) analysis was employed. This is a qualitative methodological tool, employing a semi-structured one on one interview style. Fourteen interviews in total were used from individuals who had visited <b>dark</b> <b>sites</b> and the data was analysed using the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS). The results suggest that the main motivations for visiting those sites that are deemed lighter on the dark spectrum were associated with entertainment, family fun and some learning, with much emphasis upon showcasing the experience to peers upon their return home. In contrast the motivations for visiting <b>dark</b> <b>sites</b> such as concentration camps and camps of mass genocide tended to be more empathetic with the victims, with issues associated with education and intellectual enquiry being fundamental to the visit. Issues associated with peer recognition as a result of the visit were not deemed as important for those visiting <b>darker</b> <b>sites.</b> In conclusion the research shows that visitors to the lighter sites tend to be informed by family and loved ones with emphasis upon enjoyment and family kinship. In contract those who visit the <b>darker</b> <b>sites</b> tended to be more interested in the educational and academic overtones associated with the site, with a keen interest in history further facilitating this need. The main contribution of this research relates to the differing needs as identified by light and dark visitors whist at site. Visitors at lighter sites tend to require more operational based information associated with facilities and merchandising provision, whereas visitors to <b>darker</b> <b>sites</b> require information that is geo-political and quasi academic in nature, so as to better understand the magnitude of the atrocities. In terms of the manner by which light and dark visitors go about collecting artefacts / souvenirs this also differs greatly with lighter visitors looking for commercially produced items to take home and take picture of family members in situ. In contrast visitors to <b>darker</b> <b>sites</b> choose to collect souvenirs at site which are often items of nature associated specifically with the sight. Picture taking is limited, but when used is associated with the site and the surroundings...|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{explore the}} driven-dissipative physics of geometrically frustrated lattices of cavity resonators with relatively weak nonlinearities, i. e. a photon-photon interaction {{smaller than the}} loss rate. In such systems, photon modes with zero probability at 'dark' sites are present at the single-particle level due to interference effects. In particular, we study {{the behavior of a}} cell with three coupled resonators as well as extended Lieb lattices in 1 D and 2 D. By considering a partial pumping scheme, with the driving field not applied to the <b>dark</b> <b>sites,</b> we predict that even in presence of relatively weak photon-photon interactions the nominally <b>dark</b> <b>sites</b> achieve a finite photonic population with strong correlations. We show that this is a consequence of biphoton and multiphoton states that in the absence of frustration would not be visible in the observables. Comment: Accepted for publication in PR...|$|R

An estimate in October 2012 predicted that it might brighten to magnitude −4 (roughly equivalent to Venus). In January 2013 there was a noticeable brightening slowdown that suggested that it may only brighten to magnitude +1. During February the brightness curve showed a further slowdown suggesting a perihelion magnitude of around +2.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDrosophila melanogaster {{females are}} highly {{selective}} about the chemosensory {{quality of their}} egg-laying sites [1 – 6], an important trait that promotes the survival and fitness of their offspring. How egg-laying females respond to UV light is not known, however. UV is a well-documented phototactic cue for adult Drosophila [7 – 13], {{but it is an}} aversive cue for larvae [14 – 17]. Here, we show that female flies exhibit UV aversion in response to their egg-laying demand. First, females exhibit egg-laying aversion of UV: they prefer to lay eggs on <b>dark</b> <b>sites</b> when choosing between UV-illuminated and <b>dark</b> <b>sites.</b> Second, they also exhibit movement aversion of UV: positional tracking of single females suggests that egg-laying demand increases their tendency to turn away from UV. Genetic manipulations of the retina suggest that egg-laying and movement aversion of UV are both mediated by the inner (R 7) and not the outer (R 1 –R 6) photoreceptors. Finally, we show that the Dm 8 amacrine neurons, a synaptic target of R 7 photoreceptors and a mediator of UV spectral preference [12], are dispensable for egg-laying aversion but essential for movement aversion of UV. This study suggests that egg-laying demand can temporarily convert UV into an aversive cue for female Drosophila and that R 7 photoreceptors recruit different downstream targets to control different egg-laying-induced behavioral modifications...|$|R

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{question}} that a child asks {{when he or she}} sees the night sky from a <b>dark</b> <b>site</b> for the first time is: 'How many stars are there?' This happens to be a question which has exercised the intellectual skills of many astronomers over the course of most of the last century, including, for the last two decades, {{one of the authors of}} this text. Until recently, the most accurate answer was 'We are not certain, but there is a good chance that almost all of them are M dwarfs. ' Within the last three years, results from new sky-surveys - particularly the first deep surveys at near­ infrared wavelengths - have provided a breakthrough in this subject, solidifying our census of the lowest-mass stars and identifying large numbers of the hitherto almost mythical substellar-mass brown dwarfs. These extremely low-luminosity objects are the central subjects of this book, and the subtitle should be interpreted accordingly. The expression 'low-mass stars' carries a wide range of meanings in the astronomical literature, but is most frequently taken to refer to objects with masses comparable with that of the Sun - F and G dwarfs, and their red giant descendants. While this definition is eminently reasonable for the average extragalactic astronomer, our discussion centres on M dwarfs, with masses of no more than 60 % that of the Sun, and extends to 'failed stars' - objects with insufficient mass to ignite central hydrogen fusion...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the optical night sky brightness and extinction coefficient measurements in UBVRI at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO), Hanle, during the period 2003 - 2008. They are obtained from {{an analysis of}} CCD images acquired at the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at IAO. Night sky brightness was estimated using 210 HFOSC images obtained on 47 nights and covering the declining phase of solar activity cycle- 23. The zenith corrected values of the moonless night sky brightness in mag/square arcsecs are 22. 14 (U), 22. 42 (B), 21. 28 (V), 20. 54 (R) and 18. 86 (I) band. This shows that IAO is a <b>dark</b> <b>site</b> for optical observations. No clear dependency of sky brightness with solar activity is found. Extinction values at IAO are derived from an analysis of 1325 images over 58 nights. They are found to be 0. 36 in U-band, 0. 21 in B-band, 0. 12 in V-band, 0. 09 in R-band and 0. 05 in I-band. On average, extinction during the summer months is slightly larger than that during the winter months. No clear evidence for a correlation between extinction in all bands and the average night time wind speed is found. Also presented here is the low resolution moonless optical night sky spectrum for IAO covering the wavelength range 3000 - 9300 Å. Hanle region thus has the required characteristics of a good astronomical site in terms of night sky brightness and extinction, and could be a natural candidate site for any future large aperture Indian optical-infrared telescope(s).
