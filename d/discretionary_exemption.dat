40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{inconspicuous}} but increasingly {{important role of}} Chinese courts in handling the often conflicting goals of promoting government transparency and maintaining social stability within the Party-state context. The Regulation on Open Government Information created an unprecedented right of access to information {{with the potential for}} improving administrative accountability, but established a peculiar exemption of social stability. “Stability maintenance” has long been an overwhelming political task for Chinese state organs, and has profoundly affected legal practices, posing a challenge to judicial control of abuse of the aforementioned <b>discretionary</b> <b>exemption.</b> Added to the challenge is the obscurity in the standards for judicial review of discretion. The paper reviews how the courts respond to this challenge by focusing on representative cases concerning government claims that disclosure would endanger social stability. It finds that in referential cases adopted in official publications, the courts have developed creative approaches to scrutiny. However, other sources indicate that meaningful review is largely absent from cases involving appropriations of private properties and those concerning large-scale maladministration. It argues that the judicial inaction can be attributed to two concerns underlying the common practice of the stability maintenance system, i. e. containing collective mobilization and inhibiting expression of public mistrust in governance. The courts demonstrate their ability in judicializing the political concept of social stability in the context of right to information, and thus assume more than a deferential role in the politics of stability maintenance. Nevetheless, they remain captive to the imperative of securing core regime interests. The liberalization implications of transparency reform are hence minimized through the judicial process...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for economy-wide modelling of value-added tax systems. Our framework models a number of complexities of VAT systems as they are implemented by tax agencies. In particular, we model multiple rates, multiple exemptions, multiple degrees of refundability across commodity users, and multi-product enterprises. A detailed VAT framework is important for correct modelling of VAT within a general equilibrium model. Such a framework is also of value in correctly representing the distribution of indirect tax payments within the database of a general equilibrium model, a prerequisite of accurate welfare analysis. We use the model to analyse the effects of simplifying Vietnam’s complex VAT system. We simplify the system by moving from three tax rates to one budget-neutral rate, while also removing many <b>discretionary</b> <b>exemptions.</b> ...|$|R

In particular, we model multiple rates, multiple exemptions, multiple degrees of refundability across commodity users, and multi-product enterprises. We use our framework to model what is arguably South East Asia's most complex VAT system: that of Vietnam. We analyse the macroeconomic, industrial and distributional effects of simplifying Vietnam's complex VAT system. We simplify the system via a budget-neutral movement to one rate and removal of <b>discretionary</b> <b>exemptions.</b> This generates an aggregate welfare gain, but adverse distributional effects. Adverse distributional effects can be greatly ameliorated, at small cost to the aggregate welfare gain, via exclusion of paddy and rice from the VAT simplification program.

5000|$|The most {{important}} CSA effort is {{the implementation of}} the passport system. Under the passport system, a market participant can obtain a decision from its principal regulator and, through a simple filing, have the same decision deemed to be issued under the legislation of all other participating jurisdictions, in essence providing a passport to undertake capital markets activity across Canada. The passport system covers prospectus filings, registration of securities firms and individuals, and certain types of <b>discretionary</b> <b>exemptions.</b> Ontario is recognized by the other jurisdictions as a principal jurisdiction for passport decisions but the Ontario Securities Commission has not adopted the passport rule itself. As a result, Ontario market participants have access to other jurisdictions through the passport system but participants from other jurisdictions {{do not have access to}} Ontario. Instead, the Ontario Securities Commission follows a [...] "mutual reliance" [...] policy in which it decides in each case whether to accept the decision of the principal regulator. Ontario says it supports the harmonization and improved coordination of securities regulation in Canada; however, it does not wish to participate in the passport system because it would prefer creation of a national securities regulator.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the European air {{transport}} industry {{has undergone a}} process in several stages of transition towards a single market. Liberalization has been {{closely linked to the}} effective application of the state aid rules of the EC Treaty. In principle, direct aid to undertakings within the common market is not prohibited by the state aid rules in the Treaty. However, aid granted by Member States that distorts or threatens to distort competition by giving one airline an unfair advantage over its competitors, and in so far as it affects trade between Member States, is incompatible with the Treaty. Certain mandatory or <b>discretionary</b> <b>exemptions</b> may apply to aid to airlines providing that the measure fulfills the conditions and requirements as stated by the Treaty. The European Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority have a wide discretion in deciding whether or not certain aid measures fall within the stated exemptions. Where the market forces alone are not able to achieve the desired results or if they are only able to do so in a limited capacity, such exemptions may be warranted to the extent not contrary to the common interest. A special mechanism is in place to ensure that state aid is properly scrutinized {{in the light of the}} demands of the Treaty and the EEA Agreement. The EC Commission or the EFTA Surveillance Authority must be notified of all aid measures in order to assess their compatibility with state aid rules...|$|R

40|$|The Establishment Clause is not {{violated}} {{when government}} enacts regulatory or tax legislation but provides, concerning these new burdens, an accommodation for those holding conflicting religious beliefs or practices. Such religious exemptions are enacted {{at the discretion}} of the legislature and have as their purpose to ameliorate hardships borne by religious minorities and other dissenters who find themselves {{out of step with the}} prevailing social or legal culture. In an unbroken line of cases now spanning a century, the Supreme Court has ten times rejected the argument that a religious exemption contravenes the Establishment Clause. In some instances, no doubt, lawmakers should exercise their discretion and narrow or deny an exemption for religious observance. What is not the law, however, is that the presence of adverse effects on those who do not benefit from an <b>discretionary</b> religious <b>exemption</b> causes an otherwise lawful accommodation to violate the Establishment Clause. Cases involving an exemption are being confused with religious preferences. An exemption occurs when a dissenter’s religious practice is simply left alone even as others are made to labor under a burden of the legislature’s creation, be it a tax or regulatory duty. Government does not establish religion by leaving it alone. An exemption, rather, ensures that a new regulatory burden on others is not also thrust in the path of individuals who are already inclined to privately follow the dictates of their faith. Because the government’s exemption is not the causal agent behind the religious observance, any incidental harm to third parties is the result of private conduct. Harm redressable under the Establishment Clause must be injury that was caused by the government, not private actors. In contrast, a religious preference arises when the government first takes note of a disagreement in the private sector that involves religion. If a law is subsequently adopted that takes the side of the religious disputant, the government is intentionally preferring religion over its competitor. The favoritism occurs in a situation not of the state’s creation, but in circumstances arising out of private social or market forces. Should the form of the government’s discretionary intervention go on to unyieldingly side with religion such that any costs to others are not weighed in the balance, then the Court will strike down the preference. The operative Establishment Clause rule is that persons in the private sector should not be forced to readjust their lives so that a neighbor can better conform to his or her religion. Along with true preferences, progressives want religious exemptions to be balanced against any incidental harms that befall third parties. They want this not as a matter of legislative discretion, but as a constitutional imperative. This not only misconceives the nature of the Establishment Clause, but the argument assumes that “third-party harm” is a juridical category that can be both defined and bounded. It cannot. Additionally, the logic behind this category is in danger of expanding and thereby end up overwhelming most every religious exemption. The founding generation did not regard a <b>discretionary</b> religious <b>exemption</b> as an establishment. Moreover, there are presently thousands of religious exemptions in local, state, and federal law. To abolish them all because they are thought to be unconstitutional under a novel theory would work primarily to the injury of religious minorities. That would bring a sea change in the venerable American practice of extending a welcoming hand to diverse peoples of diverse faiths...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{arguments}} being made by those displeased with Hobby Lobby is that <b>discretionary</b> religious <b>exemptions,</b> like RFRA, violate the Establishment Clause when the accommodation results in harm to third parties. It is an establishment of religion, it is claimed, when such exemptions override the interests of third parties who do not share {{the faith of the}} religious claimants. These third parties lose a valuable benefit, and do so just so the claimants of the exemption can better exercise their religion. That has the government preferring religion over nonreligious interest, insist the critics. This argument is taken up in a new article linked below. In a consistent line of six cases, the Supreme Court has turned back the claim that religious exemptions, whether enacted by statute or the result of official policy, violate the Establishment Clause. The leading case is Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos, where the Court upheld an exemption for religious employers from Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. There are no cases to the contrary. The critics cite to Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, but the law at issue in Caldor was a naked religious preference not a religious exemption. A religious exemption lifts a burden from a religious claimant, one that was originally imposed by the government itself by regulation or taxation. The net result is that those who practice religion are left alone, and government does not advance religion by leaving it alone. A preference, on the other hand, is when the government newly enters the private sector and extends a benefit or advantage on religious persons because of their religion. The Connecticut law struck down in Caldor was of the latter sort; the state was not relieving a burden from an earlier imposed regulation but taking the side of religion over the secular in a private dispute...|$|R
