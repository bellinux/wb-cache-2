This study focuses on the detailed performance of a field-scale CW in the tropics, consisting of a subsurface flow wetland (SSF) and a surface flow wetland (SF). The SSF had a total area of 151. 2 sq. m., filled with gravel and planted with Phragmites, Thalia, and Brachiaria, along three independent cells operating with a flow in parallel and receiving the influent domestic wastewater from a facultative lagoon and preceded the SF. The SF was a shallow open basin containing alternating regions of open water (195 sq. m. total) with submerged aquatic plants (Elodea) and regions of shallower water (605 sq. m. total) filled with emergent wetland vegetation (Typha, Thalia, and Cyperus).

40|$|Abstract}Perchlorate (ClO 4) {{has been}} {{detected}} {{in a large}} number of surface and ground waters in the US. Due to health concerns of perchlorate in drinking water, the California Department of Health Services has established a provisional action level of 18 mg/L. Several microbial isolates have been obtained capable of microbiological perchlorate reduction through cell respiration, but few of these have been tested for perchlorate removals to these low levels. The feasibility of using one isolate (KJ) for water treatment was tested in a packed-bed bioreactor by comparing minimum <b>detention</b> <b>times</b> necessary to achieve complete removal of perchlorate. Perchlorate was reduced approximately from 20 mg/L to non-detectable (54 mg/L) levels in acetate-fed columns inoculated with KJ or mixed cultures. The complete conversion of perchlorate to chloride was demonstrated by a stoichiometric ratio of perchlorate to chloride of 1. 0 0. 14. Perchlorate removal to non-detectable levels required a minimum empty bed contact time (EBCT) of only 2. 1 min for the column inoculated with KJ, vs. 31 min for the mixed culture column. Acetate was used at a molar ratio of C 2 H 3 O 2 =ClO 4 of 2. 9 (n 6) for the mixed culture, while {{more than twice as much}} acetate was consumed on average (6. 6 2. 0, n 156) by the pure culture. These results demonstrate that <b>detention</b> <b>times</b> of packed-bed bioreactors can be substantially reduced using isolate KJ, but that larger concentrations of acetate will be necessary to reduce perchlorate to low levels necessary for drinking water...|$|R
