40|$|The {{world is}} facing {{environmental}} challenges {{in particular the}} surging growth of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions.</b> In line with these challenges, the developed world is funding sustainable development in poor countries, assumed to have low willingness to pay for environmental quality improvements. We are therefore directed to asking the question, “Does financial sustainable development assistance improve environmental air quality in poor countries and if so, by what magnitude?” The study attempts to expose whether financial development assistance reduces <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions</b> in Sub-Sahara Africa or not. With regards to value addition to this field, the study attempts to introduce the consumer theory of utility maximization in explaining how financial sustainable development assistance shifts the country’s optimal consumption levels and it also attempts to introduce the Marshallian productivity theory in its suggested post-cure financial sustainable development assistance model. Empirically, the study makes use of an econometric programme, STATA 9, to estimate the random effects panel data model in three functional forms, linear, quadratic and cubic forms, linking <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions</b> to sustainable development assistance, per capita income, energy use and manufacturing share. In addition, it also estimates the dynamic panel data model, linking the current <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions</b> to previous emissions in SSA countries. The study finds no evidence that financial sustainable development assistance improves environmental air quality in SSA. The findings provide evidence that the quadratic functional form {{in terms of the}} sustainable development assistance variable provides the best fit for SSA data whereas the cubic functional form has the worst fit. While the explicit link between environmental quality and per capita income professed by various empirical studies is not refuted, this study finds evidence that increases in current per capita incomes increase <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions</b> in SSA. In addition, energy use and manufacturing share are found to be significant determinants of variations in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions</b> in SSA in both the linear and quadratic functional forms. But in the dynamic random effects estimation, the study finds no evidence of a significant influence of previous <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> <b>emissions</b> on current emissions although there is an indication of a positive relationship...|$|R
