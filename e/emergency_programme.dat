The ship was built during the early 1940s {{as one of the}} War <b>Emergency</b> <b>Programme</b> destroyers, and entered service in 1942.|$|E
25|$|Napier was {{the first}} of the eight-ship N class laid down under the War <b>Emergency</b> <b>Programme</b> when {{construction}} started at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company shipyard in Govan, Scotland on 26 July 1939. The destroyer was launched on 22 May 1940 by the wife of one of the company directors, and was commissioned into the RAN on 28 November 1940. Although commissioned as an Australian warship, Napier remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship was named after Scottish Admiral Sir Charles Napier, with the ship's badge taken from the family coat of arms, and cost 403,960 pounds to build.|$|E

25|$|In early 1950, the {{decision}} was made to convert all five Q-class destroyers in RAN service (three more had been acquired after World War II) to anti-submarine warfare frigates, similar to the Type 15 frigate conversions performed on several War <b>Emergency</b> <b>Programme</b> destroyers of the RN. A proposal was made by the Australian government to pay for the upgrade to the five on-loan vessels, at the predicted cost of AU₤400,000 each. Instead, the British Admiralty presented the ships to the RAN on 1 June as gifts. The conversions were part of an overall plan to improve the anti-submarine warfare capability of the RAN, although Quiberon and the other ships were only a 'stopgap' measure until purpose-built ASW frigates could be constructed.|$|E
500|$|The R {{class was}} {{a class of}} sixteen War <b>Emergency</b> <b>Programme</b> destroyers ordered for the Royal Navy in 1940 as the 3rd and 4th Emergency Flotilla. The Q and R class {{repeated}} the preceding O and P class, reverting to the larger J, K and N-class hull to allow for increased top weight (maximum permissible weight). Since they had fewer main guns than the J, K and Ns, magazine space was replaced by fuel bunkers allowing for [...] at [...] (compared with the [...] of their ancestors). Like the O and P classes, they were armed with available weapons: 4.7-inch (120mm) guns on single mountings allowing only 40° of elevation. As a result, on paper they do not compare favourably with many of their contemporaries. These ships used the Fuze Keeping Clock HA Fire Control Computer. The R class repeated the Qs, except that the officers' accommodation was moved from the traditional right aft to a more accessible location amidships.|$|E
