5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} toll on the terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem the <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E

On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further surgery was performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert was using a prosthetic chin to hide some of the <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by his many chin, mouth, and throat surgeries.|$|E

5|$|In a June 2006 {{report on}} the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{admitted}} that faulty design specifications, incomplete sections, and substandard construction of levee segments, contributed to the <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. A report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers in June 2007 concluded {{that two-thirds of the}} flooding in the city could have been avoided if the levees had held.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as a pest, {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the <b>damage</b> <b>done,</b> and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E

5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted {{by the smell of}} bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{logistical}} {{demands of}} the surrender were formidable. After Japan's capitulation, more than 5,400,000 Japanese soldiers and 1,800,000 Japanese sailors were taken prisoner by the Allies. The <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to Japan's infrastructure, combined with a severe famine in 1946, further complicated the Allied efforts to feed the Japanese POWs and civilians.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Wilson was Chief of Development Engineering at United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters, {{and was the}} USAAF {{liaison officer}} to the Manhattan Project. In December 1944 he became Chief of Staff of the 316th Bombardment Wing. Its B-29s {{deployed}} to Okinawa in June 1945, and he participated in the last air raids on Japan.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> by the bullet, the autopsy {{also found that the}} President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to Eindhoven was {{significant}} {{and can be}} considered a victory for JG 3. It was also assisted by elements of JG 6 which had misidentified Eindhoven as one their targets. The greatest losses were amongst the Recce Wing and the Canadian 124 Wing RCAF, which suffered 24 aircraft destroyed or damaged. The visiting 39 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged. 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed. It is likely that I./JG 3 was responsible for about 2/3 of the damage. Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged.|$|E

The walls of the Lower Ward were rebuilt in stone, complete with a gatehouse in {{the location of the}} future Henry VIII Gate, between 1224 and 1230. Three new towers, the Curfew, Garter and the Salisbury towers, were constructed. The Middle Ward was heavily reinforced with a southern stone wall, protected by the new Edward III and Henry III towers at each end.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} brought {{widespread rain}} to West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during its lifespan, with rains of 140mm (5.5inches) as far west as Lucknow. The rains in Uttar Pradesh caused severe property damage and flooding, with some 150people losing {{their lives in}} the state. The Ganges flooded in northern Bihar, inundating parts of Munger District, whilst the Gandaki River flooded parts of Motihari. The rains worsened floods in south Bengal, increasing the death toll from the floods there to 80 and affecting 8million people, with considerable <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to crops and housing. Jaleswar in Orissa was entirely flooded.|$|E

Three weeks later, after undergoing constant dialysis procedures, Peter gets angry that the dialysis treatments have stolen him from the world. After being convinced by Joe and Quagmire that one skipping would not hurt him, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment but his assumptions are false and him skipping it causes him to become jaundiced and vomit blood.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Blücher and the <b>damage</b> <b>done</b> to Lützow {{caused the}} German force to withdraw.

Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city, and by 14:00 on 10 April it was in German hands. The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Blüchers task force, however, allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city.|$|E
