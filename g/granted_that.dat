5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|Let {{it not be}} concluded, that I wish {{to invert}} the order of things; I have already <b>granted,</b> <b>that,</b> from the {{constitution}} of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain {{a greater degree of}} virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October, Molotov {{announced}} the Soviet demands in public, during a {{session of the}} Supreme Soviet. The Finns made two counteroffers—the first on 23 October and the second on 3 November. In both offers Finland would cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union, which was {{far less than the}} Soviets had demanded. The Finnish delegation returned home on November 13, taking for <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> the negotiations would continue in the future.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{took for}} <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> {{all of the}} layers of grease and soot on the ceiling {{were the result of}} candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|The work {{assumes that}} the royal legal system would still address some issues that later would have been dealt with by ecclesiastical courts. Clergy are not only {{to take part in}} the shire court, but could be summoned to answer charges in the court. It also sets out the various courts that were {{established}} and their jurisdiction. It takes for <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect. It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I. Another new concern in the Leges is law covering the roadways and highways.|$|E
60|$|God <b>grant</b> <b>that</b> we {{may never}} need that terrible chastisement.

60|$|God <b>grant</b> <b>that</b> he did {{remember}} St. Paul's words. God <b>grant</b> <b>that</b> he trembled once more, and to good purpose; and so repented of his sins {{even at the}} last. God <b>grant</b> <b>that</b> he {{may find}} mercy in that Day. But we can have but little hope for him; it is but too probable that he was put to death with his brother, within five years {{of the time when}} St. Paul warned him of judgment to come,--too probable that that was his last chance of salvation, and that he threw it away for ever, as too many sinners do.|$|R

5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he moved and was <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in practice it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} {{concession}} for a route from Oslo to Bodø via Trondheim without subsidies. They {{also stated that}} {{they were willing to}} fly all domestic routes without subsidies, <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bodø and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London. The first flight was made on 3 May 1952, with the Heron LN-PSG Per. From 7 to 14 May, the plane went {{on a tour of the}} country, visiting several airports. Regular services started on 18 August and a one-way ticket cost NOK95.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5|$|Offa died in July 796 {{and his son}} Ecgfrith 141days later. Coenwulf, {{a distant}} relative, succeeded to the Mercian throne after Ecgfrith's death. Soon after his {{accession}} Coenwulf sought to replace the two archdioceses with one at London, arguing that Pope Gregory I's original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at London instead of at Canterbury. In 797 and 798 Coenwulf sent envoys to Rome to Pope Leo III, suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at London for Æthelhard. The king's envoys laid {{the blame for the}} problems encountered with the Lichfield archdiocese on Pope Hadrian I's incompetence. Displeased by criticism of the papacy, Leo ruled against the king's plan. In 801 Coenwulf put down a Kentish rebellion, allowing him to once more assert his authority in Canterbury and control the archbishopric. Finally, in 802, Pope Leo III <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Hadrian's decision was invalid, after the English clergy told him it had been achieved by Offa's misrepresentation. Leo returned all jurisdiction to Canterbury, a decision announced by Æthelhard at the Council of Clovesho in 803.|$|E
25|$|During his marriage, Jung {{engaged in}} extramarital {{relationship}}s. His alleged affairs with Sabina Spielrein and Toni Wolff {{were the most}} widely discussed. Though it was mostly taken for <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Jung's relationship with Spielrein included a sexual relationship, this assumption has been disputed, in particular by Henry Zvi Lothane.|$|E
25|$|The 1946 National Assembly {{resulted}} in a new constitution in 1947. This restored Malta's self-government, with Paul Boffa as Prime Minister.
