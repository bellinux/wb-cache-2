5|$|Maximus {{is among}} those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths.

5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a <b>generation</b> <b>after</b> his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S.

A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The <b>Generation</b> <b>After</b> That. It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{arrived in}} Ceredigion in 1073–1074, {{and from the}} early twelfth century Norman {{political}} and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's. In about the year 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, {{with the exception of}} Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc’s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a <b>generation</b> <b>after</b> Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded supernova, SN 185, {{was viewed}} by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. The brightest recorded supernova was SN 1006, which occurred in 1006 AD and {{was described in}} detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers. The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula. Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed {{with the naked eye}} in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging. Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later. It was the second supernova to be observed in a <b>generation</b> (<b>after</b> SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).|$|E
5|$|Verdi was {{concerned}} about {{working on a new}} opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini. Conductors of the <b>generation</b> <b>after</b> Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory.|$|E
