5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a <b>hurry</b> <b>and</b> feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to <b>hurry,</b> <b>and</b> refuting {{warnings}} that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when most of the men around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must <b>hurry</b> <b>and</b> close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E

25|$|Limestone Lad is a bay gelding with {{no white}} markings, bred and owned by James Bowe of Gathabawn, near Johnstown, County Kilkenny.

Limestone Lad's dam, Limestone Miss, was an unraced mare who also produced Miss Lime, a winner of three races, including a fifteen length defeat of Dorans Pride at Thurles. Limestone Miss was a daughter of Miss Kiln, who was in turn a daughter of Kinneagh, a mare bought by James Bowe for about 100 guineas. Kinneagh's other foals included Drumgora, who won the Champion Chase in 1981.

25|$|After {{spending}} some time being tutored by teacher Iordache, whom the text depicts as a drunk, a sudden outbreak of cholera kills his teacher and pushes Smaranda and »òtefan to send their child out of the village. NicƒÉ follows the path of transhumance and is assigned {{to the care of}} shepherds, but he himself falls ill with what the narrator claims was cholera, and, upon returning home with a high fever, is instantly cured with a folk remedy of vinegar and lovage. A while after, claiming insolvency, »òtefan withdraws his son from school. Owing to Smaranda's persistence, the child follows his maternal grandfather David CreangƒÉ to Bro»ôteni, where he and his cousin Dumitru are enlisted in a more affordable establishment. This requires adaptation on the part of NicƒÉ and Dumitru, both of whom weep once their long hair is shaved off on the new teacher's orders. They are both hosted by a middle-aged woman, Irinuca, in a small house on the Bistri»õa, where their proximity to goats results in a scabies infection. CreangƒÉ then recounts how, while attempting to cure themselves with frequent baths in the river, he and his cousin dislodged a cliff which rolled down and tore through Irinuca's household. After leaving Bro»ôteni in a <b>hurry</b> <b>and</b> spending a while in Borca, the two children hasten for David CreangƒÉ's home in Pipirig. After an eventful trip through the Eastern Carpathians, the two boys arrive in the village, where they are welcomed by David's wife Nastasia. She cures their scabies using another local remedy, birch extract.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss again, {{and chose}} to bat. Openers Marsh and Taylor again got the {{tourists}} {{off to a}} solid start, but their heroics of the fifth test {{were not to be}} repeated, as Marsh was caught by debutant Igglesden off Galdstone Small for 17, the opening stand worth 48. David Boon came to the wicket and looked at ease, as he and Taylor set about building a solid second wicket partnership. The pair batted throughout the morning, and Taylor soon brought up his fifty. The young New South Welshman had been in majestic form throughout the series, and England had no answers for the well-timed left-hander. He pulled and drove with ease once again, to bring up his milestone. Boon likewise approached his half-century, but soon lost his partner Taylor, who rarely edged a ball outside off-stump of the bowling of Igglesden to be caught behind, and give the bowler his first ever test wicket. Taylor had gone for 71, and Australia were 130 for 2. Boon fell shortly after for 46, bringing Dean Jones to the wicket to partner his captain Allan Border. The pair seemed to enjoy each other's company, and once again built a solid 4th wicket partnership, batting throughout the remainder of the first day. Jones was in a <b>hurry</b> <b>and</b> scored freely, all around the wicket, working the field for quick singles and twos, and picking off the bad balls for four. Shortly before stumps he brought up his second century of the tour. At stumps on day one, Australia ended on 325 for 3, with Border not out on 66 and Jones on 114 not out.|$|E

The 1990 album Pass It on Down featured three number one singles: [...] "Jukebox in My Mind", [...] "Forever's as Far as I'll Go", and [...] "Down Home". According to AllMusic, {{by the time}} the band released 1992's American Pride, [...] "they were among the genre's aging veterans." [...] Richard Carlin of Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary, suggested that the group's harmonies sounded dated to the new audience.

Cheap Seats followed in 1993, with [...] "Reckless" [...] becoming Alabama's final number one, although most of the band's singles afterward peaked within the top ten. The band's 1995 album, In Pictures, represented their eighteenth gold album, more than the total for any other country act to that point. In 1996, the group remained finalists in the Vocal Group of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards. The band released Dancin' on the Boulevard in 1997, exploring R and beach music. Singles [...] "Sad Lookin' Moon" [...] and [...] "Dancin', Shaggin' on the Boulevard" [...] were top five hits in the U.S. and Canada.
