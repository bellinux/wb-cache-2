40|$|Insects {{could provide}} an {{alternative}} and more sustainable source of animal protein compared to conventional livestock. Yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.) {{can be grown}} on diets composed of organic by-products. However, these diets could be contaminated with mycotoxins. Thus far, {{little is known about}} possible retention, sequestration, excretion or detoxification of mycotoxins by edible insects. T. molitor larvae were grown on wheat flour naturally contaminated with mycotoxins among which deoxynivalenol (DON) was predominant (4. 9 mg/kg), wheat flour spiked with 8 mg/kg pure DON, and uncontaminated wheat flour. Larval survival and weight gain on the three diets were compared. Survival was high for larvae on all dietary treatments (> 98 %) and no difference in weight gain was observed when comparing larvae grown on uncontaminated control diet with larvae grown on contaminated diets (P= 0. 091). Presence of mycotoxins in larvae and larval faeces was analysed using LC-MS/MS. No DON or DON-derivatives were detected <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> after harvest of the larvae, pointing to degradation by the larvae. Excretion of DON in larval faeces was ca. 14 % of the amount of DON ingested for larvae grown on naturally contaminated diet and ca. 41 % for larvae grown on DON-spiked diet. These are promising results with respect to food safety of mealworms or derived products grown on mycotoxin-contaminated feed.

However, investigations of these limits may be affected by the circumstances under which trials are undertaken. Only a few studies have examined these effects, and typically not for beetles. This group has also not been considered {{in the context of the}} time courses of acclimation and its reversal, both of which are important for estimating the responses of species to transient temperature changes. Here we therefore examine the effects of rate of temperature change on critical thermal maxima (CT max) and minima (CT min), as well as the time course of the acclimation response and its reversal in two beetle species, Tenebrio molitor and Cyrtobagous salviniae. Increasing rates of temperature change had opposite effects on T. molitor and C. salviniae. <b>In</b> <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> faster rates of change reduced both CT max (c. 2 °C) and CT min (c. 3 °C), while in C. salviniae faster rates of change increased both CT max (c. 6 °C) and CT min (c. 4 °C). CT max <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> showed little response to acclimation, while the response to acclimation of CT min was most pronounced following exposure to 35 °C (from 25 °C) and was complete within 24 h. The time course of acclimation of CT max in C. salviniae was 2 days when exposed to 36 °C (from c. 26 °C), while that of CT min was less than 3 days when exposed to 18 °C. <b>In</b> <b>T.</b> <b>molitor,</b> the time course of reacclimation to 25 °C after treatments at 15 °C and 35 °C at 75 % RH was longer than the time course of acclimation, and varied from 3 - 6 days for CT max and 6 days for CT min. In C. salviniae, little change in CT max and CT min (< 0. 5 °C) took place in all treatments suggesting that reacclimation may only occur after the 7 day period used in this study. These results indicate that both T. molitor and C. salviniae may be restricted in their ability to respond to transient temperature changes at short-time scales, and instead may have to rely on behavioral adjustments to avoid deleterious effects at high temperatures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|If {{there are}} costs {{involved}} with the maintenance of pathogen resistance, then higher investment in this trait is expected when the risk of pathogenesis is high. One {{situation in which the}} risk of pathogenesis is elevated is at increased conspecific density. This paper reports the results of a study of density-dependent polyphenism in pathogen resistance and immune function in the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor. Beetles reared at high larval densities showed lower mortality when exposed to a generalist entomopathogenic fungus and a higher degree of cuticular melanization than those reared solitarily. The degree of cuticular melanization was a strong indicator of resistance, with darker beetles being more resistant than lighter ones regardless of rearing density.

PGRP-LE, {{a member of the}} PGRP family, selectively binds to diaminopimelic acid (DAP) -type peptidoglycan to activate both the immune deficiency (Imd) and proPhenoloxidase (proPO) pathways in insects. A PGRP-LE-dependent induction of autophagy to control Listeria monocytogenes has also been reported. We identified and partially characterized a novel PGRP-LE homologue, from Tenebrio molitor and analyzed its functional role in the survival of the insect against infection by a DAP-type PGN containing intracellular pathogen, L. monocytogenes. The cDNA is comprised of an open reading frame (ORF) of 990 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 329 residues. TmPGRP-LE contains one PGRP domain, but lacks critical residues for amidase activity.

40|$|Encapsulation is a nonspecific, {{cellular}} response {{through which}} insects {{defend themselves against}} multicellular pathogens. During this immune reaction, haemocytes recognize an object as foreign and cause other haemocytes to aggregate and form a capsule around the object, often consisting of melanized cells. The process of melanisation is accompanied by the formation of potentially toxic reactive oxygen species, which can kill not only pathogens but also host cells. In this study we tested whether the encapsulation response is costly in mealworm beetles Tenebrio molitor. We found a negative relationship between the duration of implantation via a nylon monofilament and remaining life span.

40|$|Males of {{many species}} adjust their {{reproductive}} behaviour {{according to the}} perceived risk of sperm competition. Although this phenomenon is widespread in insects and other animals, the mechanisms that allow mates to assess sperm competition levels remain largely unexplored. In this study, we analysed the mating behaviour of pairs of Tenebrio molitor beetles under three odour treatments representing increasing levels of sperm competition risk (SCR) and sperm competition intensity (SCI). Copula duration and male and female post-copulatory behaviour varied significantly with odour treatment. Both copula duration and post-copulatory associations (PCAs) increased significantly in odour treatments reflecting high male density.

Oxygen consumption measurements on protein extracts showed activity on L-tyrosine, L- 3, 4 -di-hydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and L-dopamine, indicating phenoloxidase as {{a key player in}} browning. Furthermore, no reaction on 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) was observed, ruling out an important contribution of laccase to browning. The browning reaction was most prominent at pH 6 for T. molitor and A. diaperinus, and 7 for H. illucens. As the enzyme activity of H. illucens was the lowest with the darkest color formation, this was likely caused by another factor.

In contrast, G. cuneata and G. polymorpha survived and sporulated under extended environmental conditions at {{the upper end of}} the temperature scale. The pattern of interspecific variation in the environmental tolerances of the exogenous gregarine stages is analogous to the pattern of interspecific variation in host stadium specificity observed in the corresponding endogenous gregarine stages...|$|R

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 301 : R 1838 -R 1845, 2011. First published September 14, 2011; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpregu. 00089. 2011. -The electrophysiological properties of the myogenic cardiac cells of insects have been analyzed, but the mechanisms that regulate the pacemaker activity have not been elucidated yet. In mammalian pacemaker cells, different types of membrane ion channels seem to be sequentially activated, perhaps in a cooperative fashion with the current generated by Ca 2 + extrusion mediated by the electrogenic Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger, which is sustained by the diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + release. The objective of the present work {{was to investigate the}} role of the SR function on the basal beating rate (BR), and BR modulation by extracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +](o)) and neurotransmitters in the in situ dorsal vessel (heart) of the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor. The main observations were as follows: 1) basal BR was reduced by 50 % by inhibition of SR function, but not affected by perfusion with CsCl or ZD 7288; 2) spontaneous activity was abolished by Cd 2 +; 3) a robust positive chronotropic response could be elicited to serotonin (5 -HT), but not to norepinephrine or carbamylcholine; 4) SR inhibition abolished the sustained chronotropic stimulation by [Ca 2 +](o) elevation and by 5 -HT, while the latter was unaffected by CsCl. It is concluded that, <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> heart, BR is markedly, but not exclusively, dependent on the SR function, and that BR control and modulation by both [Ca 2 +](o) and 5 -HT requires a functional SR...|$|E

40|$|The {{larval form}} of Tenebrio <b>molitor</b> (<b>T.</b> <b>molitor)</b> has been eaten in many {{countries}} and provides benefits as a new food source of protein for humans. However, no information exists regarding its safety for humans. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the genotoxicity and repeated dose oral toxicity of the freeze-dried powder of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> larvae. The genotoxic potential was evaluated by a standard battery test-ing: bacterial reverse mutation test, in vitro chromosome aberration test, and in vivo micronucleus test. To assess the repeated dose toxicity, the powder was administered once daily by oral gavage to Sprague-Daw-ley (SD) rats at dose levels of 0, 300, 1000 and 3000 mg/kg/day for 28 days. The parameters which were applied to the study were mortality, clinical signs, body and organ weights, food consumption, ophthalmol-ogy, urinalysis, hematology, serum chemistry, gross findings and histopathologic examination. The freeze-dried powder of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> larvae was not mutagenic or clastogenic based on results of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays.

40|$|The molecular-mass {{distribution}} of peptides from supernatants, {{obtained from the}} tissues of larvae Tenebrio molitor and goldfish Carassius auratus during cold acclimation, has been determined by chromatography. The results showed that peptide spectrum of the supernatants from larvae <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> and C. auratus varied during cold acclimation. The supernatants from non-acclimated larvae of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> and deacclimated fish possessed {{the highest number of}} peptide fractions. Furthermore, the cold-acclimated larvae of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> had the peptide fractions of the low molecular weight (ca. 5. 4 × 102 ÷ 22. 6 × 102 Da), and non-acclimated insects had the peptides of the high molecular weight (ca. 46. 8 × 102 ÷ 66 × 102 Da). Next, the organ-specific changes of the peptide composition of the goldfish during winter deacclimation have been revealed. Specifically, the low molecular weight peptides (ca. (14. 1 ± 0. 3) × 102 and (6. 75 ± 0. 25) × 102 Da), have been detected in the C. auratus muscles, and both the high (ca. (67. 83 ± 0. 21) × 102 (ca. 64. 16 ± 0. 26) × 102 Da) and low (ca.

40|$|A {{diuretic}} hormone {{of unusual}} structure was isolated from extracts of whole {{heads of the}} mealworm Tenebrio molitor. The hormone is a 37 -aa peptide of 4371 Da, with the sequence SPTISITAPIDVLRKTWEQERARKQMVKNREFLNSLN. This peptide increases cAMP production in Malpighian tubules of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor.</b> The amino acid sequence reveals that this peptide {{is a member of}} the family of sauvagine/corticotropin-releasing factor/urotensin I-related insect diuretic hormones.

When aligned comparably, <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> diuretic hormone has a more hydrophilic C terminus, leucylasparagine (free acid). In contrast to all other known diuretic hormones of this family, this peptide has exceptionally low stimulatory activity on cAMP production in Malpighian tubules of Manduca sexta.

40|$|Entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis indica and Steinernema riobrave, {{were tested}} for {{virulence}} and reproductive yield in Tenebrio molitor that were fed wheat bran diets with varying lipid- and protein-based supplements. Lipid supplements {{were based on}} 20 % canola oil, peanut, pork or salmon, or a low lipid control (5 % canola). Protein treatments consisted of basic supplement ingredients plus 0, 10, or 20 % egg white; a bran-only control was also included. Some diet supplements had positive effects on nematode quality, whereas others had negative or neutral effects. All supplements with 20 % lipids except canola oil caused increased <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> susceptibility to H. indica, whereas susceptibility to S. riobrave was not affected. Protein supplements did not affect host susceptibility, and neither lipid nor protein diet supplements affected reproductive capacity of either nematode species. Subsequently, we determined the pest control efficacy of progeny of nematodes that had been reared through <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> from different diets against Diaprepes abbreviatus and Otiorhynchus sulcatus. All nematode treatments reduced insect survival relative to the control (water only). Nematodes originating from <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> diets with the 0 % or 20 % protein exhibited lower efficacy versus D. abbreviatus than the intermediate level of protein (10 %) or bran-only treatments. Nematodes originating from <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> lipid or control diets {{did not differ in}} virulence.

40|$|A assincronia entre a dinâmica populacional de pragas e de seus inimigos naturais pode resultar em surtos populacionais de pragas. Isto se deve, dentre outros fatores, à ausência de predadores para a colonização das lavouras e, posteriormente, à falta de alimento para a sustentação desses insetos. O estabelecimento de inimigos naturais é, normalmente, mais lento e, atingem populações expressivas após os picos populacionais das pragas. A compreensão do papel das plantas na dinâmica populacional pode permitir a manipulação de predadores onívoros em sistemas agrícolas e melhorar a eficiência desses inimigos naturais. Supputius cincticeps (Stal) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) apresenta potencial para o controle biológico de pragas e, por isto, a morfologia das glândulas salivares, as características reprodutivas e os parâmetros das tabelas de fertilidade e esperança de vida desse predador foram estudadas com diferentes plantas e pupas de Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) em laboratório. Os tratamentos foram: T 1 - folhas de eucalipto + pupas de <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, <b>T</b> 2 - folhas de soja + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, <b>T</b> 3 - folhas de feijão + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, <b>T</b> 4 - folhas de algodoeiro + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água, <b>T</b> 5 - folhas de tomateiro + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água e T 6 - <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> + água (testemunha). Os casais de S. cincticeps receberam água, diariamente, e duas pupas de <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> três a quatro vezes por semana. Morfologicamente, o sistema salivar de S. cincticeps é constituído por um par de glândulas salivares principais e outro de glândulas acessórias, no protórax. As principais são bilobadas com lóbulo {{anterior}} esférico, menor que o posterior que apresenta forma de saco alongado e as acessórias, longas e tubulares originando-se na porção terminal do ducto acessório, que sofre um abaulamento. Quanto aos parâmetros reprodutivos, o número de ovos por fêmea de S. cincticeps foi menor sem planta que nos demais tratamentos e o de ninfas por fêmea, maior em folhas de eucalipto, soja, feijão ou algodoeiro que com tomateiro ou sem planta. As taxas líquidas de reprodução (Ro) de fêmeas de S. cincticeps foram maiores com folhas de eucalipto (68, 39), soja (57, 28) ou feijão (58, 69) e menor sem planta com 15, 06 fêmeas produzidas por fêmea. As taxas intrínsecas de crescimento (rm) foram maiores com folhas de eucalipto (0, 10) ou de soja (0, 10) e menor sem planta com 0, 07 fêmeas/fêmea de S. cincticeps acrescentadas à população por dia. A razão finita de aumento populacional (&# 955;) foi maior com folhas de soja (1, 11), eucalipto (1, 11) ou feijão (1, 10) e menor sem planta com 1, 07 fêmeas/fêmea de S. cincticeps acrescentadas à população por dia. Plantas de eucalipto, soja ou feijão melhoraram as características biológicas de S. cincticeps, o que é importante para esse predador no controle biológico de pragas nessas culturas. No entanto, o impacto negativo de plantas de tomateiro indica que o controle biológico de pragas nessa cultura com S. cincticeps pode ter baixa eficiência. The asynchrony between {{population dynamics}} of pests and their natural enemies {{may lead to}} population outbreaks of pests. This is due, among other factors {{to the absence of}} predators for the colonization of crops and, subsequently, the lack of food to sustain these natural enemies. The establishment of natural enemies is usually slower and reaches significant populations after peak of pests. Understanding the role of plants in population dynamics may allow for the manipulation of omnivorous predators in agricultural systems and improve the efficiency of natural enemies. Supputius cincticeps (Stal) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) has potential for biological pest controls. The objective of this research was to study the morphology of salivary glands, reproductive characteristics and parameters of fertility and life expectancy tables of the predator S. cincticeps with different plants and Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) pupae in the laboratory. The treatments were: T 1 - eucalyptus leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 2 - soybean leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 3 - bean leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 4 - cotton leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water, T 5 - tomato leaves + <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water and T 6 - <b>T</b> <b>molitor</b> pupae + water (control). The pairs of S. cincticeps received water daily, and two pupae of <b>T.</b> <b>molitor</b> three to four times a week. The salivary system of S. cincticeps is formed by a pair of principal glands and another pair of accessory glands in the prothorax. The principal glands are bilobed with a spherical anterior lobe, which is smaller than the posterior lobe that presents a prolonged sack form. The accessory glands present a long and tubular form that arises from the terminal portion of the accessory duct that suffers a camber. The number of eggs per female of S. cincticeps was lowest without plants. The number of nymphs per female was higher in eucalyptus, soybean, bean and cotton leaves than in tomato leaves and without plants. The net reproductive rates (Ro) of females S. cincticeps were highest on eucalyptus (68. 39), soybean (57. 28) and bean (58. 69) leaves, and lowest without plants with 15. 06 females added per female of this predator. The intrinsic rates of increase (rm) were highest with eucalyptus (0. 10) and soybean (0. 10) leaves, and lowest without plants with 0. 07 females/female of S. cincticeps added to the population per day. The finite rate of increase (&# 955;) was highest with soybean (1. 11), eucalyptus (1. 11) and bean (1. 10) leaves, and lowest without plants with 1. 07 females/female of S. cincticeps added to the population per day. Eucalyptus, soybean and bean plants improved the biological characteristics of S. cincticeps which is important for this predator in the biological control of pests in these crops. However, the negative impact of tomato plants indicates that the biological control of pests in this culture with S. cincticeps may have low efficiency...|$|R

Supplementation of 10 – 20 % wheat bran (Formulae  2, 3) or 10 % feces (Formula  4) significantly increased total fruitbody yield, so that the biological efficiency was raised to over 51.56 %. Supplementation of 20 % (Formula  5) or 10 % feces plus 10 % wheat bran (Formula  6) resulted in the highest biological efficiency of over 61.10 % which was not only significantly higher than Formula  1 but also higher than the 10 – 20 % wheat bran supplementation formula and the 10 % feces supplementation formula.
