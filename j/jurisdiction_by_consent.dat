5000|$|The article {{provides}} three different methods of reaching {{a choice of}} forum agreement, which can be both formal and less formal, consistent with commercial practice. The first route to reach a choice of forum agreement, is through ‘writing or evidenced in writing’; consistent with the above-mentioned purpose however, {{the mere fact that}} for instance a clause conferring jurisdiction is printed among the general conditions on the reverse of the contract, is not sufficient on its own, since “no guarantee is thereby given that the other party has really consented”. Second, one can reach a choice of forum agreement 'in a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves'; in this situation, an oral agreement can for example be sufficient, if it [...] "forms part of a continuing trading relationship" [...] and that [...] "the dealings taken as a whole are governed by the general conditions of the party giving the confirmation". Indeed, in that scenario, it would be [...] "contrary to good faith" [...] for the recipient of the confirmation to deny the existence of a <b>jurisdiction</b> conferred <b>by</b> <b>consent,</b> [...] "even if he had given no acceptance in writing". The third way to prorogate jurisdiction is, in the hypothesis of international trade or commerce, through a 'form which accords with a usage of which parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such a trade or commerce is widely known'.|$|R

He considered it {{part of the first}} principle, consent governs policy decisions, but many people misunderstood that elections of people to roles and responsibilities are allocations of resources and thus policy decisions. To emphasize the importance of making these decisions <b>by</b> <b>consent</b> in the circle meetings, Endenburg separated it into a fourth principle.|$|R
