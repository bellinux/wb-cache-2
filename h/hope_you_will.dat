25|$|Well, John {{has been}} on hunger strike since July. He {{resisted}} the forcible feeding for a good while, but submitted to the inevitable. Now he is being fed by a stomach tube twice daily. He has aged very much and has {{the look of a}} man who is going through torture... Seemingly anything is law in regard to John. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> make the atrocity public. We must get him out of their clutches. It is nothing but slow murder...|$|E
25|$|Welsh, {{when talking}} to the press, always stated {{that he was a}} vegetarian. This was always {{received}} with a mixture of interest and jest from his opponent and the journalists. Welsh was a vegetarian for its health values, inspired by the writings of Bernarr Macfadden, and showed no interest in animal welfare. When Welsh beat Phil Brock, he received a telegram from Macfadden stating 'Mr. Welsh - Dear Sir: <b>Hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> go through the whole bunch of meat eaters'.|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

500|$|The Junta {{reconfirmed}} the order, but excluded {{the bishop}} of Córdoba, Rodrigo de Orellana, who was banished instead. Castelli was commissioned by the Junta to enforce the execution order. Mariano Moreno said, [...] "Go, Castelli, and I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not incur the same weakness as our general, if not yet fulfilled the determination, Larrea will go, and finally I'll go myself if necessary". Ocampo and Chiclana were demoted. Castelli's assistants were Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, elected as secretary, his former client Diego Paroissien as a campaign doctor, and Domingo French {{as head of the}} escort.|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi celebrated Harrison's 25th {{birthday}} and Harrison played sitar. He gave Harrison an upside-down plastic globe {{of the world}} and said: [...] "George, the globe I am giving you symbolizes the world today. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> help us all in the task of putting it right." [...] Harrison immediately turned the globe to its correct position, shouting, [...] "I've done it!" [...] (Harrison [...] "affectionately" [...] referred to the Maharishi as the [...] "Big M"). On 8 April, the Maharishi gave an Indian prince's outfit to the Lennons for their son in England on his birthday. McCartney was uncomfortable with the Maharishi's flattery, including calling the band [...] "the blessed leaders of the world's youth".|$|E
500|$|In October 1970 Shankar became {{chair of}} the {{department}} of Indian music of the California Institute of the Arts after previously teaching at the City College of New York, the University of California, Los Angeles, and being guest lecturer at other colleges and universities, including the Ali Akbar College of Music. In late 1970, the London Symphony Orchestra invited Shankar to compose a concerto with sitar. Concerto for Sitar & Orchestra was performed with André Previn as conductor and Shankar playing the sitar. Shankar performed at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. After the musicians had tuned up on stage for over a minute, the crowd of rock-music fans broke into applause, to which the amused Shankar responded: [...] "If you like our tuning so much, I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> enjoy the playing more." [...] Although interest in Indian music had decreased in the early 1970s, the live album from the concert became one of the best-selling recordings to feature the genre and won Shankar a second Grammy Award.|$|E

500|$|Potter {{borrowed}} a cat, {{and took a}} pet rabbit to Fawe Park as models. Her meticulous preparation before finalizing an illustration was noted {{in a letter to}} Warne: [...] "I think I have done every imaginable rabbit background and miscellaneous sketches as well – about seventy! [...] I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> like them, though rather scribbled." [...] Scribbled or not, the work is of the highest quality with the sketches of onions and red carnations (which were dropped as the frontispiece) being chief examples. The illustrations communicate her obvious appreciation and love for the humble pots, onions, and flowers of the garden. [...] Many of the objects in the illustrations [...] the gate, the potting shed, the wall [...] have changed little over the years and are recognizable today from her illustrations. Aware the type of story she was writing was set primarily in colours of fawn, brown, and soft green, Potter wrote that, [...] "the (red) handkerchief will make a good bit of colour all through the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{speculation}} of rifts between Dempsey and Pompeo, {{and even}} show runner Rhimes, the former maintained his stance of leaving in a [...] "very good" [...] place with his co-star of ten years. On his relationships with Pompeo in particular, he said [...] "it’s beautiful. We’re like a married couple. It’s 10 years, {{and it was}} magic from the beginning. Chemistry right away.” He thanked his fans on Twitter and wrote, [...] "I {{want to thank all}} the fans, what an incredible 11 yrs, I love you all." [...] Rhimes asserted on the importance of Dempsey's character in the statement she released at his departure: “Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character—for Meredith, for me and for the fans. I absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ‘McDreamy.’ As Ellis Grey would say: the carousel never stops turning.” Pompeo too took to Twitter to react to the death of Shepherd and wrote, [...] "I am honored and excited {{to tell the story of}} how Meredith goes on in the face of what feels like the impossible. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> all join me on her journey.” It was the first time she spoke out publicly about Dempsey's publicised exit.|$|E
500|$|His {{work as a}} {{composer}} was much esteemed during his lifetime but is not well known today. The Crucifixion {{is one of the}} few major works of his that is still regularly performed. It is often given in Anglican churches during Holy Week and forms part of the repertoire of numerous choirs. He also made a lasting contribution to the music of Christmas in his Christmas Carols New and Old (1871), produced in collaboration with the Revd. H. R. Bramley, which marked an important stage in the revival of the Christmas carol. The book includes Stainer's arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of [...] "What Child Is This", [...] "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen", [...] "Good King Wenceslas", [...] "The First Nowell", and [...] "I Saw Three Ships", among others. He was a skilled musician and accompanist and Walter Galpin Alcock, who was taught composition by Arthur Sullivan at the National Training School for Music, recalls Sullivan saying [...] "I was at St Paul's yesterday, listening to Dr Stainer extemporising. My dear young friends, he is a genius, and I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> miss no chance of hearing him." [...] John Stainer was also a close friend of Edmund Hart Turpin, the later Hon. Secr. of the Royal College of Organists for more than fifty years.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a queer sort, Tavernake," [...] he declared. [...] "You take life plaguy seriously. I only <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>'ll</b> get {{all out of}} it {{you expect}} to. So long!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On April 8, 2014, Marvel Entertainment {{released}} a teaser trailer featuring characters from Disney Infinity interacting with Captain America's shield. D23, the official Disney fan club, originally {{reported that the}} game would be released in August 2014. This statement was later removed, as representatives of the site said [...] "we erroneously reported about {{the launch of the}} next chapter of Disney Infinity. This information was incorrect. More news about Disney Infinity will be shared on April 30, and we <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> check back for that update." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 18, 1945, Mrs. Edward S. Shaw, {{sister of}} Carpenter’s widow Clara, wrote to Admiral King, then Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet (who had {{commanded}} Lexington when Carpenter had commanded VS-3B) {{suggesting that a}} ship be named for the late leader of VP-5F’s historic flight in 1933, citing the “sincere respect” her brother-in-law had felt for King. “I sincerely <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not consider me presumptuous,” she wrote, “but if you could lend your approval to such an honor for ‘Doc’ as we all knew him, I would appreciate it very much.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In Parliament, Law {{introduced}} the so-called [...] "new style" [...] of speaking, with harsh, accusatory rhetoric, which dominates British politics to this day. This {{was as a}} counter to Arthur Balfour, known for his [...] "masterly witticisms", because the party felt they needed a warrior-like figure. Law did not particularly enjoy his tougher manner, and at the State Opening of Parliament in February 1912 apologised directly to Asquith for his coming speech, saying, [...] "I am afraid I shall have to show myself very vicious, Mr Asquith, this session. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> understand." [...] Law's [...] "warrior king" [...] figure helped unify the divided Conservatives into a single body, with him as the leader.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a medical}} missionary, Dr. Cadbury cared greatly for his patients. A saying he tightly adhered to was: [...] "Doctors cannot leave their patients, just like farmers cannot leave their land.” His {{dedication}} to helping his patients - and the Canton {{people on a}} larger scale - showed in his philanthropic endeavors. Even during his breaks in the USA, he urged other doctors and specialists to become missionaries and help the disadvantaged in China. In a 1925 speech in the USA, he said:"Don't waste time in America; help human beings dying without a doctor, without medicine. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> ask many to pray for those unhappy people."Though few people remember the name [...] "William Warder Cadbury," [...] his efforts undeniably led to the improvement of the health of thousands in Canton, China during the years of the Republic of China.|$|E
2500|$|The concert {{begins with}} Harrison {{taking to the}} stage alone and {{addressing}} the audience, his comment [...] "We've got a good show lined up – well, I hope so anyway..." [...] alluding to {{the speed with which}} the event was organised. He then introduces the first group of musicians, led by Shankar, who, like Harrison, attempts to convey the intricacies of Indian classical music to the audience, as well as outlining the reason for this [...] "special benefit concert". Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan proceed to tune their instruments and then stop after about 90 seconds. The audience, apparently believing they have heard an entire piece, respond with enthusiastic applause, to which Shankar replies: [...] "Thank you, if you appreciate the tuning so much, I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> enjoy the playing more." [...] The four musicians then launch into a fifteen-minute dhun.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know, we 've {{been expecting}} it. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>'ll</b> be very happy, Tom;" [...] and Polly shook his {{hands with a}} smile that was more pathetic than a flood of tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is another}} matter," [...] Hayes resumed. [...] "Mr. Bell {{is willing to}} take up Harkness' tenancy of the coal yard and seed store at the station. He <b>hopes</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> grant him a long lease." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your uncle bids me {{say that}} he <b>hopes</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> come over and shoot [...] the Puddinghall coverts with Humphry and John. They propose Thursday [...] next but would alter the day if that does not suit.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 November 2007, Huhne made {{remarks about}} the Speaker of the House of Commons on the BBC {{television}} programme Newsnight in which he claimed that the Speaker, Michael Martin, had fallen asleep during a speech by the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. [...] "The Speaker unfortunately fell asleep during Gordon Brown's speech... I'm not sure I'm allowed to say that, but he reacted in an entirely understandable way to what was not the most riveting of parliamentary occasions." [...] After the remarks were repeated in several publications, Huhne made a public apology to the Speaker in the House of Commons on 8 November in which he withdrew his prior comments. [...] "It was wrong of me to draw the Chair into a matter of political dispute. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> accept I intended no personal offence and fully withdraw my comments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Controversy {{seemed to}} trail {{him during his}} prelacies. [...] He loved pageantry, {{creating}} speculation that he had high church views. [...] However, when a high church priest protested that incense was needed for curing souls, Creighton burst out, [...] "And you think that souls like herring cannot be cured without smoke?" [...] His moderate views—equally opposed to radical evangelicals and conservative Anglo-Catholics—endeared him to Queen Victoria. [...] Creighton's work ethic, though, was anything but moderate. [...] He seldom refused offers of additional responsibility, confessing more than once to both an abiding fatalism about being saddled with more responsibility and guilt about shirking from it. [...] Perhaps recognising this, a canon of St Paul's, while welcoming Creighton to the diocese of London in 1897, ominously remarked, [...] "It is a frightful burden to lay on you: I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> use up everybody except yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{while he}} enjoyed the {{confidence}} of Queen Mary of Modena, {{it was clear that}} he was growing uncomfortable under the recently enthroned James: the violently hostile reception he got from the public when he gave evidence at the Trial of the Seven Bishops left him badly shaken. When he urged James to put away his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, James said that he had not realised Sunderland was his confessor, and told him to mind his own business for the future. Sunderland's unpopularity was now almost universal: Burnet wrote that it was [...] "the wonder of all mankind" [...] that James continued to employ him. He was summarily dismissed at last in October 1688, with the remark, [...] "You have your pardon; much good doe it you. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be more faithful to your next master than you have been to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I haven't {{effected}} very much; I {{have only}} cared and <b>hoped.</b> <b>You</b> <b>will</b> {{do more than}} I have ever done--you and Olive Chancellor, because you are young and bright, brighter than I ever was; and besides, everything has got started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me, what's {{the good}} of being a Southerner?" [...] the lady asked. [...] "Olive told me to tell <b>you</b> she <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> stay to dinner. And if she said it, she does really hope it. She is willing to risk that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{well aware}} of that, my friend; but I am not so certain that you would. In that boat, I am in <b>hopes</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> follow us out to sea, and come on board again, and take your old place as master." ...|$|R
