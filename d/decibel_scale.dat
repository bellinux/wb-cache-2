5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the <b>decibel</b> <b>scale</b> is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

2500|$|The self-noise or {{equivalent}} input noise level {{is the sound}} level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does {{in the absence of}} sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a <b>decibel</b> <b>scale</b> frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: [...] "15dBA SPL" [...] (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20dBA SPL or 32dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and Røde that advertise noise levels between 5–7dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the A-weighting curve while broadband noise may be increased.|$|E
50|$|Sound level may be metered {{on several}} ways: Average, maximum level (with the {{sound level meter}} set to Fast, Slow, Impulse, or Peak), etc. In addition, there are several <b>decibel</b> <b>scales.</b> Therefore, the <b>decibels</b> on the {{following}} list are not necessarily comparable.|$|R
25|$|There are two {{different}} scales used when expressing a ratio in decibels depending {{on the nature of}} the quantities: field quantity ratio or power quantity ratio. (Field quantity ratio is also referred to as root-power ratio or amplitude ratio.) When expressing power quantities, the number of decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities. That is, a change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10dB change in level. When expressing field quantities, a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20dB change in level. The extra factor of two is due to the logarithm of the quadratic relationship between power and amplitude. The <b>decibel</b> <b>scales</b> differ so that direct comparisons can be made between related power and field quantities when they are expressed in decibels.|$|R

40|$|Easy PC Graphics (GFI) is a {{graphical}} plot {{program that}} permits {{data to be}} easily and flexibly plotted. Data is input in a standard format which allows easy data entry and evaluation. Multiple dependent axes are also supported.

Instead, the internationally used <b>decibel</b> (dB) <b>scale</b> is most common. In some cases where there's a desire for a non-logarithmic scale, the decibel-related sone scale is used.

The present study tested physiological responses to natural urban soundscapes, using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and vector cardiogram. City-based recordings were matched in overall sound level (71 <b>decibel</b> A-weighted <b>scale),</b> but differed on ratings of pleasantness and vibrancy. Listening to soundscapes evoked significant activity in a number of auditory brain regions. Compared with soundscapes that evoked no (neutral) emotional response, those evoking a pleasant or unpleasant emotional response engaged an additional neural circuit including the right amygdala. Ratings of vibrancy had little effect overall, and brain responses were more sensitive to pleasantness than was heart rate.

5000|$|Sound {{pressure}} is the difference, {{in a given}} medium, between average local pressure and the pressure in the sound wave. A square of this difference (i.e., a square of the deviation from the equilibrium pressure) is usually averaged over time and/or space, and a square root of this average provides a root mean square (RMS) value. For example, 1 Pa RMS sound pressure (94 dBSPL) in atmospheric air implies that the actual pressure in the sound wave oscillates between (1 atm [...] Pa) and (1 atm [...] Pa), that is between 101323.6 and 101326.4 Pa.As the human ear can detect sounds {{with a wide range}} of amplitudes, sound {{pressure is}} often measured as a level on a logarithmic <b>decibel</b> <b>scale.</b> The sound pressure level (SPL) or Lp is defined as ...|$|E

40|$|EVER SINCE the iPhone was {{introduced}} in 2007, projected-capacitive (pro-cap) touch-screen technology has been adopted in a growing range of applications. However, integrating a pro-cap touch sensor into a touch-screen device is still a challenging problem, especially {{with respect to the}} noise generated by the liquid-crystal display (LCD), peripherals, and environment. One of the most promising solutions is to make use of a high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) touch-screen controller to combat the noise problem. A high-SNR controller also has a number of other benefits that will be explored here. SNR is defined as the power ratio between a signal (meaningful information) and the background noise (unwanted signal). If the signal and noise are measured across the same impedance, the SNR can be obtained by calculating the square of the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude values. The numeric ratio of the power values (PS/PN) is often so large that it is best described using the logarithmic <b>decibel</b> (dB) <b>scale.</b> SNR can therefore be expressed a...|$|R
40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this analysis, noise can be described as sound that is undesired, in terms of its loudness (amplitude) and frequency (pitch). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies, a frequency dependant rating relates noise to human hearing sensitivity. This is called the A‐weighted <b>decibel</b> (dBA) <b>scale.</b> This scale accounts for the human perception of a doubling of loudness as an increase of 10 dBA. Therefore, a 70 ‐dBA sound level will sound twice as loud as a 60 ‐dBA sound level. People generally cannot detect differences of 1 to 2 dBA between noise sources of a similar nature (e. g., an increase in traffic noise compared to existing traffic noise); however, under ideal listening conditions, differences of 2 or 3 dBA can be detected by some people. Most people under normal listening conditions would probably perceive a 5 ‐dBA change. Typical sound levels in dBA are shown on Table 3. 6 ‐ 1. Noise levels that vary with time are often described in terms of the equivalent sound level (Leq). The Leq is the average steady‐state sound level that, in a stated period of time, contains the same acoustic energy as the time‐varying sound level during the same time period. Because Leq is similar to average sound level, it is important to identify the time period being considered...|$|R

This chapter provides information on the existing noise environment, impacts associated {{with the development of}} the Project, impacts upon the Project site, and mitigation measures to ensure compliance with State and local criteria. 13. 1. 1 Characteristics of Environmental Noise Sound is mechanical energy transmitted by pressure waves in a compressible medium such as air. Noise can be defined as unwanted sound. Sound is characterized by various parameters that include the rate of oscillation of sound waves (frequency), the speed of propagation, and the pressure level or energy content (amplitude). In particular, the sound pressure level is the most common descriptor used to characterize the loudness of an ambient sound level. The <b>decibel</b> (dB) <b>scale</b> is used to quantify sound intensity. Because sound pressure can vary enormously within the range of human hearing, a logarithmic loudness scale is used to keep sound intensity numbers at a convenient and manageable level. The human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies in the entire spectrum, so noise measurements are weighted more heavily for frequencies to which humans are sensitive in a process called A-weighting, which is written “dBA. ” In general, human sound perception is such that a change in sound level of 3 dB is just noticeable; a change of 5 dB is clearly noticeable; and a change of 10 dB is perceived as doubling or halving sound level...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{evaluate}} the structure/function relationship between visual field sensitivity and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measured by StratusOCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) and GDx VCC (Laser Diagnostic Technologies, Inc., San Diego, CA). METHODS. Eighty-nine subjects (27 who had healthy eyes, 21 who were glaucoma suspect, 41 who had glaucoma) {{were enrolled in}} this cross-sectional study. RNFL thickness was measured using the StratusOCT and the GDx VCC, and visual field (VF) was examined using the Humphrey VF analyzer. The relationship between RNFL thickness and VF sensitivity-expressed in terms of mean deviation (MD) in <b>decibel</b> (dB) <b>scale,</b> unlogged 1 /lambert (L), and Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) and Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) VF scores-were evaluated with linear and non-linear regression models. Coefficient of determination (R 2) was calculated, and regression models were compared using the Akaike information criterion and the F test. RESULTS. In plotting MD against RNFL thickness, curvilinear regression models demonstrated the best fit, whereas linear regression attained the best associations when VF sensitivity was xpressed in 1 /L. However, when healthy subjects {{were excluded from the}} analyses, the second-order polynomial was better than linear regression in describing the relation between 1 /L and GDx VCC-measured RNFL thickness. Regression profiles between AGIS/CIGTS VF scores and RNFL thickness were best described in the linear and the first-order inverse models for GDx VCC and StratusOCT RNFL measurements, respectively. In general, StratusOCT RNFL measurements achieved higher associations with visual function in all the respective regression analyses than did GDx VCC. CONCLUSIONS. Description of structure/function relationships in glaucoma depends on the choice of perimetry scale, the type of RNFL measuring device, and the characteristics of the studied groups. The higher association with visual function in StratusOCT RNFL measurements compared with that in GDx VCC suggested optical coherence tomography might be a better approach for evaluating structure/function relationships. Curvilinear regression profiles found between StratusOCT RNFL thickness and MD/VF scores provide an explanation for those longitudinal observations, showing that VFs with higher AGIS/CIGTS VF scores or worse MD at baseline are at higher risk for deterioration. Regression analysis of the structure/function profile could provide important information in the assessment of the trend and pattern of glaucoma progression.

40|$|A {{number of}} the {{proposals}} for supporting a Galileo S-band (2. 3 -GHz) mission involve arraying several antennas to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (and bit rate) obtainable from a given set of antennas. Arraying {{is no longer a}} new idea, having been used successfully during the Voyager encounters with Uranus and Neptune. However, arraying for Galileo's tour of Jupiter is complicated by Jupiter's strong radio emission, which produces correlated noise effects. This article discusses the general problem of correlated noise due to a planet, or other radio source, and applies the results to the specific case of an array of antennas at the DSN's Tidbinbilla, Australia, complex (DSS 42, DSS 43, DSS 45, and the yet-to-be-built DSS 34). The effects of correlated noise are highly dependent on the specific geometry of the array and on the spacecraft-planet configuration; in some cases, correlated noise effects produce an enhancement, rather than a degradation, of the signal-to-noise ratio. For the case considered here [...] an array of the DSN's Australian antennas observing Galileo and Jupiter [...] there are three regimes of interest. If the spacecraft-planet separation is approximately less than 75 arcsec, the average effect of correlated noise is a loss of signal to noise (approximately 0. 2 dB as the spacecraft-planet separation approaches zero).
