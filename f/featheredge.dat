50|$|Designing the bridge, Proskouriakov {{proposed}} a new constructive solution — an original trussed girder. By using <b>featheredge</b> design for its upper chord (similar to Schwedler truss), Proskouriakov extended {{the height of}} the main trusses up to 21.64 m. The engineer also utilized the theory of influence lines for truss analysis that enabled more accurate calculation of internal forces in every member in a truss due to moving loads. Since then, the theory of influence lines for truss analysis has been used in engineering both in Russia and around the world. Incidentally, the Yenisei bridge was the first in Russia, during the construction of which the incremental launching method was applied for the first time.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the geology and {{ground-water}} resources of the lower South Platte River valley {{was made by the}} Ground Water Branch of the U. S. Geological Survey {{at the request of the}} U. S. Bureau of Reclamation and with the endorsement of the Colorado Water Conservation Board. The area includes parts of Colorado and Nebraska, covers about 3, 200 square miles, and ranges in altitude from about 3, 000 to 5, 000 feet above sea level. The average annual precipitation in the area is about 16 inches and is sufficient to support grasses and some grains. Irrigation utilizing water diverted from the river and pumped from wells is extensively developed in the valleys of the South Platte River and its tributaries. The principal agricultural products are Corn, sugar beets, alfalfa, beans, wheat, barley, and livestock. The rocks exposed in the area are sedimentary and range in age from Late Cretaceous to Recent. The Pierre shale underlies the entire area. The Fox Hills sandstone and the Laramie formation underlie the western part and the Chadron, Brule, and Ogallala formations underlie the eastern part. Pleistocene arid Recent alluvium underlies the valleys of the South Platte River and its tributaries. The Pierre shale ranges in thickness from about 2, 500 feet near Paxton, Nebr., to about 6, 500 feet near Hardin, Colo., and yields water in small quantities to wells in the vicinity of Sterling, Colo. Within the area, both the Fox Hills sandstone and the Laramie formation range in thickness from a <b>featheredge</b> to nearly 200 feet and yield small quantities of water to stock and domestic wells. Although a test hole near Proctor, Colo., was drilled 102 feet into the Chadron formation, the total thickness of the formation was not ascertained; no wells within the area covered by this investigation are known to derive water from the formation. The Brule formation ranges in thickness from a <b>featheredge</b> to more than 500 feet and yields water to wells from fractured or porous zones. The Ogallala formation ranges in thickness from a <b>featheredge</b> near Sedgwick, Colo., to about 350 feet near Paxton, Nebr., and yields large quantities of water to wells. The alluvium ranges in thickness from a <b>featheredge</b> at the edges of valleys to about 300 feet in some places in the valleys. The alluvium occurs in two physiographic forms Pleistocene and Recent terrace deposits and Recent floodplain deposits and yields abundant water to irrigation, public-supply, and other wells. Dune-sand deposits cover part of the area, range in thickness from a <b>featheredge</b> to about 100 feet, and yield water in small quantities to stock and domestic wells. Loess deposits cover much of the area and range in thickness from a <b>featheredge</b> to about 50 feet. Generally the loess is above the water table and is not known to yield water to wells...|$|E
40|$|During Ocean Drilling Program Leg 152, Sites 914 through 919 were drilled on the {{southeast}} Greenland Margin along a transect {{from the middle}} shelf into the adjacent deep-water Irminger Basin 500 km south of the Iceland hot-spot track (Iceland-Greenland Ridge). Sites 915 through 918 penetrated the entire cover of postrift sediments, and three of these four sites sampled the volcanic basement of the seaward-dipping reflector sequences (SDRS). The landward <b>featheredge</b> of the SDRS was drilled at the most landward site, Site 917, where a 779. 5 -m-thick, south to southeastward dipping volcanic section was found to over-lie steeply dipping, marine pre-rift sediments of unknown, possibly Cretaceous, age. The more seaward Site 915 (later deep-ened by Site 990) recovered two lava flows that are stratigraphically located above Site 917 and located within the oldest part of the main SDRS wedge. The {{central part of the}} SDRS wedge was penetrated at Site 918 in the Irminger Basin where a 120 -m-thick lava section was recovered below 1189 m of postrift sediments. A few sills and dikes were sampled. All other igneous units recovered were subaerially erupted and deposited lavas, some of which may have flowed over wet ground or into shallow water. Lavas at Site 917 display compositions ranging from picrite over olivine basalt to basalt, dacite, and acid tuffs. The younger lavas at Site 915 and Site 918 have a quite uniform composition similar to depleted Icelandic tholeiites. Two major successions are defined: the older Continental Succession and the younger Oceanic Succession. The Continental Succession comprises the Lower and Middle Series lavas at Site 917, and the Oceanic Succession comprises the Uppers Series lavas at Sit...|$|E
40|$|The Middle Devonian Marcellus Shale is {{a natural}} gas {{producing}} formation that was deposited in the Appalachian foreland basin {{in what is now}} eastern North America. An unconformity truncates the Marcellus in southern West Virginia and progressively younger units onlap progressively older units. The zero isopach line that marks the edge of the Marcellus is mapped to reveal the southeastern boundary. A well production analysis is conducted to locate the region of maximum natural gas production. Four lithologic completions intervals in three different well fields are compared. This study shows that the most economically viable drilling is from the Marcellus Shale completion intervals that are less than 30 feet in Chapmanville gas field in western Logan County, West Virginia. Outside of the zero isopach are areas comprised of onlapping <b>featheredges</b> of younger formations that comprise a black shale unit mistakenly identified as “Marcellus Shale. ” These areas produce significantly less gas than the “true” Marcellus Shale.
