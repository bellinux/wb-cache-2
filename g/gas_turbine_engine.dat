25|$|A {{combustor}} is {{a component}} or {{area of a}} gas turbine, ramjet, or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It {{is also known as}} a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>engine,</b> the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E
25|$|The AI-20 was {{the first}} <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> {{developed}} by the design bureau led by Oleksandr Ivchenko based at Zaporizhia, USSR, which had previously concentrated on small piston engines such as the Ivchenko AI-14 and AI-26 radials. It {{was designed as a}} prospective powerplant for the new, large Ilyushin Il-18 airliner and the Antonov An-10, to be powered by four turboprops, in competition with the Kuznetsov NK-4 engines. Both engines were tested on the preproduction batch of 20 Il-18s, but the Ivchenko engine was chosen for full production, possibly due to a crash caused by an inflight failure of an NK-4 engine, and possibly due to the desire for the engines of the Ukrainian An-10 to also be built in Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|A 1980 AMC Concord {{served as}} the test vehicle in s {{conceptual}} design study of the automotive Improved Gas Turbine (IGT) powertrain. Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>engine,</b> while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the vehicle, transmission, drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with variable power turbine nozzle, and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced maintenance and repairs, would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{diffuser}} is to slow the high speed, highly compressed, air from the compressor to a velocity optimal for the combustor. Reducing the velocity results in an unavoidable loss in total pressure, {{so one of the}} design challenges is to limit the loss of pressure as much as possible. Furthermore, the diffuser must be designed to limit the flow distortion as much as possible by avoiding flow effects like boundary layer separation. Like most other <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> components, the diffuser is designed to be as short and light as possible.|$|E

2500|$|The Sud-Ouest Djinn was {{the first}} tip-jet {{propelled}} rotorcraft to enter production. As such, the propulsion system involved a Turbomeca Palouste <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> that drove a pump to produce compressed air, which was in turn fed into the aircraft's hollow rotor blades to exit at their tips, inducing the blades to turn as a consequence. The rotor hub assembly, which freely oscillated around a spherical thrust bearing, was mounted upon a steel pylon via means of a ball joint and rubber shock absorbers. Unlike some of the experimental tip-jet designs of the era, a 'cold' tip-jet approach was used, meaning {{that there was no}} combustion activity present at the exhaust nozzles installed at the ends of the rotor blades. Consequently, the nozzles produced little noise in their operation, and were claimed by Sud-Ouest to be [...] "noiseless".|$|E
