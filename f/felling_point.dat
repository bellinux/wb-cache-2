It consists in finding one feasible route for each vehicle in order to satisfy the demands of the customers and in such a way that the total transport cost is minimised. We use a mathematical formulation of the log truck {{scheduling problem}} that is a generalised set partitioning problem. We then apply a column generation algorithm for solving the LP relaxed model and a branch and price algorithm for obtaining integer solutions. Numerical results from Swedish forestry companies are presented. 2 Introduction The wood flow planning in Swedish forestry is a complex process. Therefore, it is treated on several levels: strategic, tactical and operative level. While the strategic level treats the problem within a time horizon of one year, the operative planning is a short term one that consists of the daily transportation of logs. This in turn is done in two steps, primary transportation which involves moving the harvested logs from the actual <b>felling</b> <b>point</b> to piles situated close to the roads and secondary transportation where logs are transporte...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fell's</b> <b>Point</b> Wooden Houses. Once {{a staple}} of the Baltimore landscape, wooden houses from the late eighteenth century are now endangered. <b>Fell's</b> <b>Point</b> has the highest {{collection}} of remaining wooden structures with eight. In 1799, the fear of fire prompted city officials to prohibit building new structures of wood within the city center. Although the ordinance didn't apply to <b>Fell's</b> <b>Point,</b> new construction was primarily down with brick, as in downtown Baltimore. The houses were identified from the late 1700s by Stacy Patterson from Baltimore Heritage in 2006.|$|R
