5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's {{a big deal to}} be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

She stated that [...] "It is a songs that I listen to and wish I had written. It’s really so special. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people have found strength and hope in the lyrics. It's been really rewarding to meet and talk to people at our meet and greet events come up and {{tell me how much}} that song means to them and how it has helped them". Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy {{a long time to}} figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people feel like that." [...] In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E
5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Falchuk {{stated that}} season four will not revolve around relationships {{as much as}} past seasons, commenting, [...] "Relationships in general will be less of a focus this year, <b>I</b> personally <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of these characters are more interesting not in relationships. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of them we will be exploring that. Whether they break up or not, we’re really focused on giving them more individual stories." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Down to Earth" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber, Mason [...] "MdL" [...] Levy, Carlos and Steven Battey of The Jackie Boyz, and Kevin Risto and Waynne Nugent of Midi Mafia. It was {{recorded}} at Icon Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and it was mixed at Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. The track {{was one of three}} songs on the standard edition of My World that Bieber co-wrote. In an interview in the November 14, 2009 issue of Billboard, Bieber explained the meaning behind the song stating, [...] "It's a ballad about the feelings I had when my parents split up and how I helped my family get through it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of kids have had their parents split up, and they should know that it wasn't because of something they did. I hope people can relate to it." ...|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms {{of the quality of the}} show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of us can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E

500|$|After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain Todd Blackadder left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as {{a slap in the}} face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team." [...] Hammett later said [...] "I took it that way, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!" [...] Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96–19 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs. He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against Australia and South Africa in the Tri-Nations. The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield. Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.|$|E
500|$|Kiersten Warren also {{returned}} to the series as Nora Huntington after being introduced {{at the end of}} the second season. On her storyline, Warren commented, [...] "There's a lot of families who are going through this. Not quite the surprise ooh, boo, child, but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people have to deal with it. I think it's fantastic that they’re doing this on the show." [...] Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth, Susan's romantic interest. Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma." [...] Scott called his character [...] "bumbling at times," [...] adding, [...] "He kind of blossoms after he rediscovers his romantic juices with Susan." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E

500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{stop-start}} {{sessions for}} The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for Mother's Milk went smoothly. Many {{of the songs}} were already written, some even recorded ("Taste the Pain" [...] was recorded prior to Chad joining and featured Philip [...] "Fish" [...] Fisher on drums) {{by the time the}} band started pre-production in January 1989. [...] The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake; songs like [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: [...] "We played hard and fast more than [...] any other time in our career, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of chops were going down [...] we played constantly, got to know each other, {{and came up with a}} record." [...] Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that [...] " [...] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
