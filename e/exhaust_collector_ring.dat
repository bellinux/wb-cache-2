It was a high-wing conventional landing gear equipped monoplane using dual airfoil-shaped lift struts. The fuselage is made of fabric-covered welded steel tubing, with wooden wing spars and ribs. The red, yellow and blue paint scheme was taken a from an earlier Berrylold Paint advertisement.

5000|$|A $225,000 summary {{judgment}} against the Government {{and for the}} contractor's widows was directed when the Government claimed the accident report, as well as documents with surviving crewmember statements, could not be furnished [...] "without seriously hampering national security". However, the Supreme Court overturned the judgment under state secrets privilege. Nevertheless, the Air Force agreed to pay an out-of-court settlement of $170,000, and decades later the declassified accident report indicated the cause {{to have been a}} fire and drop in manifold pressure in the number 1 engine, as well as an inadvertent feathering of the number 4 engine, which was not successfully unfeathered prior to the crash. The report indicated the cause of the fire in engine 1 could not be positively determined, but was likely to have been the result of breaks in the right <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> <b>ring.</b> The report further stated that [...] "the fire may have been aggravated by non-compliance with Technical Orders 01-20EJ-117 and 01-20EJ-178." [...] It concluded that the aircraft was [...] "not considered safe for flight" [...] due to non-compliance with these orders. [...] A consequent lawsuit to reopen the case claimed that the report's information about the cause was not secret and alleged a government coverup, but the case was not reopened.|$|E
5000|$|After {{official}} trials, the Regia Aeronautica {{rejected the}} Ca.114 {{in favour of}} the Fiat CR.32. Nevertheless, Caproni found a buyer in the Peruvian Aviation Corps, which ordered 12 examples in April 1934. These aircraft were delivered in two batches, the first in late November 1934, and the second in January 1935. These were pressed into service with the 2do Escuadron de Caza Fighter Squadron, part of Primer Escuadrón de Aviación Aviation Squadron based in the newly created [...] "Teniente Coronel Pedro Ruiz Gallo" [...] in Chiclayo. Only a single loss was recorded by 1939, when the fleet {{was sent to the}} Caproni Factory in Lima to receive an overhaul. The heavy <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> was discarded and replaced by individual exhaust stacks, which probably improved the aircraft maximum speed. Additionally, the original red-black scheme was replaced by a silver dope overall finish. Ten remaining aircraft took part, as part of the 42 and 43 Escuadrillas flights, of the XXI Escuadrón de Caza Squadron, along with six more modern North American NA-50 fighters. After the war the Ca.114s were withdrawn from the front line and four aircraft employed in training duties from Las Palmas airbase in Lima until late 1944 when they were grounded and, shortly after, scrapped.|$|E

40|$|Discussed {{here are}} {{problems}} {{with the use of}} cowlings with radial air cooled engines. An XF 7 C- 1 airplane, equipped with service cowling and with narrow ring, wide ring, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> cowlings over the service cowling, was used. For these four cowling conditions, the rate of climb and high speed performance were determined, the cylinder conditions were measured, and pictures to show visibility were taken. The level flight performance obtained with an engine speed of 1900 r. p. m. for the service type, the narrow ring, the wide ring, and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> was 144. 4, 146. 6, 152. 8, and 155 mph, respectively. The rate of climb was practically the same for each type tested. The visibility was not materially impaired by the use of the wide or the narrow cowlings. With the narrow ring and <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> cowlings there was an increase in cylinder temperature. However, this increase was not enough to affect the performance of the engine.

The engine was provided with a propeller to absorb the power and was mounted on a test stand equipped with scales for measuring the thrust and engine torque. The results indicate that at full open throttle at sea level, for the engine tested, a gain in thrust horsepower of 18 percent using separate stacks, and 9. 5 percent using a <b>collector</b> <b>ring</b> and discharge nozzle, can be expected at an air speed of 550 miles per hour...|$|R

50|$|BLSRs {{can operate}} within a {{metropolitan}} region or, often, will move traffic between municipalities. Because a BLSR does not send redundant copies from ingress to egress, the total bandwidth that a BLSR can support {{is not limited}} to the line rate N of the OC-N ring, and can actually be larger than N depending upon the traffic pattern on the ring. In the best case, all traffic is between adjacent nodes. The worst case is when all traffic on the ring egresses from a single node, i.e., the BLSR is serving as a <b>collector</b> <b>ring.</b> In this case, the bandwidth that the ring can support is equal to the line rate N of the OC-N ring.

40|$|Among layer {{manufacturing}} techniques, Laser Consolidation (LC) {{finds its}} ideal application {{in the production}} of thin-walled metal parts for industrial niches characterised by high innovation and product complexity. To fully exploit the technological potential, developments must be made to assess LC’s repeatability and reliability. Previous studies proved that high strength parts of fine microstructure are obtained if appropriate build strategies are used. The aim of this research is to analyse a racecar <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector,</b> built in Inconel by LC, relating the failure modes and microstructure to the construction plan. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> component was built using a custom strategy and was run on a dynamometer before failing after approximately 1200 km. An investigation of the failure mechanism was carried out by a primary macroscopic analysis, aided by an X-ray control and dye penetrant test. Metallographic sections were then sampled from the critical areas to study the microstructure and relate it to the manufacturing process. Results proved that the distribution of primary microcracks associated with internal residual stresses caused by the build strategy and aggravated by differential shrinkage during the test thermocycles was responsible for ultimate failure. This issue was a result of build strategy and the non-coaxial laser head, therefore, alternative pathways could be developed capable of removing most, if not all, of the contributory factors. The analysed case suggests that LC build strategy selection is as critical to ensure low cycle fatigue resistance as component design and confirms that LC is effective {{in the production of}} advanced technological parts with high geometrical complexity given the correct build strategy...|$|R
