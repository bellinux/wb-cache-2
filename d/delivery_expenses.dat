The Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (SOBRA) was enacted by Congress in 1986 to provide a funding stream for these services. In Kansas, eligibility for this program is processed through Social and Rehabilitative Services (SRS) area offices. If the medical event is labor and delivery, the case worker can approve SOBRA eligibility. If the event is not labor and delivery, the provider of the service receives a form to fill out and return with the medical record. The Medicaid fiscal agent, EDS, receives this information and works with the SOBRA program manager to approve or deny eligibility. In 2007, there were 576 requests for non-labor and <b>delivery</b> medical <b>expenses</b> of which 295 were denied. The main challenge in administering this program is consistent application of the federal definition of covered services.

The results of our study will allow a network designer to implement such a system and to tune its performance in a delay-tolerant environment with intermittent connectivity, as to ensure with some chosen level of confidence that the information is successfully carried through the mobile network and delivered within some time period...|$|R

Information on medical costs, technical and professional capabilities of healthcare providers and service deliveries becomes influential {{when it comes}} to patients' decision on choices of healthcare providers. Methods: The study employs a data set containing 1, 459 observations collected from a survey on Vietnamese patients in late 2015. The standard categorical data analysis is performed to provide statistical results, yielding insights from the empirical data. Results: Patients' socio-economic status (SES) is found {{to be associated with the}} degree of significance of key factors (i. e. medical costs, professional capabilities and service <b>deliveries),</b> but medical <b>expenses</b> are the single most important factor that influence a decision by the poor, 2. 28 times as critical as the non-poor. In contrary, the non-poor tend to value technical capabilities and services more, with odds ratios being 1. 54 and 1. 32, respectively. Discussion: There exists a risk for the poor in decision making based on medical expenses solely. The solution may rest with: a) improved health insurance mechanism; and, b) obtaining additional revenues from value-added services, which can help defray the poor's financial burdens. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Two {{server-side}} e-mail service {{strategies that}} utilize a layer- 3 e-mail classification technique are presented. Based on layer- 3 classification scores, {{the class of}} an e-mail can be estimated with minimal processing during normal reassembly on e-mail servers with a high accuracy. Non-spam e-mails are queued in a fast queue, whereas spam e-mails are queued in a slower queue. The non-spam queue is served with higher service capacity than the spam one. Two e-mail service strategies are analyzed using a priority queue model. The first service strategy assigns fixed service capacities to both queues. The second service strategy serves the spam queue based on the occupancies of both queues. We model these two strategies using discrete-time Markov chain analysis. The behavior and performance of the proposed service strategies are analyzed under different e-mail traffic loads. Our models show that non-spam e-mails can be delivered under small delay, {{as compared to the}} current strategy that uses a single queue approach. The proposed strategies exhibit delay and loss probability orders of magnitude smaller than the ones for the single queue approach, even under heavy e-mail loading and high spam to non-spam prior. Servicing e-mails by predicting an e-mail's class has two-fold advantages.

40|$|Abstract Background Delivery by {{a skilled}} birth {{attendant}} (SBA) {{in a hospital}} is advocated to improve maternal health; however, hospital <b>expenses</b> for <b>delivery</b> care services are a concern for women and their families, particularly for women who pay out-of-pocket. Although health insurance is now implemented in Lao PDR, it is not universal throughout the country. The objectives {{of this study are}} to estimate the total health care <b>expenses</b> for vaginal <b>delivery</b> and caesarean section, to determine the association between health insurance and family income with health care expenditure and assess the effect of health insurance from the perspectives of the women and the skilled birth attendants (SBAs) in Lao PDR. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in two provincial hospitals in Lao PDR, from June to October 2010. Face to face interviews of 581 women who gave birth in hospital and 27 SBAs was carried out. Both medical and non-medical expenses were considered. A linear regression model was used to assess influencing factors on health care expenditure and trends of medical and non-medical expenditure by monthly family income stratified by mode of delivery were assessed. Results Of 581 women, 25 % had health care insurance. Health care <b>expenses</b> for <b>delivery</b> care services were significantly higher for caesarean section (270 USD) than for vaginal delivery (59 USD). After adjusting for the effect of hospital, family income was significantly associated with all types of expenditure in caesarean section, while it was associated with non-medical and total expenditures in vaginal delivery. Both delivering women and health providers thought that health insurance increased the utilisation of delivery care. Conclusions Substantially higher <b>delivery</b> care <b>expenses</b> were incurred for caesarean section compared to vaginal delivery. Three-fourths of the women who were not insured needed to be responsible for their own health care payment. Women who had higher family incomes were able to pay for more non-medical care expenses. The effect of health insurance on service utilization was noted by women and SBAs. To achieve the goal of utilizing delivery care in the hospitals, coverage of health insurance needs to be expanded. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade there have been {{significant}} socio-demographic changes in Spain with potential impact on gestational length. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe the evolution of gestational age during 1997 - 2008, separately for native-born and immigrant population, in order to assess their contribution to the overall pattern of gestational length. A cross-sectional study of 5, 018, 229 singleton births born between 1997 and 2008 was carried out. The annual mean of gestational age was calculated and compared by means of ANOVA test, globally and also separately for natives and immigrants. Proportions of deliveries by gestational age and maternal characteristics were calculated in 4 periods and compared by means of Chi-square tests. Crude and adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were fitted separately for native-born and immigrant women. Our results show that in the last 12  years a progressive shortening in the mean gestational age has taken place in Spain. While the overall decrease of gestational length along the period was 1. 5  days, closer to that in Spanish women (1. 3  days), it was 2. 3  days among immigrants. In both groups this shortening was mainly due to an increase in the proportion of 37 - 39  weeks <b>deliveries</b> at the <b>expense</b> of a substantial decrease in those with 40  weeks. These trends remained after controlling for known confounding variables such as maternal age, parity and occupation.

40|$|The {{ability to}} scale down {{threshold}} and hence supply voltages can no longer keep up with device density as technology scales. Microprocessor power density is therefore increasing. At the same time, {{the total number of}} C 4 s is predicted to be constant for the foreseeable future, according to ITRS 2011. As a result, {{more and more of the}} C 4 pads are dedicated to power <b>delivery,</b> at the <b>expense</b> of off-chip I/O signals, impeding I/O throughput scaling–even though core counts and hence bandwidth requirements are increasing exponentially. It therefore becomes important to consider the power delivery network (PDN) as early as possible in the design process, both to ensure enough I/O pads and because a later redesign due to power delivery issues is costly. In this paper, we propose and validate a steady-state architecture-level PDN model, called VoltSpot, and explore the impact of the power delivery constraint for future technology nodes. Our results, based on a scaled multicore processor, indicate that worstcase on-chip IR drop at 16 nm will be at least three times larger than that at 45 nm. We propose a first-order optimization algorithm to derive the number and placement of C 4 pads for by power delivery to achieve a specific IR-drop target. When optimizing to satisfy an IR-drop constraint of 5 %, power delivery requires so many pads that multicore processors at 16 nm will not be able to maintain constant per-core I/O bandwidth. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show the {{effectiveness}} of die shrink as a package solution for memory devices. In the case of the 8 mm x 10 mm Direct Rambus DRAM device, about 350 dies can be obtained from a single 8 -inch wafer. The 85 % linear shrink (15 % shrink in both x and y-directions) allows an additional 150 dies from the same size wafer. This simple calculation explains the importance of die shrink. There are two basic requirements for the die shrink package solution. First, the footprint of the new package must be the same as that of the earlier package because a mounting board with multiple devices on it can not be changed to accommodate the footprint change of single device. Second, the test socket for the new package must be the same or compatible with minimal modification because the <b>delivery</b> time and <b>expense</b> for new sockets for test and burn-in are significant. In this paper, the CSP die shrink solution will be limited to a discussion of the µBGA ® package only. There are two different types of µBGA CSP: a package for peripheral pad die and a package for center pad die. Each type has its own package solutions for the die shrink problem. Flash, SRAM, and 64 / 72 M Direct RDRAM are devices with peripheral bonding pads. For this study, a 6 x 8 ball matrix was used. The majority of conventional DRAMs, 128 / 144 M and 256 M Direct RDRAM are devices with a center bonding pad. A 8 x 15 ball matrix with two-row depopulation was used for the case study [1].

This paper attempts to fill this gap by providing some general policy recommendations on this important issue. While most of the paper addresses the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries, its policy implications are applicable to any country. The paper finds that the best financing option is country-specificÂ¯depending on a country’s economic, cultural, institutional, demographic and epidemiological characteristics, as well as political economy considerations. However, taxation should be the primary financing source. It also concludes that an appropriate and realistic benefit package would need to be designed to ensure the system’s financial viability. Regarding the optimal way to implement universal health care, certain preconditions are needed, including sound public administration, a small informal economy, and a transparent health financing system that builds social consensus.

40|$|Understanding the {{composition}} and distribution of the revenue of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) is key to understanding NPOs themselves. This research uses revenue data for 87, 127 charitable NPOs to draw three main conclusions. First, revenue structures of NPOs vary widely by subsector and organizational size, with many NPOs demonstrating revenue structures that might be considered uncharacteristic of the nonprofit sector. Second, despite the concerns of many nonprofit scholars, heavy dependence on either government funding or charitable contributions is atypical of NPOs. And third, nonprofit revenue is highly concentrated in relatively few NPOs. The description of revenue expands {{to examine the relationship}} between two important sources of revenue, charitable contributions and government subsidies. Nonprofit scholars have long theorized that government funding diminishes charitable giving. This research finds that the effect of subsidy on charity varies substantially among the nonprofit subsectors, but, contrary to widely accepted theory, these effects are more often positive than negative: More than half of government funding of the nonprofit subsectors appears to spur an increase in charitable giving, whereas only 6 percent of government funding is associated with decreased giving. This research suggests that effects of subsidy on charity are less likely due to the decisions of donors than to the decisions of NPOs themselves. These findings assuage some concerns about the future of the nonprofit sector but substantiate others. As government increasingly relies on NPOs to deliver government-funded services, it appears unlikely that NPOs will suffer decreases in charitable giving, and government funding may even enable NPOs to increase revenue from charitable giving. But marginal changes in charitable giving will not mitigate what many see as a distressing move away from reliance on charity toward generating fees for services and generally becoming more business-like. Whether these findings represent a nonprofit sector betraying its charitable roots, diluting its power to effect social change by 2 ̆ 2 corporatizing, 2 ̆ 2 emphasizing service <b>delivery</b> at the <b>expense</b> of advocacy, or becoming more efficient, financially stable, and responsive to market demands remains a matter of debate, but debate better informed by the understanding of nonprofit revenue provided by this research...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{financial}} services industry, the call center is being recognized as a critical delivery channel, helping firms to keep existing customers, expand their business, and control costs. For banks, call centers provide a cost effective means of servicing in customer requests, and are essential in retaining customers. The traditional role of the call center as a question and answer base for the customer is still a strong motivator for their existence, There is, however, a growing tendency to blend sales related activities with traditional transaction based activities at a financial service firm's phone center. Institutions view the opportunity to sell additional products {{as the key to}} a successful phone center operation. While service-oriented businesses in other sectors of the economy are experiencing a similar proliferation in call centers, the dichotomy of a service center and a sales center is much more apparent in banking. Other sectors do not fully blend service and sales in the call center operation as fully as is the desire of financial services firms. The move to sales elsewhere in {{the financial}} services industry has been ongoing for some time. The last decade has seen a growing number of banks implementing cross-sell programs across their branch networks in an effort to become higher profit, sales-driven organizations that leverage the <b>delivery</b> system <b>expense</b> structure. Today, these sales efforts in the branches are being extended to alternative delivery channels, a major one of which is the phone center. Lack of management focus, poor hiring practices, lack of training, ineffective organization for marketing, poor service, and not knowing customers or products are only a selection of some of the barriers between resources and sales in banking that have been documented. This paper identifies some of these roadblocks in the context of retail banking phone centers. The authors show that the nature of phone center operations makes them extremely susceptible to the increasing and changing resource needs of a sales organization. The authors provide a snapshot of retail banking phone centers, a review of related literature, and then present an analytical approach to characterize the tradeoffs between service and sales in phone centers. The situation at a specific phone center is described and analyzed. The authors demonstrate that cross-selling costs. In addition to its visible costs, such as training and technology, cross-selling is shown to have detrimental effects on customer service because of the additional burdens and operational load it creates on the system. With a move to more selling, capacity needs sharply increase in terms of customer service representatives and information processing resources. These capacity implications can be easily overlooked, since they are less visible than what one would expects to encounter. The authors show how restaffing can overcome some of the congestion related problems induced by additional sales activity. The authors use a performance model described in the paper in conjunction with an optimization model to determine economically optimal staffing levels for call centers. However, they note that staffing is not the only factor to be considered. Design of customer request processes and human resource practices that support the design are equally important in determining the success of a cross-sell program. The authors intend a second phase of this study a detailed filed study of call center operations across the entire financial services industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Desalination {{provides}} a supply alternative for potable water for many communities, along with possible defenses against security threats potentially affecting clean water supplies. The {{economic and financial}} life-cycle costs associated with building and operating the Southmost desalination facility (near Brownsville, TX) in South Texas are investigated using the spreadsheet model DESAL ECONOMICS?. Primary data key to this analysis include actual initial construction costs, annual continued costs (i. e., for source-water acquisition and transport, pretreatment, purification, and <b>delivery),</b> capital replacement <b>expenses,</b> and desalination-process parameters. The input data used reflect the unique location and quality of source water, process-flow design, asset selection and configuration, management structure, local cost rates, and employed operational methods unique to the Southmost facility. Thus, the specific results are only applicable to the Southmost facility for a specific time, but do provide useful information and insight into life-cycle costs for public and commercial desalination facilities in a more general sense. Annuity equivalent costs are reported (on both a $/acre-foot (ac-ft) and $/ 1, 000 gallons of finished water basis, f. o. b. (free on board) municipal delivery point) for seven individual operational/expense areas, {{as well as for}} the entire desalination facility. Results are also presented across different cost types, categories, and items. The baseline results are deterministic, but are expanded to include sensitivity analyses of useful life, initial construction costs, annual energy costs, and production efficiency rate, amongst others. The current estimated total annual life-cycle costs (in 2006 dollars) to produce and deliver desalinated water to a point in the municipal delivery-system infrastructure for the Southmost facility are $ 769. 62 /ac-ft {$ 2. 3619 / 1, 000 gal. }. These baseline estimates apply to the Southmost facility and are sensitive to changes in the production efficiency level, and costs incurred for energy, chemicals, initial construction, etc. Also, results indicate significant outlays, beyond those of Initial Construction, are involved with desalination. For the Southmost facility, when a commitment was made to build a facility for $ 26. 2 million, an implicit commitment for another $ 39. 1 million (basis 2006 dollars) was also made for Continued and Capital Replacement costs. Investigation into life-cycle costs during the design and planning stages of a desalination facility can assist with determining the least-cost asset configuration to adopt and operational methods to employ. Also included are modifications to certain key data-input parameters that provide ?modified results? which facilitate a more fair basis of comparing facilities and/or technologies.

40|$|Imagine a {{world in}} which {{learners}} and faculty can collaboratively build knowledge by sourcing, exchanging, adapting, reusing and integrating a range of learning resources. Soon we won't have to imagine this scenario, since a range of institutions and organisations globally are setting up repositories to support the sharing of Learning Objects (LOs) : granular, digital resources developed to support learners in achieving a single learning goal (IEEE, 2001; Koper, 2001; Wiley, 2000). The educational rationale is that a single set of resources can be restructured to support different pedagogical approaches. It is argued that individual, granular resources allow for maximum reuse across a range of contexts. At the same time aggregation of resources enables contextualisation within particular learning situations (Duncan, 2003). While Learning Object Repositories (LORs) can facilitate storage, searching and retrieval of individual and aggregated resources, few of LO resource collections are achieving their full potential. A key problem is that LORs, like many other learning technology innovations, are often designed to exploit the capabilities of the technology, rather than to meet learners' need. This focus on technology has resulted in an emphasis on issues such as interoperability standards, aggregation of learning objects, resource description, discovery and <b>delivery</b> at the <b>expense</b> of softer, social factors. The 'Community Dimensions of Learning Object Repositories' (CD-LOR) project aims to reverse this trend by identifying important pedagogical, social, and organisational factors that inhibit effective use of LORs. CD-LOR is funded by the UK's Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC, the Government Organisation responsible for UK academic networks) to identify and analyse the factors that influence the uptake and implementation of learning object repositories in support of teaching and learning within a diverse range of learning communities. The project is identifying key barriers and enablers to the implementation of LORs to support learning within communities and mapping these against a range of types of LOR communities. Such communities include those based in individual and federated institutions and those that exist across institutions regionally, nationally or internationally, for example discipline-based communities, or communities coalescing around use in teaching and learning of particular formats, such as sound files. The project team are currently creating a typology of repositories and communities and mapping the characteristics of these communities with respect to their use of the repositories. We anticipate this mapping will form the basis for development of use cases, case studies, and guidelines on implementation of learning object repositories, as well as institution-wide use cases linking LORs to wider information management processes. A range of potential solutions to barriers will be developed and tested within existing communities. We also aim to produce recommendations for institutional managers on wider policy, strategy, systems and workflow issues and make recommendations to JISC for ongoing research and development...|$|R
