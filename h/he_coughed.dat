25|$|However, Richelieu was now dying. For {{many years}} he had {{suffered}} from recurrent fevers (possibly malaria), strangury, intestinal tuberculosis with fistula, and migraine. Now his right arm was suppurating with tubercular osteitis, and <b>he</b> <b>coughed</b> blood (after his death, his lungs {{were found to have}} extensive cavities and caseous necrosis). His doctors continued to bleed him frequently, further weakening him. As he felt his death approaching, he named Mazarin, one of his most faithful followers, to succeed him as chief minister to the King.|$|E
25|$|His biggest success came in 1839 when at {{the third}} attempt he won the prestigious Newdigate Prize for poetry (Arthur Hugh Clough came second). He met William Wordsworth, who was {{receiving}} an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, <b>he</b> <b>coughed</b> blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a pre-med {{student at}} Wayne State University {{suffered}} from kidney failure and was hospitalized for 12 days due to weeks of physical abuse by {{men of the}} fraternity. Also in 2010, the fraternity chapter was permanently banned from the campus of Georgia State University for being a repeat offender and beating a student pledging so badly that <b>he</b> <b>coughed</b> up blood. In 2011, the fraternity registration was cancelled at the University of Texas at San Antonio for striking pledges and providing misleading information to university officials during the hazing investigation. [...] In March 2012, the University of Florida chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi was suspended because of 13 misdemeanor-level sworn complaints involving striking and harassing pledges. In April 2012, the fraternity at Arkansas Tech University was permanently banned from campus for beating a pledge into a coma.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know; I don't {{quite like}} {{the look of}} him, and <b>he</b> <b>coughs</b> such a lot. It seems as though he could not shake off that chill {{he got in the}} trenches. That's why he hasn't been to call at the Rectory." ...|$|R
60|$|VIRAG: (Heels together, bows) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (<b>He</b> <b>coughs</b> thoughtfully, drily) Promiscuous nakedness is much in {{evidence}} hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed {{the fact that she}} is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mulla-mulgars," [...] he said, [...] "and {{beside his}} bow and his sharp-nosed darts, {{he has three}} big knubbly cudgels in the corner higher than is Nod.

50|$|Despite {{constant}} hacking and complaining, he's seen {{running and}} engaging in other physical activities in several scenes, leading to conclusion {{that some of his}} health issues might be exaggerated. At first some of the passengers offer positive reinforcement, but soon give up after facing his strong intent on feeling and displaying self-pity. On the other hand, he really does seem to have tuberculosis — then a common disease — as at one point <b>he</b> <b>coughs</b> out some blood onto his handkerchief.|$|R
5000|$|You want {{an inkling}} of how grim things are for black kids right now, try and find another current rap record that manages to mean a damn thing without {{slipping}} into gangsta suicide or Afrocentric cryptoracism. Since this one sank faster than Public Enemy, maybe it doesn't mean much either, but to me the East Flatbush trio radiates the hope hip hop was full of not so long ago. There's deep pleasure in their vocal tradeoffs and hard, wryly textured tracks. There's wordwise grace in rhymes that balance B-movie fantasy against everyday brutality without denial or despair. And there's joy in the nonpareil skills of reformed backward rapper Chip Fu. <b>He</b> <b>coughs,</b> <b>he</b> hiccups, he snorts, he stutters; he whinnies, wheezes, wows, and flutters.|$|R

5000|$|Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music {{was shot}} inside NBC's Studio 1, at its color {{television}} facility in Burbank, California.
