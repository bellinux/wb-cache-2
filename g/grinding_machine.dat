500|$|By {{this time}} the company {{manufactured}} machine tools to its own design. Rapid expansion {{in the use of}} precision grinding machines after 1910, particularly in the developing car manufacturing industry, focussed the company's efforts on producing machines of this type. Many were of a revolutionary design due to the technical flair of Harry Hales Asbridge, who had joined the company from Charles Churchill & Co at its inception. A large plain <b>grinding</b> <b>machine,</b> with a [...] swing, built and installed in Sheffield, remained in service at least until the 1990s and was used primarily to grind the journals of large crankshafts.|$|E
500|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E

2500|$|Grinding uses an {{abrasive}} {{process to}} remove {{material from the}} workpiece. [...] A <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> is a machine tool used for producing very fine finishes, making very light cuts, or high precision forms using an abrasive wheel as the cutting device. This wheel {{can be made up}} of various sizes and types of stones, diamonds or inorganic materials.|$|E
2500|$|To use the {{grinding}} wheel it {{must first be}} clamped to the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine.</b> The wheel type (e.g. cup or plain wheel below) fit freely on their supporting arbors, the necessary clamping force to transfer the rotary motion being applied to the wheels side by identically sized flanges (metal discs). [...] The paper blotter shown in the images is intended to distribute this clamping force evenly across the wheels surface.|$|E
2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} a <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> using specially dressed {{grinding wheels}} matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>machines</b> remove {{material}} from the work piece by abrasion, which can generate substantial amounts of heat. To cool the work piece {{so that it does}} not overheat and go outside its tolerance, <b>grinding</b> <b>machines</b> incorporate a coolant. The coolant also benefits the machinist as the heat generated may cause burns. In high-precision <b>grinding</b> <b>machines</b> (most cylindrical and surface grinders), the final grinding stages are usually set up so that they remove about 200 nm (less than 1/10000 in) per pass - this generates so little heat that even with no coolant, the temperature rise is negligible.|$|R
