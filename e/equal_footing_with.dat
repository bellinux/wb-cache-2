5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear if women were given <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E
5|$|American {{emergency}} rations in World War I {{consisted of}} a quarter ounce (7 grams) packet of double-strength instant coffee, packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty-four men. Instant coffee was also used in reserve rations and trench rations. During World War II, the U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time on an <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged in the interwar period, most notably Nescafé, {{as well as the}} new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.|$|E
5|$|NATO's unity was {{breached}} {{early in}} its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France. De Gaulle protested against the USA's strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship {{between it and the}} United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D.

50|$|Major {{political}} institutions are the monarchy, the cabinet, the States General (parliament) and the judicial system. There are three other High Colleges of state, which stand on <b>equal</b> <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> parliament {{but have a}} less political role, of which the Council of State is the most important. Other levels of government are the municipalities, the water boards and the provinces. Although {{not mentioned in the}} constitution, political parties and the social partners organised in the Social Economic Council are important {{political institutions}} as well.|$|R
25|$|It {{remained}} to be proved mathematically that the non-Euclidean geometry {{was just as}} self-consistent as Euclidean geometry, and this was first accomplished by Beltrami in 1868. With this, non-Euclidean geometry was established on an <b>equal</b> mathematical <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> Euclidean geometry.|$|R
5|$|The simple {{appearance}} of MiGs could often accomplish their mission by causing American pilots to jettison their bomb loads {{as a defensive}} measure. In 1966, the MiG-17 were joined by more modern Soviet-built MiG-21 Fishbeds, which could fight on a more <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the U.S. aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force was maintaining an interceptor force of 100 aircraft, {{many of which were}} based on PRC airfields and out of reach of American air attack.|$|E

She quit the sport amidst controversy in 1988 while at the height of her ability, due to a dispute over her conduct in a match at the World Open Nine-ball Championship of that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{the journal}} Zoologica {{was founded by}} Osborn and Hornaday {{specifically}} as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first {{issue of the journal}} contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for the purpose of further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.|$|E

5|$|Soon, blue whales {{were being}} hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, {{with the advent}} of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to {{increase}} dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> those found in relative abundance.|$|E

5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with the seal of the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood on an <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of}} the Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E

In the narration, Richard observes, [...] "Jack was getting worried about the arrow, but I told him to stop crying." ...|$|R
25|$|Ultimately, the Tsarist {{government}} officially {{recognized the}} Karaim as being of Turkic, not Jewish, origin. Because the Karaim were {{judged to be}} innocent {{of the death of}} Jesus, they were exempt from many of the harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on <b>equal</b> legal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> Crimean Tatars. The related Krymchak community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.|$|R
5|$|On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom {{while he}} was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister Hussein Rushdi Pasha served as acting head of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle Hussein Kamel was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had {{considered}} putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. Hussein Kamel took the title of Sultan of Egypt (preceded by the untranslatable style of Sa Hautesse), thereby putting him on an <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the existing states.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an <b>equal</b> <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily {{from one to}} another, although there were problems {{in the case of}} the Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E

50|$|The Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom was the {{culmination}} in the 19th century of efforts over {{several hundred years}} to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on England's Jewish population.
