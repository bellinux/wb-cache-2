I loved <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was a young girl}} and I feel like I've been on a musical journey with her". Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand {{what they were talking about}} at the time... They were raw and did their own thing, and I loved that. I love artists who don't conform to what people expect of them".|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with <b>her,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke {{to her as a}} teenager; [...] "I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to Court and Spark; I worshipped <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in high school. Blue is amazing. I would have to say of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born to Mexican-American {{parents in}} Ontario, California, {{better known as}} the Inland Empire, T grew up singing in her church choir during Sunday school. In high school, T Lopez did not {{participate}} in early college enrollment with her peers. Instead, Lopez, who always knew she wanted to sing, attended Chaffey High School while working two jobs at the Ontario Mills Mall. That is until a car belonging to a talent scout, Nick Martinez, broke down near her father's garage and her father told Martinez about T's beautiful voice. T Lopez called Nick Martinez and he asked her to sing to him over the phone," [...] T Lopez said she thought it was weird, but she sang to him anyway so she sung [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] from her bathroom, she said that the acoustics were better in there.

2500|$|In 1957, {{after the}} highly {{successful}} half-hour I Love Lucy episodes had ended, Vance continued playing Ethel Mertz {{on a series}} of hour-long specials titled The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show (later retitled The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour). In 1959, she divorced her third husband, Philip Ober, who allegedly physically abused <b>her.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Love Lucy was reformatted into the hour-long Lucy-Desi shows in 1957, Desi Arnaz offered Vance and Frawley the opportunity to star in their own [...] "Fred and Ethel" [...] spin-off show. Although Frawley was very interested, Vance declined, mainly because {{she did not want to}} work on a one-on-one basis with Frawley as they already did not get along. Also, she felt the Mertz characters would be unsuccessful in a show without the Ricardos. Vance's choice to decline the would-be show intensified the animosity between her and Frawley. Instead, Vance was interested in doing a series based on the life of Babs Hooten, a New York socialite who moves to New Mexico to run a hotel and ranch. Desi Arnaz financed a pilot starring Vance as Hooten titled Guestward, Ho!, which was shot in 1958 by Desilu; however, the show was rejected by CBS and Vance continued playing Ethel Mertz. Arnaz would later retool the show with model and actress Joanne Dru taking the lead role, selling the series to ABC, where it was subsequently cancelled after one season.|$|E
