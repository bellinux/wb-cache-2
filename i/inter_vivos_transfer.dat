This approach raises problems as will be seen below. However, the contractual requirement has been rejected in other decisions, or at least diluted. Dixon J in Birmingham, commenting on Dufour v Pereira, noted that it is the trust arising from the course of conduct which is enforced, not the contract itself. This approach has received further credence in the decision of Blanchard J in Lewis v Cotton. [...] "A formal legal contract is not needed.

40|$|This paper uses PSID {{data on the}} {{extended}} family to test whether <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>transfers</b> from parents to children are motivated by altruism. Specifically, the paper tests whether an increase by one dollar in the income of parents actively making transfers to a child coupled with a one dollar reduction in that child's income results in the parents increasing their transfer to the child by one dollar. This restriction on parental and child transfer-income derivatives is derived for the standard altruism model augmented to include uncertain and liquidity constraints.

40|$|Land {{interests}} on Canadian First Nations reserves {{have long}} been governed by the rigid and paternalistic provisions of the federal Indian Act, which require {{the permission of the}} federal Minister of Indigenous Affairs for even relatively minor land transactions. Yet an increasing number of First Nations have taken advantage of the 1999 First Nations Land Management Act (FNLMA), which allows First Nations to adopt a custom land code that replaces most of the reserve land provisions of the Indian Act in their community. This paper seeks to examine how First Nation communities have chosen to exercise their powers under this Act to define and regulate land interests on reserve. Working from a database of 33 FNLMA land codes, the authors focus on three discrete issues on which the codes differ: 1) whether to require a vote of {{the community as a whole}} for the grant of a lease in community-held lands to a non-member; 2) whether to require the approval of the band council for the transfer of a leasehold interest to a non-member; and 3) whether to require the approval of the band council for the <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>transfer</b> of a member-held interest to another member. Each of these issues relates to the contentious question of how freely alienable land interests in Indigenous communities should be—a matter that occupies a kind of ideological fault line involving considerations of economic efficiency and individual autonomy, on the one hand, and community cohesion and traditional culture, on the other. The authors make a number of observations relating to the links between the characteristics of communities and their choice of land regime. Communities with substantial non-First-Nations populations living on reserve were more likely to adopt rules allowing free alienation of leasehold interests, as well as free alienation of member interests among members. In addition, First Nations that adopted liberal rules for the transfer of interests among members experienced larger increases in the proportion of their members living off-reserve in the years following the adoption of their code. This may indicate that liberal transfer rules among members help to facilitate exit from the community...|$|E

40|$|The Article 457 c. c. {{expressly}} excludes {{the contract}} by {{the sources of}} the succession. Moreover, the article 458 c. c., apart from the initial brief aside dedicated to the institute of the family pact, agrees nullity of the agreements with whom someone decides its own succession as well as those with which the future successor could decide about his rights or renounce to them about a succession not yet open. However, for a long time, the Italian doctrine wonders {{about the role of the}} contract within the succession law. It feels, in fact, the need to expand the private autonomy within the inheritance that is excessively sacrificed by the prohibition of succession agreements and by the norms for the protection of legitimate heirs. The reasons which led the legal science to these conclusions are based on different events, both social and economic, that push the interpreter to a modernization of dogmatic categories with which he can represent the succession mortis causa. In addiction, it is necessary to underline the crisis of the agreements mortis causa due to this economical and social events: as a matter of fact, the will, as the only way to give the assets post mortem, revealed itself incomplete and extremely severe compared to the new social needs. In fact, increasingly the way to give the assets happens out of the inheritance and despite to the institutions designed by the law. For these reasons, in order to adapt the system of succession to modern economic and social needs, the doctrine has identified, within the system, institutions of a contractual nature in order to better achieve the interests of private, obviating the limits assigned to the shop last will. And recently, in this context, our legislator has introduced the institution of the family pact (art. 768 bis et seq. c. c.), that is the agreement through “the entrepreneur transfers, in whole or in part, the company, and the holder of equity investments transfers, in whole or in part, its shares, to one or more descendants". While, however, part of the doctrine encourages the provision of tools that enable a person to have in advance of his succession, on the other hand there are those who promote the centrality of the will within our legal system and calls for the revitalization in respect of its vast potential is not always adequately exploited. This research aims to verify whether the contract can find importance within the phenomenon of succession for the <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> <b>transfer</b> of family assets and if the same has the characteristics to be considered a working alternative to the will. In the present work will be analyzed, in addition, some of the institutions that the doctrine has considered alternatives to the will and particularly the institution of the family pact.

In 1999 the marginal tax rates ranged from 37 percent on estates of $ 650, 000 to 55 percent on estates of over $ 3 million.
