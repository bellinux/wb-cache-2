Hospital-wide education committees {{have been adopted}} by several healthcare systems to govern postgraduate medical education and to support continuous quality <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> residency <b>training.</b> To understand the functioning and potential of such committees, {{this study examined the}} mechanisms through which hospital-wide education committees strive to enable continuous quality improvement in residency training. Focus group studies with a constructivist grounded theory approach were performed between April 2015 and August 2016. A purposeful sample of hospital-wide education committees led to seven focus groups. Hospital-wide education committees strived to enable continuous quality <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> residency <b>training</b> by the following mechanisms: creating an organization-wide quality culture, an organization-wide quality structure and by collaborating with external stakeholders. However, the committees were first and foremost eager to claim a strategic position within the organization they represent. All identified mechanisms were interdependent and ongoing. From a governance perspective, the position of hospital-wide education committees in the Netherlands is uniquely contributing to the call for institutional accountability for the quality <b>of</b> residency <b>training.</b> When implementing hospital-wide education committees, shared responsibility of the committees and the departments that actually provide residency training should be addressed. Although committees vary in the strategies they use to impact continuous quality <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> residency <b>training,</b> they increasingly have the ability to undertake supporting actions and are working step by step to contribute to high-quality postgraduate medical educatio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pseudo parallel ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm in continuous domain. The variables {{of a solution}} are optimized by two parallel cooperative ACO-based processes, either of which attacks a relatively-independent sub-component of the original problem. Both processes contain tunable and untunable solution vectors. The best tunable vector migrates into the other process as an untunable vector through a migration controller, in which the migration strategy is synchronously sprung or adaptively controlled according to the temporal stagnation situation. Implementation of this mechanism is suitable for hardware which supports parallel computation, resulting in decline of unit computational cost and <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> speed. Optimization {{to a set of}} benchmark functions is carried out to prove the feasibility and efficiency of this parallel ACO algorithm. 1...|$|E

Two surveys were developed and used to gather information from engineers and managers at three large aerospace companies. The results indicate that mentoring, early involvement in a successful project and managerial direction and feedback are all important issues in training. Mentoring accelerates the learning curve. Managerial direction and tactful feedback foster self-esteem. Early project involvement gives the trainee confidence and enthusiasm. Job related happiness, competence and turnover are influenced by these three factors. The results also indicate that manager involvement is largely ignored in the three subject companies. This may be because training is not an independent criterion in the first level engineering manager's annual salary review.
