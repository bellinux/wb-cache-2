50|$|The station's water {{treatment}} plant further <b>demineralised</b> the towns <b>water</b> and removed any impurities. Although safe to drink water still contains dissolved silica (sand) and sodium (salt). Silica particles leave scale deposits on the boiler pipes which acts as an insulator, reducing heat transfer from the furnace to the water inside. This reduces {{the efficiency of the}} station and leads to increased running costs. Sodium encourages rust which weakens the walls of the boiler pipes and can cause them to fracture and burst, known as a boiler tube leak. A serious tube leak can lead to reduced generation or loss of the unit until repairs are carried out.|$|R

40|$|Water is {{economically}} cheap, which {{fails to}} consider its intrinsic {{environmental and social}} value. However, given the uncertain future around the availability of water resources to provide industrial, environmental and social services, water conservation is now of significant concern to industries across the globe. Recently, an extension of water conservation has emerged as zero liquid discharge, whereby no water at all is released from industrial processes, regardless of its quality. Water auditing is a tool {{that can be used}} to identify water conservation strategies, ideally leading to zero liquid discharge. This article discusses a water audit conducted on a sodium cyanide plant, where flows were determined using historical data, proxy data, and known scientific relationships. Water quality throughout the process was defined as contaminated or uncontaminated. From this simple audit, two major water conservation measures were identified and modelled which could reduce inputs and outputs by ∼ 40 %. These were the reuse of rain water falling throughout the plant's boundaries instead of <b>demineralised</b> scheme <b>water,</b> and the improvement of the efficiency of one of the cooling towers. Such a methodology could be easily applied by other industries so as to improve their water conservation. The auditing method may lead to suggestions of conservation techniques for implementation either through retrofitting existing plants or contributing to the design of new ones...|$|R
40|$|Water {{is a vital}} {{component}} {{for many}} industrial operations, and is utilized {{for a wide range}} of purposes in industrial processes. The rapid growth in population, coupled with industrialization and urbanization, resulted in an increased demand for water, leading to serious consequences on the environment. The cost and scarcity of water beside stricter regulations on industrial effluents have become a significant factor in commodity material manufacturing. In this paper sincere efforts had been put to demonstrate, the potential of water pinch technology at real world of industries. To explore the effectiveness of this technology a case studies from a Starch industry of India is under taken with an aim to reduce <b>demineralised</b> (DM) <b>water</b> flow rate and subsequently waste water flow rate. The problem is viewed as a single contaminant problem and all the three modes of water integration i. e. re-use, regeneration-reuse, regeneration –recycle are demonstrated. The DM water consumption is 50 tph before modification and after modification using water pinch it reduces to 31. 9 tph (reuse), 21. 6 tph (regeneration-reuse) and 12 tph (regeneration-recycling). The results obtained from the present analysis are compared well with the results obtained from well established software ASPEN WATER which uses mathematical programming approach based on MINLP. The cost benefit analysis illustrates that the profit obtained in the case of reuse is 17, 63, 914 INR per year and the payback period for the regeneration-reuse and regeneration –recycling are 1. 8 and 1. 1 months.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} water {{electrolysis}} {{process is to}} produce hydrogen for use in ammonia making. The electrolysis process consists of 14 electrolytic units. Electrolysis of water at Sable is a process whereby 6.5 kA direct current is applied across each electrolytic unit to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen both at 35 °C and 30 bar. An electrolyte consisting of 25% wt/wt Potassium Hydroxide, the other part being <b>demineralised</b> <b>water,</b> is used as feed to the electrolytic units. 90MW are required to run all electrolytic units at capacity.|$|E
50|$|Reverse osmosis {{has been}} used for the {{production}} of <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> for over 30 years. In reverse osmosis, water is transported across a membrane under high pressure, leaving a product that consists mainly of water and a concentrate containing most other components such as minerals and unwanted residues. Many contaminants, including iron, manganese, ammonium, traces of pesticides and medicines, organic micro pollutants, and radioactive particles can be removed with reverse osmosis alone. This efficiency has made reverse osmosis the primary method of water purification, often being used in combination with other methods, as a final treatment. A downside to reverse osmosis is that the removing of most minerals from water can have negative effects on its taste. Minerals are sometimes added to drinking water that was already filtered to improve its taste.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} in flight deck layout between the 510ED and other 500 series were so significant that a separate aircraft type rating {{was required to}} fly the former. Another notable difference between the 510ED and all other 500 series was that the former's Rolls-Royce RB163-25 Mk 512-11 Spey engines lacked the latter's Mk 512-14DWs' <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> injection system, and that these engines were rated at the same thrust as the Speys powering BEA's Trident 2Es and 3Bs. To compensate for the 510ED's lower rated engines, no forward integral airstairs were fitted. The resulting weight saving permitted an increase in payload. It also offset (to some extent) the additional costs of customisation to attain commonality with the Trident 3B. Although unique {{in the context of}} the 500 series, the absence of forward airstairs was a characteristic BEA's 510EDs shared with BUA's 201ACs.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous {{return of condensate}} to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages {{have to be made}} up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a <b>water</b> <b>demineralising</b> treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{leading to}} enamel caries and lesions in hydroxyapatite (HAP) pellets systems are poorly understood. The kinetics of enamel and HAP demineralisation are usually controlled by surface reactions, but the surface layer retention suggests that diffusion {{in and out}} of the dissolving solid affects the kinetics of caries-like lesions formation. This project aimed at gaining some understanding of the physico-chemical processes occurring during caries lesion formation. Mineral loss was quantified l) 'Sing X-ray scanning microradiography which provided precise and repeatable measurements. The use of a solid-state photon detector allowed photon energy discrimination, so that a near monochromatic beam could be used. In the first study, enamel and HAP samples were submitted alternately to a <b>demineralising</b> buffer and <b>water</b> with switching periods from 0. 5 to 4 h. Mean rates of demineralisation decreased as the switching period increased, suggesting that demineralisation conditions within the solid persisted for a time after switching to water. A mathematical model was developed to fit the results. In the second study, HAP sections were separated from the demineralising buffer by an aqueous column 0 to 0. 9 cm long. The rate of demineralisation decreased as the length increased, suggesting outward diffusion of dissolved HAP controlled the kinetics of demineralisation. Mathematical modelling based on Fick's diffusion supported this interpretation of the experimental results. The third study focused on the demineralising behaviour of points at increasing depths below the HAP surface. This showed that mineral redeposition occurred near the solid surface. In the last study, samples were submitted to demineralising buffers (same pH) with increasing ionic strength (increase of inert electrolytes concentration). The rate of demineralisation increased with the ionic strength while the surface layer formation was significantly suppressed. This suggests that coupled diffusion between inflow of acid and outflow ofdissolution products is important in surface layer formation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|The stator casing and {{diffuser}} are rigidly supported {{from the}} turbine end bearing bracket. Low conductivity <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> {{is circulated through}} the stator windings by a pump and passes through coolers and a filter before entering the inlet manifold of the winding. After passing through the winding the water returns to the pump through a degassing tank. This is basically a sudden enlargement in the pipe, which causes the water velocity to decrease and so enables any bubbles of gas to be collected in a small chamber fitted with a float-operated alarm switch. A header tank, which contains enough water for a complete refill of the system, is connected into the inlet pipe to the winding. A small demineralising plant is provided to treat the water, should the conductivity of the make-up water supply be too high.|$|E
50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double tube plate construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with <b>demineralised</b> <b>water,</b> supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{walls were}} {{extracted}} from maize endosperm and separated into different polysaccharide fractions by sequential extraction with solutions of saturated Ba(OH) 2, <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> and 1 and 4 M KOH. Solubilised polysaccharides were collected after each extraction. Residues were collected following the extractions with <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> and 1 and 4 M KOH. The original cell wall (CW) material, extracts and residues were analysed for their fermentation characteristics using an in vitro cumulative gas production technique. The rate of fermentation of the alkali-treated residues was faster {{than that of}} the original CW material, except for the 4 M KOH residue, which had a similar rate of degradation to the original CW material. The polysaccharides solubilised from the cell wall (extracts) were all rapidly fermented, more rapidly than both CW and residues. A division of the gas production profile into two phases using curve fitting was in good agreement with a division of the cell wall fermentation into the fermentation of arabinoxylans and cellulose. Therefore the likelihood of preferential degradation of arabinoxylans from the maize cell wall was discussed. The volatile fatty acid production pattern was fairly well explained by the fermentation rate and composition of the substrates. It was concluded that breaking the interactions of polysaccharides in the maize cell wall by mild alkali extraction increases the fermentability of maize cell walls in the gastrointestinal tract of farm animals. Contrarily, more severe alkali extractions will reduce the fermentability of maize cell wall...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{leaching}} behaviour of construction materials {{is necessary for}} the assessment of environmentally hazardous substances. For this reason leaching tests are intended. The objective of the thesis was the testing of the inverse elution method (Percolation method) in a laboratory comparison test for creating the basis of standardisation of the elution procedure. Furthermore the impact of <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> on the release of mobilizable substances should be examined. The comparison analysis regarding the standardisation of the inverse column elution was performed in three laboratories. The results of the laboratory comparison test showed acceptable reproducibility of the parameters for polyacrylate (injection) and cement glue (installation), with variation coefficients beyond 25 %. The form of the created construction samples and the different conductivities of eluents (drinking waters) were identified for having the most important influence on the comparability of the procedures. The investigations concerning the assessment of impacts of polyacrylate on soils and groundwater resulted in a closely limited discharge reaching the level of the initial value after less than 24 h again. Ecotoxicological tests mostly showed a low adverse effect. Only alga test indicated a high risk potential. But since the substances are easy degradable a long term impact is not expected.

In this study, we present the results of laboratory and pilot-plant experiments, aimed at deepening {{the knowledge of the}} mechanisms governing the equilibrium of dissolved and particulate-bound MCs, and exploring the possible use of ultrafiltration (UF) for their removal from eutrophic water within the potabi- lization treatment. Firstly, we analysed the presence of MCs in filtered water after three months of pure culture of Microcystis aeruginosa and different cycles of freezing and thawing, showing an increase of dissolved MCs due to cell breakage caused by the refrigeration cycles. Secondly, we performed filtration tests in a pilot UF plant, using samples of <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> and raw water from a eutrophic lake, both spiked with MCs. The tests demonstrated the possibility to remove MCs by adsorption rather than by mechanical seizing. The tests with <b>demineralised</b> <b>water</b> denoted a tendency to desorption after reaching the adsorption equilibrium, an adsorption isotherm less effective than the one observed in earlier lab-scale studies, and the need for very well controlled chemical washings to clean the membranes. Conversely, the raw lake water tests showed a higher removal efficiency, allowing to reach a final concentration of less than 1 μg/l, and a tendency to maintain the removal efficiency for longer cycles.
