The research also conducted several other different methodologies alongside the IIT in measuring the effective Young's modulus as a comparison. A special designed testing machine Mach- 1 TM is used conducting the IIT, 3 -point bending and compression test. The traditional compression test on standard cylinder parts made from the same binder <b>jetting</b> <b>machine</b> are used as a benchmark of the test material. Three different unit structures with different relative densities are considered, the solid part, the part with 1. 0 mm size of grid lattice and the part with 1. 5 mm size of grid lattice. Compared with the benchmark results obtained from traditional testing machines and the 3 -point bending, the IIT bears a 15 % error measuring solid and lattice freeform samples. Through the primary results, the porosity of the material as well as the stylus size and the lattice size contribute largely to the error...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} rapid manufacture used {{in the development of}} a regenerative pump impeller. Rapid manufacturing technology was used to create complex impeller blade profiles for testing as part of a regenerative pump optimisation process. Regenerative pumps are the subject of increased interest in industry. Ten modified impeller blade profiles, from the standard radial configuration, were evaluated with the use of computational fluid dynamics and experimental testing. Prototype impellers were needed for experimental validation of the CFD results. The manufacture of the complex blade profiles using conventional milling techniques is a considerable challenge for skilled machinists. The complexity of the modified blade profiles would normally necessitate the use of expensive CNC machining with 5 axis capability. With an impeller less than 75 mm in diameter and a maximum blade thickness of 1. 3 mm, a rapid manufacturing technique enabled production of complex blade profiles that were dimensionally accurate and structurally robust enough for testing. As more advanced rapid prototyping machines become available in the study in the future, e. g. 3 D photopolymer <b>jetting</b> <b>machine,</b> the quality of the parts particularly in terms of surface finish will improve and the amount of post processing operations will reduce. This technique offers the possibility to produce components of increased complexity whilst ensuring quality, strength, performance and speed of manufacture. The ability to manufacture complex blade profiles that are robust enough for testing, in a rapid and cost effective manner is proving essential in the overall design optimisation process for the pump...|$|E

This paper focuses on the comparative study of jetting techniques and laser machining technics. This paper concentrates on the machining of composite materials like epoxy pre-impregnated graphite woven fabric and fibre reinforced plastic materials that are used in aerospace industries.
