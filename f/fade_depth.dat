The behaviour effects robustness of communication system {{and needs to be}} considered in system design as it influences the required link budget fade margin. This paper introduces a new simplified model of <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> scaling as a function of bandwidth. It is based on higher number of measurements compared to preceding works. As a result, thorough exploration of <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> dependency on frequency and distance has been conducted.

40|$|In this paper, the {{relation}} between small-scale <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> and channel bandwidth in an indoor environment is investigated. The <b>fade</b> <b>depth,</b> {{a measure of the}} signal power variability over a local region in space, is evaluated for arrowband, wideband and ultrawide-band channels. The experimental analysis is based on frequency-domain measurements in the 3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz microwave band. Physical insight into the fading process is provided, and the effect of increasing bandwidth and temporal resolution is discussed. A dual-slope empirical model is developed, which accurately describes {{the relation}}ship between <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> and channel bandwidth. It is demonstrated that the <b>fade</b> <b>depth,</b> considered at the three standard deviation values, converges to about 4 dB at 1 GHz bandwidth, and a further increase in bandwidth yields only a marginal improvement in fade mitigation...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> characterisation in wideband mobile communications systems is described. The approach, {{based on the}} eigenvalue decomposition technique, allows deriving the cumulative distribution functions of the received power for Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels. Application examples for different systems, namely GSM, UMTS, HIPERLAN and MBS, working within different environments, as proposed by standard-setting bodies, are shown in detail, {{and the results are}} discussed, giving a general insight into the <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> behaviour. In the considered environments, the <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> experienced by GSM is between 9. 4 and 18. 4 dB. The <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> observed by UMTS is below the one for GSM by 2. 1 to 10. 3 dB. Regarding HIPERLAN, the observed <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> is 2. 6 to 4. 9 dB below the one for UMTS. MBS experiences <b>fading</b> <b>depths</b> that are usually below 9. 7 dB (a worst case of 10. 6 dB is observed in City Streets under NLoS).

40|$|A time-domain {{technique}} for <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> characterisation in wideband Rayleigh and Ricean environments is proposed. New expressions for the probability {{functions of the}} received power, which apply to both Line-of-Sight and Non-Line-of-Sight cases, are derived. The <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> for continuous and discrete channel models is evaluated {{as a function of}} the Rice factor, and the product between the system bandwidth and the rms delay spread of the propagation channel. Application examples for UMTS working in different environments are shown, and the results are discussed, giving a general insight into the <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> behaviour. The <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> observed by UMTS within different environments ranges from less than 4. 3 to 12. 5 dB, which is significantly lower than the ones for GSM, thus, different fading margins must be considered.

40|$|Abstract—A {{simple and}} {{computationally}} inexpensive analytical {{approach to the}} evaluation of the short-term <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> dependence on system bandwidth and environment characteristics is proposed. The approach, accounting for the maximum difference in propagation path length and having the Rice factor as a parameter, is derived from fitting simulated data from a model in the literature. Application examples are presented for global system for mobile communications (GSM), universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS), high-performance radio local area network (HIPERLAN), and mobile broadband systems (MBS), which give some insight into the <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> observed under different conditions regarding system bandwidth and environment characteristics. Macro, micro, and picocell environments are considered. In the microcellular environment, the <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> experienced by UMTS is below the one for GSM by 0. 1 to 5. 5 dB, while in the picocellular one, the difference between GSM and UMTS is not significant, being almost independent of environment characteristics. When considering HIPERLAN or systems with larger bandwidths, the <b>fading</b> <b>depth,</b> both in micro and picocellular environments, is smaller than the one verified by UMTS; however, there is an increased dependence on environment characteristics. In the macrocellular environment, the <b>fading</b> <b>depth</b> experienced by UMTS is about 6 to 11 dB below the one for GSM. Hence, different short-term fading margins should be considered for each system and working environment.

40|$|Current {{problem in}} real life WSN {{deployment}} is determining <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> in indoor propagation scenario for link power budget analysis using (fade margin parameter).

40|$|Abstract—This study {{builds on}} the earlier work by Odedina and Afullo on Multipath fading in Durban. Their work was based on {{multipath}} measurements in Durban over a 6. 73 km Line-of-Sight (LOS) link. This submission uses the geoclimatic factor approach and ITU-R recommendations P 530 - 14 to obtain the multipath fading occurrence in five cities in South Africa, including Durban. Three-year radiosonde data is used in estimating the percentage of time that a certain <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> is exceeded and hence outage probability due to atmospheric multipath propagation, assuming the given <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> leads to the received signal falling below the squelch level. We employ the Inverse Distance Square technique to estimate point refractivity gradient not exceeded for 1 % {{of the time in}} the lowest 65 m above the ground for five locations within South Africa. Standard error of the mean and confidence interval for both annual averages and seasonal averages of point refractivity gradient is calculated to reflect possible deviation in the given readings. These values of point refractivity gradient obtained are used in determining the geoclimatic factor K. The results presented show monthly, seasonal and annual variation of both point refractivity gradient and geoclimatic factor K. The results confirm that the geoclimatic factor K is region based. The percentage of time a given <b>fade</b> <b>depth</b> is exceeded for a single frequency increases rapidly with increasing path length. This {{is due to the fact}} that as the path length increases so do the multiple reflections leading to multipath propagation, which can result in either signal enhancement or multipath fading.
