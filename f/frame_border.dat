Since {{there is no reason}} for {{opposite}} borders to be alike, the ''periodic'' image generally presents strong discontinuities across the <b>frame</b> <b>border.</b> These edge effects cause several artifacts in the Fourier Transform, in particular a well-known ''cross'' structure made of high energy coefficients along the axes, which can have strong consequences on image processing or image analysis techniques based on the image spectrum (including interpolation, texture analysis, image quality assessment, etc.). In this paper, we show that an image can be decomposed into a sum of a ''periodic component'' and a ''smooth component'', which brings a simple and computationally efficient answer to this problem.

5000|$|Although <b>framing</b> <b>borders</b> {{in ancient}} art {{were used to}} divide scenes and {{ornamentation}} by ancient Egyptian and Greek artists in pottery and wallpaintings, the first carved wooden frames {{as we know them}} today appeared on small panel paintings in twelfth and thirteenth century Europe. According to a historical series published in Picture Frame Magazine, these early [...] "framed panel paintings were made from one piece. The area to be painted was carved out, leaving a raised <b>framing</b> <b>border</b> around the outside edge, like a tray. The whole piece was then gessoed and gilded. Painting the image on the flat panel was the last thing to be done."When it was realized this method of producing a frame and the image within in one slab of wood was too costly, [...] "a more efficient method was eventually developed which used mitred moulding strips. These strips were attached to a flat wooden panel which produced a similar result to the carved panel, but were more cost effective. This type of frame is known as an engaged frame. The early ones were made of simple wooden moulding strips attached to the outside edge of a wooden panel." ...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} production of Ju?rez as an apocalyptic symbol {{of the future of}} the neoliberal world in the representations of journalists, graphic narrators, and contemporary artists. While trying to report on the effects of free trade and the War on Drugs, some of these authors recycle old stereotypes about the border and <b>frame</b> <b>border</b> people as violent and disposable, creating what I call a border muselmann, an unresponsive entity incapable of responding to his/her own plight. I maintain that the frequent comparisons of the maquiladora model to Nazi concentration camps tends to be iatrogenic; rather than shedding light on the precarious situation of the workers, it frames their existence into a pre-ordained and inescapable future of gloom. These narratives also contribute {{to the creation of a}} social imaginary that justifies violent military and high impact policing as a solution to social problems. However, I also analyze other works that attempt to explore new ways of assembling information and producing Ju?rez as an arena of thought and not just a death world. My dissertation is organized in four chapters. In the first one, I expose how journalist Charles Bowden launched a powerful set of frames to represent Ju?rez as a gulag and a laboratory of the future, portraying this city as a “worst-case scenario” to borrow a phrase from Claire F. Fox. In the second chapter, I review how Ju?rez has become a complex arena of reflection about the neoliberal model and how this has produced alternative ways of thinking about the representation of violence, its consequences and ways to combat and resist its structural sources. In this chapter I document how Ju?rez is a site of thought and resistance. The third chapter is dedicated to the analysis of how graphic narratives about Ju?rez are also heavily based on stereotypes about the local people. I examine how the artists who have travelled to the city to report on a crisis conceive of themselves. By thinking of themselves as rescuers of the Other, these graphic narrators contribute to an uneven distribution of rights. They reinforce the idea that local residents are either victims or perpetrators, waiting to be rescued from themselves. Finally, in chapter four I examine the work of Teresa Margolles, vis-?-vis the ideas of authors such as Eyal Weizman and Astrid Erll, in order to explore new ways to speak about violence without falling into the formulas that reproduce and reinforce stereotypes. In this final section, I try to demonstrate that this artist?s methods of working with human and social remains, allow for an assemblage of voices that can speak and render certain forgotten lives as grievable. At the same time, I contend, some of her pieces have the potential to become mnemonic artifacts that can carry testimony about grief, tragedy and resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} study {{employs the}} unique collection of decorative material assembled during the research {{to show the}} high level of collaboration of Prague Jewish printers {{of the first half of}} the 16 th century with their Christian counterparts. Czech historians have tended to overlook domestic non-Czech book printing during the Jagiellonian era, considering it representative of a foreign enclave among the era’s Utraquist, Catholic and Brethren print shops focused on the production of texts in the Czech language. But foreign researchers had noticed that the visual side of Jewish and Christian book production showed certain interrelationships. This observation was based on the identification of woodblocks by Prague printer Pavel Severin of Kapí Hora in several Hebrew publications. The occasional borrowing of printing material was not a fundamental feature of domestic book culture. A more important factor to pay attention to is Prague’s role as a multicultural center that after the mid- 1510 ’s provided the printing trade with more opportunities than before. The shopkeeper Severin’s workshop, which he had previously rented out exclusively to the Utraquist Printer of The Prague Bible, apparently began to have alternating tenants. During the interval that the Printer of the Prague Bible was not working, other publishers could ply their trade: Jewish publishers after 1512, Jan Moravus in 1513 and later (1517 – 1519) the Belarusian doctor, translator and publisher Francysk Heorhij Skoryna. A more important phenomenon than the journey of three of four woodblocks would appear to be the fact that the unprecedented increase in and coexistence of several printing shops resulted in a natural demand for woodcutting workshops. The demand was further increased because publishers no longer ordered only illustration cycles for their publications, but in line with ongoing changes in artistic style began to apply book ornament as well (ornamental band, <b>frame,</b> <b>border).</b> The previous practice adopted by the Printer of the Prague Bible – which from 1488 to 1505 relied on cooperation with Augsburg, Nuremberg and Strasbourg – was no longer possible. We thus observe the development of a previously unknown feature of the era’s book art industry: the distribution of all artists’ work into multi-year stages and among several printing houses simultaneously. Like book illuminators during the Hussite and post-Hussite eras, book artists of the early 16 th century worked on commissions regardless of the denominational or ethnic background of their employers. After 1507 seven artists worked in Prague. The typographically conservative printer Mikuláš Konáč instigated the late-Gothic book art of the Master of Burleigh’s Border (1507) and the Master of the Brick Background (1510). The first works by the Master of Skoryna’s Ornament (1514), Master IP (1514), and the Master of Broad Hatching (1525) appear in Jewish commissions. The Master of Fine Hatching was discovered by Francysk Heorhij Skoryna (1517), and the Master of Kohen’s Haggadah was encouraged to work in publishing by Pavel Severin (1525). Master IP and the Master of Fine Hatching worked for Utraquist and Jewish printers and Skoryna. The Master of Fine Hatching and the universal Master of Skoryna’s Ornament even associated themselves with Brethren printers in Litomyšl (Pavel Olivetský) and Mladá Boleslav (Jiřík Štyrsa). The Master of Burleigh’s Border, the Master of Kohen’s Haggadah, and the Master of Broad Hatching worked for Konáč, Severin, and Hebrew printers. The Master of the Brick Background worked with Konáč and Jewish printers as well. The need to work with several book artists at once is documented not only by Skoryna’s Biblia ruska, but also by the Haggadah of 1526, whose publishers hired the Master of Kohen’s Haggadah, the Master of Skoryna’s Ornament, as well as the Master of Burleigh’s Border. The year 1527, when Pavel Severin founded the country’s first artistic workshop dedicated entirely to meeting the needs of his printing house, marks a certain turning point in the history of book design.

The concept of Betweenness requires us not to dissolve multiplicity and interaction of components into unity or unity into multiplicity.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the four main characteristics of the symmetrical placement in batik sarong design. The fi rst is translation, or the repetition, of a motif so that each time it is repeated, it is placed at an equal distance and retains the same size. The second is rotation, when a motif turns around a point, which can be a rotation of 60 °, 90 °, 120 ° or 180 °. The third is refl ection, when the motif is mirrored in its repetition; and the fourth is glide refl ections, when motifs translate along the axis and at the same time refl ect across an axis. Batik sarongs from Malaysia commonly utilize these geometric design principles. This symmetrical patterning provides balance and harmony to the sarong composition. The result of the analysis shows the enhancement of the visual impact on fabrics. The symmetrical order is examined by analysing the layout of the batik sarong&# 039;s panels in the kepala kain (main central panel), the badan kain (larger left and right panel), the apit kain (the <b>framing</b> <b>border)</b> and the tepi kain (upper and lower edges).
