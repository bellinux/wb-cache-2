Over the last 30 years over 5 million meters of this pile {{system has been}} {{installed}} worldwide predominantly in Europe. TRM piles are a pre-fabricated driven pile system utilizing high strength ductile iron pipes which are manufactured using a spun-cast process having outside diameters of 118 and 170 mm. The standard pile lengths are 5,0 m long. The pipes are manufactured with a tapered socket with an internal shoulder for full engagement at top and a tapered spigot at the bottom. The individual pile sections can be connected with this Plug and Drive® connection to drive a pile of any length.|$|E

The aim was {{to get a better}} understanding for piling methods used in Sweden and to work as an information tool for structural engineers. In order to get the technical aspects on piling methods literature study and interviews with structural engineers from Kadesjös Ingenjörsbyrå AB have been conducted. The case study on a residential building in Västerås was also performed. In this case study calculations for a quantity of piling methods have been made and sent for RFQs for various entrepreneurs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{calculation}} {{equation of}} large diameter bored pile's effective length {{is connected with}} its distribution of pile shaft resistance. Thus, {{there is a great}} difference between the calculation results under the different distributions of pile shaft resistance. Primarily, this paper summarizes the conceptualized mode of pile shaft resistance under the circumstance that the soil surrounding the piles presents different layer distributions. Secondly, based on Mindlin's displacement solution and in consideration of the effect of pile diameter, the calculation equation is optimized with the assumption that the pile shaft resistance has a parabolic distribution. The influencing factors are analyzed according to the calculation result of <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length. Finally, combined with an engineering example, the calculation equation deduced in this paper is analyzed and verified. The result shows that both the Poisson ratio of soil and pile diameter have impacted the <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length. Compared with the Poisson ratio of soil, the effect of pile diameter is more significant. If the pile diameter remains the same, the effect of the Poisson ratio of soil to the <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length decreases as the ratio of pile elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. If the Poisson ratio of soil remains the same, the effect of the pile diameter to the <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length increases as the ratio of pile elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. Thus the optimized calculation result of pile effective length under the consideration of pile diameter effect is more close to the actual situation of engineering and reasonably practicable...|$|E

An effective electro-vibroimpact system has been built {{on the basis of}} interactions between two sources of electromagnetic force. A vertical downward progression of mechanism into hard or brittle material required an increased magnitude of impact force within a compact geometry. Horizontal progression into clay is tested by combining periodic impact and static forces that produces an effective progression rate. As a consequence of this experimental work, a prototype electro-vibroimpact system is tested. Electrical circuitry consists of a timer and batteries which is a compact arrangement, functioning as waveform generator, and power supply. A cylindrical hollow aluminium tube houses the main components such as electromagnetic solenoids and oscillating bar within. This protects the main components from clay while progressing into soil and also reduces soil resistance with a minimal surface area.

40|$|Calculation of {{deflections}} for piles loaded {{under both}} axial and lateral loads {{are a key}} component of <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> design. This thesis presents the solution for the problem of a pile in a multi-layered elastic soil subject to axial loads, lateral loads and moments. The multi-layered soil profile is a continuum following either linear elasticity or nonlinear elasticity. The input parameters needed are the pile geometry, soil profile and the elastic constants of the soil and pile. For nonlinear elastic soil, additional parameters are also required. For a given set of loading conditions, the displacement field at any point in the pile-soil domain can be obtained using principles of continuum mechanics and calculus of variations. An analytical solution for the pile displacements is obtained. Functions varying along the depth and radial direction describe the displacement field in the soil. Using strain-displacement and stress strain relationships, these functions are used to define the strain potential energy of the pile-soil system. Further, through calculus of variations, we get the governing differential equations along with boundary conditions involving these functions. The solution of the boundary-value problem relies on the eigenvalue method for the pile differential equations and on the finite difference method for the soil differential equations. An iterative scheme couples the soil and pile solutions, so that the solution to the problem reflects the interaction between the pile and soil. ...|$|E
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are frequently}} used in very loose and weak deposits, in particular soft marine clays deposits to support various industrial structures, power plants, petrochemical complexes, compressor stations and residential multi-storeyed buildings. Under these circumstances, piles are predominantly subjected to horizontal dynamic loads and the pile response to horizontal vibration is very critical {{due to its}} low stiffness. Though many analytical methods {{have been developed to}} estimate the horizontal vibration response, but they are not well validated with the experimental studies. This paper presents the results of horizontal vibration tests carried out on model aluminium single piles embedded in a simulated Elastic Half Space filled with clay. The influence of various soil and pile parameters such as pile length, modulus of clay, magnitude of dynamic load and frequency of excitation on the horizontal vibration response of single piles was examined. Measurement of various response quantities, such as the load transferred to the pile, pile head displacement and the strain variation along the pile length were done using a Data Acquisition System. It is found that the pile length, modulus of clay and dynamic load, significantly influences the natural frequency and peak amplitude of the soil-pile system. The maximum bending moment occurs at the fundamental frequency of the soil-pile system. The maximum bending moment of long piles is about 2 to 4 times higher than that of short piles and it increases drastically with the increase in the shear modulus of clay for both short and long piles. The active or <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> length is found to be increasing under dynamic load and empirical equations are proposed to estimate the active pile length under dynamic loads...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the 't-z method' is {{employed}} {{to describe the}} nonlinear behaviour of a single pile and is used to obtain simplified predictions of pile group behaviour by considering the interaction between two-piles {{in conjunction with the}} Interaction Factor Method (IFM). The principal inconvenience of the t-z method arises from the determination of the resisting curve's shape an improvement upon this aspect is the main aim of this study. Partial slip is considered using a new analytical approach which is an adaptation of a model based on bond degradation. Pile installation effects and interface strength reduction are uncoupled and considered explicitly in this study. Lateral profiles of mean <b>effective</b> stress after <b>pile</b> installation and subsequent consolidation which were representative of predictions determined in a previous study using {{a modified version of the}} cavity expansion method (CEM) are adopted; these predictions are subsequently used to relate installation effects to changes in soil strength and stiffness. In addition, the 'reinforcing' effects of a second, 'receiver', pile on the free-field soil settlement is considered using a nonlinear iterative approach where the relative pile-soil settlement along the pile shaft is related to the soil spring stiffness. Through comparisons with previously published field test data and numerical simulations, the results indicate that the proposed approach provides a sufficiently accurate representation of pile behaviour while conserving considerable computing requirements...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the many recent {{advances}} in pile design and execution methods, the quantitative effects of grouted pile skin resistance and form on subsequent pile behavior remains an area for research. There are many parameters involved {{in the analysis of}} the bearing capacity of piles and descriptive method theory of the loading effect for each parameter is very complex. Many of these parameters are interrelated and investigation of the relationships leads to complex equations, which cannot be easily solved. The only reliable solution is to study the influence of each parameter by experimental model tests in equipped laboratories. This research presents the results of static compression tests on two model groups of pipe and grouted pile shafts (35 mm, 50 mm and 60 mm in diameters and 900 mm in length) installed into beds of Yazd siliceous sand (located in southeast Iran).

40|$|Worked {{example of}} pile {{stability}} analysis An {{example of the}} model parameters used to predict stable pile depth in the Snowy River study (SKM 2005) is outlined. The inputs used in {{the run of the}} LLP 99 model were: • single soil layer, • very high flexural stiffness of pile (1, 000, 000 kN/m 2). • pile width = 0. 3 m (i. e. wooden pile), • shear strength in the absence of lateral stress (for unconsolidated sand 150 kN/m 2 was used), • effective unit weight of soil (15 kN/m 3), • active lateral effective stress coefficient (used 0. 426 based on coefficient of earth pressure at rest for sand with = 35 °), • neutral lateral effective shear stress coefficient (used default – 1), • passive lateral effective stress coefficient (= 1 / active lateral stress coefficient = 2. 35), and • stroke displacement between active and passive stress (used default 0. 02 m). Loading steps of 1 kN were applied at 1 m above the pile interception with the pre-scour bed level. The moment for each loading step is based on a maximum scour hole depth of 3. 5 m, hence the moment arm is 4. 5 m (i. e. moment = 4. 5 kNm for each loading step). The depth of pile was varied in order to determine an <b>effective</b> <b>pile</b> depth for securing LWD. The pile deflection was limited for all pile depths considered (Table 7). For piles constructed 1 m below the maximum scour depth, the piles should not deflect more than 1 cm under the bankfull flow. In practice we would recommend that piles be driven an extra metre to account for any underestimation in maximum scour depth. The recommended pile depth is, therefore, the maximum depth of scour (3. 5 m) plus 2 m, or 5. 5 m from the pre-scour bed level for securing in-stream wood. Table 7.

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} of the cyclic degradation of Rhode Island silts there exists no practical method, numerical model, or otherwise to assist a practicing engineer to determine potential actual hazards to existing structures during pile installation activities. Therefore, the ultimate objective of this research is to predict the onset of significant ground movement during pile driving in silts and to provide practicing engineers with a hazard assessment model that can be utilized to identify the radial extent of significant soil degradation (e. g. the onset of significant induced strains) prior to the onset of construction activities. ^ To meet the research objective, {{a review of the literature}} was performed to determine the applicability of various liquefaction-based analyses to both non-plastic fines (i. e. silts) and for predicting the resulting behavior from pile-induced vibrations. Additionally, a review of the current State-of-Practice was conducted to identify how the hazard of pile-induced vibrations are assessed. It was concluded that energy-based approaches are the most adaptive for this research moreover, the current State-of-Practice does not consider the hazards associated with soil degradation with depth (at best only considers surface vibrations). ^ Secondly, a laboratory-testing program was developed and implemented to determine the response of non-plastic silts in terms of normalized energy capacity. A reconstitution methodology was developed whereby laboratory specimens could be reconstituted to mimic in-situ behavior at any density state through a newly developed normalized density state thus, negating the need for in-situ samples. ^ Lastly, a total stress hazard prediction model was developed based on determining the spatial Factor of Safety, defined as the ratio of normalized energy capacity to normalized energy demand, against the onset of significant movement. The model was then validated against a well-documented case history, wherein the predicted radial hazard extent was in good agreement with the observed deformations. A parametric study was performed to identify model sensitivities. It was concluded that the radial extent of the hazard is most influenced by the <b>effectives</b> stress profile, <b>pile</b> hammer, and pile properties (ultimate capacity, composition, etc.). Therefore, the use of the hazard model, presented herein, would provide practicing engineers with the ability to mitigate potential hazards to adjacent structures during the construction design phase. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{dissertation}} was {{to quantify}} the role of FRP in repairing corroded prestressed piles in a marine environment and to demonstrate the feasibility of using it for field repairs. Three laboratory studies and two field demonstration projects were undertaken to meet this goal. In the first study, corroded specimens were repaired under water and tests conducted {{to determine the extent}} of strength retained immediately after wrapping and after further accelerated corrosion. Results showed that the underwater wrap was effective in restoring and maintaining lost capacity in both situations. The second study attempted to determine the effectiveness of FRP for specimens where corrosion had initiated but with no visible signs of distress. In the study, 22 one-third scale model of prestressed piles fabricated with cast-in-chlorides were wrapped at 28 days and exposed to simulated tidal cycles outdoors for nearly three years. Two materials [...] carbon and glass were evaluated and the number of layers varied from 1 to 4. Results of gravimteric tests showed that the metal loss in FRP wrapped specimens was about a quarter of that in identical unwrapped controls indicating its effectiveness in this application. The third study attempted to identify the most suitable pre-wrap repair. For this purpose, 26 scale model prestressed specimens were first corroded to a targeted metal loss of 25 %, repaired and then exposed to simulated hot salt water tidal cycles for over two years. Two disparate types of repairs were evaluated [...] an elaborate full repair and a simpler epoxy injection repair. Results of ultimate and gravimetric tests conducted at the end of the exposure showed that the performance of the full and epoxy injection repairs were comparable but vastly superior compared to identical unwrapped controls. Two field studies were conducted in which full-sized corroding piles were instrumented and wrapped to monitor post-wrap performance. Corrosion rate measurements indicated that rates were lower for wrapped piles compared to identical unwrapped piles. Overall, the study demonstrated that underwater wrapping of piles using FRP is viable and a potentially cost <b>effective</b> method of <b>pile</b> repair in a marine environment...|$|R

Partindo-se da hipótese que a compostagem é resultado da ação de microorganismos e a aeração é um dos fatores principais para o desenvolvimento de suas atividades, o objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar qual a melhor composição de resíduos (lodo primário, lodo secundário, rejeitos de depuração, casca de eucalipto, dregs, grits e cinza) e a eficiência da biodegradação das leiras de compostagem submetidas à duas metodologias de aeração: revolvimento mecânico e aeração passiva. O revolvimento mecânico foi realizado semanalmente com o auxílio de uma pá carregadeira e a aeração passiva foi proporcionada pela presença de tubos flexíveis perfurados no {{interior}} da leira, onde por conseqüência da diferença de temperatura entre a parte interna e externa, possibilitou a inserção de oxigênio {{no material}}. Para alcançar os objetivos foram montadas nove leiras com misturas diferentes de resíduos, sendo que seis eram periodicamente revolvidas e três eram estáticas e montadas com tubos em seu interior. Ao longo de 120 dias foram monitoradas temperatura, umidade, microorganismos patogênicos, relação C/N e metais pesados. Os resultados indicaram que: a) No final do processo todos os compostos atenderam os limites estipulados pelo CONAMA 375 / 2006; b) Houve redução de Salmonellas e Coliformes Termotolerantes; c) A metodologia de aeração passiva foi eficiente na aeração das leiras; d) O composto atingiu o grau de maturação.

Based on the hypothesis that composting {{is a result of the}} action of microorganisms and the aeration is one of the major factors for the development of its activities, the objective of this study was to determine which is the best waste composition (primary sludge, secondary sludge, tailing sludge, bark from eucalyptus, dregs, grits and ash) and efficiency of biodegradation of the compost piles subjected to two methods of aeration: mechanical tillage and passive aeration. Mechanical tillage was done weekly using a front loader and the passivity was proposed in this work provided by the presence of drilled flexible pipes inside the windrow, where consequently the temperature difference between the internal and external areas enabled the insertion of oxygen in the material. Achieving the objectives it has been set up nine piles with different mixtures of waste, providing that six were periodically tilled and three were static and had drilled flexible pipes inside then. During 120 days it was monitored temperature, humidity, pathogenic microorganisms, C / N ratio and heavy metals.

The impact of pile spacing along the row, {{which is likely to}} {{have a significant effect on}} stability, is not clearly understood from a current design perspective. In this study the effects of pile spacing on passive interaction with the slope are investigated using a series of geotechnical centrifuge model tests which are interpreted with a proposed theoretical framework. A total of 23 geotechnical centrifuge model tests were successfully carried out (Chapters 3 and 4) : • A plane strain model slope was subjected to up to 50 g centrifugal acceleration, with the upper layer of the slope tending to fail on an underlying predefined surface. The model piles were instrumented to measure bending moment, and hence the shear force and pressure on the piles resulting from interaction with the unstable layer were deduced using a curve-fitting technique. Cameras ‘on-board’ the centrifuge model allowed in-flight photogrammetry to be used to determine soil or pile displacement. • Pile spacing (s/d) was varied, which determined limiting pile-soil interaction for the row, and variation of other geometrical parameters (l/h) for the slope controlled the total load on the pile row. • A number of mechanisms of behaviour for the reinforced slope were identified ranging from a successfully stabilised slope to shallow and deeper slips passing through the pile row, as well as slips which occurred upslope of the pile row and thus did not interact with it. A theoretical framework was developed and used to interpret the results (Chapter 5) : • The centrifuge model test results have been successfully interpreted using the proposed analytical approach. • The centrifuge test results confirm previous numerical modelling results, and hence a simple theory which can be used for calculation of the maximum stabilising force available from interaction of the pile row with the slope. The work presented here also confirmed that another previous theoretical model, although quite widely used, is somewhat flawed.
