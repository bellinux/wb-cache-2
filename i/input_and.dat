40|$|Efficient <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service {{delivery}} may {{call for a}} hub approach where all the necessary <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services are supplied in a coordinated manner, either by a single supplier or by several and separate entities in a given geographical location accessible to beneficiaries. Based on experience from Ada'a milk shed in central Ethiopia, this paper assesses the evolution of <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service provision in the dairy sub-sector, focusing on coordination {{and the degree of}} competition among different actors at different levels in the value chain over time. Data were collected from key value chain actors engaged in provision of <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> output marketing services in Ada'a milk shed. The major lesson is that the development of coordinated <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> {{service delivery}} by different business entities or under a single business entity may not emerge at once, but through a gradual evolution. This depends on the level of demand for the <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services as determined by the degree of demand for milk and milk products, and the economies of scale <b>input</b> suppliers <b>and</b> service providers could attain from the expansion of demands for these <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services. Moreover, at the early stage of a hub development, collective actions and integration of services and marketing within a business organisation could be the main strategy to attain efficiency. But, once the demand for <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services has grown, competition among different entities will lead to more efficient <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service delivery. In general, where there is an increasing demand for <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services, there is a faster development of <b>input</b> supply <b>and</b> service provision by private actors and collective actions in a more competitive way. Role of the public sector could change gradually from provision of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> services to coordination, capacity building, quality control, and regulation...|$|R
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat <b>input</b> <b>and</b> thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat <b>input</b> <b>and</b> can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is a non-parametric data oriented {{method for}} evaluating relative {{efficiency of the}} number of decision making units (DMUs) based on pre-selected <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs. In some real DEA applications, the large number of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs, in comparison with the number of DMUs, is a pitfall that could have major influence on the efficiency scores. Recently, an approach was introduced which aggregates collected <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs {{in order to reduce the}} number of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs iteratively. The purpose of this paper is to show that there are three drawbacks in this approach: instability due to existence of an infinitesimal epsilon, iteratively which can be improved to just one iteration, <b>and</b> providing non-radial <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> outputs and then capturing them.

30|$|In this section, we {{consider}} the case of two <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> a single output to show the relationship between DEA efficiency and the production frontier. DEA efficiency is independent of the change of <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> output by the same proportion, so we can change the <b>inputs</b> <b>and</b> output in the same proportion for each DMU until the output data of the evaluated DMUs and sample DMUs are equal. Next, the coordinate system is established with <b>input</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>input</b> 2 as the x and y coordinate axes.

The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E

In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> output).

This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive.
