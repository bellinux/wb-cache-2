It would remain the highest influx of international players selected in the modern NBA draft era until the 2016 NBA draft, where almost half of the selected players were born in countries outside the US. In addition, four of the players selected in the draft were Russians, which not only marked the highest number of players born in that region to be taken in one draft, but also was the <b>highest</b> <b>representation</b> of a country in one draft until 2016 when five Frenchmen would be taken in the draft.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergent}} mathematical {{philosophy of}} categorification is reshaping {{our view of}} modern mathematics by uncovering a hidden layer of structure in mathematics, revealing richer and more robust structures capable of describing more complex phenomena. Categorified <b>representation</b> theory, or <b>higher</b> <b>representation</b> theory, aims to understand {{a new level of}} structure present in representation theory. Rather than studying actions of algebras on vector spaces where algebra elements act by linear endomorphisms of the vector space, <b>higher</b> <b>representation</b> theory describes the structure present when algebras act on categories, with algebra elements acting by functors. The new level of structure in <b>higher</b> <b>representation</b> theory arises by studying the natural transformations between functors. This enhanced perspective brings into play a powerful new set of tools that deepens our understanding of traditional representation theory. This volume exhibits some of the current trends in <b>higher</b> <b>representation</b> theory and the diverse techniques that are being employed in this field with the aim of showcasing the many applications of <b>higher</b> <b>representation</b> theory.

The oldest recipient of the award is Dai Rees, who won in 1957 aged 44. Ian Black, who won the following year, aged 17, is the youngest winner. Torvill and Dean, who won in 1984, are the only non-individual winners of the award, so in the 61 years of the award there have been 62 recipients. Of these 13 have been female. 17 sporting disciplines have been represented; athletics has the <b>highest</b> <b>representation,</b> with 17 recipients. Counting Torvill and Dean separately, there have been 48 English winners of the award, six Scottish, four Welsh, three Northern Irish, and one Manx. Since the award ceremony began only on one occasion (2013) have none of the podium placers been English. On three occasions a sportsman from outside the United Kingdom has made the podium, on each occasion for sporting success achieved in Great Britain; New Zealand speedway star Barry Briggs (1964 and 1966) and Italian jockey Frankie Dettori (1996). Barry McGuigan, Greg Rusedski and Lennox Lewis originally competed for Ireland (McGuigan) and Canada (Rusedski and Lewis) respectively, but had completed their transfer of allegiance to Great Britain by the time of their awards.|$|E
500|$|Kagame's image amongst {{international}} observers is varied. Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Freedom House, {{claim that}} Kagame hamstrings his opposition by restricting candidacies in elections to government-friendly parties, suppressing demonstrations, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists. Human Rights Watch and Freedom House have accused Kagame of using strict laws criminalizing [...] "divisionism" [...] (ethnic hatred) and genocide ideology to silence his critics, {{to the point}} that Rwanda is a de facto one-party state. [...] It has praised some aspects of Kagame's rule, such as the progress made in the delivery of justice and the abolition of the death penalty. Other progressive initiatives include supporting a UN declaration on LGBT rights, as well as the world's <b>highest</b> <b>representation</b> of women in parliament. Kagame's image amongst foreign leaders was very positive until the late 2000s. He was credited with ending the genocide, bringing peace and security to Rwanda, and achieving development. Since 2010, the international community has increasingly criticized Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda's support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo. In 2012, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of budget support to Rwanda, with many redirecting their aid to project-based assistance.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{as much of}} {{this kind}} of {{richness}} of tone is always given by Turner as is compatible with truth of aerial effect; but he will not sacrifice the higher truths of his landscape to mere pitch of color as Titian does. He infinitely prefers having the power of giving extension of space, and fulness of form, to that of giving deep melodies of tone; he feels too much the incapacity of art, with its feeble means of light, to give the abundance of nature's gradations; and therefore it is, that taking pure white for his highest expression of light, that even pure yellow may give him one more step in the scale of shade, he becomes necessarily inferior in richness of effect to the old masters of tone, (who always used a golden highest light,) but gains by the sacrifice a thousand more essential truths. For, though we all know how much more like light, in the abstract, a finely-toned warm hue will be to the feelings than white, yet it is utterly impossible to mark the same number of gradations between such a sobered high light and the deepest shadow, which we can between this and white; and as these gradations are absolutely necessary to give the facts of form and distance, which, as we have above shown, are more important than any truths of tone,[17] Turner sacrifices the richness of his picture to its completeness--the manner of the statement to its matter. And not only is he right in doing this for the sake of space, but he is right also in the abstract question of color; for as we observed above (Sect. 14,) it is only the white light--the perfect unmodified group of rays--which will bring out local color perfectly; and if the picture, therefore, is to be complete in its system of color, that is, if it is to have each of the three primitives in their purity, it must have white for its highest light, otherwise the purity of one of them at least will be impossible. And this leads us to notice the second and more frequent quality of light, (which is assumed if we make our <b>highest</b> <b>representation</b> of it yellow,) the positive hue, namely, which it may itself possess, of course modifying whatever local tints it exhibits, and thereby rendering certain colors necessary, and certain colors impossible. Under the direct yellow light of a descending sun, for instance, pure white and pure blue are both impossible; because the purest whites and blues that nature could produce would be turned in some degree into gold or green by it; and when the sun is within half a degree of the horizon, if the sky be clear, a rose light supersedes the golden one, still more overwhelming in its effect on local color. I have seen the pale fresh green of spring vegetation in the gardens of Venice, on the Lido side, turned pure russet, or between that and crimson, by a vivid sunset of this kind, every particle of green color being absolutely annihilated. And so under all colored lights, (and there are few, from dawn to twilight, which are not slightly tinted by some accident of atmosphere,) there is a change of local color, which, when in a picture it is so exactly proportioned that we feel at once both what the local colors are in themselves, and what is the color and strength of the light upon them, gives us truth of tone.|$|E

40|$|Sources in <b>higher</b> <b>representations</b> of SU(N) {{gauge theory}} at T= 0 couple with {{apparently}} stable strings with tensions {{depending on the}} specific representation rather than on its N-ality. Similarly at the deconfining temperature these sources carry their own representation-dependent critical exponents. It is pointed out that in some instances one can evaluate exactly these exponents by fully exploiting the correspondence between the 2 + 1 dimensional critical gauge theory and the 2 d conformal field theory in the same universality class. The emerging functional form of the Polyakov-line correlators suggests a similar form for Wilson loops in <b>higher</b> <b>representations</b> which helps in understanding the behaviour of unstable strings at T= 0. A generalised Wilson loop in which along part of its trajectory a source is converted in a gauge invariant way into <b>higher</b> <b>representations</b> with same N-ality {{could be used as}} a tool to estimate the decay scale of the unstable strings.
