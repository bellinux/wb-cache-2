25|$|Philodendrons {{have both}} aerial and {{subterranean}} roots. The aerial roots occur in many {{shapes and sizes}} and originate {{from most of the}} plant's nodes or occasionally from an internode. The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of root hairs attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive hydrotropic and negative <b>heliotropic</b> behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a sclerotic hypodermis, which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the sclerotic hypodermis are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.|$|E

5000|$|This {{alignment}} {{results from}} heliotropism {{in an earlier}} development stage, the bud stage, before the appearance of flower heads (anthesis). The buds are <b>heliotropic</b> {{until the end of}} the bud stage, and finally face East. Their apparent <b>heliotropic</b> motion is a circadian rhythm, synchronized by the sun, which continues if the sun disappears on cloudy days or if plants are moved to constant light. If a sunflower plant in the bud stage is rotated 180°, the bud will be turning away from the sun for a few days, as resynchronization by the sun takes time. The <b>heliotropic</b> motion of the bud is caused by unequal growth speed of the flower stalk and only occurs before the flowers open. The motion of the 'nodding' buds is irreversible, but cumulative. When growth of the flower stalk stops and the flower is mature, the heliotropisms also stops and the flower faces east from that moment onward. This eastward orientation allows rapid warming in the morning and, as a result, an increase in pollinator visits. [...] Sunflowers do not have a pulvinus below their inflorescence. A pulvinus is a flexible segment in the leaf stalks (petiole) of some plant species and functions as a 'joint'. It effectuates leaf motion due to reversible changes in turgor pressure, which occurs without growth. The sensitive plant's closing leaves are a good example of reversible leaf movement via pulvinuli.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{palmette}} originated in ancient Egypt 2,500 years B.C., and has influenced Greek art. Egyptian palmettes (Greek Anthemion) were originally based on features of various flowers, including the papyrus and the lotus or lily representing lower and upper Egypt and their fertile union, before it became associated with the palm tree. From earliest times {{there was a strong}} association with the sun and it is probably an early form of the halo.Among the oldest forms of the palmette in ancient Egypt was a 'rosette' or daisy-like lotus flower emerging from a 'V' of foliage or petals resembling the 'akhet' hieroglyph depicting the setting or rising sun at the point where it touches the two mountains of the horizon - 'dying', being 'reborn' and giving life to the earth. A second form, apparently evolved from this, is a more fully developed palmette similar to the forms found in Ancient Greece. [...] Third is a version consisting of a clump of lotus or papyrus blooms on tall stems, with a drooping bud or flower on either side, arising from a (primal) swamp. The lotus and papyrus clump occur in association with Hapy, the god of the crucial life-giving annual Nile inundation, who binds their stems together around an offering table in the sema-tawi motif - itself echoing the shapes of the 'akhet' of the horizon. This unification scene appeared on the base of the throne of several kings, who were thought of as preserving the union of the two lands of (upper and lower, but also physical and spiritual) Egypt and thereby mastering the forces of renewal. These 'binding' scenes, and the <b>heliotropic</b> swamp plants appearing in them, evoked the necessity of discerning and revealing the underlying harmony, the origin of all manifest forms, that re-connects the dispersed and separate-seeming fragments of everyday experience. The further implication is that it is from this apparently occult and magical, undivided source that fertility and new life spring.|$|E

P., Awramik, S. M., 1985. Stromatolites and Earth-Sun-Moon dynamics. Precambrian Research 29, 121 - 142]. The model of <b>heliotropic</b> growth was used to estimate obliquity of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt) and days/year at 850 Ma. Subsequent work, however, casts strong doubt on the <b>heliotropic</b> interpretation. Further field observations {{and the study of}} 11 additional specimens of Anabaria = Kotuikania juvensis from the original locality confirm that the columns typically display strong branching, which produces a common divergence and convergence of columns that is incompatible with <b>heliotropic</b> growth. The rare, apparent sinuosity of columns is seen as the fortuitous product of column irregularity and column branching. Moreover, stratigraphic studies indicate that the host dolomite unit does not belong to the Bitter Springs Formation but caps the younger Cryogenian glaciogenic succession in the Amadeus Basin and hence is ~ 600 Ma. The previous estimate of ~ 435 (range 409 - 485) days/year based on extrapolated counts of laminae in the original specimen of A. = K. juvensis conflicts with the figure of 400 ± 7 days/year indicated by high-quality palaeotidal data obtained from the late Cryogenian (~ 640 - 600 Ma) Elatina-Reynella tidal rhythmites in South Australia.

Each eye controls the tonus of a different group of muscles {{on both sides of}} the body. Different areas of each eye likewise are related to the tonus of different muscle groups, and the relationship is entirely analogous to that of the otic labyrinth of vertebrates. Asymmetrical conditions of muscle tension are produced by any procedure which establishes an unequal photochemical reaction in the two eyes, by difference in illumination, by partial or complete blackening of one eye, or establishing unequal sensitiveness in the two eyes. The unbalanced condition of muscle tonus expresses itself in unusual postures of the resting insects, and in movements in forced paths—circus motions when one eye has been blackened. These reactions vary directly with the intensity of the illumination, as shown not only by the variation in diameters of the circles, but also by the reactions of the insects on vertical surfaces and on the turntable. The relation of the results of these experiments to the problem of <b>heliotropic</b> orientation is too obvious to require detailed discussion, which could only lead to a repetition of the description of the mechanism f heliotropism which Loeb has so clearly expounded.

40|$|<b>Heliotropic</b> leaf {{movement}} or leaf ‘solar tracking ’ occurs {{for a wide}} variety of plants, including many desert species and some crops. This has an important effect on the canopy spectral reflectance as measured from satellites. For this reason, monitoring systems based on spectral vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), should account for <b>heliotropic</b> movements when evaluating the health condition of such species. In the hyper-arid Atacama Desert, Northern Chile, we studied seasonal and diurnal variations of MODIS and Landsat NDVI time series of plantation stands of the endemic species Prosopis tamarugo Phil., subject to different levels of groundwater depletion. As solar irradiation increased during the day and also during the summer, the paraheliotropic leaves of Tamarugo moved to an erectophile position (parallel to the sun rays) making the NDVI signal to drop. This way, Tamarugo stands with no water stress showed a positive NDVI difference between morning and midday (DNDVImo-mi) and between winter and summer (DNDVIW-S). In this paper, we showed that the DNDVImo-mi of Tamarugo stands can be detected using MODIS Terra and Aqua images, and the DNDVIW-S using Landsat or MODIS Terra images. Because pulvinar movement is triggered by changes in cell turgor, the effects of water stress caused by groundwater depletion can be assessed and monitored using DNDVImo-mi and DNDVIW-S. For an 11 -year time series without rainfall events, Landsat DNDVIW-S of Tamarugo stands showed a positive linear relationship with cumulative groundwater depletion.
