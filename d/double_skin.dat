2500|$|The Dongdaemun Design Plaza (2007–2013) {{is among}} the largest {{buildings}} in Seoul, South Korea. Its name means [...] "Great Gate of the East", {{in reference to the}} old walls of the city. The complex of 86,574 square metres contains exhibition space, a museum of design, conference rooms and other common facilities, as well as the bureaux and a marketplace for designers which is open 24 hours a day. The main building is 280 metres long with seven levels, including three levels underground. The smooth-skinned, giant mushroom-like structure floating atop sloping pylons is made of concrete, aluminium, steel and stone on the exterior, and finished inside with plaster reinforced with synthetic fibre, acoustic tiles, acrylic resin, and stainless steel and polished stone on the interior. Hadid wrote that the principal characteristics of her design were [...] "transparency, porousness, and durability." [...] It also features many ecological features, including a <b>double</b> <b>skin,</b> solar panels, and a system for recycling water.|$|E

60|$|The cold daily increased, and Godfrey {{began to}} feel much the want of warmer clothing. However, on the eighth day the Ostjaks brought in two suits. They were the joint work of {{the women of the}} village. As the Ostjaks were greatly pleased at the {{quantity}} of food coming in daily, which ensured them a sufficiency of meat throughout the winter, in addition to their own stock of fish, the work was well done. For each a closely-fitting shirt had been made of the squirrel skins they had brought down with them, with the fur inside. The trousers were of red fox-skin, with the hair outside. The upper garment was a long capote of the same fur, reaching down to the ankles, and furnished with a hood covering the head and face, with the exception of an opening from the eyes down to the mouth. In addition to these, was given to each as a present a pair of Ostjak boots. These were large and loose. They were made of goat-skins, rendered perfectly supple by grease and rubbing, and with the hair inside. They came up to the thighs, and had a thick sole made of layers of elk-hide. There was also for each a pair of socks of squirrel's skin, with the hair inside, and a pair of fingerless gloves of <b>double</b> <b>skin,</b> the fur being both inside and out, except in the palm, which was of single skin, with the fur inside.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>skin</b> milk {{originates}} {{from the}} Shunde District in Guangdong. It {{is said to}} have been created by Grandma Dong in 1850 in Shunde.Cowherd Grandma Dong (Xiaohua Dong) wished to store unsold milk. In one experiment she boiled the milk and found a skin formed on the milk after cooling it down. The skin was surprisingly delicious. After several improvements we have today's <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> milk, with Grandma Dong credited as the originator. Nowadays, the skills used in making <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> milk are listed as part of the Shunde Intangible Cultural Heritage.|$|E

50|$|Construction of the prototype, {{with steel}} tube {{fuselage}} covered with plywood skinning and steel tube built up wings, with the 'enerzh' <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> surface-evaporation radiators forming {{the leading edge}} skin, back to the main-spars, was approximately 90% finished when the Soviet Air Force rejected the aircraft on grounds of vulnerability of the cooling system.|$|R
50|$|The wing may be {{a single}} or <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> unit. A single skin wing uses the same {{material}} for structure and holding the air, while a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> arrangement uses an airtight bladder in a structural casing of strong but porous textile. Single skin construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> wing, while repair of the single skin bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details. Single skin wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth.Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.|$|E

50|$|The Aero Letňany A.10 was a biplane {{airliner}} {{produced in}} Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I. It {{was the first}} commercial aircraft {{to be built in}} Czechoslovakia and was known as the Ae-10 Limousine. It was designed by Husnik and Vlasak and was intended to meet the growing need for aerial communication to and from the country. Behind the single nose-mounted engine was a cabin with seats for three and two tables, upholstered on the underside, and able to be inverted to provide another two seats if required. A <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> firewall between the engine and cabin, together with <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> surfaces to the walls, floor and roof and Triplex windows gave a (relatively) quiet ride. A rear window gave communication with the pilot, whose open cockpit was above and behind the cabin. The cockpit also accommodated the navigator who had a seat directly behind the pilot.|$|R
50|$|Several {{versions}} of the Otter were manufactured. The original design consisted of a single skin glass fibre hull and a Gunter rig (without spinnaker). Later models used the more successful Bermudan rig (with optional spinnaker), and a <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> 'unsinkable' hull with integrated buoyancy tanks. The hull weight and sail area depend on the version. The picture to the right shows the original wooden masted Gunter sailplan.|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} six <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> {{structural}} models, namely four mild steel models and two aluminum alloy models, have been tested in a quasi-static loading condition, varying the plate thickness and the initial colliding location. The mild steel models were designed to represent side or bottom structures typical in double hull tankers or LNG carriers. The aluminum alloy models were designed to examine the internal mechanics in collision and grounding of aluminum alloy hull vessels for future designs.

50|$|Following some {{forty years}} of design {{development}} using chined plywood hulls, both Guernsey and Jersey are now importing superior double and single washdeck fibreglass boats from France. Semi washdeck, chined, <b>double</b> <b>skinned,</b> plywood quads, were under construction in Guernsey during {{the first decade of}} this century, though none were built in 2009. A Guernsey designed carbon fibre double and quad appeared in 2008. This design went into production in the UK in 2009, with a fleet being built for the 2009 world championships in Plymouth. Boat building in Jersey ceased in the '80's. All Channel Island boats are now built to FISA dimensions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{different}} {{specimens of}} hollow composite columns with perforated ribs, {{one is the}} column with <b>double</b> steel <b>skin</b> {{and the other is}} with single steel skin, were designed for imposing axial compression test. The tests indicated that both of the columns have a good bearing capacity and the column with <b>double</b> steel <b>skin</b> has a comparatively better bearing capacity than the one with single steel skin. Then comparisons between tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were preceded, which showed that not only the load-displacement relationship of the columns, but also a reasonable failure mode can be simulated by the finite element analysis...|$|R

40|$|Satellite-borne scatterometers {{are used}} to measure {{backscattered}} micro-wave radiation from the ocean surface. This data {{may be used to}} infer surface wind vectors where no direct measurements exist. Inherent in this data are outliers owing to aberrations on the water surface and measurement errors within the equipment. We present two techniques for identifying outliers using neural networks; the outliers may then be removed to improve models derived from the data. Firstly the generative topographic mapping (GTM) is used to create a probability density model; data with low probability under the model may be classed as outliers. In {{the second part of the}} paper, a sensor model with input-dependent noise is used and outliers are identified based on their probability under this model. GTM was successfully modified to incorporate prior knowledge of the shape of the observation manifold; however, GTM could not learn the <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> nature of the observation manifold. To learn this <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> manifold necessitated the use of a sensor model which imposes strong constraints on the mapping. The results using GTM with a fixed noise level suggested the noise level may vary as a function of wind speed. This was confirmed by experiments using a sensor model with input-dependent noise, where the variation in noise is most sensitive to the wind speed input. Both models successfully identified gross outliers with the largest differences between models occurring at low wind speeds. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{submerged}} floating tunnel (SFT) {{must have}} enough strength to resist to various external loadings such as bending, torsion, tension, and compression. The expected main deformation of SFT is caused by bending moment. And this bending moment makes tensile stress and compression stress {{on the wall of}} SFT. Thus, bending moment is a main affecting factor on the safety of SFT. Until now, a reinforced concrete tunnel was suggested for SFT by other researchers. In this study, an internally confined hollow reinforced concrete tunnel and a <b>double</b> <b>skinned</b> composite tubular tunnel were proposed. And their bending strengths were studied and compared with that of a reinforced concrete tunnel. The analysis results showed the proposed SFT structures had enough strength to guarantee safety...|$|R
