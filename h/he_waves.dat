5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, the crew is singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care less if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the Doctor has brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E
60|$|He {{does not}} need to finish his sentence, <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> an unteachable {{destructive}} arm.|$|E
60|$|When he got astride {{again he}} saw his father and the next driver heading their horses south. So he started Sorrel and the drive had begun. <b>He</b> <b>waved</b> his sombrero at his father. And <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> it in the {{direction}} of home, with a message to Lucy.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>waved</b> {{his hand}} towards the case which {{contained}} the breastplate.|$|R
5000|$|As Morgan went {{to court}} Isabel, <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> hello to some townspeople.|$|R
60|$|They see in his gay rotundity A clumsy stuffed-out dress-- They {{see in the}} cup <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> on high A tinselled emptiness.|$|E
60|$|The cruel old scoundrel brightens up At {{the death}} of the Olden Year, And <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> a {{gorgeous}} golden cup, And bids the world good cheer.|$|E
6000|$|... (Shaman stiffens {{suddenly}} with hideous [...] facial distortions, with inturned eye-balls [...] and loosened jaw. <b>He</b> <b>waves</b> {{his arms}} [...] about, writhes and twists in torment, as [...] if in epilepsy.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>waved</b> {{his hand}} to the runner. The brave grasped Jim's arm.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{knew they}} would come! See, father, see! Geoffrey is smiling as <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> his handkerchief, and Adam's hand is on his shoulder. Answer them! oh, answer them! I can only look." ...|$|E
6000|$|PHILIP (re-appearing). He comes. (<b>He</b> <b>waves</b> his bat {{over the}} window. Bohun comes in, {{taking off his}} false nose and {{throwing}} {{it on the table}} in passing as he comes between Gloria and Valentine.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>waved</b> {{his hand}} deprecatingly, the bradawl used {{for his work}} in it.|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> a hand {{towards the}} tall cloaked figure at his side.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>waved</b> {{away the}} men who would have interfered, and the blades rang together.|$|R
60|$|ASHER. Let them strike. If {{they burned}} down the shops this afternoon, I wouldn't stop them! (<b>He</b> <b>waves</b> TIMOTHY Off.) My boy is leaving for France, and I'm going to New York with him.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly his eye becomes fixed, and <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> a fat hand vigorously at Jethro, who {{answers the}} salute {{with a nod}} of unwonted cordiality for him. Then comes a hush, and the {{exercises}} begin.|$|E
6000|$|STEPHEN: (Looks {{up to the}} sky) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. (<b>He</b> <b>waves</b> his hand) Hand {{hurts me}} slightly. Enfin ce sont vos oignons. (To Cissy Caffrey) Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>waved</b> {{his hand}} and she stole away. At the door he stopped her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>waved</b> his hand, and betook {{himself again}} to his {{employment}} of gathering herbs.|$|R
60|$|I {{acknowledged}} {{this interesting}} communication by a sympathetic murmur. <b>He</b> <b>waved</b> his hand carelessly.|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (smiling). Oh--you--yes! (Then seriously.) I don't {{care for}} the atmosphere, though. (<b>He</b> <b>waves</b> his hand towards the {{partition}} looking out on the porch.) All those people in bed {{out there on the}} porch seem so sick. It's depressing. I can't do anything for them--and--it makes me feel so helpless.|$|E
6000|$|BENNET [waves {{her back}} into silence]. Mr. Newte was given {{refreshment}} suitable to his station. [She goes to interrupt. Again <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> her back.] We are speaking of more important matters. Your cousin reminded you {{that you would have}} to pass the lodge, occupied by your Aunt Amelia. I state the case correctly? ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Valentine drums {{gently with}} his mahl-stick on the floor. Madonna looks towards him directly; <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> his hand {{round and round}} rapidly above his head. This is the sign which means [...] "Zack." [...] The girl smiles brightly, and blushes as she sees it. Zack is {{apparently}} one of her special favorites.|$|E
60|$|The {{fisherman}} murmured an ejaculation of pity, as <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> {{a hand in}} adieu.|$|R

6000|$|... "Here, placid 'Carlisle' {{breathes}} his gentle line, [...] Or haply, gen'rous 'Hare', re-echoes thine.

6000|$|But ever when it seemed--her {{need was}} at the sorest, [...] A prince in shining mail--comes prancing through the forest, [...] A waving ostrich-plume--a buckler {{burnished}} bright; [...] I've seen him in my dreams--good sooth! a gallant knight.

6000|$|... 'Who knows? He is gone, inscrutable at heart, and {{the poor}} girl is leading a sort of soundless, inert life in Stein's house. Stein has aged greatly of late. He feels it himself, and says often that he is [...] "{{preparing}} to leave all this; preparing to leave [...] ." [...] while <b>he</b> <b>waves</b> his hand sadly at his butterflies.' ...|$|E
60|$|With that <b>he</b> <b>waved</b> {{his hand}} to an {{assistant}} and dismissed me from his thought.|$|R
