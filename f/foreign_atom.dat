During the scattering process the initial state wave vector ki of electron wave function is scattered to a final state wave vector kf. Because the electron gas is a Fermi gas only electrons with energies near the Fermi level can participate in the scattering process because there must be empty final states for the scattered states to jump to. Electrons that are too far below the Fermi level EF can't jump to unoccupied states. The states around the Fermi level that can be scattered occupy a limited range of k-values or wavelengths. So only electrons within a limited wavelength range near the Fermi level are scattered resulting in a density modulation around the impurity like ...|$|E

These calculations were motivated by experimental investigations of similar structures by the SFU group. The multilayer structures of interest have the general form: Fe/Cu(k) /Fe and Fe/Cu(m) /X(1) /Cu(n) /Fe where X indicates one AL (atomic layer) of <b>foreign</b> <b>atoms</b> X (Cr, Ag, or Fe) and k, m, n represent the number of atomic layers of Cu.

40|$|SUMMARY. This paper {{presents}} an extended {{version of the}} local lattice deformation model of solid solutions (J. T. Iiyama, I 974 b). It has been assumed previously that a <b>foreign</b> <b>atom</b> fixed in a crystal causes local lattice deformation, which prevents another <b>foreign</b> <b>atom</b> from occupying the deformed zone. The resulting entropy of the solid solution from this model can explain the particular behaviour of ion-exchange r actions observed with alkali and alkali-earth elements in feldspars and in musco-vite. The present version assumes that the deformed zone does not prohibit foreign atoms, but {{that the number of}} foreign atoms acceptable in this region depends on the total numbers of foreign atoms already fixed in the crystal. The model is applied successfully to explain ion-exchange isotherms ob-served with Cs, Na, and Li in micas and permits an estimation of the apparent reaction constant of the ion exchange. This is otherwise impossible {{because of the lack of}} ideal dilute-solution behaviour in exchange isotherms even at the IO ppm range of the foreign element fixed into the crystal. It is demon-strated that the model can explain the particular behaviour of Li in sanidine. THE behaviour of alkali and alkal i-earth trace elements in feldspars, feldspathoids, and micas has been studied experimentally by using ion-exchange reactions unde...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The topmost atom {{layers of}} any surface often play very crucial roles {{regarding}} the surface properties, {{in addition to}} facilitating the interaction of materials with their external environment. They form substrates for both homo and hetero-epitaxial growth of thin Â¯lms used in semiconducting device fabrication and in other cases act as heterogeneous catalysts used to induce and steer a given chemical reaction. They are the key players in many surface processes such as bonding, wettability, surface conductivity, lubrication, optical absorption and corrosion among many others. Some of these processes can be aÂ®ected quite signiÂ¯cantly by the <b>foreign</b> <b>atoms</b> residing on the surfaces, which may be introduced onto the surfaces either intentionally or through alien means. It is therefore extremely important when studying surface properties to pay keen interest towards their nature and where necessary the <b>foreign</b> <b>atoms</b> residing on them, their bonding sites and also the bonds that they form, {{as well as their}} proportions. <b>Foreign</b> <b>atoms</b> on diamond surfaces have already been shown to alter its surface properties {{in a way that makes}} it quite useful in various technological applications and in other cases less attractive. Among the many <b>foreign</b> <b>atoms</b> that may bond onto polished diamond surfaces, oxygen has so far been shown to be among the main adsorbate on diamond surfaces prepared through mechanical polishing and then cleaned in an acid mixture, followed by rinsing in deionised water. This was conÂ¯rmed by our XPS studies which further established that the optimum oxygen coverage on clean diamond surfaces was 0. 5 monolayers on the (100) surface, and 0. 3 monolayers on both the (110) and (111) surfaces. The oxygen atoms were further bonded in various oxidation states, sometimes forming C-O or C=O bonds and in other cases C-OH bonds. The C=O bond was found to be the most stable conÂ¯guration on the (111) surfaces, while the C-O-C and C-OH dominated on the (100) surfaces. The (110) surface had four major functional groups, which included the C-OH, C-O-C, C=O and COOH groups, with none of them showing any outright dominance. Few cases were nonetheless considered on this surface, and the absence of any speciÂ¯c group being the most stable was attributed to the nature of the surface. Some minor groups such as O-C-O, O-C=O, C-O-C=O and H-C=O were also observed occasionally on the three surfaces, and these were believed to reside at suitable sites with more dangling bonds such as steps, edges etc. This study also investigated quite extensively the transfer of 13 C atoms onto polished diamond surfaces.
