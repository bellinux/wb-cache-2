Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton, [...] "Oh, I was really down. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>in</b> ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song... It was the band.

500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Yang as [...] "competitive", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "intelligent", {{while also}} noting her weaknesses: [...] "bossy", [...] "aggressive", and [...] "tactless". Oh {{said of her}} character: [...] "I've always tried to play Cristina with {{a tremendous amount of}} focus and ambition—which is the reality for a female surgeon. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>in</b> real life there aren't many of them. But the ones you encounter are {{at the very top of}} their game. You have to have a kind of ascetic personality to survive." [...] James Pickens, Jr. who portrays Dr. Webber said: [...] "That character itself set a bar in terms of how we look at millennial women: independent yet vulnerable, seriously competitive yet caring." [...] Rhimes referred to Yang's relationship with Burke by the portmanteau [...] "Burktina", citing [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] as one of her favorite episodes featuring them because it shows their evolution from the beginning of the second season to its end.|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 2005, a re-release of Too Bad You're Beautiful was issued, {{featuring}} the {{songs from the}} Sin, Sorrow, and Sadness EP. Under direction of producer Richardson, From Autumn to Ashes' third full length album, Abandon Your Friends, was released on August 30, 2005. The album stemmed from the idea that [...] " [...] kind of...what we do. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>in</b> the sense of how life goes on when we go away [...]" [...] Abandon Your Friends met with speculation about the band's internal conflicts surrounding a potential break up. Perri had not been much {{involved in the process}} of creating the album and did not attend practice sessions, despite stating in interviews that the album was [...] "a full on collaborative effort" [...] and [...] "We just all had a say in what we were writing." [...] It was revealed in 2007, in interviews, and when Mark posted in the band's Myspace blog that he had ghostwritten Perri's lyrics in a matter of days. The band had made a further move away from the melodic sound of their past albums, and had been a point where the band shifted more focus to Mark's vocals. CMJ reviewer Tracey John explained that the album [...] "continues to unabashedly straddle both ends of the hardcore/emo spectrum", however, the band [...] "doesn't show much of a progression from 2003's The Fiction We Live." [...] The album generally garnered reviews in which it was noted that, as a reviewer at Punk News explained that if you're a [...] "fan of From Autumn to Ashes, you'll be disappointed."Others disagreed, like UK magazine Kerrang! who gave the album a 5 out of 5 review and called it a metal masterpiece. This album would also go on to sell over 100,000 copies. Abandon Your Friends produced one single, [...] "Where Do You Draw The Line?" [...] with an accompanying music video. Unhappy with intraband politics, guitarist Jonathan Cox quit the band.|$|E
