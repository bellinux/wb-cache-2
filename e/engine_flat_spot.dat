Also, a sharp transition is found from degenerate geometry similar to what was found earlier for non-differentiable maps with a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> to bounded geometry as in critical maps without a <b>flat</b> <b>spot...</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>flat</b> <b>spot,</b> or wheel <b>flat,</b> is a {{fault in}} {{railroad}} wheel shape. A <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> {{occurs when a}} rail vehicle's wheelset is dragged along the rail after the wheel/axle has stopped rotating. <b>Flat</b> <b>spots</b> are usually caused by use of the emergency brake, or slip and slide conditions that causes wheels to lock up while the train is still moving. <b>Flat</b> <b>spots</b> are {{more common in the}} autumn and winter when the rails are slippery. <b>Flat</b> <b>spots</b> can also be caused by faulty brakes or wheelset bearings.|$|R

40|$|In this project, the {{buckling}} of imperfect circular cylindrical shells under uniform {{axial compression}} has been investigated. The imperfection considered is prismatic {{and is in}} the form of <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> along the complete length of the shell. The problem is solved by considering it as an interaction problem between curved and flat panels. Shell equations are satisfied in the curved portions of the shell while flat plate equations are used in the <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> regions. At the common edge between two adjacent panels, forces and displacements are matched to arrive at the eigenvalue problem for the critical load of the shell. Two <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> configurations have been studied. In the first case, a single <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> along the complete length of the shell is considered. Curved and flat panels join to form sharp corners at their common edges. Numerical results are presented to show the effect of the width of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot,</b> thickness ratio and length to radius ratio of the shell, on the buckling load of the shell. In the second case, the imperfection {{is in the form of}} two or more identical <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> distributed uniformly along the circumference of the shell. Between two consecutive <b>flat</b> <b>spots</b> is a uniform radius cylindrical panel joining smoothly to the flat panels. This analysis is valid for any integral number of identical <b>flat</b> <b>spots.</b> Numerical results are presented for 2, 3, 4, 8 -flat spots. The effect of width of <b>flat</b> <b>spots,</b> radius of curved panels, thickness ratio of the shell has been investigated. The results, presented in this paper, clearly demonstrate a very significant reduction in the buckling load of the shell below its classical value. This is true even in the presence of relatively small <b>flat</b> <b>spots.</b> This reduction becomes more severe with a decrease in the thickness of the shell or an increase in the width of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{classify}} {{the dynamics}} of (orientation-preserving) <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> maps on the circle, and derive explicit expressions for the function counting the first entrance time into the <b>flat</b> <b>spot.</b> Metric properties of first entrance time functions for the standard <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> family are analysed in detail, via a computation of conditional expectation {{with respect to the}} orbit partition. This facilitates investigation of the median of the entrance time function, proving the surprising result that its first entrance time is constrained to equal either 1, 2, 4, 5, or 12, provided the rotation number of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> map does not equal the exceptional values 0, ± 2 / 7, ± 3 / 10, ± 1 / 3, ± 3 / 8...|$|R
50|$|If the <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> is {{very large}} (as in the picture), strands of molten metal may have got stuck {{on one side}} of the <b>flat</b> <b>spot,</b> making it {{impossible}} for the wheel to turn due to insufficient clearance between the rolling surface and the brake block. In this case, the wheelset must be replaced immediately.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{possible}} reasons for there being a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> on a seismic image. It could be representative of a mineralogical change in the subsurface or an unresolved shallower multiple. Additionally, the interpretation of a <b>flat</b> <b>spot</b> should be attempted after depth conversion to confirm that the anomaly is actually flat.|$|R
