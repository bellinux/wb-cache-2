40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of action of <b>intoplicine</b> (RP- 60475), a 7 H-benzo[e]pyrido[4, 3 -b]indole derivative that is presently in early clinical trials, have been investigated. <b>Intoplicine</b> induced both topoisomerase I- and Il-mediated DNA strand breaks, using purified topoisomerases. The topoisomerase cleavage site pat-tems induced by <b>intoplicine</b> were unique, relative {{to those of}} camptothecin, 4 â€™-(9 -acridinylamino) methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), and other known topoisomerase inhibitors. Both topoisomerase I- and Il-induced DNA breaks decreased at drug concentrations higher than 1 M, {{which is consistent with}} the DNA-intercalating activity of <b>intoplicine.</b> DNA damage was inves-tigated in KB cells in culture by using alkaline elution. <b>Intoplicine</b> induced single-strand breaks (SSB) in a bell-shaped manner with respect to drug concentration (maximum frequency at 1 M 220 rad-equivalents). SSB formation was fast, whereas reversa...|$|E
