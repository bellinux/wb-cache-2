25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball {{that ought to}} make him a little fortune. <b>It</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> become one of the greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E

I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think I can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{newspaper}} {{described the}} novelty of indoor football as follows:"Indoor football is an innovation, but <b>it</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> become a permanency for late games. While the other fields about Chicago were sloppy and the players were floundering about in the seas of mud, the athletes in the Coliseum played on dry surface and secure from the elements. A two-inch layer of tan bark was placed over the hard earth, {{and there was no}} inconvenience from dust. None of the punts touched the beams overhead and spectators and players were captivated with the comfortable conditions under which the game was played. Darkness came on at 4:00 and the players were scarcely distinguishable for a time, but electric lights soon rendered each play distinct." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{comparison}} of Vivah with Sooraj Bartjatya's previous films compelled it to receive generally mixed reviews. The film {{was a big}} success, but before its release, many journalists expected Vivah to be a flop. Ron Ahluwalia of Planet Bollywood gave it 7.5 out of 10 wrote, [...] "Sooraj Bartjatya comes up with the best, cheesiest family flick we’ve {{seen in a long}} time without sending us back to the 1940s." [...] Deepa Gahlot of Sify said, [...] "Vivah is far less offensive and far more watchable." [...] Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India called it a [...] "simple documentation of something as banal as an engagement to a vivah". Madhuparna Das of The Telegraph criticised Vivah for lacking plot, flat characters and mentioning that the story was [...] "rather weak and improbable." [...] BBC described Vivah as [...] "a didactic, worthy, and highly sanitised take on reality in keeping with the Rajshri tradition." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave only 1 out of 5 stars and condemned the screenplay, calling both Kapoor and Rao [...] "insipid and boring." [...] A review carried by Anupama Chopra mentioned, [...] "Sooraj Barjatya's fantasy world is carefully constructed, but his conviction infuses his films with an emotional heft." [...] Business of Cinema defended the film stating, [...] "Vivah is a film with beautiful moments, <b>it</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> recreate the magic of Maine Pyar Kiya." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] tilling {{the fields}} with his new, untrained oxen is made furious by their {{wrecking}} of the land. In his anger {{he makes the}} rash oath that the wolf [...] "mot have you all at anis! [...] ". However, the wolf is lying nearby with the fox, and, overhearing <b>it,</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> make him stay true to his word. Eventually the oxen calm down, but {{on the way back}} home the wolf jumps into their path. The wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them, since they are not his, to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before. The wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration, to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything. They argue, and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness; in response, he produces the fox. The creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute, and takes each aside in turn. To the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him {{were it not for the}} [...] "grit coist and expence" [...] of doing so; the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has, to which the fox acedes and goes off. To the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} to stabilizing the carrier–envelope offset frequency is to cancel it completely {{by use of}} difference frequency generation (DFG). If the difference frequency of light of opposite ends of a broadened spectrum is generated in a nonlinear crystal, the resulting frequency comb is carrier–envelope offset-free since the two spectral parts contributing to the DFG share the same carrier–envelope offset frequency. This was first proposed in 1999 [...] and recently demonstrated using an erbium fiber frequency comb at the telecom wavelength. This simple approach has the advantage that no electronic feedback loop is needed as in conventional stabilization techniques. <b>It</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> be more robust and stable against environmental perturbations.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is called}} the neurogenic {{hypothesis}} of depression. <b>It</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> explain pharmacological antidepressant action, including the time lag from taking the drug to therapeutic onset, why downregulation (not just upregulation) of neurotransmitters can help depression, why stress often precipitates mood disorders, and why selective modulation of different neurotransmitters can help depression. It may also explain the neurobiological mechanism of other non-drug effects on mood, including exercise, diet and metabolism. By identifying the neurobiological [...] "final common pathway" [...] into which most antidepressants funnel, it may allow rational design of new medications which target only that pathway. This could yield drugs which have fewer side effects, are more effective and have quicker therapeutic onset.|$|E
2500|$|By {{using the}} StubHub website, a buyer may select from {{available}} tickets to an event. StubHub charges buyers {{a fee of}} 10% {{of the purchase price}} of the tickets (minimum $5 per transaction). [...] A shipping and handling charge is then imposed (minimum $4.95) and tickets are either shipped via UPS, email delivered, available for instant download, or picked up the day of the event at a last-minute services office. In total, on a typical order, StubHub earns 20-25% of the purchase price of every ticket sold: buyers typically pay 10% more than the listed price and sellers receive 10-15% less than their listed price depending on certain seller metrics and bonuses. Criteria for reduced seller fees include confirm time, fill rate, and quarterly sales totals. [...] Additional seller incentives include the ability to buy tickets without paying service fees. If a buyer fails to win the ticket, StubHub will help the buyer find alternative tickets. [...] StubHub does not prohibit sellers from listing tickets for any amount, regardless of how absurd the amount might be, but posts the prices at which tickets have sold. [...] A September 2012 Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa Bay Rays game had tickets listed for $52,122, nearly 1000 times the face value of the tickets. Ticket prices for the 2009 Super Bowl averaged $2,500. To increase delivery rate, StubHub uses Goodmail's CertifiedEmail. <b>It</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> refund the price of any ticket that fails to reach a buyer by FedEx. StubHub and MyStoreRewards have been described as examples of [...] "applications that leverage the PayPal platform in creative ways".|$|E

60|$|A ball, {{but not the}} one {{to which}} we have seen Miss Susan and Miss Phoebe rush forth upon their career of crime. This is the third of the series, the one of which Patty has foretold with horrid relish that <b>it</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> be {{specially}} given over to devilries. The scene is a canvas pavilion, used as a retiring room and for card play, and through {{an opening in the}} back we have glimpses of gay uniforms and fair ladies intermingled in the bravery of the dance. There is coming and going through this opening, and also through slits in the canvas. The pavilion is fantastically decorated in various tastes, and is lit with lanterns. A good-natured moon, nevertheless, shines into it benignly. Some of the card tables are neglected, but at one a game of quadrille is in progress. There is much movement and hilarity, but none {{from one side of the}} tent, where sit several young ladies, all pretty, all appealing and all woeful, for no gallant comes to ask them if he may have the felicity. The nervous woman chaperoning them, and afraid to meet their gaze lest they scowl or weep in reply, is no other than Miss Susan, the most unhappy Miss Susan we have yet seen; she sits there gripping her composure in both hands. Far less susceptible to shame is the brazen Phoebe, who may be seen passing the opening on the arm of a cavalier, and flinging her trembling sister a mischievous kiss. The younger ladies note the incident; alas, they are probably meant to notice it, and they cower, as under a blow.|$|E
