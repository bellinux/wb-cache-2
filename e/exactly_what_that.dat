500|$|Barlow's {{immediate}} {{idea was}} to create a game involving police interviews, but he [...] "didn't know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant". He then conceived the idea to involve real video footage, and the ability to access the footage through a database interface; he described the interface as being [...] "part Apple II, part Windows 3.1 and part Windows 98". The interface design was inspired by Barlow's appreciation of the police procedural genre, commenting that [...] "the conceit of making the computer itself a prop in the game was so neat". He also compared the searching mechanic to the Google search engine, and wanted to [...] "run with the idea" [...] that players are [...] "essentially Googling". The game's concept was inspired by the TV series [...] (1993–1999), which Barlow found depicted police interviews being a [...] "gladiatorial arena for detectives". Barlow intentionally made the game's opening screen to be [...] "slightly too long", to immediately notify players of the slow pacing that would follow.|$|E

[...] He seems to have been close to the most famous Venetian composer of madrigals of the middle of the 16th century, Cipriano de Rore, since Rore included one of Taglia's madrigals in one of his own publications in 1557, a rare tribute. [...] In addition, Taglia contributed to Venetian poet Manoli Blessi's Greghesche in 1564, probably indicating a commission or request.|$|E

2500|$|On June 6, 2002, ABC's World News Tonight {{broadcast}} {{an interview}} with Johnelle Bryant, former loan officer at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in south Florida, who told about her encounter with Mohamed Atta. This encounter took place [...] "around {{the third week of}} April to the third week of May of 2000", before Atta's official entry date into the United States (see below). According to Bryant, Atta wanted to finance the purchase of a crop-duster. [...] "He wanted to finance a twin-engine, six-passenger aircraft and remove the seats," [...] Bryant told ABC's World News Tonight. He insisted that she write his name as ATTA, that he originally was from Egypt but had moved to Afghanistan, that he was an engineer and that his dream was to go to a flight school. He asked about the Pentagon and the White House. He said he wanted to visit the World Trade Center and asked Bryant about the security there. He mentioned Al Qaeda and said the organization [...] "could use memberships from Americans". He mentioned Osama bin Laden and said [...] "this man would someday be known as the world's greatest leader." [...] Bryant said [...] "the picture that came out in the newspaper, that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> man looked like." [...] Bryant contacted the authorities after recognising Atta in news reports. Law-enforcement officials said Bryant passed a lie-detector exam.|$|E

[...] screamed Sammy, and then looked down at Reddy with a mischievous look in his sharp eyes. There is nothing Sammy Jay delights in more than in upsetting the plans of Reddy Fox. At the sound of Sammy's voice, Mr. and Mrs. Quack swam hurriedly towards the middle of the pond. They knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> warning meant. Reddy Fox looked up at Sammy Jay and snarled angrily. Then, knowing it was useless to hide longer, he bounded away through the Green Forest to hunt elsewhere.|$|E

I do not believe that you can bestow a greater benefit upon a fellow-being than to ask Miriam to pay you a visit while you are at the seaside. Think of this, I beg of you, my dear Dora." ...|$|E

When he was allowed to run out of doors it was always with some one to watch him. He was petted and babied and made a great deal of, but he knew all the time that he was a prisoner. He knew that if he was to get away at all he would have to sneak away, and somehow there never seemed a chance to do this. He was grateful to these kindly people, but down in his heart was a great longing for Farmer Brown's boy and home. He always felt this longing just a wee bit stronger when Blacky the Crow passed over and cawed.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone called it [...] "still only so-so, offering {{a series of}} modestly tuneful, sometimes snoozy soul-pop-hip-hop songs". Entertainment Weekly said the album [...] "seems divided against itself, rest assured {{that all of the}} songs have something in common: they're not remotely catchy". For AllMusic, Andy Kellman wrote that [...] "it's not like any part of it is flat-out poor, but it's a shame it didn't turn out better". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention rating (...) , indicating a [...] "likable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy".

60|$|It was, perhaps, not {{the kind}} of {{conversation}} one would have expected from a man at an impressionable age and a distinctly pretty girl, especially when they stood alone in such a scene of wild grandeur as few men's eyes have looked upon, but Hetty did not appear to consider it in any way out of place. Indeed, though there had been a time when she had accepted Ingleby's compliments with a smile and even became a trifle venturesome in her badinage, there had been a difference since they left England, and while Ingleby did not realize <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> difference was he felt that it was there. Hetty Leger had not enjoyed any of the training which is, usually, at least, bestowed upon young women of higher station; but she had discovered early that, as she expressed it, there is no use in crying for the moon, and she had a certain pride. It was also a wholesome one and untainted by petulance or mortified vanity.|$|E
6000|$|Women, {{for their}} age, are surely older than men--married women, at all events, than {{men who have}} not had that experience. And all through those first weeks of their life together, {{there was a kind}} of wise watchfulness in Gyp. He was only a boy in {{knowledge}} of life as she saw it, and though his character was so much more decided, active, and insistent than her own, she felt it lay with her to shape the course and avoid the shallows and sunken rocks. The house they had seen together near the river, under the Berkshire downs, was still empty; and while it was being got ready, they lived at a London hotel. She had insisted that he should tell no one of their life together. If that must come, she wanted to be firmly settled in, with little Gyp and Betty and the horses, so that it should all be for him as much like respectable married life as possible. But, one day, in the first week after their return, while in her room, just back from a long day's shopping, a card was brought up to her: [...] "Lady Summerhay." [...] Her first impulse was to be [...] "not at home"; her second, [...] "I'd better face it. Bryan would wish me to see her!" [...] When the page-boy was gone, she turned to the mirror and looked at herself doubtfully. She seemed to know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> tall woman whom she had seen on the platform would think of her--too soft, not capable, not right for him!--not even if she were legally his wife. And touching her hair, laying a dab of scent on her eyebrows, she turned and went downstairs fluttering, but outwardly calm enough.|$|E
60|$|Not {{only the}} Meyricks, whose various {{knowledge}} had been {{acquired by the}} irregular foraging to which clever girls have usually been reduced, but Deronda himself, with all his masculine instruction, had been roused by this apparition of Mirah to the consciousness of knowing hardly anything about modern Judaism or the inner Jewish history. The Chosen People have been commonly treated as a people chosen {{for the sake of}} somebody else; and their thinking as something (no matter <b>exactly</b> <b>what)</b> <b>that</b> ought to have been entirely otherwise; and Deronda, like his neighbors, had regarded Judaism as a sort of eccentric fossilized form which an accomplished man might dispense with studying, and leave to specialists. But Mirah, with her terrified flight from one parent, and her yearning after the other, had flashed on him the hitherto neglected reality that Judaism was something still throbbing in human lives, still making for them the only conceivable vesture of the world; and in the idling excursion on which he immediately afterward set out with Sir Hugo he began to look for the outsides of synagogues, and the title of books about the Jews. This awakening of a new interest--this passing from the supposition that we hold the right opinions on a subject we are careless about, to a sudden care for it, and a sense that our opinions were ignorance--is an effectual remedy for ennui, which, unhappily, cannot be secured on a physician's prescription; but Deronda had carried it with him, and endured his weeks of lounging all the better. It was on this journey that he first entered a Jewish synagogue--at Frankfort--where his party rested on a Friday. In exploring the Juden-gasse, which he had seen long before, he remembered well enough its picturesque old houses; what his eyes chiefly dwelt on now were the human types there; and his thought, busily connecting them with the past phases of their race, stirred that fibre of historic sympathy which had helped to determine in him certain traits worth mentioning for those who are interested in his future. True, when a young man has a fine person, no eccentricity of manners, the education of a gentleman, and a present income, it is not customary to feel a prying curiosity about his way of thinking, or his peculiar tastes. He may very well be settled in life as an agreeable clever young fellow without passing a special examination on those heads. Later, when he is getting rather slovenly and portly, his peculiarities are more distinctly discerned, and it is taken as a mercy if they are not highly objectionable. But any one wishing to understand the effect of after-events on Deronda should know a little more of what he was at five-and-twenty than was evident in ordinary intercourse.|$|E
