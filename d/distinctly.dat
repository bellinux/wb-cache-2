5|$|Retiboletus retipes is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance, but is distinguished {{by a more}} orange to orange-yellow color, a lack of sliminess, and a <b>distinctly</b> reticulated stalk.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} holidays, festivals and other {{celebrations}} play an integral role in Barbadian folk, and popular, music. Whitsuntide, Christmas, and Easter are important, each {{associated with their}} own musical traditions, as are <b>distinctly</b> Barbadian festivities like the crop over festival and the Landship movement.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a <b>distinctly</b> African style. In some spots this {{takes the form}} of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>distinctly</b> {{different}} from each other, DNA damage and mutation are related because DNA damage often causes errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair; these errors are {{a major source of}} mutation.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{improvements}} Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a magnifying capability of 20×, {{he was able to}} see celestial bodies more <b>distinctly</b> than was ever possible before. This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 what {{came to be known as}} the Galilean moons.|$|E
5|$|Bengali women {{commonly}} {{wear the}} sari, often <b>distinctly</b> designed {{according to local}} cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear western attire. Among men, western dress has greater acceptance. Particularly on cultural occasions, men also wear traditional costumes such as the panjabi with dhuti while women wear salwar kameez.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic {{language}} {{that allows the}} creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but <b>distinctly</b> from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{category}} was separated {{into two categories}} – Outstanding Narrator and Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance. As with longform and reality, this split acknowledges and accommodates a general industry uptrend in the <b>distinctly</b> different achievements that are VO narration and VO character performance.|$|E
5|$|President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{established}} NASA in 1958 with a <b>distinctly</b> civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful {{applications in}} space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.|$|E
5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five <b>distinctly</b> identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
5|$|The A center {{shows an}} IR {{absorption}} spectrum with no sharp features, which is <b>distinctly</b> {{different from that}} of the C or B centers. Its strongest peak at 1282cm−1 is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the A form.|$|E
5|$|The Clemson University Tiger Band's rude songbook, The Unhymnal", has a four-verse {{parody of}} the fight song which is <b>distinctly</b> un-politically correct which derides the Georgia Tech coach, {{football}} team and cheerleaders.|$|E
5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A {{new generation of}} Norwegian architects educated in Sweden {{took the lead in}} developing a <b>distinctly</b> national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the Norwegian Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a <b>distinctly</b> Norwegian collegium of architects that has contributed to a Norwegian regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{likewise}} {{very common}} Lactarius deliciosus {{is similar in}} appearance. Lactarius deterrimus differs basically from the first because its flesh becomes reddish within 10minutes and in about 30minutes dark maroon, caused by the discolouration of the milk. The milk of L.deterrimus stays orange or becomes reddish within 30minutes. Also, the milk of the latter tastes mild, while the milk of the first <b>distinctly</b> bitter. The cap of L.deterrimus changes its colour in old age or if injured <b>distinctly</b> greenish and is common only under spruces, while L.deterrimus is native under pines.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each {{individual}} animal is <b>distinctly</b> male or female, and cross-fertilization can occur. The sex ratio is 1:1. The structure of the flagellum of the spermatozoon is unique: the flagellum {{is divided into two}} parts.|$|E
5|$|Together with H.pustulatus, H.persoonii, H.mesotephrus and H.latitabundus, H.olivaceoalbus {{form the}} section Olivaceoumbrini within the genus Hygrophorus. The fungi {{of this section}} have greasy to slimy caps and stems. Their caps are darkish brown grey, olive or orange, and their stems are ed or {{somewhat}} <b>distinctly</b> ringed.|$|E
5|$|According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and {{the dark}} pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best {{classified}} in the section Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white spore prints and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its <b>distinctly</b> intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within the section.|$|E
5|$|Canada has a {{well-developed}} media sector, but {{its cultural}} output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, {{the preservation of}} a <b>distinctly</b> Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and {{institutions such as the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).|$|E
5|$|Cattle breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus {{date back}} to the 1700s, and a handful of farmers {{continue}} to raise cattle sired by registered pedigree bulls. Bullocks, which live outdoors year-round, grow slowly as they would in their natural habitat, ultimately producing a <b>distinctly</b> tender meat. Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Derived {{mainly from}} heraldic traditions in France and the United Kingdom, Canadian {{heraldry}} also incorporates <b>distinctly</b> Canadian symbols, especially native flora and fauna, {{references to the}} First Nations and other aboriginal peoples of Canada, and uniquely Canadian elements such as the Canadian pale, derived from the Canadian flag. A unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for United Empire Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|Despite her mixed {{critical}} reception, Ariel remains {{popular with}} audiences {{and is considered}} one of Disney's most iconic animated characters, with her specific color combination of red hair, lavender seashells and green tail making her <b>distinctly</b> identifiable. A poll in the Internet Movie Database showed Ariel to be the second most alluring animated character after Jessica Rabbit. In August 2011, Jodi Benson was honored with a Disney Legend for her work as Ariel and her other projects at Disney.|$|E
5|$|During {{these years}} Gaudí {{completed}} {{a series of}} works with a <b>distinctly</b> oriental flavour, inspired by {{the art of the}} Middle and Far East (India, Persia, Japan), as well as Islamic-Hispanic art, mainly Mudejar and Nazari. Gaudí used ceramic tile decoration abundantly, as well as Moorish arches, columns of exposed brick and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more similar}} {{is the very}} rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The cap of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar and also the most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is <b>distinctly</b> zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
5|$|Her {{first solo}} album My Winter Storm (2007) {{contains}} rock and metal songs {{as well as}} songs that resemble classical songs. Turunen uses both her classical singing voice and a rock-sounding voice. In many songs she starts with a rock voice, and then switches for widely arching melodies into a <b>distinctly</b> classical singing voice.|$|E
5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the <b>distinctly</b> larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar for extended periods, unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping their wings.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} <b>distinctly</b> dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and {{changing}} the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson {{analysed}} North American coal balls. Their {{discovery of}} marine organisms led to classification of coal balls were sorted into three types: normal (sometimes known as floral), containing only plant matter; faunal, containing animal fossils only; and mixed, containing both {{plant and animal}} material. Mixed coal balls are further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was <b>distinctly</b> separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation.|$|E
5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a <b>distinctly</b> hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{laid the}} basis for {{scholarship}} that looked at the social sciences from a <b>distinctly</b> Canadian point of view. As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross shape with a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a <b>distinctly</b> English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
5|$|Lycian {{architecture}} and sculpture {{are on the}} same level as Greek, but to the Greeks, the Lycians, along with other non-Greek peoples of S.W. Anatolia, were often viewed as barbarians. From c.550BC Greek pottery is found in quantity in Lycia; the Lion Tomb, Pillar of the Wrestlers, and the pillars at Isinda and Trysa are all <b>distinctly</b> Greek in style with little eastern symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts is the 7th-smallest {{state in}} the United States. It {{is located in the}} New England region of the northeastern United States and has an area of , 25.7% of which is water. Several large bays <b>distinctly</b> shape its coast. Boston is the largest city, at the inmost point of Massachusetts Bay, and the mouth of the Charles River.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} {{a brief but}} significant interlude in Norway, appearing primarily in the decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the <b>distinctly</b> Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|Stenungsund is {{one example}} of a {{municipality}} that, having no historic city arms, created wholly new arms in the 1970s. This device, displaying a hydrocarbon molecule, alludes to the area's petrochemical industry, and is also an example of <b>distinctly</b> modern arms. The arms, registered with the PRV in 1977, display: Argent, a hydrocarbon molecule of three pellets conjoined with six bezants gules, over a base wavy azure.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{roots in}} the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by the established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies. They were forced to seek their own places of worship, and soon {{there were hundreds of}} <b>distinctly</b> Pentecostal congregations.|$|E
