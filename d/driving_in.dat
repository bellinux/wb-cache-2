Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers.

5|$|The Pirates {{had been}} the only National League team to do worse than the Dodgers in 1917, {{finishing}} last. Stengel met with the Pirates owner, Barney Dreyfuss to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until Stengel proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, Stengel was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had been fighting in World War I for a year, and Stengel enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the Brooklyn Navy Yard's baseball team, <b>driving</b> <b>in</b> the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds.

5|$|Washbrook {{reached his}} century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures {{half an hour}} after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and profited from many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It was a welcome return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five innings of the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second innings of the Third Test before {{proceeding}} to an unbeaten 85.

5|$|Before the 2011 season Penske {{sold the}} owners' points of its No. 77 car to Rusty Wallace Racing, {{to be driven}} by owner Rusty Wallace's son (and team driver) Steve at the season-opening Daytona 500, for {{financial}} reasons. As a result, Penske moved Hornish to the Nationwide Series to drive the team's No. 12 Dodge Charger. He drove the 5-hour Energy 500 at Pocono Raceway in Front Row Motorsports' No.38 Ford Fusion, filling in for Travis Kvapil (who was <b>driving</b> <b>in</b> a Truck Series event at Texas). Hornish started in 26th place and finished 35th, 60 laps behind. He drove twelve races with the No. 12 team, moving to Penske's No. 22 for a 13th race at Iowa Speedway. At Iowa Hornish started in third place and led from laps 13 through 51, later dropping five laps behind to finish 24th. In the WYPALL* 200 Powered by Kimberly-Clark Professional at Phoenix International Raceway, he started in fifth place and led for the race's final 61 laps after passing Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (who led for a race-high 73 laps) for his first career victory in the series.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and <b>driving</b> <b>in</b> oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E

He debuted at the season-opening race at Walt Disney World Speedway, {{starting}} in 19th place and finishing in 20th (28 laps behind). In the season's third race, the Vegas Indy 300 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Hornish started 18th {{and had his}} first career podium finish (third place, one lap behind). He qualified for his first Indianapolis 500 in 14th place, after his team replaced the G-Force with a Dallara IR00. In mid-race, Hornish was involved in an accident which relegated him to 24th place. Starting 20th at Kentucky Speedway, he led for a series career-high 38 laps and finished ninth. Hornish ended his season with a 27th- (and last-) place finish at Texas Motor Speedway, finishing his rookie season with 110 points (21st in the point standings).|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Schumacher {{signed with}} Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he {{competed in the}} German Formula 3 series, winning the title in 1990. He also won the Macau Grand Prix. At the end of 1990, along with his Formula 3 rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing {{programme}} in the World Sports-Prototype Championship. This was unusual for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries would compete in Formula 3000 {{on the way to}} Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long distance races would help his career. In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in a Sauber–Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the drivers' championship despite only <b>driving</b> <b>in</b> three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber–Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the drivers' championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing 5th in a car shared with Karl Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{returned}} home to face the Seattle Mariners in a three-game series, and two unlikely players were key contributors in the team's win in the series opener: Jerome Williams allowed one run in seven innings and Andrés Blanco hit a three-run homer (his first home run in three years) to defeat the Mariners, 4–1. The next night, Burnett's struggles {{during the second half}} of the season continued as he gave up five runs in 7 innings for a 5–2 loss. The Phillies then edged the Mariners 4–3, with help from Wil Nieves (three hits) and the bullpen (Jake Diekman, Giles and Papelbon pitched four scoreless innings, striking out nine). The Phillies' home stand continued with a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kendrick started game one; despite his continued first-inning struggles (he allowed three runs in the first, raising his season first-inning ERA to 9.69), the Phillies batted around in the third to take a 5–4 lead and strong pitching from both teams enabled them to hang on for the win. The next night, mental errors by the Phillies cost them the game 6–5 in 12 innings. Williams started the series' rubber match, continuing his effectiveness in a 7–1 win with eight strong innings and <b>driving</b> <b>in</b> a run with a suicide squeeze. The series win was the Phillies' first consecutive-series victory since April, a 33-series drought and their longest since 1996–1997.|$|E
