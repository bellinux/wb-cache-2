5|$|In 1895 he {{designed}} a funerary chapel for the Güell {{family at the}} abbey of Montserrat, but {{little is known about}} this work, which was never built. That year, construction finally began on the Bodegas Güell, the 1882 project for a hunting lodge and some wineries at La Cuadra de Garraf (Sitges), property of Eusebi Güell. Constructed between 1895 and 1897 under the direction of Francesc Berenguer, Gaudí's aide, the wineries have a triangular end facade, a very steep stone roof, a group of chimneys and two bridges that join them to an older building. It has three floors: the bottom one for a garage, an apartment and a chapel with catenary arches, with the altar in the centre. It was completed with a porter's lodge, notable for the iron gate {{in the shape of a}} <b>fishing</b> <b>net.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí {{apparently}} {{took part in}} the construction of the , in collaboration with his disciple Francesc Berenguer, though the project's authorship is not clear or to what extent they each contributed to it. The style of the building evokes Gaudí's early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a <b>fishing</b> <b>net,</b> currently installed in the Park Güell. The building was demolished in 1939. Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the upper left corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical tools of the trade. The banner was burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a <b>fishing</b> <b>net.</b> Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E

40|$|Marine plastic litter is {{a growing}} concern, and one {{particular}} troublesome marine waste fraction is discarded fishing gear. Increasing levels of marine litter is particularly pertinent to the Northern Periphery and Arctic region. The EU funded project Circular Ocean focuses on identifying possible use of the waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets</b> in this region by acting as a catalyst to motivate and empower remote communities to develop sustainable and green business opportunities based of waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets</b> as resource. A recent Circular Ocean report based on unpublished national port-related feasibility studies focused on the collection and recycling of waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets</b> and ropes. Among others, {{it was found that}} there is a very fragmented picture of the issues surrounding waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets</b> and ropes in the region with little research completed to date. Additionally, {{there appears to be a}} lack of clear innovation eco-systems within port areas to enable the development of eco-innovative products from waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets</b> and ropes. To support increased use of the waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets,</b> mechanical properties of PE and Nylon 6 waste <b>fishing</b> <b>nets</b> have been documented at DTU Byg. On basis of the findings different uses of these fibers in concrete have been suggested and experimentally investigated. The result is that PE can be used for increased durability by control of plastic shrinkage cracking, whereas Nylon 6 can be used for structural purposes, i. e. improvement of mechanical properties such as ductility (yet unpublished results) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{relatively}} cleaner {{portion of}} the drain in rural southwest Delhi before it enters densely populated and badly polluted area at Vikaspuri also attracts some small scale local village fishermen, occasionally one can be seen casting his line or net in the waters or floating on a black inflated truck tire tube spreading his <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> across {{the breadth of the}} drain. A fishing license is needed to catch fish legally in Delhi waters.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from trade}} relations, the natives were also {{involved}} in aquaculture and fishing. The natives {{make use of the}} salambao, which is a type of raft that utilizes a large <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles made from a particular type of resin similar to the copal of Mexico. Use of safe pens for incubation and protection of the small fry from predators was also observed, and this method astonished the Spaniards at that time. During fishing, large mesh nets were also used by the natives to protect the young and ensure future good catches.|$|E
25|$|Off the Kii peninsula, {{there was}} one {{sighting}} in June 1999, one mortal entanglement in April 2003, and three records of two different animals in the spring-summer 2006 (both from many whale watching vessels). One of these whales was very active. A right whale escaped alive from a <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> near Taiji Town in January 2009, a very close observation during whale watching tour (later described) in April 2011. An individual was sighted off Kushimoto within a pod of rough-toothed dolphins in February, 2016. Off Cape Muroto, two entanglements (both escaped safely) were reported in February 1971 and February 2008. On occasion, right whales were confirmed by local fishermen off Tosa Bay (personal communication).|$|E

25|$|Floating debris was {{collected}} {{in the early morning}} hours after the accident. Two days after the accident, officials had established a one mile exclusion zone against fishing activities near the accident site, and the AAIB had requested specialized deep water recovery equipment to recover the wreckage and, they hoped, the bodies of the pilot and paramedic. Six days later the diving support vessel Seaway Osprey arrived on the scene of the accident with remotely operated vehicles (ROV's) and saturation divers capable of manually recovering debris. Within twelve hours all major components of the aircraft had been recovered except for the left wingtip, which was discovered on May 2, 2005, in a trawler's <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> about 2.5nm from the debris field. The wreckage was brought to the AAIB's hangar at RAF Machrihanish (on which Campbeltown Airport was located at the time of the accident) for analysis.|$|E
25|$|Several months later, Dr. Lee {{released}} {{a report on the}} evidence and suggested to the CIB to trace the suspect according to the casings and bullets. In March 2005, Chen Yi-hsiung, a local Tainan resident, was the main suspect for the shooting but allegedly committed suicide 8 days after the election. The CIB closed the case in August 2005 implicating him as the shooter. But in 2006, James Chun-i Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Forensic Medicine, led an investigation and concluded that Chen Yi-hsiung was most likely murdered, because his body, wrapped in a <b>fishing</b> <b>net,</b> was dumped into the water only after he died. Another report reached by the CIB task force concludes that the two bullets could not have come from the same pistol because a 9.1mm bullet would not fit into a 9mm pistol that the police said was used by the suspect. The KMT continues to claim that it was all engineered by Chen to this day.|$|E

A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die {{as a result of}} the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a <b>fishing</b> <b>net.</b> Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking [...] "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth." ...|$|E

Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, causing Darla to scream. Upon seeing Nemo, Marlin mistakenly believes he is dead, before Nigel is violently thrown out. In despair, Marlin leaves Dory and begins to swim home. Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain {{that leads to the}} ocean. Dory loses her memory and becomes confused, and meets Nemo, who reaches the ocean. Eventually, Dory's memory returns after she reads the word [...] "Sydney" [...] on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but she is caught in a <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> with a school of grouper. Nemo enters the net and orders the group to swim downward to break the net, enabling them to escape. After returning home, Nemo leaves for school, with Crush's son Squirt, and Marlin and Dory proudly watch Mr. Ray carry Nemo and his friends to school. Meanwhile, back in Sydney, the high-tech filter in the dentist's fish tank breaks down, and the Tank Gang escape to Sydney Harbour, belatedly realizing that they are still confined inside their plastic bags.|$|E
500|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane made another landfall at Carrabelle on the Florida Panhandle. Winds {{in the region}} were estimated at , and tides ran at up to [...] above normal. In Tallahassee, the winds downed trees and power lines and scattered debris, rendering roads impassable. The Tallahassee Democrat reported that [...] "at {{the height of the}} wind several hundred Tallahasseeans were seen rushing into their yard to gather pecans which were knocked down by the swaying trees". The storm destroyed vehicles throughout the region; replacement automobiles were sparse, as assembly plants were producing cars for the Army. Despite a lack of electricity due to the winds, the Tallahassee Democrat managed to publish 6,000copies of a special storm edition. Initial fears of severe damage along the coast prompted rescue crews to push toward St. Marks; however, upon arrival a group of local residents convinced the crew that their assistance was unnecessary. Considerable crop and property damage was reported; total losses in the state were estimated at $675,000 USD ($ in today's terms). Seven injuries were reported, and five men drowned in the storm tide at a <b>fishing</b> <b>net</b> drying yard in Panacea, Florida. Initially, there were reports of 20 missing fishermen. 34 Cuban fishermen were also trapped off the coast near Carrabelle when 10 boats ran aground and were damaged after the storm surge subsided. The fishermen's supply of food was destroyed by salt water, but they were rescued by the Coast Guard cutter Nemesis without any injuries. After their rescue, they reported that five men had drowned in a small boat nearby.|$|E
