However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E

Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermünde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a single engine was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered.|$|E

He finished the season with a 14–14 record, 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97. After the season ended, Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States, ending in Wenatchee, Washington.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made {{a friendly}} visit to Melbourne in early 1863.

The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries.

This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky.

5|$|Entering {{the day of}} December 31, Stauskas led {{the nation}} in three point field goal percentage. This is {{somewhat}} confusing because various sources have various eligibility thresholds. ESPN reports leaders based on a 2 three point attempts per game minimum, while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.5 attempts per game for eligibility. NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game, and Stauskas had been the leader since the December 9 weekly report. On January 16, Sporting News named Stauskas the surprise player of the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> As late as January 28 Stauskas was leading the Big Ten in free throw shooting percentage (.833) as well as three pointers made and was second in 3-point shooting percentage (.490). On that day, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992. On January 31, Stauskas and Robinson were named to the Wayman Tisdale Award (USBWA National Freshman of the Year) top 12 midseason list, recognizing their performances as being among the 12 best freshman performances in the NCAA competition. Stauskas finished the 18-game 2012–13 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season schedule with a 37% three point-percentage on 30-for-81 shooting during conference play.|$|E
