5|$|On 2 June 1972, a Phantom <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> {{supersonic}} speed shot down a MiG-19 over Thud Ridge in Vietnam {{for the first}} supersonic gun kill.

5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of the}} accident.

5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> low altitude in ground effect. As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flying</b> <b>at</b> {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E

5|$|If seen <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads.

5|$|Some places, (for example, the Altiplano in Peru and Bolivia, or {{the plateau}} around Asmara (where the airport is) in Eritrea, and some {{mountain}} passes), are many thousand {{feet above sea}} level and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude should be treated as <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> the equivalent altitude after diving.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of dusk, at 17:50 four Sa'iqa battalions were airdropped {{deep into the}} Sinai by helicopters <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> low altitude. The Sa'iqa were assigned the objective of hampering reserves en route from Israel. The helicopters left the range of friendly SAMs and were not assigned air cover, resulting {{in a number of}} them being shot down.|$|E
5|$|The 5-inch/38 {{functioned as}} a dual purpose gun. However, this {{did not mean that}} it possessed {{inferior}} anti-air abilities; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board North Carolina, the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> , which was twice as far as the effective range of the earlier single purpose 5-inch/25 anti-air gun.|$|E

5|$|The Avro Canada CF-103 was a {{proposed}} Canadian interceptor, designed by Avro Canada {{in the early}} 1950s as a development, and possible replacement of the company's CF-100 Canuck, that was entering service at the time with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Although intended {{to be capable of}} <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> transonic speeds, the CF-103 only proffered a moderate increase in performance and capability over the CF-100; subsequently, the aircraft never progressed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{is distinguished}} from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo. Crow species may appear similar when seen <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because {{of the necessity of}} <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was made all the more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E

5|$|Born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Hagerstrom {{gained an}} {{interest}} in <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> a young age. He left college in 1941 and joined the U.S. Army Air Forces, being posted to New Guinea {{to fight in the}} South West Pacific theatre of World War II. There, Hagerstrom mainly escorted bombers with his P-40 Warhawk, shooting down six Japanese aircraft {{over the course of the}} war, including four in one morning. After the war, he flew with the Texas Air National Guard. By 1950 he was in command of a fighter squadron that was mobilized to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War. He later transferred to the United States Air Force and flew in MiG Alley in a F-86 Sabre jet, scoring 8.5 victories over MiG-15s.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft <b>flying</b> <b>at</b> medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E
