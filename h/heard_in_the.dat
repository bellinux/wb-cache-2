5|$|A {{traditional}} {{definition is}} {{that to be a}} Cockney, one had to be born within the sound of Bow Bells, situated in Cheapside. In general, the sound pattern would cover most of the City, and parts of the near East End such as Aldgate and Whitechapel, but {{it is unlikely that the}} bells would have been <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> docklands. In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

The album was released just before the release of the game, and received positive reviews.

5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles.

5|$|Although no fossil {{evidence}} has been dated within the last 1,000 years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common in the oral legends of the Malagasy. In 1648, Étienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the Malagasy about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled hippopotami, but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highlands could only be about Malagasy hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these oral traditions led the IUCN to classify the Malagasy hippopotami as recent extinctions.|$|E

5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E
5|$|As the 1960s {{came to a}} close, folk rock {{changed and}} evolved away from the jangly {{template}} pioneered by The Byrds, but, Unterberger argues, the band's influence could still be <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music of Fairport Convention. Since the 1960s, The Byrds' jangly, folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music {{up to the present}} day, with authors Chris Smith, Johnny Rogan, Mark Deming, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine all noting the band's influence on such acts as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., The Long Ryders, The Smiths, The Bangles, The Stone Roses, Teenage Fanclub, and The La's.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dream {{sequence}} uses {{a distinctive}} reversed manner of speech. This {{was achieved by}} recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene, so it is not <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
5|$|Micaëla {{enters with}} a guide, seeking José and {{determined}} to rescue him from Carmen ("Je dis que rien ne m'épouvante"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. José's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight ("Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ("Holà, holà José"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, singing the toreador's song.|$|E
