50|$|Many people, {{particularly}} in Isan (northeastern region of Thailand), {{believe that the}} Naga are responsible for unnatural wave phenomena occurring in the rivers or lakes in the vicinity. It is also frequently claimed that the serpent-like demigods are responsible for marks on common objects, such as car <b>hoods</b> or house <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mosque covers roughly 14 m by 14 m and is {{square in}} shape. It has one large dome and another smaller half-dome {{that covers the}} mihrab, which is painted and has a stalactite <b>hood.</b> The mosque's <b>walls</b> are 1.65 m thick and its minaret, which is topped by a conical {{structure}} covered by lead, is 43.5 m in height.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in February 1996, {{the city}} was denoted the {{location}} of the [...] "home office" [...] that produces the top-10 list for David Letterman's Late Show program, having relocated from Grand Rapids, Michigan. The town had lobbied Letterman for the status for months. It had the Nebraska legislature proclaim him an admiral in the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska, as well as inundate Letterman with letters, postcards, and bribes of flowers, clothing, animals, alcoholic beverages, shredded money, and free checkups at the Wahoo Medical Center. When Letterman jokingly said he wanted more, Wahoo sent him a '76 Ford Pinto with a sofa attached to the <b>hood,</b> a <b>wall</b> clock made of cow droppings, and two of the town's teenagers, brothers Jeff and Josh Price. This brought some degree of fame and tourism to the town. The nightly recap of the show on the CBS web site is titled The Wahoo Gazette.|$|R
500|$|The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building was {{designed}} in the postmodern style. The structure's exterior walls were constructed from limestone and brick that surround regular glass blocks, each about [...] thick with side lengths ranging from [...] The brick and limestone walls faced the west, north, and east, while the southern face was primarily glass, a feature designed for efficient energy use; when sunlight hit the wall, air rose into the building and was heated, then pumped throughout where it aided {{in the operation of}} the structure's 46 fume <b>hoods.</b> The north <b>wall,</b> meanwhile, {{was designed}} to be resistant to cold air. The building was well insulated and its plain outer walls were as uninterrupted in material as possible to keep as much warm air inside the structure as possible in winters.|$|R
25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (<b>hood)</b> moulds and <b>wall</b> buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|R
40|$|Capture {{efficiency}} (CE) of exhaust from {{a natural}} gas cooking range was quantified for three common designs of residential range hoods in laboratory experiments: (A) microwave exhaust combination; (B) short hood with grease-screen-covered air inlet at bottom; and (C) deep, open hood exhausting at top. Devices were evaluated at varying installation heights, at highest and lowest fan settings, {{and with the}} hood installed 15 cm away from back wall with intent to improve CE for front burners. Each configuration was evaluated for the oven and for three cooktop burner combinations (two back, two front, one front and one back). At highest fan settings and standard installation against the <b>wall,</b> <b>Hoods</b> A and C captured back cooktop burner exhaust at > 90 percent and Hood B at > 80 percent. In this configuration, CE for front burner exhaust was 73 - 78 percent for Hoods A and C but only 46 - 63 percent for Hood B. CEs followed similar patterns but were substantially lower on the lowest fan speed. Installing the hood {{away from the wall}} improved CE for oven and front burners on Hood A at low speed, but substantially reduced CE for back burners for all hoods at low and high speed...|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} Japanese-style (和式, washiki) toilet is a squat toilet—also {{known as}} the 'Asian Toilet,' as squat toilets of somewhat similar design are common all over Asia. A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical <b>hood,</b> i.e., the <b>wall</b> {{in the back of}} the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: [...] "small" [...] (小) and [...] "large" [...] (大). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally [...] "small excretion") and the latter for feces ("large excretion"). The lever is often pushed to the [...] "small" [...] setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970 the Supreme Court {{moved to}} new {{premises}} and the Vehicle Licensing Division of Department of Transport occupied the front section of the building. The building became vacant after the Department of Transport {{moved to new}} premises in the mid 1980s. In 1972 the caretaker's residence was sold for removal. In 1994 the roof was reinstated using Federal [...] "One Nation" [...] funding. The building was also painted around this time. However, on 14 April 1998, before the conservations works could be finished the former Townsville Supreme Court building was destroyed by fire. What little of the timber building that remained after the fire was later removed from the site due to safety concerns. The remains {{of the late nineteenth}} century drystone wall is the only remaining physical evidence on the site. At the time the building was destroyed it was described as:The axis of the building is north-south, with the main entry at the northern end facing Cleveland Terrace. The north facade has a two- storeyed verandah with crossed timber balustrades and curved boarded valances to both levels, and a central projecting portico with paired timber posts topped with a pediment and a flagpole as finial. The double entry doors have an arched fanlight, and large single pane double-hung windows with arched heads to either side. Behind are two levels of offices and chambers each side of a central corridor.This northern section of the building has hipped roofs in a U-shaped configuration. There is a glazed lantern with curved domed roof on one of the ridges. The double-hung windows, smaller than those of the front, have two panes per sash and are shaded by continuous curved corrugated iron <b>hoods.</b> The <b>walls</b> are clad in weatherboards.The interior of this section has walls lined with wide horizontal beaded boards, and high ceilings of double beaded boards. The entry has the remnant of a gold painted sign beside the arched opening. The room beside the entry retains its moulded timber counter. In the cupboard under the stair are small remnants of theatrical posters dating from 1879-1880. Doors here are typically low-waisted four panel, some with fanlights. The floors are timber boards.In the upper level, the lantern provides a boarded rooflight to the central corridor. At the end of the corridor, an arched opening and timber balustrade form a balcony which overlooks the courtroom. To the very upper portion of the walls is a panel of perforated zinc ventilation grilles. The former Judges chambers retain their cedar bookshelves. From this level, the northern verandah has views over Cleveland Bay.Detached to the west of this section is the strongroom of painted brick. It has a curved corrugated iron roof, iron door and small barred window.The central part of the building is the single-storeyed Courtroom. The gabled roof has dormer windows and ventilators along its ridge. On the east side is the Courtroom's gabled entry porch, which has a scalloped bargeboard, boarded valance and timber posts with capitals. A verandah with similar valance runs the length of the western side. From this verandah, an external timber stair leads to the Judges' chambers.The Courtroom has exposed scissor trusses with stop-chamfered members, and raked ceilings lined in diagonal boarding above. There is a dormer window to each side of the ridge. The large double-hung windows, two to each side, have single pane sashes and arched heads, and are similar to those beside the main entry. Again, the walls are lined in horizontal beaded boards and the floors timber.To {{the southern end of the}} Courtroom is an elevated timber stage, with stairs to either side. Court furniture retained in place includes the cedar judges' bench with screen behind, the stand for the witness box, the defendant's dock, the jury stand, and a timber rail and tiered benches for the public at the rear.To the rear of the Courtroom are three small offices at the level of the stage. From here, a link of latticed walls and curved corrugated iron roof connects to the Jury Room to the east. The Jury Room is a single timber room, with toilets added to the north. Its subfloor construction includes brickwork of an earlier building in this position. It has a pyramid roof and ventilator at its apex, and timber hoods to its windows.Behind this block is a small brick shower room, with lean-to roof and boarded shutter. Behind the shower and of similar height, is a stone pitched retaining wall marking the rear of the site.Along the western side of the main building runs a graded brick retaining wall, forming the terrace of the remainder of the site. Further to the west, is a timber cell block and a timber toilet block.|$|R
