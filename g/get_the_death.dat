500|$|Some of South Africa's {{laws and}} {{emergency}} regulations mandated particular penalties which judges had no discretion to modify. South Africa's whites-only parliament pursued {{a doctrine of}} parliamentary supremacy, passing laws which judges were absolutely bound to enforce {{if they had been}} enacted by parliament or were faithful to what parliament had done. Goldstone distressed civil rights lawyers in 1986 when he concurred without comment with a decision that allowed the jailing of a 13-year-old boy for disrupting school. Goldstone later remarked that he was constrained by the law, that [...] "the emergency regulations covered the situation." [...] The laws and regulations also included the death penalty for certain crimes such as murders committed without any extenuating circumstances; although Goldstone was personally opposed to the death penalty, he was nonetheless required to pass death sentences on two convicted murderers. His reluctance to impose death penalties prompted criticism from judges who were in favour of capital punishment. Another Transvaal Supreme Court judge, D. Curlewis, commented in 1991 that [...] "a person who deserves to hang was more likely to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> sentence from me or my ilk" [...] than Goldstone or other liberal judges, who were [...] "at heart abolitionists for one reason or another... Obviously, and for that reason, they cannot be sound on the imposition of the death penalty." ...|$|E

[...] According to Erickson, had Penn State not accepted the penalties, the NCAA would have gone in [...] "another direction"—one that would have included the NCAA canceling at least the 2012 season. [...] Erickson said that under the circumstances, [...] "we had our backs to the wall," [...] and he had no choice but to accept the consent decree since it was the only deal on offer. [...] Erickson subsequently told ESPN's John Barr that Penn State was facing as long as a four-year ban from play had it not agreed to the sanctions that were ultimately imposed. [...] Erickson went further on July 25, saying that Emmert had personally told him on July 17—a day after Emmert's interview with Smiley—that a majority of the NCAA leadership wanted to shut down Penn State football for four years. [...] He also said that Penn State could have faced a host of other severe penalties, including a fine several times greater than the $60 million ultimately imposed. [...] When Erickson learned this, he immediately started talks with the NCAA, and was able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> penalty taken off the table. Erickson discussed his actions with the board later that night, and the board resolved that Erickson's actions were understandable under the circumstances.|$|E
