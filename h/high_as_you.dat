500|$|A. A. Gill {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Sunday Times after {{the move to}} the Oak Room in late 1997. He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can go in this country, and close to as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can go in the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a celeriac remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior of the dining room [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E

2500|$|During Guizot’s {{tenure as}} foreign minister, he and Lord Aberdeen, the foreign {{secretary}} to Sir Robert Peel, carried on well, and thus they secured France and Britain in the entente cordiale. Part {{of the formation}} of the entente came about when Guizot secured the transfer of Napoleon’s ashes from St. Helena to the French government. The opposition in France denounced Guizot's foreign policy as basely subservient to England. He replied in terms of unmeasured contempt: [...] "You may raise the pile of calumny as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will; vous n'arriverez jamais a la hauteur de mon dédain!" [...] In 1845 British and French troops fought side by side {{for the first time in}} the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata.|$|E
5000|$|... "This {{sequence}} {{was made}} without trick photography and before process was perfected. The action — {{at all times}} — actually occurred <b>as</b> <b>high</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> see it happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{precious}} {{hard on a}} poor fellow {{to be left alone}} with his <b>higher</b> motives, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call them, before he has well begun to act on his lower." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} amongst the mountains, sir," [...] I answered, my pulse {{quickening}} at his description, [...] "but {{they were not}} so <b>high</b> <b>as</b> those <b>you</b> speak of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{o'clock in}} the morning at the very least," [...] said Leo. [...] "The sun is pretty <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> might have seen if you had looked at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Wyndham, with a twinkle. [...] "Keep it as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can for yourself, {{so long as}} you {{are willing}} to make some {{allowances}} for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mount as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, my lord," [...] the Malay said. [...] "The trunk {{is not so}} rough, {{when you}} get higher; and the beast will find it harder to climb." ...|$|E
60|$|Flo. Troth, I pity your {{highness}} there; I perceive he {{has left}} you for the little one: Methinks {{he should have been}} afraid to break his neck, when he fell so <b>high</b> <b>as</b> from <b>you</b> to her.|$|R
60|$|SERGIUS (carried away). You lie: {{it is not}} so, by all the stars! If I loved you, and I {{were the}} Czar himself, I would set you on the throne by my side. You know that I love another woman, a woman <b>as</b> <b>high</b> above <b>you</b> <b>as</b> heaven is above earth. And you are jealous of her.|$|R
6000|$|Build deep, build <b>high,</b> build massive <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, [...] The wanton grass-roots will {{defeat the}} plan [...] By {{shouldering}} asunder all the stones [...] In what to {{you would be}} a moment's span.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dey ain't another nigger in dis town dat's as highbawn as you is. Now den, go 'long! En jes {{you hold}} yo' head up as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> want to--you has de right, en dat I kin swah." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do one of {{you give}} me my flask out of my holster," [...] he said, [...] "and another cut off the leg of my trousers, as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can above the wound. That is right. Now for the bandages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I come {{to think}} of it," [...] she went on reminiscently, [...] "there is a curious streak of fidelity, isn't there, in your father's character. You must take after him. It ought to make you very careful, Letitia. I don't want to say a word against Charles, but he doesn't carry his head quite so <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do, you know. When are you going to {{announce}} your engagement?" ...|$|E
30|$|The hill slope makes {{difficult}} {{to build the}} drainage systems for the runoffs. In fact, the rainwater drills accumulates waste and deepen gradually as it rains that we fail to remove the waste. Because of the <b>high</b> altitude, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can see, waste from the top is accumulated here. That {{may be one of}} the reasons we experience diarrhoea during rainy season.|$|R
50|$|Track {{supports}} where {{included with}} the sets to allow elevated sections of track thus also enabling cars to pass underneath. These connectors could be place together to make the track <b>as</b> <b>high</b> or low <b>as</b> <b>you</b> so desired, typically these pieces where utilised to make a figure eight circuit.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{foreword}} to the Hamlet's Father, Card {{says that}} he could never identify with Hamlet: [...] "I have little interest in a dithering hero; nor am I much inspired by revenge plots." [...] He wrote the story in response, and citing the potential backlash from rewriting Shakespeare, he says, [...] "If you think it's blasphemous to fiddle with Shakespeare's work, then for heaven's sake don't read this story. I leave his version in shreds on the floor. But my body count is just <b>as</b> <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> don't expect me to account for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. I figure Tom Stoppard took care of them for all time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} a medium, if one could find it," [...] said Albert, {{defending}} his opinion in the same tone in which the King attacked him; [...] "so this morning, {{when you were in}} the woman's dress, you raised your petticoats rather unbecomingly <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> waded through the first little stream; and when I told you of it, to mend the matter, you draggled through the next without raising them at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Mr. Tappitt, I shall consult my {{brothers}}." [...] Mrs. Tappitt's {{brothers were}} grocers in Plymouth; men whom Mr. Tappitt had never loved. [...] "They mayn't hold their heads quite as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do,--or rather as {{you used to}} do when people thought that the establishment was all your own; but {{such as it is}} nobody can turn them out of their shop in the Market-place. If you are going to Sharpit, I shall consult them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Then, {{when you}} have put loads of stones all along in this way, you must shift your boards {{over to the other}} side of the path, and then wheel on them again; and that will fill up the side where the boards lay at first. And so, after a while, you will get the whole pathway filled up with stones, as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please. I should think you had better fill it up nearly level with the bank on each side.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Panorama Cotton is a pseudo-3D {{scrolling}} shooter {{reminiscent of}} Space Harrier, set in an anime-style fantasy world. Various levels scroll [...] "into the screen", vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You can move Cotton over the screen, shooting at oncoming enemies and avoiding obstacles on her way. Cotton can upgrade her weapon to <b>higher</b> levels <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{advance in the}} game, and can also cast magical spells by collecting special items.|$|R
50|$|Piura {{is covered}} by deserts, {{tropical}} valleys, dry equatorial forests, <b>high</b> Amazon climates <b>as</b> <b>you</b> reach between 1000 and 1500 meters, and a humid subtropical sierra climate if you reach over 2,000 meters. The Páramo climate {{is found in the}} higher regions of the Sierra.|$|R
5000|$|Lambert sold Centennial One in 2001 {{and began}} a {{successful}} speaking career. Her topics include: “My Journey to <b>Higher</b> Ground,” “Lifting <b>as</b> <b>You</b> Climb,” “Success Builds Success,” “Lessons Learned: If I Had to Do It Over Again” and “ The Road Map to Success: Ready! Set! Go!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{tell you}} why they were taken first: because the mist, when we came through it, only rose five or six feet above the stream, {{and we were in}} it, while you on board were above it. And those that were taken on board this morning, every one of them, slept on the main-deck, and every one of them, too, was in fear of the fever, whereby I judge two things,--Keep as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, and fear nothing but God, and we're all safe yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish them}} joy of it," [...] said Quentin, composedly. [...] "To speak plain, I should have liked {{the service of}} the French King full well; only, dress me as fine and feed me as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will, I love the open air better than being shut up in a cage or a swallow's nest yonder, as you call these same grated pepper boxes. Besides," [...] he added, in a lower voice, [...] "to speak truth, I love not the Castle when the covin tree bears such acorns as I see yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Stand by {{the side}} of the tree, Joyce. Now I will put this rope round you and round the tree, leaving a certain amount of slack in the loop. Now you get a grip of the tree with your knees. Then with your hands you shift the loop up as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, and lean against it. Get a sort of purchase, and so shift your knees a bit higher. No doubt you will feel it awkward at first, but after a little {{practice}} you will find no difficulty whatever in going up at a fair rate of speed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{prepared}} to exchange any words with you," [...] said Grant. [...] "Go while the door is open, {{and it would not}} be advisable for you to fall into our hands again. We hanged a friend of yours who, I fancy, lived up to, at least, <b>as</b> <b>high</b> a standard <b>as</b> <b>you</b> seem to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My good sir," [...] said I, [...] "there is no row of firs there now, and {{the fence}} {{is not very}} <b>high.</b> My dog, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> see, is very much excited and I cannot answer for the {{consequences}} if he takes it into his head to jump over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{you are at}} fault, my lord," [...] she answered, {{her voice}} very level. [...] "I shall {{be called upon to}} say {{something}} when I impeach you all for murder upon the <b>high</b> seas, <b>as</b> impeach <b>you</b> I shall if you persist in your intent." ...|$|R
60|$|That is the can-can. The {{idea of it}} is {{to dance}} as wildly, as noisily, as furiously as you can; expose {{yourself}} {{as much as possible}} if you are a woman; and kick as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, no matter which sex you belong to. There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable, aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement. There were a good many such people present. I suppose French morality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at trifles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't {{you think}} {{something}} of that kind would have a very nice effect? Have the entrance-story low-studded, and your parlours on the next floor as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please. Put your little reception-room here beside the door, and get the whole width of your house frontage for a square hall, and an easy low-tread staircase running up three sides of it. I'm sure Mrs. Lapham would find it much pleasanter." [...] The architect caught toward him {{a scrap of paper}} lying on the table at which they were sitting and sketched his idea. [...] "Then have your dining-room behind the hall, looking on the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you wish}} to travel," [...] said he, [...] "attach this little machine to your left wrist {{by means of the}} band. It is very light and will not be in your way. On this dial are points marked 'up' and 'down' as well as a perfect compass. When you desire to rise into the air set the {{indicator}} to the word 'up,' using a finger of your right hand to turn it. When you have risen as <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> wish, set the indicator to the point of the compass you want to follow and you will be carried by the proper electric force in that direction. To descend, set the indicator to the word 'down.' Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Olaf, now I {{see that}} you are not a fool, as I thought, but very clever. Why, only {{yesterday}} the Augusta said to me--it was after she had read that report of yours--that if you were but a Christian she would be minded to lift <b>you</b> <b>high</b> indeed. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> remained the most obstinate of heathens she did not see how it could be done without causing great trouble." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the big day}} arrived, {{the guest}} list {{included}} {{more than a dozen}} world-famous chefs including Ferran Adria, Heston Blumenthal, Thomas Keller, and Pierre Hermé. [...] The evening included an elaborate 14-course, 4-hour meal which Carlson later described [...] "It was <b>as</b> <b>high</b> a pinnacle <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could ever have. It will never get better than that." [...] He stated the event was [...] "the most important night of [...] career," [...] and refused to accept payment for his services.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, boys," [...] {{the doctor}} said, when the {{laughter}} had ceased, [...] "you may find your aunt a little peculiar, {{but she is}} evidently determined to do her duty to you, and you must do yours to her, and not play more pranks than you can help. As to you, Rhoda, you will evidently be in <b>high</b> favor, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are fortunately a quiet little lady, you will, I have no doubt, get on with her very well." ...|$|R
