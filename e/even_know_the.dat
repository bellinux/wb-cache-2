When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E

25|$|In {{a startling}} debut, Tauseef took 7 for 126, dismissing Kim Hughes twice and Greg Chappell once, sharing 18 wickets with Iqbal Qasim (the other two falling to Imran Khan).

25|$|Ideological {{issues were}} not, ultimately, {{fundamental}} to the republican strategy: {{for the majority of}} sympathisers, who didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> texts of the main manifestos, it was enough to be against the monarchy, against the Church and against the political corruption of traditional parties. This lack of ideological preoccupation doesn't mean that the party didn't bother to spread its principles. The most effective action of dissemination was the propaganda made through its rallies and popular demonstrations and bulletins such as A Voz Pública (The Public Voice) in Porto, O Século (The Age, from 1880) O Mundo (The World, from 1900) and A Luta (The Struggle, from 1906) in Lisbon.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January 2006 Kušljić {{filed an}} appeal before the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{claiming}} that his fair trial rights were violated {{when it was}} not made {{possible for him to}} participate in the procedure before the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Communications of B and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of B, when it was decided that B would not request his extradition regarding the criminal procedure against him for genocide, although in his view B had jurisdiction, since he did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> procedure was underway. The Court dismissed his appeal for being ratione materiae incompatible with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|South of Black Fell is Tarn Hows, {{a picturesque}} work of {{landscape}} design initiated by James Marshall in the 1860s. This {{is one of}} the most popular destinations in the Lake District, the mixture of water, rock and arboretum being finely contrived. Now owned by the National Trust, the motor traffic is so great that a one-way system had to be initiated as early as the 1960s. Tarn Hows is maintained by a dam at the south west corner and circumnavigated by a broad, level path, providing access to all. Few of the millions of visitors stray onto the slopes of Black Fell, or <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> name of the hill which provides the backdrop to so many photographs.|$|E

25|$|His {{inherent}} shyness {{can never}} fully explain his apparent cold indifference. His {{roots in the}} Normandy countryside may explain his love of the land but could not excuse his inability to even make a generous gesture. The hard life {{that his father had}} experienced could never pardon the economy of effort with which Jacques was obsessed. In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort. He spent most of the time {{at the back of the}} bunch and did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> name of most of the riders.|$|E
25|$|In a population, at most half have values {{strictly}} {{less than}} the median and at most half have values strictly greater than it. If each group contains {{less than half the}} population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the median. For example, if a<nbsp&bnbsp&<nbsp&c, then the median of the list {a,nbsp&b,nbsp&c} is b, and, if anbsp&<nbsp&bnbsp&<nbsp&cnbsp&<nbsp&d, then the median of the list {a,nbsp&b,nbsp&c,nbsp&d} is the mean of b and c; i.e., it is (bnbsp&+nbsp&c)/2. Indeed, as {{it is based on the}} middle data in a group, it is not necessary to <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> value of extreme results in order to calculate a median. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated.|$|E
25|$|In May 1994, WJBK's then-owner, New World Communications {{signed a}} groupwide deal with Fox to switch the network affiliations of {{twelve of the}} company's 14 {{stations}} to Fox (two of which New World would sell to Fox outright as it could not keep them due to ownership conflicts). One of the stations due to switch was WJBK. CBS approached all of Detroit's major stations--WDIV-TV, WXYZ-TV, WKBD and WXON—but all of them turned CBS down. Fearing it would be left without an affiliate in Detroit, CBS began talks with WADL. As {{a measure of how}} desperate CBS was at the time, it approached WADL even though most Detroit-area viewers didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> station existed. However, Franklin Adell and CBS could not come to a mutual agreement, due to what CBS called unreasonable demands on Adell's part. CBS eventually bought Detroit's other low-profile independent, WGPR-TV (channel 62), changing its calls to WWJ-TV and moved the network's programming there on December 11, 1994, months before its purchase was finalized.|$|E

500|$|Michel {{has spoken}} out against entertainment-type cooking {{shows such as}} the 1990s cooking gameshow Can't Cook, Won't Cook, saying that [...] "The way these people handle food is a crime. They don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> basics. Little {{attention}} is paid to detail. Instead, they are intent on having a giggle and a joke. They can do this without involving food." [...] The Roux brothers had a BBC television show in the early eighties.|$|E
500|$|The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) insisted to the 9/11 Commission that fighters {{would have}} intercepted Flight93 before it reached its target in Washington, D.C., but the {{commission}} disagreed, stating that [...] "NORAD did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> plane was hijacked until {{after it had}} crashed" [...] and concluding that had it not crashed {{it probably would have}} arrived in Washington by 10:23. The 9/11 Commission Report stated that NEADS fighters pursued Delta Air Lines Flight 1989, a flight thought to be hijacked. The commission found that NORAD and the FAA gave inaccurate testimony.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of his death Beiderbecke was little known except among fellow musicians, and for several years critics paid little {{attention}} to his music. As Jean Pierre Lion has pointed out, [...] "The only serious and analytical obituary to have been published in the months" [...] after his death was by a Frenchman, Hugues Panassié. The notice appeared in October 1931 and began with a bit of hyperbole and an incorrect fact, two hallmarks of much of the subsequent writing about Beiderbecke: [...] "The announcement of Bix Beiderbecke's death plunged all jazz musicians into despair. We first believed it was a false alarm, as we had heard so often before about Bix. Unfortunately, precise information has been forthcoming, and we <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> day—August 7—when he passed away." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scabrous}} lyrics—"God {{save the}} Queen/She ain't no human being/There is no future/In England's dreaming"—prompted widespread outcry. Several major chains refused to stock the single. It was banned {{not only by}} the BBC but also by every independent radio station, making it the [...] "most heavily censored record in British history". That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two thousand million years." [...] Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see how anyone could describe us as a political band. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> name of the Prime Minister." [...] The song, and its public impact, are now recognised as [...] "punk's crowning glory".|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> character's name!'

500|$|Marie and her siblings, Prince Alfred (b. 1874), and Princesses Victoria Melita (b. 1876, {{known as}} [...] "Ducky"), Alexandra (b. 1878, known as [...] "Sandra") and Beatrice (b. 1884, known as [...] "Baby Bee"), {{spent much of}} their early life at Eastwell Park, which their mother {{preferred}} instead of Clarence House, their official residence. In her memoirs, Marie would remember Eastwell fondly. The Duke of Edinburgh was largely absent from his children's lives, due to his position in the British Royal Navy, and their life was governed by their mother. Marie would later state {{that she did not}} <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> colour of her father's hair until she looked at later portraits of him, believing it to be much darker than it actually was. When he was at home, the Duke would often play with his children, inventing many games for them. Of all her siblings, Marie was closest to her sister Victoria Melita, who was one year younger, but whom everyone believed to be the older girl because of her stature, much to the princesses' dismay. The Edinburgh children were all baptised and raised in the Anglican faith; this upset their Russian Orthodox mother.|$|E
