40|$|Abstract. A priori {{knowledge}} of the customer's perception of a product is a precondition to reduce efforts in product development and therefore diminish costs. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study analyzing the correlation between the haptic perception of surfaces and the technical measured parameters using the example of roughness. A methodology has been developed that allows objectifying specific haptic quality characteristics. Important impacts on the perception are the structure and the material of the surfaces. Three experimental studies have been conducted to investigate specific characteristics of haptic perception. The first study examines the different haptic perceptions regarding different <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structures, assuming that the subjects are able to differentiate <b>geometrical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with different technical parameters. The second experiment studies the perceived haptic relation between two surfaces that have the same technical roughness, but differ in surface structure. The structure types can be differentiated in natural (stochastic, e. g. leather) and in artificial (<b>geometrical)</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The third study concerns the hedonic evaluation of previously analyzed natural and <b>geometrical</b> <b>surfaces</b> to identify the preferences of the customer. The presented findings enable the application of the methodology in terms of customer orientated product development. Résumé.

The determination of the molecular projection area is based on choice of the surface area of the structure studied and the adsorption data obtained from the GCMC simulation. Two methods {{were used to determine}} the surface area: the flat surface area that are commonly used in the literature and the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> area. The molecular projection areas of argon and nitrogen at 77 K vary with pressure over the recommended range for BET plot (reduced pressures from 0. 05 to 0. 3) and also they varies with the percentage of defects on the surface. Additionally, it is seen that the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> area method gives molecular projection area of defective surfaces values that are in accordance with the experimental value reported in the literature.

30|$|The {{structures}} of the protoplanetary disk have been examined under various conditions of the stellar wind and the mass distribution of the disk, by assuming that the disk is steady and geometrically thick. T Tauri stars are commonly accompanied by disks {{as well as the}} stellar wind. Therefore, the disk around a T Tauri star should be influenced by the stellar wind. The height of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> of the disk is suppressed by the dynamical pressure of the wind but depends very weakly on the wind strength. The surface becomes slightly higher when the wind strength becomes weaker. Furthermore, the dependency on the mass distribution of the disk is also weak. As a natural result, the temperature distribution in the disk is insensitive to the wind strength and also the mass distribution of the disk. Thus, we can conclude that the temperature and the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> height of the disk under the stellar wind does not depend on either the wind properties or the mass distribution of the disk.|$|R

The toleranced surface is represented by a point-set {{which is consistent with}} its parametric equations, the semantics of geometrical tolerances are parameterized with respect to variation of point-set and associated mathematical interpretations of tolerance zone are formalized. Three methods are presented to extract individual points from point-set: characteristic points of MGRE, characteristic points of <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> and discrete points of <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface.</b> The tolerance chains through key assembly features are analyzed and represented by homogenous transform matrix.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{which leads to}} tool-surface structures with improved tribological properties in cold forming processes is presented. This approach {{is based on the}} one hand on an increase of wear resistance and, on the other hand on the general idea to use the remaining wear mechanisms itselfs for the production of a defined <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structure during forming (self-forming phenomenon). This effect is initiated by a predefined three-dimensional material structure; i. e. a 30 -surface structure is created out of a 30 material structure "in situ". In practice, the creation of a defined three-dimensional material structure can be realized by local application of thermal or thermo-chemical surface-treatment techniques. The difference in material properties between thermally implanted zones and matrix material finally leads to a functional gradient in the tribological system. The matrix wears off faster compared to the implanted areas and produces the required surface structure. Therefore, regarding the appearance of wear mechanisms, this defined functional gradient of material structure has the effect, that within the tribological system originally uncontrolled wear becomes an instrument of controlled <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structuring. Starting from theoretical considerations on the influence of different wear mechanisms on structural changes of tool surfaces during forming, a special technique of laser treatment (thermal implantation) leading to three-dimensional material structures in the surface zone of tool steel is presented. Tribological experiments were conducted at different contact pressures to see how the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structure evolves. The tests were run for varying length of time and three-dimensional surface topography was utilised to obtain the evolution of surface structure resulting from different wear mechanisms with time. Therefore, cold-forging tools with different geometries were treated and applied under practical forming conditions. The surface quality of the final products was inspected by 3 D-measurement...|$|R

40|$|A local Hawking {{temperature}} is derived for any future outer trapping horizon in spherical symmetry, using a Hamilton-Jacobi {{variant of the}} Parikh-Wilczek tunneling method. It is given by a dynamical surface gravity as defined geometrically. The operational meaning of the {{temperature is}} that Kodama observers just outside the horizon measure an invariantly redshifted temperature, diverging at the horizon itself. In static, asymptotically flat cases, the Hawking temperature as usually defined by the Killing vector agrees in standard cases, but generally differs by a relative redshift factor between the horizon and infinity, being the temperature measured by static observers at infinity. Likewise, the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> gravity reduces to the Newtonian surface gravity in the Newtonian limit, while the Killing definition instead reflects measurements at infinity. This may resolve a longstanding puzzle concerning the Hawking temperature for the extremal limit of the charged stringy black hole, namely {{that it is the}} local temperature which vanishes. In general, this confirms the quasi-stationary picture of black-hole evaporation in early stages. However, the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> gravity is generally not the surface gravity of a static black hole with the same parameters. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
40|$|Bearing the {{thermodynamic}} arguments {{together with}} the two definitions of mass in mind, we try to find metrics with spherical symmetry. We consider the adiabatic condition along with the Gong-Wang mass, and evaluate the $g_{rr}$ element which points to a null hypersurface. In addition, we generalize the thermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus the corresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the $g_{tt}$ element. Moreover, we investigate the mathematical and physical properties of the discovered metric in the Einstein relativity framework which shows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. The obtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of a polytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de Sitter background. We also show that if one considers the Misner-Sharp mass in the calculations, the Schwarzschild metric will be got. The {{relationship between the two}} mass definitions in each metric is studied. The results of considering the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> gravity are also addressed. Our investigation shows that the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> gravity's definition is not always compatible with the validity of the first law of thermodynamics on the horizons of spherically symmetric static metrics.
