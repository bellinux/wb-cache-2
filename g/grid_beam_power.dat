When tested under gravity loads, this configuration with 7 <b>grid</b> <b>beams</b> in each panel gave acceptable approximations of both resultant forces and displacements. However, when evaluated for the scenario involving a column removal, the errors were significant (with displacements being overestimated {{by a factor of}} 3 or more). Likewise, the third configuration, wherein one-way <b>grid</b> <b>beams</b> run in the short direction in the exterior panels and in the long direction in the interior panels, was also unsatisfactory in predicting either displacements or internal forces to an acceptable degree.|$|R
30|$|The first {{analyzed}} configuration has two-way <b>grid</b> <b>beams,</b> {{as shown}} in Fig.  13 a: the cases of 1, 3, 5, and 7 evenly distributed girders for each panel were analyzed. In all cases <b>grid</b> <b>beams</b> were assigned the same depth— 203  mm—and the same reinforcement ratio as the slab. When compared to the “exact” model that incorporates nonlinear slabs, the two-way <b>grid</b> <b>beam</b> model produces acceptable results when comparing axial forces under gravity loads, however the errors in peak displacements range from 10 to 25  % (in {{the region of the}} missing column lines) and even larger errors are noted in predicting shear forces in the beams. Increased refinement of the grids and modifying the stiffness properties of the equivalent beams do result in improved predictions but the overall effort in identifying a suitable grid and stiffness modifiers was deemed too cumbersome to merit further investigation.|$|R

40|$|<b>Beam</b> <b>power</b> is a {{fundamental}} parameter that describes, in part, the state of a supermassive black hole system. Determining the <b>beam</b> <b>powers</b> of powerful classical double radio sources requires substantial observing time, {{so it would be}} useful to determine the relationship between <b>beam</b> <b>power</b> and radio power so that radio power could be used as a proxy for <b>beam</b> <b>power.</b> A sample of 31 powerful classical double radio sources with previously determined <b>beam</b> and radio <b>powers</b> are studied; the sources have redshifts between about 0. 056 and 1. 8. It is found that the relationship between <b>beam</b> <b>power,</b> Lj, and radio power, P, is well described by Log(Lj) = 0. 84 Log(P) + 2. 15, where both L_j and P are in units of 10 ^(44) erg/s.
