5|$|Galland flew {{his first}} of 300 combat mission in Spain with the J/88 {{commander}} Gotthard Handrick, on 24 July 1937, near Brunete. During {{his time in}} Spain, Galland analysed the engagements, evaluated techniques and devised new ground-attack tactics which were {{passed on to the}} Luftwaffe. His experiences in pin-point ground assaults were used by Ernst Udet, a proponent of the <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> and leading supporter of the Junkers Ju 87 to push for Stuka wings. Wolfram von Richthofen, an opponent of Udet's, used them to push for the opposite: Schlachtflieger dual combination fighter-bombers. After trials with Henschel Hs 123s, Bf 109s and Ju 87s, the Junkers was selected to undergo trials for the <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> role.|$|E
5|$|There are 54 Spitfires {{and a few}} Seafires in {{airworthy}} condition worldwide, {{although many}} air museums have examples on static display, for example, Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry has paired a static Spitfire with a static Ju 87 R-2/Trop. Stuka <b>dive</b> <b>bomber.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 {{ordered his}} <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> units to begin {{operations}} against the radar stations and airfields {{on the southern}} coast of Britain. The targets {{on the afternoon of}} 18 August were RAF Ford, RAF Thorney Island and Gosport, all belonging to the Fleet Air Arm or Coastal Command. Included in the target selection was the radar station at Poling, West Sussex, near Littlehampton.|$|E
50|$|Two escadrilles of the Aéronautique Navale, {{designated}} as AB2 and AB4, converted to the LN.401/411 between late 1939 and early 1940. AB2 received its first LN.401 <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> in November 1939, while AB4 received the LN.411 <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> {{rejected by the}} Air force from February 1940 onwards. The <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> rejected by the Air force were a welcome reinforcement to the Navy, as production of the LN.401 was very slow.|$|R
50|$|Ernst Udet, an {{advocate}} {{of the use of}} <b>dive</b> <b>bombers,</b> tested the second prototype - Fw 56 V2 - in this role, and on his recommendation the development of <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> was given greater attention.|$|R
50|$|Lexingtons {{aircraft}} {{arrived and}} attacked at 11:30. Two <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> attacked Shōkaku, hitting the carrier with one 1000 lb bomb, causing further damage. Two other <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> dove on Zuikaku, missing with their bombs. The rest of Lexingtons <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> {{were unable to}} find the Japanese carriers in the heavy clouds. Lexingtons TBDs missed Shōkaku with all 11 of their torpedoes. The 13 CAP Zeros on patrol at this time shot down three Wildcats.|$|R
5|$|Luftflotte 3 (commanded by Hugo Sperrle), {{supported}} by Luftflotte 2 (commanded by Albert Kesselring), executed the heaviest air bombardment {{the world had}} yet witnessed and the most intense by the Luftwaffe during the war. The Luftwaffe committed two Sturzkampfgeschwader (<b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> wings) to the assault, flying 300 sorties against French positions, with Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 alone flying 201 individual missions. A total of 3,940 sorties were flown by nine Kampfgeschwader (Bomber Wing) units often in Gruppe strength.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1942, Sōryū set {{out with}} the Combined Fleet's carrier {{striking}} force {{in the company of}} Kaga, Akagi, and Hiryū, which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Her aircraft complement consisted of eighteen Zeros, sixteen D3As, eighteen B5Ns, and two prototypes of the new Yokosuka D4Y <b>dive</b> <b>bomber.</b> Also aboard were three A6M Zeros of the 6th Kōkūtai intended as a portion of the aerial garrison for Midway.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{request for}} proposals for a heavy escort fighter (Tyazholyy Istrebitel' Soprovozhdeniya) was received at the Polikarpov OKB in November 1938, but the press of work with the I-180 and SPB prototypes prevented any significant design work until {{the third quarter of}} 1940. Mikhail Yangel was appointed head designer, but his job was complicated by multiple changes {{in the role of the}} aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor, <b>dive</b> <b>bomber,</b> and eventually reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen Ju 87D <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> {{and a few}} Ju 87R-2 {{extended}} range <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> {{are known to have}} been supplied to the HZL, and six of these were flown operationally against Soviet troops in the late summer of 1944.|$|R
50|$|In a well-planned attack, {{fighter planes}} strafed the {{battleship}} {{to suppress the}} AA guns, while <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> used their armor-piercing bombs to cause topside damage and havoc. The fighters and <b>dive</b> <b>bombers,</b> however, were diversions to allow the delivery of aerial torpedoes.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's main supply of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} {{phase of the}} German {{invasion}} of Poland, I.(Jagd)/LG2 (1st Fighter Group of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) relocated to Lauenburg (now Lębork), near Bromberg, {{in support of the}} 4. Armee (4th Army). Unteroffizier (a non-commissioned officer) Geißhard claimed his first aerial victory, a PWS-26 biplane, that day. The following day, flying his Messerschmitt Bf 109, Geißhardt had to make an emergency landing behind Polish lines. After several hours in Polish captivity, he escaped during the confusion caused by a German Stuka (<b>Dive</b> <b>Bomber)</b> attack. He reached German lines after walking for five days.|$|E
5|$|Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz was to {{plan the}} {{operation}} having been appointed C-in-C of II. Fliegerkorps on 8 December. Luftwaffenkommando West had ordered all units—except Jagdgeschwader 300 and 301—to attend the main planning meeting in Flammersfeld on 5 December. On 14 December, Peltz officially initiated plans for a major blow against the Allies in northwest Europe. Peltz was not a fighter pilot; his combat record was as a <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> pilot, flying the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. His experiences in Poland, in France, and during the early campaigns on the Eastern Front had moulded him into an outstanding ground attack specialist, making him an ideal candidate for planning Bodenplatte.|$|E
500|$|Between 09:05 and 09:14, Junyō {{had arrived}} within [...] of the U.S. {{carriers}} {{and launched a}} strike of 17 <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> and 12 Zeros. As the Japanese main body and advanced force maneuvered to try to join formations, Junyō readied follow-up strikes. At 11:21, the Junyō aircraft arrived and dove on the Enterprise task force. The <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> scored one near miss on Enterprise, causing more damage, and one hit each on South Dakota and light cruiser , causing moderate damage to both ships. Eleven of the 17 Japanese <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> were destroyed in this attack.|$|R

5|$|In {{accordance}} with Japanese carrier doctrine at the time, Admiral Nagumo had kept {{half of his}} aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> and torpedo <b>bombers.</b> The <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> were as yet unarmed. The torpedo bombers were armed with torpedoes should any American warships be located.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to Battleship Row and the island's naval field, the fixed moorings {{on the western}} side of Ford Island (capable of securing battleships or aircraft carriers) were high-priority targets. Just west of the island, the seaplane tender Curtiss was hit by a crashing <b>dive</b> <b>bomber,</b> a bomb and fragments of another bomb. She was then unsuccessfully attacked by a Japanese midget submarine, which fired a torpedo before being sunk by the destroyer Monaghan. Hangar 6 and several patrol seaplanes and other aircraft on Ford Island (33 out of 70 of the island's planes) were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the <b>dive</b> <b>bomber,</b> each with crews {{of two or}} three men. Wartime {{experience}} showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of radio beacons and the development of more powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the consolidation of the two types of bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier's air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group to be increased.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, the Wehrmacht {{commenced}} Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion}} of the Soviet Union. The Luftwaffe order of battle of 22 June 1941 contained four <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> wings. VIII. Fliegerkorps under the command of General der Flieger Wolfram von Richthofen was equipped with units Stab, II. and III./StG 1. Also included were Stab, I., II. and III. of Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 Immelmann. Attached to II. Fliegerkorps, under the command of General der Flieger Bruno Loerzer, were Stab, I., II. and III. of StG 77. Luftflotte 5, under the command of Generaloberst Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, operating from Norway's Arctic Circle, were allotted IV. Gruppe (St)/Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1).|$|E
25|$|The Junkers Ju 87 Stuka <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> {{carried out}} the first mission of the campaign, twenty minutes before war was officially announced. The <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> scored the first aerial victory of the war when Kettenführer Leutnant Frank Neubert shot down a Polish PZL P.11c fighter {{aircraft}} piloted by Captain Mieczysław Medwecki.|$|R

5|$|Yorktowns second strike—utilizing {{the same}} aircraft—returned to Tulagi and began their attack at 12:10 on the Japanese ships, {{many of which}} were now at full steam and {{attempting}} to put distance between themselves and Tulagi harbor. The second strike hit and sank the minesweepers #1 and #2 and severely damaged Tama Maru northeast of Savo Island. Another Japanese seaplane was shot down by a U.S. <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> during the second strike. After four F4F-3/3A Wildcat fighters from Yorktown joined the strike, the fighters shot down two more Japanese floatplanes over Florida Island. The four U.S. fighters then strafed Yūzuki, killing her captain and nine others of her crew, and causing moderate damage to the ship. Two or three other Japanese floatplanes were damaged in Tulagi harbor and their crews were killed.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Eastern front, the Junkers {{assisted}} Army Group Centre in its {{drive toward}} Moscow. From 13–22 December, 420 vehicles and 23 tanks {{were destroyed by}} StG 77, greatly improving {{the morale of the}} German infantry, who were by now on the defensive. StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> wing. It had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to hostile action. At the end of Barbarossa, StG 1 had lost 60 Stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground. StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, StG 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action). IV.(St)/LG1, operating from Norway, lost 24 Ju 87s, all in aerial combat.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised Zveno-SPB (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined <b>Dive</b> <b>Bomber)</b> which {{consisted}} of a Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN mothership and two Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 fighters. Each of the fighters was armed {{with a pair of}} 250kg (550lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs. Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100kg (220lb) of bombs, once hoisted in the air by the TB-3 it could reach 410km/h (220 knots, 255mph) at 2500 m (8,200ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310ft), and could dive at up to 650km/h (350 knots, 405mph). Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000kg (48,500lb), a top speed of 268km/h (145 knots, 165mph), and a range of 2500km (1,350 NM, 1,550mi). The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.|$|E

5|$|The {{second wave}} arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, {{consisting}} of 57 Junkers Ju 87 <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> and 30 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters. They {{were met by}} 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at Kragujevac, acting without orders of their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two <b>dive</b> <b>bombers</b> shot down {{for the loss of}} both Yugoslav aircraft.|$|R

5|$|In early 1942, the Ju 87s {{gave the}} German Army yet more {{valuable}} support. On 29 December 1941, the Soviet 44th Army {{landed on the}} Kerch Peninsula. The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (Kampfgruppen) and two <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> groups belonging to StG 77. With air superiority, the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were blocked by the Stukas inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping. The Ju 87's effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. Later versions of the T-34 tank could withstand Stuka attack in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Wing's three <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> squadrons {{returned}} to Australia during March 1944 to be re-equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. The RAAF had previously intended to establish new squadrons {{to introduce the}} Liberator into service, {{and the availability of}} the Vengeance-equipped units simplified this process. All of the squadrons' dive bombers departed Nadzab on 13 March, and their ground crews followed soon afterwards. No. 21 Squadron was transferred to Camden, New South Wales, No. 23 Squadron to Higgins Field in Cape York where it operated as an army-cooperation unit as part of No. 75 Wing, and No. 24 Squadron to Lowood. Al three units ceased flying Vengeances shortly afterwards. No. 4 OTU was also disbanded on 30 April 1944. No. 12 Squadron remained at Merauke until July 1944, when it was withdrawn to Strathpine, Queensland, and handed in its Vengeances ahead of also receiving Liberators.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the Eastern Front, Müncheberg {{travelled}} to Berlin {{where he}} briefly served {{on the staff of the}} General der Jagdflieger Galland discussing air combat tactics and how to lead a fighter wing. On 26 July 1942 he participated in the German track and field championships, starting for the ASV Köln in the decathlon. Müncheberg finally arrived on the Eastern Front in early August 1942 where he was welcomed by the Geschwaderkommodore of JG51, Major Karl-Gottfried Nordmann. Initially Müncheberg believed that combat on the Eastern Front was child's play in comparison to the Western Front. In the first four weeks his aircraft was twice severely damaged in combat. His first major task was re-equipping JG51 with the Fw190. Under his leadership JG51 became the first fighter wing on the Eastern Front to equip with this type. He claimed his first victories in the east on 3 August 1942, shooting down two Petlyakov Pe-2 <b>dive</b> <b>bomber</b> near Rzhev.|$|E
