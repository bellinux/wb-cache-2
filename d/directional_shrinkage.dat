Polymerization shrinkage is an undesirable side-effect of dental resin composite. The resulting stresses cannot be measured directly and the outcome is very complex and depends {{on a lot of}} variables. In this exploratory study, we aimed to evaluate the <b>directional</b> <b>shrinkage</b> within an unbounded composite restoration by tracking the displacement of its inherent glass particles. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Characterisation of {{a number}} of key wood {{properties}} utilising ‘state of the art’ tools was achieved for four commercial Australian hardwood species: Corymbia citriodora, Eucalyptus pilularis, Eucalyptus marginata and Eucalyptus obliqua. The wood properties were measured for input into microscopic (cellular level) and macroscopic (board level) vacuum drying models currently under development. Morphological characterisation was completed using a combination of ESEM, optical microscopy and a custom vector-based image analysis software. A clear difference in wood porosity, size, wall thickness and orientation was evident between species. Wood porosity was measured using a combination of fibre and vessel porosity. A highly sensitive microbalance and scanning laser micrometres were used to measure loss of moisture content in conjunction with <b>directional</b> <b>shrinkage</b> on micro-samples of E. obliqua to investigate the validity of measuring collapse-free shrinkage in very thin sections. Collapse-free shrinkage was characterised, and collapse propensity was verified when testing thicker samples. Desorption isotherms were calculated for each species using wood–water relations data generated from shrinkage experiments. Fibre geometry and wood shrinkage anisotropy were used to explain the observed difficulty in drying of the different species in terms of collapse and drying stress-related degrade...|$|E

In both compounds, alkali-ions are gradually lost Into the vacuum, under an intense electron beam, leaving the vacant spaces in the conduction planes. One possible process of filling up these vacant spaces is the local diffusion of Al (or Fe) and O atoms from the neighboring spinel blocks. The other process, observed only in potassium ^'"-ferrite, is the direct contacts of the upper and the lower spinel blocks, through the coopera-tive movements of atoms towards the vacant conduction plane. <b>Directional</b> <b>shrinkage</b> along the c axis Is observed in the second process. As reported before [Matsui, Y. et al. : Acta Cryst., B 4 T, 27 (1985) ], the original zig-zag structural feature with mirror planes at every seventh oxygen layer, is gra-dually rearranged in potassium /}'"-ferrite to form larger domains of magnetite (Fe) O 4).

40|$|The textile {{industry}} processes a large quantity of fibres obtained from various animals of which wool is commercially the most important. However, {{it has some}} technical problems which affect the quality and performance of the finished products such as felting shrinkage, handle, lustre, pilling and dyeability. These problems may be attributed mainly {{to the presence of}} wool scales on the fibre surface. The scales are relatively hard and have sharp edges which are responsible for causing fibre <b>directional</b> movement and <b>shrinkage</b> during felting. Furthermore, the scales also serve as a barrier for diffusion processes which will adversely affect the sorption behaviour. In recent years, there has been an increase in the modification of wool surface scales by physical means such as mechanical, thermal and ultrasonic treatments, and chemical methods such as oxidation, reduction, enzyme and ozone treatments which can solve the felting and sorption problems to a certain extent. Hitherto, chemical treatments are still the most commonly used descaling methods in the industry. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using self-assembly, {{nanoscale}} {{materials can}} be fabricated {{from the bottom}} up. Opals and inverse opals are examples of self-assembled nanomaterials made from crystallizing colloidal particles. As self-assembly requires {{a high level of}} control, it is challenging to use building blocks with anisotropic geometry to form complex opals, which limits the possible structures. Typically, spherical colloids are employed as building blocks, leading to symmetric, isotropic superstructures. However, a significantly richer palette of directionally dependent properties are expected if less symmetric, anisotropic structures can be created, especially originating from the assembly of regular, spherical particles. Here we show a simple method for introducing anisotropy into inverse opals by subjecting them to a post-assembly thermal treatment that results in <b>directional</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the silica matrix caused by condensation of partially hydrated sol−gel silica structures. In this way, we can tailor the shape of the pores, and the anisotropy of the final inverse opal preserves the order and uniformity of the self-assembled structure. Further, we prevent the need to synthesize complex oval-shaped particles and crystallize them into such target geometries. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy studies clearly identify increasing degrees of sol−gel condensation in confinement as a mechanism for the structure change. A computer simulation of structure changes resulting from the condensation-induced shrinkage further confirmed this mechanism. As an example of property changes induced by the introduction of anisotropy, we characterized the optical spectra of the anisotropic inverse opals and found that the optical properties can be controlled in a precise way using calcination temperature...|$|E
