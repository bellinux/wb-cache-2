5|$|Eliot {{believed}} that Burnt Norton could benefit society. The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they can follow the paths of either <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil,</b> {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E

5|$|Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch {{lead the}} attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, {{successfully}} defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for doing this is for the people to finally be free of rule, <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E

5|$|Infamous (stylized as inFAMOUS) is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Sucker Punch Productions {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3. The game was released in North America on May 26, 2009, in Europe on May 29, 2009, in Australia on June 4, 2009 and in Japan on November 5, 2009. In Infamous, the player controls the protagonist Cole MacGrath, a bike messenger caught {{in the center of}} an explosion that devastates several city blocks of the fictional Empire City. The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity-based super powers. Though the game's story follows Cole using his new abilities to restore some semblance of order to Empire City, the player is given several opportunities to use these powers for <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> purposes in the game's Karma system. These choices ultimately affect character growth, the reaction of the City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{important}} texts {{were created}} and studied by scholars. Philosophical works written by Yang Xiong (53 BC – 18 AD), Huan Tan (43 BC – 28 AD), Wang Chong (27–100 AD), and Wang Fu (78–163 AD) questioned whether human nature was innately <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> and posed challenges to Dong's universal order. The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Tan (d. 110 BC) {{and his son}} Sima Qian (145–86 BC) established the standard model for all of imperial China's Standard Histories, such as the Book of Han written by Ban Biao (3–54 AD), his son Ban Gu (32–92 AD), and his daughter Ban Zhao (45–116 AD). There were dictionaries such as the Shuowen Jiezi by Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 147 AD) and the Fangyan by Yang Xiong. Biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen. Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre, which achieved its greatest prominence {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu.|$|E

25|$|Chandogya Upanishad, {{in chapter}} 1.2, {{describes}} {{the battle between}} Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle {{between good and evil}} fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> sights witnessed by beings, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> words shared between people, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> smells of nature, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> feelings experienced, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.|$|E

25|$|Both {{folklore}} and modern popular culture use physical traits to denote a character's either <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> tendencies.

25|$|On the {{seafaring}} Lamu Island, families traditionally keep a jinn jar at home. The jinn jar is {{a container}} that holds a supernatural being in Islam and Arabian mythology called a jinn (in English, a genie).

25|$|The spiritual {{barometer}} is on {{the lower}} {{left side of the}} screen. This is a close-up view of the main character currently being played. Since good behavior is meaningless lacking the temptation to do evil, each character is free to do <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> acts. However, good acts are rewarded by increases in the character's spiritual barometer, which affect the chances of the player destroying AM in the final adventure. Conversely, evil acts are punished by lowering the character's spiritual barometer.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the novel, Azriel is {{struggling}} to understand whether he is a ghost, a demon, or an angel. He is trying to understand why God has denied him the Stairway to Heaven by allowing him to be made into an immortal spirit who is bound to the gold-encased bones of his mortal body. As a genie, he must obey the Master of those bones (whoever has them at the moment) and become the Master's Servant, whether for <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil.</b> Thus the title, Servant of the Bones.|$|E
25|$|Appayya Dikshita, a Shaiva theologian and {{proponent of}} Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards {{happiness}} and misery {{in accordance with}} the law of karma. Thus persons themselves perform <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone.|$|E

25|$|While, however, Xenocrates (and {{with him}} Speusippus {{and the other}} {{philosophers}} of the older Academy) would not accept that these intermediate things, such as health, beauty, fame, good fortune, etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that they were absolutely worthless or indifferent. According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have designated it as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil,</b> probably with the proviso, that by misuse what is good might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might become good.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the legends}} are {{interconnected}} in the Bhagavata. The text asserts that gods (Deva), demons (Asuras) {{and human beings}} do things, and behave in <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> ways, in part, because of their past experiences and their innate evolving natures (Guṇa). The evil behavior of demon king Hiranyakasipu in Book 7, for example, against his own son Prahlada for his Bhakti for Vishnu, is not simply because of demonic Tamasic Guṇa but also because Vishnu in his Varaha avatar had killed Hiranyakasipu's brother Hiranyaksa in Book 2. Hiranyakasipu turned vengeful against Vishnu ever since then, and had refused to consider whether Hiranyaksa deserved to die.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, the {{majority}} of the followers of Islam believe in the existence of spirits as a fundamental aspect of their religion. However, these spirits are not those of humans but of a third sapient creation said to be made by God (other than the creation of man and angels) called the jinn. Jinn are spirits made from smokeless fire, in a realm not visible to the eyes of people, who are also subject to follow the laws of God and, alike to people, may enter either Heaven or Hell. A famous jinn in the Muslim tradition is Satan, as opposed to the Christian belief that he is a fallen angel. Communication with these 'spirits', whether the spirit is <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> in nature, is generally not encouraged in Islam.|$|E
