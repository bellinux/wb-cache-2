25|$|Wide-field multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{refers to}} an optical non-linear imaging technique tailored for ultrafast imaging in which a large area of the object is illuminated and imaged {{without the need for}} scanning. High intensities are required to induce non-linear optical processes such as two-photon fluorescence or second <b>harmonic</b> <b>generation.</b> In scanning multiphoton microscopes the high intensities are achieved by tightly focusing the light, and the image is obtained by stage- or beam-scanning the sample. In wide-field multiphoton microscopy the high intensities are best achieved using an optically amplified pulsed laser source to attain a large field of view (~100µm). The image in this case is obtained as a single frame with a CCD without the need of scanning, making the technique particularly useful to visualize dynamic processes simultaneously across the object of interest. With wide-field multiphoton microscopy the frame rate can be increased up to a 1000-fold compared to multiphoton scanning microscopy.|$|E

40|$|Optical <b>harmonics</b> <b>generation</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} nonlinear frequency conversion effects, whereby an integer number of low-energy photons merge into a single high-energy photon inside a nonlinear material.

We show that the acceleration of mid-infrared photons trapped inside the metasurface, triggered by the rapid evolution of the metasurface resonance due to free carrier generation, is responsible for the generation of upconverted photons with peak frequencies of up to ≈ 3. 1 ω. A simple model of resonant photon acceleration is in good agreement with experimental results, and shows a clear path for higher photon acceleration efficiency, which is estimated to be around 22...|$|R
