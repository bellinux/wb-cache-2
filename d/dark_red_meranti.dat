40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the basic working load (BWL) of metal plate connections in different species of Malaysian timber namely as Kapur (Dryobalanops spp), and <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Meranti</b> (Shorea sp.). Two types of connections were used, parallel and perpendicular joints, each joints consists of two different orientation of plate to load directions. The study also includes the investigation of strength influence due to gap factors at butt end and at different embedment surface on <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Meranti</b> species. Each type of connection consists of 12 specimens. The samples of the wood connections were experimented under tensile loads for the derivation of their BWL. The size of metal plate is 50 mm (w) x 100 mm (l) x 1 mm (t). All testing and analysis were carried out in accordance to Australian Standard (AS 1649 – 1998). For each test specimens, the maximum load, maximum displacement and failure mode were observed. The values of BWL derived were from the maximum load. It is found that the highest BWL were from the parallel orientation of wood and plate to the load direction with 80 N/tooth and 40. 75 N/tooth for Kapur and <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Meranti</b> respectively. From the result of this study, it shows that the orientation plate, wood species, density of the wood and its moisture content influenced the strength of the metal plate connection.

External parameters concern mainly the machining process parameters such as: the feeding speed, the depth of cut, the cutting tool diameter and geometry, the cutting geometry, the cutting technique (up or down milling). This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Meranti</b> (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as fuzzy grain, torn grain and chip marks often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield. To understand and optimize the planing characteristics of this wood species, a series of experiments were carried out using a weinig Unimate 23 E moulder (cutter-head rpm of 6000, cutter diameter 120 mm) to produce machined surface with differing depth of cut ranging from 0. 8 to 2. 4 mm, by altering the feed rate from 8 to 16 m min - 1 according to ASTM D 1666 - 87. Based on the preliminary results of this study, the best results were obtained at 0. 8 mm of depth of cut and feed rate of 8 m min - 1 for <b>Dark</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Meranti.</b> While, the poorest results was on Melunak wood at 2. 4 mm of depth of cut and 16 m min - 1 of feed speed.
