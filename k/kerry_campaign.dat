5|$|In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin {{and took}} his first job in the {{political}} arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives. Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, had a large part in the decision to hire Lu; the two would work together again later on the Obama administration; Lu later said he considers Schiliro and Pete Rouse, another future White House staffer, among his most influential mentors. During his tenure with the Government Reform Committee, Lu conducted several high-profile investigations, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the 1996 presidential election, the collapse of Enron, and substandard nursing home conditions. Lu also served as special adviser for communications to Senator John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of September 11 attack victims supporting the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E

50|$|Mary Beth Cahill (born December 1954) is an American {{political}} figure, {{who served}} as the campaign manager of Senator John <b>Kerry's</b> <b>campaign</b> for the Democratic nomination for President.

25|$|He joined Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential {{campaign}} soon after graduation from the College of the Holy Cross. While {{working for the}} <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{his job was to}} assemble audio clips of talk radio programs for the Kerry camp to review for the next day. When the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign</b> began to falter at one point, they found themselves without a speechwriter, and Favreau was promoted to the role of deputy speechwriter. Following Kerry's defeat, Favreau became dispirited with politics, and was uncertain if he would do such work again. Favreau first met Obama (then an Illinois State Senator running for the U.S. Senate), while still working for Kerry, backstage at the 2004 Democratic National Convention as Obama was rehearsing his keynote address. Favreau, then 23 years old, interrupted Obama's rehearsal, advising the soon-to-be-elected Senator that a rewrite was needed to avoid an overlap with Kerry's address.|$|E
25|$|Favreau {{attended}} the College of the Holy Cross, graduating as valedictorian. In college, he accumulated scholastic honors, and {{took part in}} and directed community and civic programs. After graduation, {{he went to work}} for the John Kerry presidential campaign in 2004, working to collect talk radio news for the campaign and was promoted to the role of Deputy Speechwriter. While working for the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> he first met Barack Obama.|$|E
500|$|In the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Kennedy campaigned heavily for fellow Massachusetts Senator John Kerry and lent {{his chief}} of staff, Mary Beth Cahill, to the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign.</b> [...] Kennedy's appeal was {{effective}} among blue collar and minority voters, and helped Kerry stage a come-from-behind win in the Iowa caucuses that propelled him on to the Democratic nomination.|$|E

500|$|Dodd {{had told}} the Associated Press in April 2006 that he was {{considering}} running, and by May 22 he had met with key backers, including congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, and had assembled a team to prepare a potential 2008 campaign. In June 2006, he held his first major fundraiser, stunning Beltway commentators by raising over $1 million in one night. Dodd attended a Florida Democratic convention in July 2006 to garner further support. He hired former John <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign</b> manager Jim Jordan in December of that year. Two months later, Dodd told {{the head of the}} New Hampshire Democratic Party at the Rainbow Cafe that he was not [...] "going to do the exploratory thing" [...] but instead [...] "plunge right in" [...] to the race.|$|E
500|$|Bayh {{traveled}} to the first primary state of New Hampshire on July 10, 2005 on his first campaign trip since the 2004 election. He held a [...] "meet and greet" [...] at Democratic headquarters in Manchester, and visited Concord the following day to meet with Governor John Lynch and environmental leaders. The next month he {{traveled to}} the first caucus state of Iowa, meeting with Congressman Leonard Boswell to discuss methamphetamine use. He also attended party fundraisers and met with activists during his three-day stay. While in Des Moines, Bayh stated that Democrats must gain credibility on national security, and commented that he would begin a full-fledged presidential campaign if {{he felt he had}} the means to win the Democratic nomination. Throughout the month, he visited Iowa and reflected similar rhetoric to the 2004 <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> advocating energy independence, fair trade, lowering the federal deficit and an improved handling of the war in Iraq. He explained to reporters that his visits to Iowa were [...] "the beginning of a longer conversation".|$|E

2500|$|Kerry {{has made}} his Vietnam {{journals}} and diaries available to his biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, but has not made them otherwise publicly available. [...] In declining to make the materials available to the Washington Post in 2004, the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign</b> cited an exclusivity agreement with [...] Brinkley. [...] However, Brinkley subsequently told the paper that he interpreted the agreement as requiring only that quotations from the materials cite his book.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Meehan, a {{spokesman}} for the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> responded to SBVT's charges with a statement that Kerry was referring to a period when Nixon had been president-elect and before he was inaugurated. Meehan went on to state that Kerry had been [...] "deep in enemy waters" [...] between Vietnam and Cambodia and that his boat came under fire at the Cambodian border. Meehan also said that Kerry did covertly cross over into Cambodia to drop off special operations forces on a later occasion, but that there was no paperwork for such missions and he could not supply dates.|$|E
2500|$|Mapes and Smith {{made contact}} with Burkett in late August, and on August 24 Burkett offered to meet with them to share the {{documents}} he possessed, and later told reporters from USA Today [...] "that he had agreed {{to turn over the}} documents to CBS if the network would arrange a conversation with the Kerry campaign," [...] a claim substantiated by emails between Smith and Mapes detailing Burkett's additional requests for help with negotiating a book deal, security, and financial compensation. [...] During the last week of August, Mapes asked Josh Howard, her immediate superior at CBS, for permission to facilitate contact between Burkett and the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> and Howard and Mapes subsequently disputed whether such permission had been given.|$|E

50|$|Early on, John <b>Kerry's</b> <b>campaign</b> {{manager was}} Jim Jordan. However, Jordan was {{replaced}} by Mary Beth Cahill. Kerry also hired Bob Shrum as a campaign consultant. Cahill and Shrum were known for disagreeing on how the campaign should be run.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Shrum {{worked on}} John <b>Kerry's</b> <b>campaign,</b> guiding {{him to a}} victory in the crucial Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and soon after, the Democratic presidential nomination, only for Kerry to be {{defeated}} in the general election by George W. Bush.|$|R
2500|$|Mapes {{informed}} Rather of {{the progress}} of the story, which was being targeted to air on September 8 along with footage of an interview with former Lieutenant Governor of Texas Ben Barnes, who would publicly state for the first time his opinion that Bush had received preferential treatment to get into the National Guard. [...] Mapes had also been in contact with the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign</b> several times between late August and September 6, when she spoke with senior Kerry advisor Joe Lockhart regarding the progressing story. Lockhart subsequently stated he was [...] "wary" [...] of contact with Mapes at this stage, because if the story were true, his involvement might undermine its credibility, and if it were false, [...] "he {{did not want to be}} associated with it." [...] Lockhart called Burkett on September 6 at the number provided by Mapes, and both men stated they discussed Burkett's view of Kerry's Presidential campaign strategy, not the existence of the documents or the related story.|$|E
2500|$|That April, <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign</b> manager Mary Beth Cahill began listing {{possible}} {{candidates to}} be the 2004 Democratic National Convention's keynote speaker—including Jennifer Granholm, Janet Napolitano, Tom Vilsack, Mark Warner, and Bill Richardson—searching for speakers who would generate a significant buzz in the media. [...] Others {{involved in the process}} included convention manager Jack Corrigan and Kerry media advisor Robert Shrum. [...] Corrigan's friend, Lisa Hay, knew Obama from their time together working on the Harvard Law Review and strongly recommended him. Cahill had previously seen Obama in a photo in TIME and began asking for opinions from people who knew and had worked with him. [...] Although there were some internal worries about his style of speaking, lack of experience with a teleprompter, opposition to the Iraq War that Kerry initially supported, {{and the fact that he}} was only a state senator, they eventually chose Obama over the other finalist, Jennifer Granholm, in part because polls showed Kerry with less support among African-Americans than Democrats normally enjoyed and because he was running for an important Senate seat. [...] During the process, the Obama senate campaign provided the Kerry camp with an eight-minute audition video, and several Obama advisors lobbied on his behalf with members of the Kerry staff.|$|E
50|$|In November 2003, she {{was named}} {{communications}} director for the John <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> at Kennedy's recommendation. During that campaign, she was criticized for having a surly and difficult personality and was often scapegoated for Kerry's loss. Kerry considered the criticism of her unfair and praised her work. After the <b>Kerry</b> <b>campaign,</b> Cutter returned to work for Kennedy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kerry's</b> <b>campaign</b> {{began the}} process of searching for a vice-presidential nominee, {{sometimes}} called the [...] "Veepstakes", shortly after Kerry's Super Tuesday victories. Kerry named Jim Johnson, former advisor to Vice President Walter F. [...] "Fritz" [...] Mondale, {{as the head of}} a vice-presidential search process.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Kerry's</b> <b>campaign</b> advisor Bob Shrum later {{reported}} in Time magazine that Kerry said {{he wished he}} had never picked Edwards, and the two have since stopped speaking to each other. Edwards said in his concession speech, [...] "You can be disappointed, but you cannot walk away. This fight has just begun." ...|$|R
50|$|On July 22, 2004, {{campaign}} {{staff were}} opening mail at <b>Kerry's</b> <b>campaign</b> headquarters in Washington, D.C. when white powder {{fell out of}} one package at around 5 p.m. on the eighth floor, where the campaign has its fund-raising and human resources departments, along with a financial company unrelated to the campaign.|$|R

50|$|During {{the last}} weeks of the campaign, however, the polls began to {{indicate}} {{a significant change in}} support.
