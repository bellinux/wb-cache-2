50|$|The {{manufacture}} of espadrilles is generally {{more complex than}} that of sandals. The jute soles are the most critical part. The jute twines are first machine-braided. These braids are then manually formed {{into the shape of}} the sole and <b>hydraulically</b> <b>pressed</b> with heat to form the final shape and completed with vertical stitching. These basic soles are then vulcanized underneath. EVA foam or wooden heels are glued in place and more jute braids are wrapped around it to complete the soles. Uppers of different styles are then built on the jute soles to complete the espadrille.|$|R

Like their predecessors, encaustic clay tiles, they derive their name from the term [...] "encaustic" [...] which is an art term used for metal enameling that uses a type of lost wax procedure. They have this name because of the intricate patterns and designs that mimic the encaustic enameling process. Cement tiles are not fired; there is no glaze layer {{on the surface of}} the tile. They derive their durability from the combination of finely dehydrated ground Portland cement layer and a more coarse layer of sand and cement.

5000|$|The Model 99 rifle is {{a single}} shot bullpup rifle that debuted in 1999. Its primary market was long range {{competitive}} target shooters and in 2001 a shooter set a world record at 1,000-yards with the M99 by shooting a 5-shot group which measured 4.09″. The M99 features a hard-core construction, 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion, match-quality trigger design, heat-treated steel M1913 rail, match grade barrel, and S-7 tool steel bolt. It has three quick assembly pins, allowing it to be assembled or disassembled {{without the use of}} tools. The Model 99 is very accurate because of its heavy contour barrel. With the [...]416 round, the accuracy and increased velocity compared to [...]50 BMG enables greater long range precision. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. To make the rifle very reliable and easy to maintain, the Model 99 has just three moving parts: the extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly. For bench rest shooting, the bi-pod can be detached easily. The design of the trigger is virtually maintenance free. The barrel is locked into the extrusion by being <b>hydraulically</b> <b>pressed,</b> allowing the user to mount a rifle scope on it. The steel gun barrel and the aluminum extrusion surround the cartridge, making the firearm safer.|$|R

5000|$|Coining is a {{cold working}} process similar in other respects to forging, which takes place at {{elevated}} temperature; it uses {{a great deal of}} force to plastically deform a workpiece, so it conforms to a die. Coining can be done using a gear driven press, a mechanical press, or more commonly, a <b>hydraulically</b> actuated <b>press.</b> Coining typically requires higher tonnage presses than stamping, because the workpiece is plastically deformed and not actually cut, as in some other forms of stamping. The coining process is preferred when there is a high tonnage.|$|R

40|$|Zirconia {{toughened}} alumina (ZTA) {{has good}} mechanical properties and {{widely used in}} cutting insert application. Although the ZTA is well known of its good mechanical properties, its still can be improved {{in order to produce}} better properties. It can be done by adding additives as reinforcement such as magnesium oxide (MgO), cerium oxide (CeO 2), titania (TiO 2) and chromia (Cr 2 O 3). The effects of TiO 2 -Cr 2 O 3 addition on the physical properties of ZTA were investigated in this study. The composition of TiO 2 was varied from 0 wt. % to 3. 5 wt. % while Cr 2 O 3 was fixed at 5 wt. %. The starting powder materials were mixed by wet mixing for 30 minutes in acetone. Then the powder mixtures were <b>hydraulically</b> <b>pressed</b> at 260 MPa. The green pellets were sintered at 1600 °C for 1 hour using an electrical furnace in presureless condition. The results were characterized by XRD, density, and also Vickers hardness. The ZTA-Cr 2 O 3 -TiO 2 ceramic composite achieved the highest density of 4. 1 g/cm 3 and Vickers hardness of 1919 HV prior to the addition of 2. 0 wt. % TiO 2. Therefore, it can be decisively concluded that the addition of Cr 2 O 3 -TiO 2 does affected the properties of ZTA...|$|R
40|$|Alumino-silicate {{fireclay}} material was {{found within the}} equatorial region of Ekiti state of Nigeria. From Ijero-Ekiti, fireclay samples were explored, exploited and developed into automobile brake pads. Eight samples were taken from 5 to 30 metres downward at various pits to prevent unwanted foreign materials. Specifically, these samples were examined and found to be characteristically homogeneous in physical, mechanical, mineralogical and chemical composition. 30 per cent of the unwanted foreign materials from the fireclay were technically removed with above 45 micron sieve using a wet sieving method. 70 per cent of the purified clay of less than 45 micron sieve was eventually used as beneficiated {{fireclay material}}. After the purification, sample clay obtained was finally calcined at 15000 C temperature for clay structural stability and prevention of excessive clay shrinkage. The refractory clay material was eventually made into various is batches using a mathematical model. Material composition fomula used was technically based on range of grain particle sizes (30 to 70 per cent) grog or calcined clay; and beneficiated clay {{range of particle sizes}} of 70 to 30 per cent as the binding agent respectively.

40|$|During the {{qualification}} of Frit 202 {{samples for}} the `DWPF Cold Runs`, {{the need for}} a reliable chemical frit standard became apparent. A standard was prepared by obtaining a quantity of Frit 202 and grinding into a fine powder. This material was homogenized as one slurry material volume, spray dried to prevent segregation, and <b>hydraulically</b> <b>pressed</b> into discs. These discs were fired and packaged into eleven sub-lots containing approximately 2, 000 discs per sub-lot. A number of samples were obtained and analyzed by two analytic laboratories. The chemical analyses were carefully reviewed and evaluated by several statistical means. While there were several statistically significant variations between the sub-lots, it is believed that those variations are partially caused by the variability of the analytic method. These discs should provide a reliable standard for future chemical analyses of DWPF Frits similar in comparison to Frit 202. It is recommended that these discs be used as a standard material included with the representative frit sample to the independent chemical analysis laboratory, and the order of use of these standards be from sub-lot eleven to sub-lot four. It is further recommended that the NIST standard material (93 a) be employed along with the 202 standard until confidence in the new standard is gained. The NIST standard should also be used when initial use of a new sub-lot is begun. this procedure should continue {{to the end of the}} DWPF program or such time as the chemical composition of the frit is extensively modified...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} the biochemical composition of junctional feet in skeletal muscle utilizing {{a fraction of}} isolated triad junctions. [3 H]Ouabain entrapment was employed as a specific marker for T-tubules. The integrity of the triad junction was assayed by the isopycnic density of [3 H]ouabain activity (24 - 30 % sucrose for free T-tubules, 38 - 42 % sucrose for intact triads). Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pronase all caused separation of T-tubules from terminal cisternae, indicating that the junction is composed as least in part of protein. Trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolyzed four proteins: the Ca 2 + pump, a doublet 325, 000, 300, 000, and an 80, 000 Mr protein. T-tubules which had been labeled covalently with 125 I were joined to unlabeled terminal cisternae by treatment with K cacodylate. The reformed triads were separated from free T-tubules and then severed by passage through a French <b>press.</b> When <b>terminal</b> cisternae were separated from T-tubules, some 125 I label was transferred from the labeled T-tubules to the unlabeled terminal cisternae. Gel electrophoresis showed that, although T-tubules were originally labeled in {{a large number of}} different proteins, only a single protein doublet was significantly labeled in the originally unlabeled terminal cisternae. This protein pair had molecular weights of 325, 000 and 300, 000 daltons. Transfer of label did not occur to a substantial degree without K cacodylate treatment. We propose that the transfer of 125 I label from T-tubules to terminal cisternae during reformation and breakage of the triad junction is a property of the protein which spans the gap between T-tubules and terminal cisternae...|$|R
