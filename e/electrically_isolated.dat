25|$|Resistive {{opto-isolator}} (RO), {{also called}} photoresistive opto-isolator, vactrol (after a genericized trademark introduced by Vactec, Inc. in the 1960s), analog opto-isolator or lamp-coupled photocell, is an optoelectronic device {{consisting of a}} source and detector of light, which are optically coupled and <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> from each other. The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|E
25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a power pack consisting of a transformer and rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E
25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated.</b> This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|E

50|$|The {{metal tab}} is often {{connected}} electrically {{to the internal}} circuitry. This does not normally pose a problem when using isolated heatsinks, but an electrically-insulating pad or sheet {{may be required to}} <b>electrically</b> <b>isolate</b> the component from the heatsink if the heatsink is electrically conductive, grounded or otherwise non-isolated. Many materials may be used to <b>electrically</b> <b>isolate</b> the TO-220 package, some of which have the added benefit of high thermal conductivity.|$|R
25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|Within the chamber, <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> {{cylindrical}} electrodes are placed, whose length {{varies with}} the distance along the pipe. The length of each electrode {{is determined by the}} frequency and power of the driving power source {{and the nature of the}} particle to be accelerated, with shorter segments near the source and longer segments near the target. The mass of the particle has a large effect on the length of the cylindrical electrodes; for example an electron is considerably lighter than a proton and so will generally require a much smaller section of cylindrical electrodes as it accelerates very quickly. Likewise, because its mass is so small, electrons have much less kinetic energy than protons at the same speed. Because of the possibility of electron emissions from highly charged surfaces, the voltages used in the accelerator have an upper limit, so this can't be as simple as just increasing voltage to match increased mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E
50|$|The {{metal tab}} is often {{connected}} electrically {{to the internal}} circuitry, ground and supply connection are common. This does not normally pose a problem when using isolated heatsinks, but an electrically-insulating pad or sheet {{may be required to}} <b>electrically</b> <b>isolate</b> the component from the heatsink if the heatsink is grounded or otherwise non-isolated.

2500|$|A {{significant}} contribution to the PCC design was noise reduction with extensive use of rubber in springs and other components to prevent rattle, vibration, and thus noise and to provide a level of comfort not known before.

2500|$|Early tubes {{used the}} {{filament}} as the cathode, {{this is called}} a [...] "directly heated" [...] tube. Most modern tubes are [...] "indirectly heated" [...] by a [...] "heater" [...] element inside a metal tube that is the cathode. The heater is <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> from the surrounding cathode and simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for thermionic emission of electrons. The electrical isolation allows all the tubes' heaters to be supplied from a common circuit (which can be AC without inducing hum) while allowing the cathodes in different tubes to operate at different voltages. [...] H. J. Round invented the indirectly heated tube around 1913.|$|E
2500|$|The {{armature}} may be {{an integral}} part of the projectile, but it may also be configured to accelerate a separate, <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> or non-conducting projectile. Solid, metallic sliding conductors are often the preferred form of railgun armature but [...] "plasma" [...] or [...] "hybrid" [...] armatures can also be used. A plasma armature is formed by an arc of ionised gas that is used to push a solid, non-conducting payload in a similar manner to the propellant gas pressure in a conventional gun. A hybrid armature uses a pair of [...] "plasma" [...] contacts to interface a metallic armature to the gun rails. Solid armatures may also [...] "transition" [...] into hybrid armatures, typically after a particular velocity threshold is exceeded.|$|E
2500|$|A {{superior}} solution, and {{one which}} allowed each cathode to [...] "float" [...] at a different voltage, {{was that of the}} indirectly heated cathode: a [...] cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a [...] "heater", and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum. In the 1930s indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery-powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes.|$|E

2500|$|Some low-quality {{keyboards}} also suffer {{problems with}} rollover (that is, when multiple keys pressed {{at the same}} time, or when keys are pressed so fast that multiple keys are down within the same milliseconds). Early [...] "solid-state" [...] keyswitch keyboards did not have this problem because the keyswitches are <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> from each other, and early [...] "direct-contact" [...] keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had [...] "n-key" [...] rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) {{at the same time}} in a [...] "direct contact" [...] keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth [...] "phantom" [...] key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. [...] "Three-key" [...] rollover, also called [...] "phantom key blocking" [...] or [...] "phantom key lockout", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and games (designed for multiple key presses).|$|E
2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is a floating gate (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is <b>electrically</b> <b>isolated</b> by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM). Counter-intuitively, placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E
