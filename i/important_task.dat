Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most <b>important</b> <b>task</b> was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most <b>important</b> <b>task,</b> was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.|$|E
5|$|The mission's planet finding {{component}} {{was set up}} {{to serve}} as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets. SIM Lite was to perform an <b>important</b> <b>task</b> that these missions will not be capable of: determining planet masses. Another task that the SIM was envisioned to perform for the future missions will include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets. With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star–planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial (and other) planets SIM has detected.|$|E
5|$|With a large {{construction}} programme, engineers made up 29.3% of Michaelmas Task Force. An Engineer Section headquarters was organised on 24 December 1943, {{only nine}} days before landing, consisting of five officers and five enlisted men. Later a jeep and a driver were {{borrowed from the}} 114th Engineer Battalion to provide transportation. The officers did not know each other and therefore were unaware of each other's capabilities. As it turned out, {{none of them had}} experience with amphibious operations, and only one had experience in airbase construction, although this was to be their most <b>important</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} to prioritize tasks during the planning event. This means the tasks {{are added to}} the board with marked priorities. It helps the team members to know which tasks should be completed first and which can be completed later.

5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an <b>important</b> <b>task</b> for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E
5|$|Iwadare {{was asked}} to create memorable melodies, but found {{creating}} suitable tracks difficult as many of his initial pieces were thrown out. For Kameoka, recording the live orchestral segments proved a time-consuming and difficult business: each element of a track was recorded separately, then mixed into a single track, then each orchestral element needed to be adjusted for speed and tone so they lined up correctly. According to Mitsuda, the live recording of music spanned seven full sessions, estimated by him as being the largest-scale musical production for a video game to that date. He was entirely dedicated to orchestration and recording for four months. Mitsuda was tasked with creating the music for the game's 2010 reveal trailer, which he knew was an <b>important</b> <b>task</b> {{as it would have}} an international audience. He estimated that around 150 people in total worked on the score throughout its creation.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with Edward III, and accompanied him abroad on a diplomatic mission in 1329. That same year he was sent on an embassy to negotiate a marriage alliance with King Philip VI of France. His most <b>important</b> <b>task,</b> however, came in connection with a mission to the Papacy in Avignon. The young king—along with his government—was under the dominance of his mother Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, who had been responsible for the deposition of the king's father. Montagu explained the king's situation, and Pope John XXII asked for a special signal that assure him that he was dealing with the king in person. After Montagu's return, Richard Bury, Keeper of the Privy Seal, wrote to inform the pope that only letters containing the words pater sancte (holy father), in Edward's own handwriting, were indeed from the king. Only Edward, Bury and Montagu were party to the scheme.|$|E

40|$|The {{academic}} deanship {{is among}} the least studied and most misunderstood positions in the academy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the functions that experienced deans found most important. This survey of education deans used a paired-comparison method. The survey was administered to all the deans/chairs of education who were members of the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education (AACTE). The survey was e-mailed to 564 deans and chairs. The usable return rate was 29. 0 %. Deans selected the most <b>important</b> <b>tasks</b> from 20 dean tasks identified in the literature. The most <b>important</b> <b>tasks</b> were promoting quality teaching, hiring strong faculty, and developing effective partnerships with schools. The least <b>important</b> <b>tasks</b> were keeping central administration well informed, promoting staff development, and remaining current in his/her own discipline. Deans indicated it was more important to work well with their faculty than with those in central administration.
