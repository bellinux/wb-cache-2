The radiation levels near the <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> replacement valves reach 4.7 millisieverts per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.|$|E

40|$|For {{the present}} {{specifications}} for membrane <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> are partially insufficient or {{can hardly be}} compared, a new extensive test method {{was developed by the}} Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA). With this test method comparative statements can be made concerning the rinseup behaviour, the particle retentina and the reaction of <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> on pressure shocks. All tested <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> do not show any discernible penetration of added particles. In contrast to that, the different reactions of various <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> on pressure shocks were striking.

However, some manufacturers (especially of ceramic candle filters) incorporate a high-performance activated carbon core inside the ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> that reduces organic & metallic contaminants.

Volume flow rate relate with pressure of the water that flow through pipe system. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> function as a media that reduced pressure from the water flow and call pressure drop.

40|$|Large volume (102 – 103 L) {{seawater}} {{samples are}} routinely processed {{to investigate the}} partitioning of particle reactive radionuclides and Ra between solution and size-fractionated suspended particulate matter. One {{of the most frequently}} used methods to preconcentrate these nuclides from such large volumes involves extraction onto three <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> (a prefilter for particulate species and two MnO 2 -coated filters for dissolved species) connected in series. This method assumes that the extraction efficiency is uniform for both MnO 2 -coated cartridges, that no dissolved species are removed by the prefilter, and that any adsorbed radionuclides are not desorbed from the MnO 2 -coated cartridges during filtration. In this study, we utilized 234 Th-spiked coastal seawater and deionized water to address the removal of dissolved Th onto prefilters and MnO 2 -coated <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Experimental results provide the first data that indicate (1) a small fraction of dissolved Th (3 ̆c 6...|$|R

50|$|The Eliminator {{is a small}} {{suction fan}} with an {{activated}} carbon <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> that is placed within the flush tank.

The odors are drawn upwards through the independent overflow pipe within the cistern and then pass through the activated carbon filter where the odors are totally eliminated. It is fully automatic with a robust auto sensor system as standard and comes complete with an AC/DC mains adapter or alternatively with a rechargeable battery pack. In 2015, The Eliminator was rebranded as The Odorless and started a Kickstarter project. It successfully raised $33,633 of its pledged of $27,000 goal.|$|E

50|$|The {{condensed}} and pressurized liquid refrigerant is next {{routed through}} the receiver-drier, that is, a one way desiccant and <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> that both dehydrates the refrigerant and compressor lubricant oil mixture {{in order to}} remove any residual water content (which would become ice inside the expansion valve and therefore clog it) that the vacuum done prior to the charging process didn't manage to remove from the system, and filters {{it in order to}} remove any solid particles carried by the mixture, and then through a thermal expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator coil in the passenger compartment.|$|E
50|$|Similar to TOC, SEM {{particle}} analysis {{represents a}} lower cost alternative to the expensive online measurements and therefore it is commonly a method of choice in less critical applications. SEM analysis can provide particle counting for particle size down to 50 nm, which generally is in-line with the capability of online instruments. The test involves installation of the SEM capture <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> on the UPW sampling port for sampling on the membrane disk with the pore size equal or smaller than the target size of the UPW particles. The filter is then transferred to the SEM microscope where its surface is scanned for detection and identification of the particles. The main disadvantage of SEM analysis is long sampling time. Depending on the pore size and the pressure in the UPW system, the sampling time can be between one week and one month. However, typical robustness and stability of the particle filtration systems allow for successful applications of the SEM method. Application of Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) provides compositional analysis of the particles, making SEM also helpful for systems with on-line particle counters.|$|E
5000|$|A {{disc filter}} {{is a type}} of water filter used {{primarily}} in irrigation, similar to a screen filter, except that the <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> is made of a number of plastic discs stacked {{on top of each other}} like a pile of poker chips. Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps. The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The water passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind. The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the filtering element is able to retain. Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water. This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points. [...] The discs are typically color coded to denote the level of filtration. [...] Filtration quality is usually measured in microns, based on the smallest size particle filtered. The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest. [...] Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent mesh size of a comparable screen filter. Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600. [...] When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.|$|E

50|$|Beer {{filtration}} is {{also common}} {{on a small}} scale.

While they lack the sophisticated equipment of large-scale breweries, they can achieve satisfactory results using canister filters with successive, replaceable <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> or pads. Most homebrewers will only filter their beer down to 5 µm to remove the majority of yeast and sediment, although some may filter their beer down to 1.0 or 0.5 µm.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this CRADA between Lockheed Martin and Cummins Engine Company was to develop fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (SiC) composite materials for use as diesel engine particulate traps. Chemical vapor deposition techniques were used to partially densify and rigidize a thin fibrous substrate and produce the porous SiC- based filter. Microwave energy was used to directly couple to the deposited SiC to uniformly heat the filter and oxidize the collected carbon particulates. For commercial usage particulate traps must: (1) filter carbon particulates from a high temperature diesel exhaust at an acceptably low backpressure, (2) survive thousands of thermal transients due to regeneration or cleaning of the filter by oxidizing the collected carbon, (3) be durable and reliable over the expected life of the filter (300, 000 miles or 10, 000 hours), and (4) provide a low overall operating cost which is competitive with other filtering techniques. The development efforts performed {{as part of this}} CRADA have resulted in a very promising new technology for Cummins Engine Company. Ceramic fiber based filter papers were developed at Fleetguard, Inc., (a Cummins Subsidiary) and used to produce the spiral wound, corrugated <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Optimized SiC coatings were developed at Lockheed Martin which couple with 2. 45 GHz microwaves. Prototype particulate <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> fabricated at Fleetguard and rigidized at Lockheed Martin performed well in single cylinder engine tests at Cummins.
