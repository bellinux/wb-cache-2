50|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} is used {{to examine}} parts of the gastrointestinal tract that cannot be seen {{with other types of}} endoscopy. Upper endoscopy, also called EGD, uses a camera attached to a long flexible tube to view the esophagus, the stomach {{and the beginning of the}} first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. A colonoscope, inserted through the rectum, can view the colon and the distal portion of the small intestine, the terminal ileum. These two types of endoscopy cannot visualize the majority of the middle portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the small intestine. Capsule endoscopy is useful when disease is suspected in the small intestine, and can sometimes diagnose sources of occult bleeding visible microscopically only or causes of abdominal pain such as Crohn's disease, or peptic ulcers. Capsule endoscopy can be used to diagnose problems in the small intestine, but unlike EGD or colonoscopy it cannot treat pathology that may be discovered. Capsule endoscopy transfers the captured images wirelessly to an <b>external</b> <b>receiver</b> worn by the patient using one of appropriate frequency bands. The collected images are then transferred to a computer for diagnosis, review and display. A transmitted radio-frequency signal can be used to accurately estimate the location of the capsule and to track it in real time inside the body and gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

Existing methods {{to measure the}} solar flux density in the receiver aperture face new challenges regarding the receiver size.

40|$|Various {{physiological}} parameters can {{be monitored}} non-invasively using wireless biotelemetry links. The development of sophisticated ultra low power consuming transceivers allows {{the transmission of}} large amounts of data {{from the inside of}} the body to an <b>external</b> <b>receiver</b> in real time at microwave frequencies. Antenna impedance matching is crucial for obtaining an acceptable propagation link budget in a wireless telemetry link. The dielectric properties of biological tissue induce detuning to transceiver antennas when implanted into the body. To counteract detuning problems, implant antennas are coated with biocompatible insulating material. The study investigates the propagation losses of a wireless communication link at different insulation thicknesses of medical grade silicone in the Industrial-Scientific-Medical (ISM) radio band at 2. 45 GHz. The wireless link consisted of an implantable unit which was placed between two pads of tissue substitute material and an <b>external</b> <b>receiver</b> which was connected to a laptop. Predefined data packets were transmitted from the implant, the received packets were analyzed, packet errors and packet losses were logged and the received signal strength indicator values (RSSI) were recorded. Our results showed that the mean RSSI values of insulated transmitter antennas - embedded in tissue equivalent material - provide more safety distance to critical receiver sensitivity level than uncoated antennas. The conducted measurements let us conclude that with increasing thickness of the insulation layer, the antenna becomes less sensitive to detuning by adjacent tissue substitute material. Therefore tuned antennas are less influenced by the surrounding tissue after implantation...|$|E

Therefore, it is necessary optimize the design of these receivers. The aim of this work is to study the thermal behavior of a new design of central receiver. This new <b>external</b> <b>receiver</b> is composed by several vertical panels formed by bayonet tubes. Each bayonet tube presents an inner tube and an outer tube concentric to the internal one. Both are joined in one side by a bayonet end-cap. The heat transfer fluid flows through the inner tube and the annular {{gap between the two}} tubes. In addition, the outer tube will be coated in its external surface by a material of high absorptivity of the solar radiation. In absence of experimental data of the receivers both concepts of <b>external</b> <b>receiver,</b> traditional and bayonet, have been characterized using simplified numerical simulations.
