Data on procedure duration, number of passes, angiographic findings, type of stent retriever used, and expertise of the operators were collected. Successful recanalization was defined as grade 3 or 2 b modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia recanalization accomplished in up to three passes. Univariate and multivariate subgroup analyses were conducted to control for the confounding variables of prior thrombolysis, location of occlusion, and operator expertise. Results Successful recanalization with the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> was achieved in 89. 2 % of thrombectomies (91 of 102) versus 67. 9 % (55 of 81) achieved with the non-balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> (P =. 0004). The one-pass thrombectomy rate with the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> was significantly higher than for that with the non-balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> (63. 7 % [65 of 102] vs 35. 8 % [29 of 81], respectively; P =. 001).

40|$|Ponangi Udaya Prashant CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, India Abstract: Appropriate <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> {{selection}} is a paramount requirement for successful angioplasty of complex coronary artery lesions. When choosing an appropriate <b>guide</b> <b>catheter,</b> the diameter {{and shape of}} the guide are the most important factors to be considered, and depend on the anatomy of the coronary artery and backup support required to cross the obstructive lesion. In turn, backup support of the <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> depends on the size and terminal shape of the guide rather than the route of intervention chosen and can be expressed mathematically. Many radial route-specific <b>guide</b> <b>catheters</b> have been developed by introducing extratertiary curves and angles to previous existing femoral guides. Backup support can be enhanced by various maneuvers and innovations like the “mother-child” technique. Computer-aided aortogram analysis can help in choosing the right catheter for anomalous coronary arteries.

50|$|Endovascular coiling {{is usually}} {{performed}} by an interventional neuroradiologist {{with the patient}} under general anaesthesia. The whole procedure is performed under fluoroscopic imaging guidance. A <b>guiding</b> <b>catheter</b> is inserted through the femoral artery and advanced to a site close to the aneurysm after which angiography is performed to localize and assess the aneurysm. After this, a microcatheter is navigated into the aneurysm.|$|E
50|$|The {{coronary}} guidewire, {{which is}} an extremely thin wire with a radio-opaque flexible tip, is inserted through the <b>guiding</b> <b>catheter</b> and into the coronary artery. While visualizing again by real-time X-ray imaging, the cardiologist guides the wire through the coronary artery {{to the site of}} the stenosis or blockage. The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage. The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently manipulating the end that sits outside the patient through twisting of the guidewire.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} is {{performed by a}} Vascular Interventional Radiologist under local anesthesia. Access is commonly through the radial or femoral artery via the wrist or groin, respectively. After anesthetizing the skin over the artery of choice, the artery is accessed by a needle puncture. An access sheath and guidewire are then introduced into the artery. In order to select the uterine vessels for subsequent embolization, a <b>guiding</b> <b>catheter</b> is commonly used and placed into the uterine artery under x-ray fluoroscopy guidance. Once {{at the level of}} the uterine artery an angiogram with contrast is performed to confirm placement of the catheter and the embolizing agent (spheres or beads) is released.Blood flow to the fibroid will slow significantly or cease altogether, causing the Fibroid to shrink. This process can be repeated for as many arteries as are supplying the fibroid. This is done bilaterally from the initial puncture site as unilateral uterine artery embolizations have a high risk of failure. With both uterine arteries occluded, abundant collateral circulation prevents the uterus from necrosing and the fibroids decrease in size and vascularity as they receive the bulk of the embolization material. The procedure can be performed in a hospital, surgical center or office setting and commonly take no longer than an hour to perform. Post-procedurally if access was gained via a femoral artery puncture an occlusion device can be used to hasten healing of the puncture site and the patient is asked to remain with the leg extended for several hours but many patients are discharged the same day with some remaining in the hospital for a single day admission for pain control and observation. If access was gained via the radial artery the patient will be able to get off of the table and walk out immediately following their procedure. The {{procedure is}} not a surgical intervention, and allows the uterus to be kept in place avoiding many of the associated surgical complications.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} proximal flow control on efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in an in vitro middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Three independent variables, including clot type, device (Merci Retriever, Solitaire FR, and Trevo devices), and use of a balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter,</b> were used to ascertain the impact of proximal flow control on the size and number of distal emboli generated during thrombectomy. Secondary end points were the recanalization rate and amount of flow restored. RESULTS: Use of the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> during thrombectomy of the fragile, hard clot significantly reduced the formation of large distal emboli with a diameter 3 ̆e 1 mm, regardless of the device used (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Applying aspiration via the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> {{in place of the}} conventional <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69. 2 +/- 27. 3 and 45. 5 +/- 22. 8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> was used (1. 5 versus 1. 1).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using a 6. 5 Fr sheathless <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> as a default system in transradial (TRA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: TRA PCI has been shown to reduce mortality rates through a reduction in access site related bleeding complications compared with procedures performed though a femoral approach. Complications associated with the TRA route increase with the size of sheath used. These complications may be reduced by the use of a sheathless <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> system (Asahi Intecc, Japan) that is 1 - 2 Fr sizes smaller in diameter than the corresponding introducer sheath. METHODS: We performed PCI in 100 consecutive cases using 6. 5 Fr sheathless guides to determine the procedural success, rates of symptomatic radial spasm and radial occlusion. RESULTS: Procedural success using the 6. 5 Fr sheathless <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> system was 100 % with no cases requiring conversion to a conventional <b>guide</b> and <b>catheter</b> system.

40|$|Aims: Optimal ostial {{seating and}} {{adequate}} back-up of <b>guide</b> <b>catheters</b> {{are required for}} challenging percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The GuideLiner™ (GL) (Vascular Solutions Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> extension system that provides active back-up support by deep coronary intubation. We aimed to assess feasibility and safety of GL-use in routine clinical practice. Methods and results: We prospectively recorded patient and procedural details, technical success, and in-hospital outcome of 65 consecutive patients undergoing “ 5 -in- 6 ” Fr GL-facilitated PCI of 70 target vessels. The GL was mainly used for PCI of complex coronary lesions: 97 % (68 / 70) had American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) lesion types B 2 /C; 53 % (37 / 70) were distally located; and 23 % (17 / 70) were heavily calcified.
