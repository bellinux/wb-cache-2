30|$|The Uppsala model {{uses only}} two factors (i.e., market knowledge, market commitment), {{which may be}} {{insufficient}} to explain international expansion (Forsgren 2002). There is a compelling need for a more in-depth investigation of the firm-, retail-, and market-specific antecedents that may influence the international market <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> apparel retailers. This study posits that the Uppsala model can better explain current international market involvement by incorporating antecedents related to SME apparel retail firms and current domestic apparel markets. In this study, firm age, product uniqueness, and domestic growth opportunity are selected as key influences. Firm age can affect international market involvement (Chen and Sternquist 1995). Unlike manufacturing firms, apparel retailers differentiate themselves largely through intangible assets (Quinn and Doherty 2000); thus, their international market involvement may depend on the product’s being sufficiently unique. Another antecedent, firms’ perceived domestic growth opportunities, can influence their international market involvement because firms that perceive limited domestic growth {{are more likely to}} expand into international markets (Lopez and Fan 2009).|$|R
30|$|As the {{tradition}} behavioral learning theory, the Uppsala model emphasizes {{the role of}} organizational knowledge in the internationalization process that has received much attention across the large manufacturing sector and the small export sector (e.g., Autio et al. 2000). The Uppsala model, however, has been criticized because its two explanatory factors may be insufficient to understand international market involvement (Forsgren 2002). Moreover, the notion of emphasis on experiential knowledge is too deterministic because a firm can also learn from indirect learning sources (e.g., observation, network) (Forsgren 2002). Considering that small retail firms have limited financial resources and experience, their market knowledge sources might be {{different from those of}} large firms. Nevertheless, few studies have examined whether possible indirect sources influence market knowledge. To fill this gap, {{there is a need for}} a more in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect learning sources to build foreign market knowledge and the antecedents that may influence the international market <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> apparel retailers.|$|R

40|$|In {{a number}} of cities around the world the {{adoption}} of climate policies {{has been driven by}} partnerships between multiple actors from the private sector, NGOs, and academia. With this paper we investigate the formulation and implementation processes of climate policy in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. We argue that the trend of multiactor and multilevel participation in climate policy making, detected in developed countries, can be observed in a major city from an emerging economy. We further argue that the ample engagement of actors driving the adoption of climate policies might not be reflected in policy implementation. Although São Paulo's Municipal Climate Law was adopted after a participatory process, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the transport sector have been largely absent from its implementation. We propose four reasons for further <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> and suggest that participation of relevant actors and sectors is necessary in both the formulation and the implementation of climate policies...|$|E

40|$|Today, small-medium sized {{enterprises}} (SMEs) collectively {{contribute to}} {{the largest percentage of}} job creation in OECD countries. SMEs have become increasingly international {{since the turn of the}} century despite being smaller in size in comparison to large multinational firms, and notably, exporting is the most favoured mode of international market entry utilised by SMEs in their internationalisation strategy. Governments around the world have acknowledged the importance of export promotion and have employed policies that are targeted at increasing the export activity of SMEs. However, in many countries, the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in export operations remains rather low. Within Australia, for example, only about one-third of local SMEs are exporting and this raises an important question as to why there is such a huge percentage of non-exporters. Much scholarly research that focuses on this problem has concentrated on the broad concept of 'export barriers' that act as obstacles to a firm's export development. This paper takes a different approach to previous studies and proposes that a firm's resistance to commence exporting can be better understood through an analysis of the behavioural decision process during its pre-export state. Using a sample of Australian SMEs, the factors that are important in preventing a firm’s initial export commencement decision are categorised and discussed through the use of factor analysis...|$|E
40|$|Uganda's {{economy has}} great potential. Endowed with {{significant}} natural resources, including ample fertile land, regular rainfall, and mineral deposits, it appeared poised for {{rapid economic growth}} and development at independence.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the importance}} of collaboration and networks in international entrepreneurship by distinguishing entrepreneurial small and medium firms (SMEs). SMEs, which characterized by fast internationalisation of their activity {{from the very beginning}} of the establishment despite limited resources, knowledge, international experience, are called born global. Such firms distinguish in entrepreneurial orientation, innovativeness, orientation towards niches, competitiveness and proactiveness towards international opportunities. The paper argues that the accelerator <b>of</b> entrepreneurial <b>SMEs</b> is their being in networks. Active interaction with customers, suppliers and external partners is inseparable from entrepreneurial orientation in pursuing for new possibilities in the market. The empirical data have been obtained from internationalized Lithuanian high-tech firms operating in the information technology sector.

Managers of foreign firms stated that they work with students or to a small extent with single professors rather that with faculties or institutes. Asked for the innovation model for improving agrarial science in the western regions professors of Tsinghua would answer that the best knowledge and technology transfer model would be to send experts to the regions. In IMAU, researchers {{would say that the}} impact factor is a politically constructed figure and cooperation with local firms is in general a good thing but science-to-science research in one discipline must be the priority for the time being. Foreign top universities were the preferred partner (interviews CASTED, Tsinghua and IMAU Universities carried out by the authors 2015 – 2016). Proposals to set up Triple Helix-based innovation clusters that anticipated university–industry and local government interactions in the zones were rejected by the high technology zone managers and managers made a settlement plan for firms according to sectorial compartments. Meeting and interaction was planned in leisurement and sport facilities (interviews by the authors, 2015 – 2016 : Beijing consulting company and TEDA). Companies like Huawei spend a large amount of money on research and interact with universities and research labs in countries outside China. However, joint programs for joint research projects of Chinese research labs and local industry based on matching funding in China are not (yet?) an innovation policy instrument (Gebhardt 2016; interviews, CASTED).

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} globalised world, firms generally {{have become more}} internationalised utilising a range of different modes of operation. In the case of small-medium sized enterprises (SMEs), exporting is the favoured mode of international market entry, {{at least in the}} early stages of internationalisation, and many governments have supported SME exports through export promotion policies because of the importance of SMEs in employment creation. However, in spite of this policy focus, in most countries, the proportional <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in exporting remains low, which raises an important question as to what factors are inhibiting firms that are successful domestically from exporting. In addressing this question, much scholarly research has focused on the broad concept of ‘export barriers’.

This topic is of great relevance for European Union which aims to stimulate a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in each of its region {{to come out of}} the actual crisis with the launch of a new set of territorial policies: the “Research and regional Innovation Strategies for the Smart Specialization”. This work deals with the inclusion of SMEs when implementing those RIS 3. We present several contributions to enhance a true <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> within the RIS 3 dynamic. We highlight first the potentialities of the Collaborative Business Model dynamics as a suitable approach to support the collective participation of networks of SMEs in the definition of the RIS 3 orientations. Secondly we present the design of a collaborative platform called WeKeyInnovation (WKI), accessible online to share information about innovation tools or devices and which is progressively enriched by all the regional “entrepreneurs”. By collecting qualified empirical data WKI is designed to be a dynamic observatory of innovation processes within regional enterprises. This collaborative platform is settled to be the regional online community which will support the knowledge sharing of actors dedicated to the innovation at regional level. By being also a catalyst of regional “entrepreneurs” interactions, WKI facilitates the identification of potential partners and boost their adequate matching before to collectively engage in CBM processes. The final goal is to implement WKI as a transversal toolkit supporting a new framework of innovation at regional level which will be useful both for the collaboration of SMEs within networks and for institutional actors to help them in the launch of the RIS 3 insuring the full inclusion of regional SMES...|$|E

In the development of policy relating to the tourism sector international organizations and tourism scholarship on collaboration and partnerships exhort governments to enter into partnerships with the private sector. One stakeholder that is often omitted is, however, the group of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Only {{a limited amount of}} work has been undertaken outside the developed world and sub-Sahara in particular, on issues relating to the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in tourism policy. In this investigation, a qualitative explorative study was conducted with the aim of providing interpretative and evaluative knowledge on this phenomena. Based on purposive sampling forty key informants of various backgrounds and from different locations in Namibia participated in the study. The results of this research on Namibia contribute to the limited body of literature and knowledge concerning the participation of SMEs in the formulation of tourism policies. The study provides an analysis of the complexity of issues surrounding SME participation in policy formulation. It gives descriptions of the policy process in order to unravel the interaction between the various policy actors, their attitudes and behaviours. The major findings of the study are that in Namibia SMEs are involved in the policy process only in an ad hoc manner. Not only are they less knowledgeable about the policy process and policy content but also they are ignorant of the rules of engagement. The SMEs and interest groups respond to policy formulation as an end goal. The study recommends that SME incorporation in tourism policy formulation should be based on a number of overarching principles and approaches. It is argued SME involvement should be through consultation and empowerment. In addition, an important aspect of local empowerment is the impartation of skills and knowledge that enable SMEs to participate effectively in decision-making beginning with the local level...|$|E

30|$|Firms are {{operating}} {{in an economy}} that is becoming increasingly global. The worldwide reduction of trade and investment barriers through the World Trade Organization and the establishment of regional economic cooperation agreements such as the European Union have diminished barriers for SMEs and new ventures to become internationally active. Also, technological advancements (including the widespread use of Internet and e-mail) and falling transportation costs have resulted in enhanced information flows between countries which facilitate small and new venture internationalization (Autio 2005; Reynolds 1997 a. It has, for example, become easier for small and new ventures to find information about foreign markets and about clients abroad, to communicate with foreign partners, and to coordinate various activities across borders. An increasingly global economy presents firms with both opportunities and threats (Greenaway et al. 2008). Substantial opportunities arise for small and new ventures, such as to expand sales or business activities abroad, to target specific international niches, or to access advanced technologies abroad. According to Feenstra and Hanson 2005, “Buy low, sell high” logic leads economists to comparative advantage theory. Comparative advantage means the comparison of relative price differences between nations to explain the pattern of trade. Entrepreneurship, as measured by various indicators such as start-up activity rates or the increase in business ownership, {{plays an important role in}} national economies (van Stel 2006). Entrepreneurship is considered to be an important mechanism for national economic development, e.g., through its contribution to the generation of employment and innovation (Acs and Audretsch 2003; Autio 1994; Baumol 2002; Carree and Thurik 2003; Wennekers and Thurik 1999; Schumpeter, 1934). However, considerable differences exist between countries in the extent to which entrepreneurship contributes positively to national economic development. To gain insight into the factors that affect the emergence of entrepreneurship and into the economic outcomes of various types of entrepreneurship, the significance of entrepreneurship for national economies is important in considering cross-border entrepreneurship or the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> and new ventures in the international economy despite environmental forces that limits firms’ performance outside their regions of operation. Cross-border activities, such as exports, are an important means through which small and new ventures are able to create value, to generate growth, and to access new knowledge and technologies abroad (Yeoh 2004). Nowadays, the internationalization of SMEs and new ventures is both expanding and accelerating, which is likely to further contribute to a greater number of economic actors pursuing foreign markets (Hessels 2007). The expansion and acceleration of cross-border entrepreneurship should be considered in the light of substantial changes that took place in the past decades and that resulted in a reduction of transaction costs for undertaking international business. Threats may result from increased foreign competition (Acs et al. 2003), which may provide a greater necessity for small and new firms to look beyond national borders to survive or grow in complex business environment depending on the entrepreneur drive of the business owners (McDougall and Oviatt 2000; Root 1994).|$|E
40|$|Centralization of {{purchasing}} activities is an escalating trend for {{both public and}} private organizations. Organizations are attempting to capture the economies of scale in purchasing prices and process costs by replacing individual purchases done throughout the organization with corporate-wide framework agreements. These benefits are achieved by the formalization {{of purchasing}} processes and channels, e. g. e-procurement, and the reduction in supplier base, developed by the central purchasing unit. But these changes may challenge the other employees used to handling purchases more informally at a local level as well as limit participation of smaller suppliers. To facilitate a scientific treatment of these challenges of centralization, this thesis has three objectives: 1) To examine how organizations can estimate and quantify the cost effects of purchasing centralization, 2) To study what kind of consequences the development of centralized purchasing and the phenomena associated with it have for the suppliers, specifically for the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises as suppliers and 3) To conceptually and empirically analyze the forms and reasons of non-compliant purchasing behavior i. e. maverick buying and what types of measures can be used to reduce such behavior. The thesis consists of four papers which look at the challenges of centralization primarily through the eyes of actors facing the change process, while also addressing the inherent problems of the procurement function as reflected in principal-agent theory. In the first paper of the thesis, “Value of centralization”, the cost effects of centralization on purchasing prices and tendering process costs are estimated. The estimation of process costs is done by surveying the time spent on the tendering process both for the decentralized operating model and the centralized operating model in the Finnish government and estimating the costs of those times. The second type of cost effect, price difference, is estimated by comparing the central framework agreement prices to market prices. The savings potential in both process costs and purchasing prices show that the number of units centralizing their purchasing process and the purchasing volume being pooled {{do not need to be}} very high before economies of scale becoming evident. The second paper, “The involvement of small- and medium-sized enterprises in public procurement: Impact of resource perceptions, electronic systems and enterprise size” investigates what kind of an impact the phenomena related to centralization, i. e. increased use and consolidation of e-systems in procurement and more formalized and burdensome tendering processes, have on SME involvement in public procurement. The results of hypothesis testing using data from a survey conducted among SMEs show that perceived lack of resources especially in legal expertise and administration is associated with low SME involvement in public procurement. By analyzing suppliers to municipalities and state organizations separately, it is also found that lack of electronic systems in order processing and invoicing is related with low <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> especially in state procurement, but not in municipal procurement, which is far behind in its centralization efforts. In the third paper, “Non-compliant work behaviour in purchasing: an exploration of reasons behind maverick buying”, a systematic literature review is used to identify different forms of maverick buying, ranging from unintentional maverick buying to straightforward sabotage. These different forms and reasons are then validated and enriched through a series of in-depth interviews with purchasing professionals. These results are significant as the mere introduction of centralized contracts will not bring the expected benefits of centralization; contract compliance is crucial to achieve these. Only by being able to identify the forms of and the reasons behind maverick buying are organizations able to attack the problem. The last paper, “Maverick buying as an agency problem”, extends the investigation of maverick buying as an agency problem in which the principal is the purchasing department negotiating the contracts for use by the whole organization. The ordering and operative buying is then delegated to the agents i. e. various individuals in the organization. In this research paper Comment [l 1]: Comment [l 2 R 1]: hypotheses on maverick buying as an agency problem of ‘hidden action’ are proposed and tested with survey data from the Finnish Government. Empirical testing shows that maverick buying is related to the two conditions of agency problems: information asymmetry and goal incongruence. Based on the results, traditional governance mechanisms of principal-agent theory are efficient in reducing non-compliant behavior, while governance mechanisms to reduce honest incompetence are efficient in reducing the conditions of the agency problem, specifically information asymmetry...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{of small and}} medium enterprises (SMEs) in promoting economic growth in both developed and developing countries is widely accepted and documented by both scholars and policy makers. Particularly lacking are studies on the {{evidence in support of}} the importance of credit rationing to the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in an emerging economy like South Africa’s. This specific problem, especially in the developing countries, has been identified as the major bottleneck in realising socio-economic potentials <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in those countries. However, one of the major ways of addressing the challenge of inadequate funding that exists within the SME sector is the use of bank credit. This study was therefore undertaken to explore the role of commercial banks in the provision of credit to the SMEs in South Africa. This study focuses {{on the issue of the}} relationship between the banking industry and SMEs. In particular, the problem of credit rationing of, and discrimination against SMEs by commercial banks was investigated. Because credit rationing and finance gaps can stem from imperfections on either supply-side (banks), or demand-side (SMEs), or both, the intention of the study was to examine both of these variables in order to uncover the implications of their relationships. The empirical analysis is based on survey data collected by means of a structured questionnaire which was distributed amongst banks and SME borrowers in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Contrary to the general view that commercial banks are disinclined to provide credit to SMEs, the study found that South African banks are keen to serve the SMEs and are therefore making efforts to penetrate this potentially profitable market segment. However, several obstacles are potentially restricting the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> banks with <b>SMEs</b> in South Africa. The findings revealed that regulations such as the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) and the National Credit Act (NCA) came out strongly as major hindrances of bank financing to SMEs. Furthermore, it was shown that compliance with the NCA was ranked higher than credit history and profitability as a factor hindering the approval <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> loans. - iii - However, by using the structural equation modelling (SEM), the results also show that there is a positive and significant influence of lending technology and collateral on the supply <b>of</b> credit to <b>SMEs.</b> Variables such as creditworthiness, collateral and e-banking were found to have a positive and significant impact on the provision <b>of</b> credit to <b>SMEs</b> by commercial banks. For both the supply- and demand-side analysis, technology came out as the most important predictor <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> access to finance. This means that banks should strive to align their lending techniques with the dynamic technological developments so as to reach as many SMEs as possible even in the geographically dispersed regions. It is anticipated that improving SME access to bank credit could be the key to the growth and sustainability <b>of</b> <b>SMEs,</b> the alleviation <b>of</b> poverty and unemployment; and consequently leading to the growth of the South African economy.

While the projects themselves {{have the potential}} for a significant level of reuse and recycling from decon-struction and demolition, their unique characteristics often prohibit direct application of existing waste management systems, which are typically based on managing waste generated through new material application in new build projects. Moreover, current waste management plans include no stimuli to involve Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for on-site waste management. As SMEs carry out the majority of on-site work as subcontractors, their active involvements will result in more proactive approaches to waste management and enhance project delivery. This paper discusses the interim results of a continuing research aimed at engaging SMEs in the planning processes of waste management through the collaboration between subcontractors and main contractors of retrofitting projects. It introduces a conceptual model for SMEs to proactively plan and manage on-site waste generation for both deconstruction and construction stages, before traditional waste management plans by the main contractor come into place. The model also suggests a collaboration process between SMEs as subcontractors and large companies as the main contractor to improve the <b>involvement</b> and performance <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in waste management of office building retrofit projects...|$|R
