2500|$|The {{need for}} {{instrumentation}} grew with {{the rapidly growing}} central electric power stations after the First World War. [...] Instrumentation was also important for heat treating ovens, chemical plants and refineries. [...] Common instrumentation was for measuring temperature, pressure or flow. [...] Readings were typically recorded on circle charts or strip charts. [...] Until the 1930s control was typically [...] "open loop", meaning {{that it did not}} use feedback. [...] Operators made various adjustments by such means as turning handles on valves. [...] If done from a control room a message could be sent to an operator in the plant by color coded light, letting him know whether to increase or decrease whatever was being controlled. [...] The signal lights were operated by a switchboard, which soon became automated. [...] Automatic control became possible with the <b>feedback</b> <b>controller,</b> which sensed the measured variable, measured the deviation from the setpoint and perhaps the rate of change and time weighted amount of deviation, compared that with the setpoint and automatically applied a calculated adjustment. [...] A stand-alone controller may use a combination of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electronic analogs to manipulate the controlled device. [...] The tendency was to use electronic controls after these were developed, but today the tendency is to use a computer to replace individual controllers.|$|E

This paper focuses on the design of a robust backstepping adaptive <b>feedback</b> linearization <b>controller</b> (FLC) for internal combustion (IC) engine in presence of uncertainties. In order to provide high performance nonlinear methodology, <b>feedback</b> linearization <b>controller</b> is selected. Pure <b>feedback</b> linearization <b>controller</b> can be used to control of partly unknown nonlinear dynamic parameters of IC engine.

50|$|The {{deflection}} {{signals are}} caused {{not only by}} sample topography, {{but also by the}} thermal expansion caused by Joule heating. Since AFM has <b>feedback</b> <b>controller</b> with a bandwidth, for example 20 kHz (different AFM may have different bandwidths), the signal below 20 kHz is captured and processed by the <b>feedback</b> <b>controller</b> which then adjusts the z-piezo to image surface topography. Joule heating frequency is kept well above 20 kHz to avoid feedback response and to separate topological and thermal effects. The upper limit of the frequency is limited by the decrease of thermoelastic expansion with the inverse power of the modulation frequency and the frequency characteristics of the cantilever arrangement. A lock-in amplifier is specially tuned to the Joule heating frequency for detecting only the expansion signal and provides the information to an auxiliary Atomic Force Microscopy channel to create the thermal expansion image. Usually expansion signals approximately 0.1 Angstroms start to be detected, although the resolution of SJEM highly depends on the whole system (cantilever, sample surface, etc.).|$|E
40|$|A {{class of}} output <b>feedback</b> <b>controllers</b> capable of {{reducing}} parameter sensitivities and rejecting disturbances and parameter variations is investigated in this thesis. The methodology uses piecewise continous output <b>feedback</b> <b>controllers,</b> generating a sliding output trajectory along a switching manifold in the output space. Variable structure output <b>feedback</b> <b>controllers</b> are developed which guarantee stability of all motions of a class of linear time-invariant systems. Two coordinate transformations are used which makes the design procedure easier to implement. New switching surface design algorithm based on eigenvectors assignment technique is presented. Besides using the output variables, the output <b>feedback</b> <b>controllers</b> presented in this thesis ensure minimum chattering effect during sliding. This is because the control gains of the switched part may be chosen relatively small. ^ In order to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} presented results, and to compare the obtained results with the existing ones, the design method is applied to a chemical process and to a power system. The power system is represented by a single machine connected to an infinite bus. The control design method used in the chemical process problem serves as an intermediate step between state variable structure control and output variables variable structure control since the design process utilizes only the available outputs of the plant. ...|$|R

Two analog <b>feedback</b> <b>controllers</b> were designed and built using the measured frequency response function of each panel. Two independent (decoupled) <b>feedback</b> <b>controllers</b> were then used to minimize the vibration amplitude of each panel in the presence of an acoustic disturbance. A normal-incidence transmission loss measurement system was used to assess the performance of the DPAP and of a single panel passive partition.

The reduction in vibration amplitude {{across the surface of the}} transmitting panel was confirmed with scanning laser vibrometer measurements. Transmission loss results were obtained for two passive and three active configurations. The average normal incidence transmission loss over the active measurement bandwidth (50 - 1, 000 Hz) for the active double panel was 60 dB. This is an average of 39 dB more transmission loss than a passive single panel partition...|$|R
