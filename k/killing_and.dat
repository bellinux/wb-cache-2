5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, but several JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Gešovski's <b>killing,</b> <b>and</b> the Serbian media pointed to the young Macedonian's death as proof that Tuđman's government had revived the fascist Ustaše, which controlled Croatia during World War II.|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, {{larger and}} more {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting strategies to cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before <b>killing</b> <b>and</b> feeding on it.|$|E

5|$|In June 1832, {{after hearing}} that Atkinson was forming a new army, Black Hawk began sending out raiding parties. Perhaps hoping {{to lead the}} Americans away from his camp at Lake Koshkonong, he {{targeted}} areas to the west. The first major attack occurred on June 14 near present-day South Wayne, Wisconsin, when a band of about 30 warriors attacked a group of farmers, <b>killing</b> <b>and</b> scalping four.|$|E

The Americans pursued them, <b>killing</b> <b>and</b> {{scalping}} several Native stragglers along the way.|$|E

5|$|The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} wild birds. The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can {{live up to}} 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct <b>killing</b> <b>and</b> roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} diurnal, {{although it may}} call into the night, like some {{other members of the}} Artamidae. Natural predators of magpies include various species of monitor lizard and the barking owl.

5|$|While {{some were}} {{executed}} quickly, others were tortured before being killed. The public torture of prisoners was a traditional ritual in many tribes of the Eastern Woodlands. Captives {{might have to}} endure excruciating torture for hours and even days. The British Indian Department used its influence to discourage the <b>killing</b> <b>and</b> torturing of prisoners, with some success, but in 1782 the Indians revived the practice of ritual torture in order to exact revenge for the slaughter at Gnadenhütten.|$|E
