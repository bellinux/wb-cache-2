The structure of these films, consisting of nanometer size metallic particles in a <b>hydro-carbon</b> matrix, was investigated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy /atomic force microscopy (AFM/STM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and tribological tests (friction, wear). Structur analytical methods (STM, TEM, SAXS, XRD) were used to investigate size- and distance distributions of the metallic particles of Au-, Pt-, W- and Fe containing films, with the point of main effort on the scanning probe techniques. Sample surfaces were cleaned by plasma etching methods and special procedures were developed to compensate for tip convolution effects in size and dista nce determination by STM.

40|$|Summary. -The {{results of}} a series of mouse-skin {{paintings}} are given for fractions prepared by two schemes designed to concentrate the polycyclic aromatic <b>hydro-carbons</b> (PAH) and their heterocyclic analogues (HETC) present in cigarette smoke condensate into single fractions. It is demonstrated that, for each group, a single index of tumour response, the " Weibull risk parameter " (WRP), can be calculated which, considered in conjunction with two other parameters common to all the groups, adequately describes the pattern of tumour incidence in that group. These indices can be used to calculate for each fraction a further statistic, the " tumorigenic ratio " (TR), which conveniently measures the activity of the fraction relative to whole-smoke condensate on a weight-for-weight basis. From the analyses it is shown that the separation processes can successfully concentrate all types of mouse-skin carcino-genic material, irrespective of the type of condensate used, and that a combination of processes prepares an active concentrate representing 2 % by weight of the original condensate.

One of the principal features of the Convention is {{the area of the}} Sea which it brings under the two legal regimes of the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf. Under these two regimes considerable areas of the Sea are brought under national jurisdiction for purposes of exploration, control, conservation and exploitation of marine natural resources. The regimes also define the zones with the highest probability of the attractive natural resources, notably fisheries and <b>hydro-carbon.</b> It is estimated, for instance that Kenya and Tanzania would each acquire a new zone of between 20, 000 and 200, 000 nautical square miles over which they have exclusive jurisdiction and sovereign rights for purposes of exploration, exploitation and conservation of natural resources.
