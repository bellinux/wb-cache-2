The experimental group received <b>educational</b> <b>packages,</b> the control group did not. These <b>educational</b> <b>packages</b> were closely matched with explicit criteria used in the indicator condition—our method of measuring the quality of care. The indicator conditions were divided into elective, mandatory and hidden categories.

These episodes of care were then classified according to quality of care. Though knowledge increased from the <b>educational</b> <b>packages,</b> overall quality of care improved very little. If the topics were elective, quality of care improved equally in both the experimental and control groups. When the topics were mandatory, quality of care provided by the experimental group improved (P < 0. 05). Topics covered by the hidden indicator conditions showed no spillover effect...|$|R

Fifty-six physicians completed a pretest multiple-choice questionnaire and were allocated at random either to a group that received the <b>educational</b> <b>package</b> (the "study group") or to a control group. There was a highly significant correlation between the pretest scores {{and the number of}} years since graduation (r = - 0. 55, p less than 0. 0001), which indicated that younger physicians are more likely than older physicians to have an up-to-date knowledge of the management of hypertension.

Furthermore, although the post-test scores in the control group were still significantly correlated with the number of years since graduation, those in the study group were not.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Transtheoretical model (TTM) based <b>educational</b> <b>package</b> on vitamin intake in female adolescents in Tehran. Methods &amp; Materials: A randomized community trial was applied. Study samples were consisted of 80 female students from two middle schools of Tehran, district 17 th. They were selected using a cluster-random sampling method and were randomly assigned to the intervention (n= 40) and control groups (n= 40).

Results: Based on pre-test results, intake of vitamin B 2, B 6, B 9, B 12, and C were lower than Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) in both groups.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} is pointing towards {{the efficacy of}} intervention programmes in decreasing the incidence of delirium among older people admitted to hospital. We have previously shown that an <b>educational</b> <b>package</b> directed at doctors and nurses significantly decreased the point prevalence of delirium among older people on a general medical ward. It is not yet established whether specific and fixed patients characteristics influence the rate of response to such an intervention. Methods A secondary, exploratory stratified analysis was carried out to determine whether age, sex and presence of dementia might influence {{the effect of the}} intervention through a delirium <b>educational</b> <b>package.</b> This information is important in order to increase the effectiveness of preventive measures across various patients subgroups. Results Male gender (OR 0. 17, 0. 05 - 0. 65) significantly (p = 0. 030) and positively influence the response to the <b>educational</b> <b>package</b> compared to female gender (OR 1. 04, 0. 38 - 2. 81). Neither age nor the presence of underlying dementia was associated with a significant influence on the rate of response to the delirium prevention package. Conclusion Staff {{may be more likely to}} implement an earlier and more effective intervention for males who are perceived as presenting a higher risk to themselves and others. The results reported highlight the need to increase staff's vigilance to female patients whose prodromal symptoms of delirium may be underemphasised. Understanding different sub-group responses to preventive educational packages for delirium is an important consideration if these are to be applied widely.
