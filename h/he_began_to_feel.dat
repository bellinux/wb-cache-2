5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> better. His mother {{asked if he could}} return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pain in {{his lower}} back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, and he could not leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} races of the 1935 season, Caracciola won the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring and {{finished}} second at the Penya Rhin Grand Prix in Barcelona. He {{also won the}} Tripoli Grand Prix, organised by the Libyan Governor-General Italo Balbo. The Grand Prix {{was held in the}} desert, around a salt lake, and because of the intense heat Neubauer was concerned that the tyres on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and held it to the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> he had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.|$|E

50|$|Use of an {{intensifier}} subtly {{suggests to}} the reader what emotion he should feel. By naming an emotion within the predicate, the writer compels the reader to consider this emotion and hence <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it.|$|R
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> his potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} a {{scientist}} at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He teaches the protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{that his}} {{reputation}} in Western Australia {{and his personal}} standing in cabinet were being undermined. In response, he resigned as treasurer on 30 July 1907 and joined the crossbenches, {{where he was a}} mild critic of the government.|$|E
60|$|The American {{lives in}} a {{political}} unity on the big modern scale. He can go on comfortably {{for a hundred years}} yet before <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> tight in his political skin, and before <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the threat of immediate warfare close to his domestic life. He believes by experience in peace, but he feels under no passionate urgency to organize it. So far as he himself is concerned, he has got peace organized for a good long time ahead. I doubt if it would make any very serious difference for some time in the ordinary daily life of Kansas City, let us say, if all Europe were reduced to a desert in the next five years.|$|R
50|$|Iko {{undergoes}} a medical procedure in which Borg nanoprobes are injected into his system; {{not only do}} the probes repair his injuries, they also seem to have restored the parts of his brain responsible for empathy, and <b>he</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> remorse for his crime.|$|R

25|$|From 1937 to 1940, Schütz-Marsauche studied Reformed {{theology}} in Strasbourg and Lausanne, {{where he was}} a leader in the Swiss Student Christian Movement, part of the World Student Christian Federation. Falling ill with tuberculosis, during his convalescence <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> drawn to a monastic way of life.|$|E
25|$|This proved one of {{the pivotal}} points in his life, {{comparing}} work at a job he disliked to receiving public relief, {{as he had done}} {{for the first time the}} year before, he gave up the latter and resigned from Stone and Webster after only three months. He never worked at another job or paid income tax again. It was at this time <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> an interest in music.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{he fell in}} {{love with}} Nora and became {{dedicated}} to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Inspector Frost has {{to contend}} with missing children, severed body parts, rape cases and a man {{claiming}} to have killed his wife (even though she reports in as alive and living outside Denton).

50|$|Though Khan is {{at first}} working for Spalko, he {{eventually}} {{realizes that he}} {{has been used as a}} pawn in Spalko's personal game.

25|$|While still a {{young man}} he was {{attacked}} by a young yakuza wielding a bokken. Having developed strong abilities in striking based arts he felt hesitant to use these skills against his young assailant for fear of gravely injuring him and so blocked strike after strike on his arms eventually scaring his attacker away without retaliating. Having injured his arms in this altercation <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the limitations of arts which relied predominantly upon striking.|$|E
25|$|Luther {{had been}} {{suffering}} from ill health for years, including Ménière's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract in one eye. From 1531 to 1546 his health deteriorated further. The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the scandal that ensued from the bigamy of the Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, all may have contributed. In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, arthritis, and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum. In December 1544, <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the effects of angina.|$|E
25|$|According to his biography, from 1868 on <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{overburdened}} by his pastorate, as {{his church}} was very large {{with only a}} single minister. This led to the 1870 hiring of Rev. A. L. Benton from Lima, New York. However, the co-pastor was lost in 1872, when Benton accepted a new position ministering at the Fredonia Presbyterian Church of Fredonia, New York. By now an older man, and with the difficult task on ministering to a large church without any help, Lord {{felt the need to}} leave the position of pastor to someone else. In September 1873, his resignation was reluctantly accepted by the Central Presbyterian Church, after 38 years as pastor.|$|E

500|$|Crossing {{over the}} eastern coast of Africa, <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> overheated; this problem was also {{apparent}} {{to the ground}} controllers, who were having a debate with the flight surgeon over whether {{it was safe to}} continue or if the mission should be ended after the first orbit. The flight director, Christopher Kraft, followed the surgeon's advice to see if the problem would settle, and gave the go for a second orbit. Schirra eventually stabilized the problem over time, slowly dialing the suit's control knob to a high cooling setting; he compared the heat to that of [...] "mowing a lawn in Texas".|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E
50|$|The Broadway {{production}} starred Melvyn Douglas as Howard Carol, {{a middle-class}} {{husband and father}} of three girls, one of whom, Ginger (Nancy Malone), wants {{to try out for}} her school's football team.

The setting is the Carol's living room.|$|R
60|$|Haney {{himself had}} only {{joy of the}} return.

Only {{towards the end of the}} second day after eating his dinner did <b>he</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> oppressed.|$|R

Both of them share this similarity; they both start to relive their lives. Chance was directed and produced by Graf and was screened within 35 different film festivals.|$|R
500|$|When {{early in}} 1962, the police {{questioned}} Josiffe {{about the alleged}} theft of a suede jacket, Thorpe persuaded the investigating officer that Josiffe was recovering from mental illness, and was under his care. No further action was taken. In April 1962 Josiffe obtained a replacement National Insurance card which, he later said, was retained by Thorpe who had {{assumed the role of}} his employer. This was denied by Thorpe, and the [...] "missing card" [...] remained an ongoing source of grievance for Josiffe. <b>He</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> marginalised by Thorpe, and in December 1962, in a fit of depression, confided to a friend his intention to shoot the MP and commit suicide. The friend alerted the police, to whom Josiffe gave a detailed statement of his sexual relations with Thorpe, and produced letters to support his story. None of this evidence impressed the police sufficiently for them to take action, although a report on the matter was added to Thorpe's MI5 file.|$|E
500|$|Tolle recalls {{going out}} for a walk in London the next morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, and <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a strong {{underlying}} sense of peace in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching the world go by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E
500|$|Kanae {{imagined}} {{himself a}} realist and was distressed at the avant-garde {{that was coming}} to dominate the European art world; he {{found it difficult to}} comprehend and reconcile it with his understanding of a realist ideal in Western art. [...] His disappointment and confusion impacted his productivity; he produced few of the prints that were supposed to fund his stay, and the language barrier made it difficult to find buyers. [...] A Tokyo agent of his committed suicide after appropriating money from Kanae and other clients. [...] He could not bring himself to reveal his and his parents' financial situation, so he had another agent, Rokurō Watanabe, send money to Paris just so he could send it back to his parents, who were under pressure from a loan shark. [...] Along with his disappointment in the Western art world, Kanae witnessed first-hand the impact Japanese art had had there. [...] Though he kept such thoughts to himself <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> a sense of the superiority of Japanese art—of the same traditions he had denied himself during his years of training.|$|E
