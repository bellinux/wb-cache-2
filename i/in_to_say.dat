500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was a delight to finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, Haggard {{released}} a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while {{he and his wife}} attend classes at the University of Phoenix. Haggard said that he was pursuing a degree in counseling while his wife Gayle was studying psychology. He also announced that his family was moving into the Dream Center, a Phoenix-based halfway house that ministers to recovering convicts, drug addicts, and prostitutes. After Haggard's request for donations, a member of Haggard's restoration team said he should have consulted with them before releasing a statement. News media pointed out several questions concerning the need for his fundraising, citing his previous six-figure salary, his $138,000 severance package, an $85,000 anniversary bonus that was paid shortly before the scandal broke, the Haggards' Colorado Springs home that was valued at more than $600,000, and royalties from Haggard's many books. Questions also surfaced about the tax-exempt group [...] "Families With a Mission". Haggard asked that donations be sent to on his behalf. According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard. But the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State. A few days after Haggard's initial email statement, his restoration team stepped <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> his statement was [...] "inappropriate" [...] and that [...] "Haggard was a little ahead of himself." [...] They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family.|$|E

2500|$|General Hospital ratings {{soared to}} a 19-month high, {{during the week}} of October 15–19, 2012, and the show {{received}} its highest ratings since executive producer Frank Valentini and head-writer Ron Carlivati assumed their positions. In total viewers, the show had its highest numbers since February 2011 at 3 million viewers. The major events of that week - the culmination of the baby switch storyline involving the couple's son Daniel, and the reunion of Jason and Sam with Daniel, were among those credited with this large increase in ratings. In the summer of 2012, Jason and Sam won the Gold for General Hospital in Zap2it's Summer Soap Couple Olympics. In November 2012, Jason and Sam were praised on TV Line.com's weekly column on major happenings in primarily primetime television. In early 2013, thousands of fans voted to see an episode featuring Jason and Sam in SOAPnet's Valentine's Day Supercouple Marathon. Over 36,000 votes were cast. Jason and Sam won first place and a spot in a marathon. They were featured alongside other popular General Hospital supercouples. Also in 2013, Jason and Sam were named one of General Hospital's great supercouples of the 2000s in People magazine's tribute to General Hospital's 50th anniversary. In February 2014, Jason and Sam were the only daytime soap opera couple nominated in the People's Choice Awards Valentine's Day poll, for most romantic TV couple of the 2000s. Jason and Sam placed second in the competition. Regarding Sam and Jason's spot as the only daytime couple in the competition, People's Choice editorial director Nuzhat Naoreen said, [...] "We asked the fans to nominate their all-time favorite romantic TV couples and GH's Jason and Sam received a flood of submissions [...] they were the only soap couple that garnered enough write-ins to land a spot among the four couples featured in the All Time Most Romantic TV Couple poll. Fans wrote <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Jason and Sam had all the qualities that make a great couple and that the pairing made them fall in love with [...]" ...|$|E
