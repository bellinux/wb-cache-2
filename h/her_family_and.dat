Rattanbai defied <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> nominally converted to Islam, adopting (though never using) the name Maryam Jinnah, resulting in a permanent estrangement from <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> Parsi society. The couple resided at South Court Mansion in Bombay, and frequently travelled across India and Europe. The couple's only child, daughter Dina, was born on 15 August 1919.

5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation.

Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899.

Overwhelmed by Liz's desire for vengeance {{and the search for}} her child, Eve is unaware of Whitney's relationship with Chad. The storyline culminates in July 2004, when Liz brings Eve's aunt Irma Johnson to tell T. C. the truth about her relationship with Julian and their child. Whitney turns against her mother, incorrectly assuming that her child with Julian is Chad (making her relationship with him incestuous). T. C. divorces Eve, unable to forgive her lies about her past with Julian and her pregnancy, and begins a romantic relationship with Liz. Eve and Julian renew their relationship, despite his wife Rebecca Hotchkiss' refusal to grant him a divorce.|$|E
5|$|Following No Reservations, Zeta-Jones {{significantly}} decreased her workload in {{the next}} five years.

The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814.
