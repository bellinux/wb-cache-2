40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Absorption of drug {{substances}} {{across the}} intestinal epithelium {{is a complex}} and dynamic process. Counter transport proteins {{are responsible for the}} efflux of specific drug molecules after they have been absorbed. One of the <b>key</b> <b>counter</b> transport efflux proteins, which is of importance in this study, is P–glycoprotein. The efflux pump P–glycoprotein {{plays a major role in}} altering the pharmacokinetics of a wide variety of drugs limiting their absorption and therefore also bioavailability. Many flavonoids have been shown to interact with P–glycoprotein mediated efflux in vitro studies. Numerous in vitro methods have been used to study drug absorption across the intestinal membranes, but it is often not possible to use only one in vitro model to accurately predict permeability characteristics. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of four selected hydroxy– and methoxy– flavonoids on the in vitro transport of Rhodamine 123, a known P–gp substrate, across excised rat and pig intestinal tissue using the Sweetana–Grass diffusion apparatus. The results were further used to determine if the two different animal tissue models corresponded with regard to the flavonoids' effects on P–glycoprotein related efflux. Two control groups were included in the experimental design. In the negative control group, the transport of Rhodamine 123 was tested alone and no modulator was added. In the positive control group, the transport of Rhodamine 123 was determined in the presence of Verapamil, which is a known P–glycoprotein inhibitor. The experiments with the flavonoids Morin, Galangin, 6 –Methoxyflavone and 7 –Methoxyflavone were done in triplicate to determine repeatability of the results. The transport of Rhodamine 123 was evaluated in both the apical to basolateral (absorptive) and basolateral to apical (secretory) directions. The relative transport of Rhodamine 123, the apparent permeability coefficient (P app) values and flux (J) values in both directions as well as the efflux ratio (ER) and net flux (J net) were calculated. The concentration Rhodamine 123 present in the acceptor chamber was determined by means of a validated HPLC method. Statistical analysis was used to compare the results of the test groups with the control groups in order to indicate significant differences. It has been found that Morin, Galangin and 6 –Methoxyflavone have a significant inhibitory effect on the Rhodamine 123 efflux (probably P–glycoprotein related) in both the rat and pig intestinal tissue models with p–values smaller than 0. 05. On the other hand, 7 –Methoxyflavone showed a significant effect on the efflux of Rhodamine 123 in the pig intestinal tissue model (p 0. 05). These flavonoids may increase the bioavailability of drugs that are substrates for P–glycoprotein and thereby cause clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions, however, this should be confirmed with in vivo studies. On the other hand, these flavonoids may be used for drug absorption enhancement when applied under controlled circumstances. With regard to the different animal tissue models used it can be concluded that data obtained from the rat intestinal tissue model cannot be compared and extrapolated to data obtained from the pig intestinal tissue model. It is recommended that the in vitro results be correlated to in vivo findings to identify the most suitable model. Master...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a power efficient design of a 4 -bit up-down Johnson counter by using Dual Dynamic Node Pulsed Flip-flop(DDFF) featuring efficient embedded logic module(DDFF-ELM) and then clock gating is incorporated {{in order to reduce}} the power dissipation further. The proposed design employs a DDFF which mainly reduces the power consumption by eliminating the large capacitance present in the pre-charge node of several existing flip-flop designs by separately driving the output pull-up and pull-down transistors by following a split dynamic node structure. This reduces the power up to 40 % compared to conventional architectures of the flip-flops. Then the Embedded logic module is an efficient method to incorporate complex logic functions into the flip-flop. Clock gating is applied to reduce the power consumption up to 50 % due to unnecessary clock activities. <b>Key</b> words—Johnson <b>counter,</b> DDFF, DDFF-ELM, clock gating, XCFF, CDMFF, low power.

Vertical ground reaction force, take off velocity, center of mass displacement after take off, impulse and power were calculated using the force time data.

In Spain, as in other countries of the European Union, steps have been taken to reduce the number and consequences of such accidents, with encouraging results in recent years. A <b>key</b> to <b>countering</b> this concern is the accident research activity that has obtained remarkable achievements in different fields, especially when multidisciplinary approaches are taken. This paper describes the development of a multivariate model that is able to detect the most influential parameters on the consequences of vehicle-pedestrian collision and to quantify their impact on pedestrian fatality risk. First, an accident database containing detailed information and parameters of vehicle-pedestrian collisions in Madrid has been developed. The accidents were investigated on the spot by INSIA accident investigation teams and analyzed using advanced reconstruction techniques. The model was then developed with two components: (1) a classification tree that characterizes and selects the explanatory variables, identifying their interactions, and (2) a binary logistic regression to quantify the influence of each variable and interaction resulting from the classification tree. The whole model represents an important tool for identifying, quantifying and predicting the potential impact of measures aimed at reducing injuries in vehicle-pedestrian collisions...|$|R

One of the <b>key</b> needs to <b>counter</b> such a threat is long-range detection of nuclear material.

However, detection at this range has long been thought impractical due to fluctuating levels of natural background radiation. These fluctuations are the major source of uncertainty in detection and mean that sensitivity cannot be increased simply by increasing detector size. Recent work has shown that this problem can be overcome through the use of imaging techniques.
