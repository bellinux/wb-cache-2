5|$|A {{multi-purpose}} breed, the Norman Cob {{was formerly}} used wherever {{there was a}} need. It was utilized {{in a variety of}} agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for <b>its</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernization of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the third largest party, Clegg had {{announced}} that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled <b>its</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government {{as part of a}} rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{proceeded}} rapidly {{during the}} week, {{but did not}} touch {{on the issue of}} Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal had indicated <b>its</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.|$|E

The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam, but two other faculty members criticized the procedures. Putnam permanently severed his ties with the PLP in 1972. In 1997, {{at a meeting of}} former draft resistance activists at Arlington Street Church in Boston, Putnam described his involvement with the PLP as a mistake. He said that he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and <b>its</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> attempt to organize from within the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers {{had decided}} that it was not in their {{interest}} that any one power should dominate the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message to the Dutch fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England worked hard to broker a peace, aided by France which also declared <b>its</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the post–World War II baby boom, the New South Wales Department of Education, under Bob Heffron, queried the University of Sydney in 1951 on its thoughts about training and certifying schoolteachers by external studies and/or correspondence courses. The university rejected the idea, stating that external degree or certification programs would be significantly inferior to residence education. Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about <b>its</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> conduct external studies. Madgwick enthusiastically supported the idea and instructed his college's staff to begin preparing an external studies program. Heffron asked the University of Sydney if it had any objection to New England being granted independence to operate the state's external education program. The university replied {{that it had no}} objection.|$|E
