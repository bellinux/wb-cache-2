She loses it and becomes distressed; John <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> a month later in the freezer, but Alice thinks it has only been missing for a day. Alice and John visit Anna in the hospital to meet their newborn twin grandchildren, but Alice does not recognize her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} basal position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> within Neoceratopsia. Protoceratopsidae {{is considered to be}} the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most likely due to the amount of missing information. Removal of Asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram.|$|E
5|$|Set after X-Men: Days of Future Past, En Sabah Nur, {{the first}} mutant, awakens after {{thousands}} of years. Disillusioned {{with the world}} as he <b>finds</b> <b>it,</b> he recruits a team of mutants to cleanse mankind and create a new world order, over which he will reign. Raven, {{with the help of}} Professor X, must lead the X-Men to stop Apocalypse and save mankind from destruction.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Denmark has {{its origins in}} the Viking period, richly revealed by archaeological <b>finds.</b> <b>It</b> became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. It was during this period that, {{in a country with}} little access to stone, brick became the construction material of choice, not just for churches but also for fortifications and castles.|$|E
5|$|While Johnny wanders {{the city}} and pines for a woman he sees in an {{apartment}} window ("Boulevard of Broken Dreams"), Tunny <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> hard to adjust to urban life and is seduced by a television ad for the army ("Favorite Son"). Tunny realizes that his generation has been so numbed and apathetic that nothing, not even {{the bright lights of}} the city, will excite him ("Are We the Waiting"). He enlists in the army.|$|E
5|$|Black has {{the blood}} tested, and <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> {{free of any}} pathogen; meanwhile, the {{government}} center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, and may be tied to the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are clearly not welcome. Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes {{is connected to the}} United States Department of Energy.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} {{it has caused}} for his family, Gregor <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> hard {{to distance himself from}} the Underland. When he receives word that a plague has broken out and his bond Ares is one of the victims, he heads down to help with yet another of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies. His mother, however, hates the Underland and only allows Boots and Gregor below on the condition that she comes with them. The humans' plague expert, Dr. Neveeve, explains that there is a plant called starshade growing deep in the Vineyard of Eyes which can be distilled into a cure. In the midst of the meeting, a dying bat infected with the plague inadvertently one of the delegates—Gregor's mother.|$|E
5|$|Goeslaw {{is married}} to guitarist Anto Hoed. Together they have two children, Anakku Lelaki Hoed and Lelaki Bernama Hoed (literally My Son Hoed and Boy Named Hoed). In her spare time she enjoys shopping, playing with her children, and {{browsing}} the internet; she has stated that she <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> increasingly difficult to enjoy shopping due to being constantly recognised. She has stated that she prefers being backstage over giving concerts, as {{she does not have}} to wear make-up or rehearse.|$|E
5|$|Grace is {{the young}} {{supervisor}} of Short Term 12, a group home for troubled teenagers. She lives with her long-term boyfriend and coworker, Mason, but <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> difficult {{to open up to}} him emotionally. When Grace finds out she is pregnant, she schedules an appointment for an abortion; she eventually tells an overjoyed Mason about the pregnancy, but not about her plan to have an abortion. At the facility, Grace and Mason focus their efforts on Marcus, a Short Term 12 resident who is about to turn 18 and is struggling with the prospect of leaving the facility.|$|E

5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{discovers that}} Karin's father was {{pulled from the}} mud of an orchard twenty years earlier. Ramirez tells him that the death brought about an end of a blight {{affecting}} the trees. Later, Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews' casket and <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> filled with roots, his body missing. When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her. Karin enters the root cellar, and is revealed {{to be the source}} of the male voice Lisa heard earlier, due to her having Dissociative personality disorder brought on by abuse from her own father.|$|E

5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy <b>finds</b> <b>it,</b> bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E
5000|$|Barker {{was angry}} with Lionsgate's treatment, believing the studio's {{president}} Joe Drake to be shortchanging other people's films {{to focus more}} attention on films like The Strangers, where he received a producing credit: [...] "The politics that are being visited upon it {{have nothing to do}} with the movie at all. This is all about ego, and though I mourn the fact that The Midnight Meat Train was never given its chance in theaters, it's a beautifully stylish, scary movie, and it isn't going anywhere. People will <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> and whether they <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in midnight shows or they <b>find</b> <b>it</b> on DVD, they'll <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> and in the end the Joe Drakes of the world will disappear." ...|$|R

He cares deeply for his motherless daughter, Mary, {{but was unable to}} attend the annual {{commencement}} at her co-educational college. He awaits for her to return from college, but Mary leaves with her romantic interest, Jack Denbeigh. On promise of marriage and wealth, Mary is romanced and gives birth to a fatherless child. Without word from his daughter, Ezra resigns from his job and attempts to seek her out and finds a poor motherless child, Marie. With Ezra's money exhausted he seeks employment and <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> as the valet of Jack.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Washington, Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director Walter Skinner and the Smoking Man for his actions. Mulder claims he still had enough {{evidence}} with the days missed to prosecute {{the subject of his}} assigned wiretap, and that his own phone calls were being monitored. Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the tape reel, Mulder <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> blank due to a power surge during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.|$|E
