5|$|After the Seven Years' War, Zieten {{retired from}} active service, widely {{considered}} a hero. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Frederick forbade him to go, so {{he stayed on}} his estate at Wustrau with his niece, Johanna von Blumenthal, whose son was serving in his regiment. During this period she <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> reminiscences for a biography.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{was born}} in the Stockholm Palace Tre Kronor in November 1655. His father, Charles X of Sweden, left Sweden in July to fight in the war against Poland. After several years of warfare, the king {{returned}} in the winter of 1659 and <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> family and the Riksdag of the Estates in Gothenburg. In mid-January 1660 he fell ill and one month later he wrote his last will and died.|$|E

He later died on 1 June 1830 (Jeth sud 10, Samvat 1886), {{and it is}} believed by followers that, {{at the time of}} his death, Swaminarayan left Earth for Akshardham, his abode. He was cremated according to Hindu rites at Lakshmi Wadi in Gadhada.|$|E

5|$|Just before 05:00, as his rebels {{continued}} their search, Major Hatanaka {{went to the}} NHK studios, and, brandishing a pistol, tried desperately to get some airtime to explain his actions. A little over an hour later, after receiving {{a telephone call from}} the Eastern District Army, Hatanaka finally gave up. He <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> officers {{and walked out of the}} NHK studio.|$|E
5|$|Tabinshwehti took {{personal}} {{command and}} <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> forces at Martaban (Mottama). The invasion forces were organized into three main armies: the vanguard army led by Bayinnaung, the main army led by Tabinshwehti and the rearguard army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza and Mingyi Swe, {{each with a}} strength of 4000 troops. Their route of invasion was via the Three Pagodas Pass towards Kanchanaburi, {{and then to the}} capital Ayutthaya.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{expeditionary force}} set sail from Constantinople in late June 533, {{and after a}} sea voyage along the coasts of Greece and {{southern}} Italy, landed on the African coast at Caputvada in early September, to Gelimer's complete surprise. The Vandal king <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> forces and met the Roman army at the Battle of Ad Decimum, near Carthage, on 13 September. Gelimer's elaborate plan to encircle and destroy the Roman army came close to success, but Belisarius was able to drive the Vandal army to flight and occupy Carthage. Gelimer withdrew to Bulla Regia, where he <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> remaining strength, including the army of Tzazon, which returned from Sardinia. In December, Gelimer advanced towards Carthage and met the Romans at the Battle of Tricamarum. The battle resulted in a Roman victory {{and the death of}} Tzazon. Gelimer fled to a remote mountain fortress, where he was blockaded until he surrendered in the spring.|$|E

5|$|After a {{long and}} zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a saint: {{receiving}} a premonition of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey's hospice for the terminally ill where, having <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before nocturns. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are incorrect.|$|E
5|$|As Duckworth <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> squadron, Northumberlands {{mainmast}} collapsed {{across the}} deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas {{was out of control}} and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E
5|$|As {{the eldest}} son of Gerold of Vinzgouw and as a high ranking Frankish commander, Eric was titled from 789 to his death the Duke of Friuli (dux Foroiulensis). He was {{appointed}} governor of Istria, Fruli, and neighbouring areas by Charlemagne. Eric wanted to extend his dominion by conquering Dalmatian Croatia. In the autumn of 799, Eric marched from Istria along the seacoast of Liburnia towards the town of Trsat, which is today {{part of the city}} of Rijeka. Meanwhile his opponent, duke Višeslav, <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> forces and moved north from his governing center at Nin.|$|E

Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E
5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.|$|E
5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} five days to draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E

5|$|Vlad's patron, Sigismund of Luxembourg, died on 9 December 1437. Sigismund's {{death and}} the {{uprising}} of the Transylvanian peasants weakened Hungary, forcing Vlad to seek reconciliation with the Ottoman Empire. He went to Edirne and swore fealty to Murad II. He also promised to pay a yearly tribute to the sultan and to support the Ottomans' military campaigns at the sultan's order. Before long, Murad II decided to invade Hungary and <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> troops at Vidin.|$|E
5|$|By then, Farnese, unwilling {{of having}} {{for a longer}} time his troops close to Antwerp's cannons, made drums and {{trumpets}} to call for withdrawal and <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> men at Borgerhout. Meanwhile, people from Antwerp sallied to carry the wounded French, British and Walloon officers and soldiers into the city to receive treatment. The Spanish soldiery, once the fire of Borgerhout was finished, looted the basements of the burned buildings and had a meal before praying to thank God. After that, the Spanish Army marched across the roads of Lier and Herentals to Turnhout, where Farnese wanted to arrive the next day. Fearing a new attack, Antwerp's civic guards {{spent the night at}} their posts.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E

Some flew their aircraft and crews, including several Dornier Do 17s and a CANT Z.1007 to Italy and surrendered to the Allied forces there. Some flew their aircraft over to the Partisans, including several light aircraft and some Bf 109s, whilst others, also including Bf 109s, {{as well as at}} least one Dornier Do-17Z, a Messerschmitt Bf 110G-2, a Bristol Blenheim I and a Yugoslav-designed and built Zmaj Fizir FP-2, sought sanctuary in Klagenfurt, Austria.|$|E
5|$|At Gibraltar, {{the only}} ship in harbour was the small sloop-of-war HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas, who on {{sighting}} the French squadron immediately sent word to Saumarez off Cadiz. The message arrived on 5 July, delivered by Lieutenant Richard Janvrin {{in a small}} boat. The admiral, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile, immediately <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> ships and sailed eastwards to investigate. He had only six ships of the line as one, HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, was on detached duty {{at the mouth of the}} Guadalquivir River with the brig HMS Pasley. Saumarez sent messages in the frigate HMS Thames recalling Keats, who followed Saumarez towards Algeciras, and was in sight of the admiral's ship on the horizon at dawn on 6 July. However, after hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had already sailed from Algeciras, Keats reasoned that the French would have turned eastwards for Toulon and thus he would be too late to catch them. He therefore resolved to return to his station observing the Spanish at Cadiz, retaining Pasley and Thames.|$|E
5|$|During late 1596, Michael {{was faced}} with an {{unexpected}} attack from the Tatars, who had destroyed the towns of Bucharest and Buzău. By the time Michael <b>gathered</b> <b>his</b> army to counterattack, the Tatars had speedily retreated and so no battle was fought. Michael was determined to continue {{the war against the}} Ottomans, but he was prevented because he lacked support from Sigismund Báthory and Rudolf II. On 7 January 1597 Hasan Pasha declared the independence of Wallachia under Michael's rule, but Michael knew that this was only an attempt to divert him from preparing for another future attack. Michael again requested Rudolf II's support and Rudolf finally agreed to send financial assistance to the Wallachian ruler. On 9 June 1598 a formal treaty was reached between Michael and Rudolf II. According to the treaty, the Austrian ruler would give Wallachia sufficient money to maintain a 5,000-man army, as well as armaments and supplies. Shortly after the treaty was signed, the war with the Ottomans resumed and Michael besieged Nicopolis on 10 September 1598 and took control of Vidin. The war with the Ottomans continued until 26 June 1599, when Michael, lacking the resources and support to continue prosecuting the war, signed a peace treaty.|$|E
