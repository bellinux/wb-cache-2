We give an operational semantics, where {{there are two kinds}} of transitions: probabilistic transitions and timed transitions. Transitions of the first kind are associated with the events that a behavior expression can execute, while timed transitions deal with time evolution. From this operational semantics we define a testing semantics, where a process passes a test with a probability in a period of time, and two processes are intended to be equivalent if they pass all the tests with the same probability for any time. In the second part of the paper, we use PTLotos in order to specify the Alternating Bit Protocol. The ABP is a simple communication protocol which provides an error free co [...] ...|$|R

The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the risk(s) associated with lockout/tagout of hazardous energy and propose a new LOTO procedure which tracks the implementation <b>of</b> <b>LOTO</b> to mitigate against identified risks as a basis for promotion of safety. The study focuses on electrical personnel working in PHCN. Only electrical accident risks are examined, not other types of risk e. g. mechanical, chemical, and nuclear. To gather material for this study, a questionnaire was distributed amongst electrical workers in PHCN and their supervisors were interviewed. Relevant literature and publications were studied as reference. According to electrical personnel experience, electrocution, arc flash, arc blast, burns and lockout and tagout of the wrong electrical circuit are seen as the biggest electrical safety risk with regards to <b>LOTO</b> <b>of</b> hazardous energy. The research reveals new information about electrical accident risks. This information is used to create a procedure for tracking <b>LOTO</b> <b>of</b> hazardous energy. The procedure can be utilized in the mitigation of electrical risks and promotion ofMaster...|$|R
