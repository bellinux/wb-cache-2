5|$|The {{inner and}} outer Belpaire <b>firebox</b> was also smaller than the Merchant Navy class also {{constructed}} using welded steel.|$|E
5|$|At Tomorrowland Station {{in early}} 2004, {{accumulated}} diesel fumes in the <b>firebox</b> of the DRR's No. 3 locomotive exploded after its fire suddenly went out. The explosion ejected the engineer from the locomotive's cab and inflicted serious burns on the fireman.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1912, SECR F1 class {{locomotive}} No. 216 {{was working}} an empty stock train when it suffered {{the failure of}} the <b>firebox</b> crown near Tunbridge Wells {{due to a lack of}} water in the boiler. Both engine crew were severely injured by escaping steam and jumping from the moving locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The {{first five}} {{locomotives}} of 1914 were delivered with steel <b>fireboxes.</b> In {{the case of}} the Classes 15 and 15A, it was still early days for water treatment and enough trouble was experienced to result in their steel <b>fireboxes</b> being replaced with copper <b>fireboxes.</b> Hendrie followed a conservative policy in this respect and the majority {{of the rest of the}} Class 15A fleet were originally fitted with copper <b>fireboxes.</b> Steel <b>fireboxes</b> were only to be fitted in large numbers by his successor, Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, and only the last batch of 1925, supplied by Maffei, were delivered with steel <b>fireboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Class 10 and Class 20 had narrow <b>fireboxes.</b> The Class 30 and Class 60 had wide <b>fireboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Baldwin {{had built}} the class with round-topped steel <b>fireboxes</b> but the PR found these unsatisfactory. It {{therefore}} sent six more H class to Armstrong Whitworth who fitted copper <b>fireboxes</b> instead. On other H class locomotives PR made modifications themselves, fitting Belpaire <b>fireboxes</b> and {{reducing the number of}} domes from three to two.|$|R
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long <b>firebox,</b> and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the <b>firebox</b> crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire <b>firebox.</b> The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
50|$|With no appreciable gain {{obtained}} in steaming capacity, the enlarged grate area on these experimental locomotives {{did not come}} up to expectations. Since the <b>fireboxes</b> began to have problems with cracks and leaking rivets soon after the locomotives were placed in service, the experimental boilers and <b>fireboxes</b> were soon replaced with standard 8th Class boilers and <b>fireboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{weight on the}} {{trailing}} wheels, steel <b>fireboxes</b> were originally used instead of copper. Some locomotives in Natal had been fitted with steel <b>fireboxes</b> years previously {{and the results were}} fairly good, but wherever water supplies were of poor quality, steel <b>fireboxes</b> gave a lot of trouble and necessitated the introduction of water treatment plants to prevent corrosion. This reintroduction of steel <b>fireboxes</b> eventually led to its widespread use on all the larger locomotive types, but it also forced the SAR to adopt locomotive water treatment as a general policy.|$|R
5000|$|On the LNER, those {{retaining}} round-top <b>fireboxes</b> {{were classified}} J16, and those built, or rebuilt, with Belpaire <b>fireboxes</b> were classified J17. The J16 category {{ceased to exist}} in 1932.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new <b>firebox</b> tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was not prepared to spend further money at this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E
5|$|The smokebox was an {{integral}} part of the air-smoothed casing, being a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the <b>firebox</b> that acted as a former to maintain the shape of the casing. In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire <b>firebox</b> and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox snifting valves, {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|E
50|$|These engines {{had been}} {{developed}} from S. W. Johnson's Midland Railway locomotives introduced in 1899. Johnson's locomotives were originally built with round-topped <b>fireboxes</b> {{but they were all}} rebuilt with Belpaire <b>fireboxes</b> from 1919.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{weight on the}} {{trailing}} wheels, steel <b>fireboxes</b> were originally used instead of copper since the water quality in the Free State was considered suitable for this metal. Some locomotives in Natal had been fitted with steel <b>fireboxes</b> years previously {{and the results were}} fairly good, but wherever water supplies were of poor quality, steel <b>fireboxes</b> gave a lot of trouble and necessitated the introduction of water treatment plants to prevent corrosion.|$|R
50|$|Up to 1891, 185 were built: 165 by Derby Works and {{the last}} 20 by the Vulcan Foundry. Originally they were built with type A boilers with round-topped <b>fireboxes,</b> but many later {{received}} type G5 boilers with Belpaire <b>fireboxes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The SR V class, more {{commonly}} known as the Schools class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR King Arthur class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables. Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ <b>firebox,</b> rather than the square-topped Belpaire <b>firebox</b> used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the <b>firebox,</b> copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the <b>firebox</b> and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The <b>firebox,</b> near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with steel <b>fireboxes</b> {{for use in}} those areas where good or treated water was readily available, while others were still equipped with copper or composite <b>fireboxes</b> for use in areas with poor water quality.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives as built, with Belpaire <b>fireboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the engines}} had round-topped <b>fireboxes,</b> and the boiler barrel had a maximum {{diameter}} of 4 ft. When boilers became due for replacement, the replacement boilers were of various types, {{some of which}} had Belpaire <b>fireboxes,</b> and some were larger, being 4 ft diameter.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive <b>firebox</b> enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or <b>firebox,</b> which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the <b>firebox.</b> The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} driver (US: engineer) worked {{on one side}} of the locomotive, and the fireman on the other; the <b>fireboxes</b> separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the <b>fireboxes,</b> with the steam brake valve at one end.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and were superheated, using the Schmidt type superheater. Unlike {{most of the}} other SAR Mallet classes, which had round-topped <b>fireboxes,</b> the Class MJ had Belpaire <b>fireboxes.</b> The four cylinders were arranged outside the 4 in thick bar frames.|$|R
50|$|This {{reintroduction}} {{of steel}} <b>fireboxes</b> {{eventually led to}} its widespread use on all the larger locomotive types, but it also forced the SAR to adopt locomotive water treatment as a general policy. There was no settled policy on water treatment for some years, but engines with copper <b>fireboxes</b> were used mainly {{in areas where the}} water was not of good quality. Hendrie followed a conservative policy in this respect and steel <b>fireboxes</b> were only to be fitted in large numbers by his successor, Colonel F.R. Collins DSO.|$|R
5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the <b>firebox,</b> boiler and value gear so {{they were the same}} as the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire <b>firebox</b> that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for free running up to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E
5|$|The low granite block {{foundation}} {{of the house is}} more exposed {{on the west side of}} the house, allowing for a full-height door exiting from the cellar. The stone stack supports four fireplaces that each support the hall, hall chamber, parlor and the cellar. Also there is a smoke chamber in the stack in the attic. The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the rear wall of the <b>firebox.</b> The attic once housed a large loom that was later moved down to the west side of the cellar. Amos G. Avery, who owned and restored the house prior to its 1992 National Register of Historic Places listing, removed a 1871 Victorian balustrade on the front staircase installed by the second Theophilus Avery.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the earlier}} locomotives, the Scotia Class was also {{delivered}} with copper boilers and <b>fireboxes.</b> Around April 1903, no. 8 Scotia was fitted with an experimental steel boiler and around 1907-1908 two more steel boilers with copper <b>fireboxes</b> were acquired as spare boilers for the Scotia Class.|$|R
50|$|They had round-topped copper <b>fireboxes,</b> the crowns {{of which}} were {{supported}} by direct stays of Yorkshire iron which were screwed and riveted over at both ends. The <b>fireboxes</b> had brick arches, a feature which was only adopted in America and several other countries at much later dates.|$|R
50|$|The Midland Railway (MR) 2441 Class was a {{class of}} steam locomotive. Introduced by Samuel Johnson in 1899, {{originally}} with round-topped <b>fireboxes.</b> Henry Fowler later rebuilt them with Belpaire <b>fireboxes.</b> They were given the power classification 3F. The LMS Fowler Class 3F of 1924 was based on this design.|$|R
