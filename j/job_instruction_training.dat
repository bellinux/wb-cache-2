40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is constantly developing and manufacturing industry is facing modernisation {{and need for}} increased efficiency which implies that the {{automotive industry}} is facing changes for assembly training. To minimise quality errors and save time computerbased training virtual training {{can be used to}} practice on product knowledge, variants and sequences. Currently in traditional training in automotive industries, the operators practice on psychical products. The purpose of this bachelor thesis is to obtain knowledge of the effects of virtual training with cycle times longer than five minutes by evaluate the virtual training methods at Scania in Södertälje, Sweden. To achieve the purpose of the thesis the objective is to create a basis of the advantages and disadvantages. Scania is part of the Volkswagen Group and is a world leading supplier in the automotive industry which develops custom made and high-quality products with short lead times. Scania’s core products are heavy trucks, buses and engines for marine and industrial applications. Scania has 46 000 employees in 100 countries. Today Scania use standardised work and <b>Job</b> <b>Instructions</b> <b>Training</b> tools for learning the assembling processes which could be time consuming, ineffective and resource-intensive. Therefore, Scania’s vision with virtual training is to shorten the learning time on-line by implementing virtual training to practice off-line. The main objectives are to reduce the time for training simultaneously as the product quality increases. To obtain reliable information to reach the purpose a qualitative approach has been used in the study. To obtain primary data the methods have been semi-structured interviews, observation and questionnaires that have been performed and literature studies have been used to collect secondary data to obtain a broad knowledge of the subject. Through this the bachelor thesis resulted in recommendations that will contribute to Scania’s decision of future work with virtual training. The recommendations have been based on the previous accomplished studies, results and obtained comments which together were connected in the discussion and by the recommendations the authors believe that Scania can use virtual training with success. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this survey is to {{investigate}} the level and relationship between top down communication and job performance among management and subordinates. Ninety four subordinates of â€œSupporting Group 1 â€ from Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru (MBJB) were selected. The main objective of this survey is to measure the relationship between top down communication and job performance, which is <b>job</b> <b>instruction,</b> information, feedback, <b>job</b> rationale and ideology. The researcher also identified the relationship between communication channel and job performance for written and oral communication channel perspective. The frequency distribution analysis and Pearson rank order correlation were {{used to analyze the}} data. The findings of this study showed that majority of the subordinates have high level of job performance. The top down communication for feedback was measured to be at a high level and the top down communication for <b>job</b> <b>instruction,</b> <b>job</b> rationale and ideology and information was measured to be at a moderate level. Meanwhile, the communication channel for written and oral communication was also at a moderate level. There is a positive small correlation between the overall top down communication with job performance (r= 0. 030). The result of the relationship between top down communication for <b>job</b> <b>instruction</b> is (r= 0. 138), information is (r= 0. 073), feedback is (r= 0. 143), job rationale and ideology is (r= 0. 126) with their job performance.
