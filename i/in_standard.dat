5|$|Chord {{inversion}} {{is especially}} simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising {{one or two}} notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3tuning {{even when they are}} inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, chords {{cannot be}} shifted around the {{fretboard}} <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> tuning, which requires four chord-shapes {{for the major}} chords: There are separate fingerings for chords having root notes {{on one of the}} four strings three–six.|$|E

Episodes are also available for download at the iTunes Store <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> and high definition, and Amazon Video, with new episodes appearing the day after their live airings. ABC Video on demand also releases episodes of the show, typically one to two days after their premieres. Recent episodes are available at ABC's official Grey's Anatomy website, and on Hulu. In 2009, ABC signed a deal allowing Grey's Anatomy episodes to be streamed on Netflix.|$|E
5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> solar radii and mass <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> solar masses.|$|E
