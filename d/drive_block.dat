On June 8, 1931, an intoxicated McErlane swept a South Shore <b>Drive</b> <b>block</b> with shotgun blasts, shooting at imaginary foes. Police ultimately filed a whopping total of five simultaneous charges; drunk and disorderly, carrying a concealed weapon, firing a shotgun indiscriminately around his neighborhood, driving with forged license plates, and biting his sister on the cheek. On October 8, 1931, McErlane was driving his car with common-law wife Elfrieda Rigus and her two German Shepherds in the back seat. Police later determined that both were extremely drunk and arguing with each other. At one point, Frank finally snapped. After pulling over in front of 8129 Phillips Avenue, McErlane whirled around and fired four fatal bullets into Elfrieda. Tired of the yapping dogs, Frank shot and killed them as well.|$|E
40|$|J. Bryan Mann 1, Bert H. Jacobson 2 FACSM. 1 University of Missouri, Physical Therapy and Athletic Training, 2 Oklahoma State University, Health 2 ̆ 6 Human Performance, The <b>drive</b> <b>block</b> is {{the basic}} of a running play and is {{typically}} executed by offensive linemen a three-point stance. The technique begins with a quick explosion into the defensive lineman followed by driving the legs {{in an attempt to}} displace the defender. Strength and power are vital to this skill and training of these variables is conducted during the offseason as well as during the season. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between velocity of the <b>drive</b> <b>block</b> and selected strength and power variables. METHODS: Following IRB approval 10 offensive linemen performed 10 fire-outs from a three-point stance into a stationary blocking dummy while assessments of power and velocity were made. Velocity (m/sec) was recorded using a Tendo® Power and Speed Analyzer and these data were correlated with each players’ 225 lb Bench Press repetitions: 1 -RM Bench Press, Squat, Hang Clean, and Vertical Jump. RESULTS: Means for each variable were: 225 lb bench press 1 -RM bench press 357. 0 + 38. 02 kg, 1 R-M Squat 520. 25 + 111. 56; 1 R-M Hang Clean 307. 67 + 50. 03; Vertical Jump 66. 74 + 5. 80; Average Velocity 1. 76 + 0. 044 m/sec. Correlations of the variables yielded significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) positive associations between Average Velocity and 225 lb Bench Press (r= 0. 92), Bench Press (r= 0. 89) and Hang Clean (r= 0. 81) but not for the Squat (r= 0. 60) or the Vertical Jump (r= 0. 10). CONCLUSION: Based on these results training protocols inclusive of the bench press and hang clean positively offensive line play. It may be that in current line block technique much of the initial hit is by the heel of the hands to the body of the defender. It is suggested that training continue to include the both the bench press and hang clean in year-long training in order to maximize playing efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the accuracy}} of the estimated mechanical speed and electromagnetic torque in a Direct Torque Controlled (DTC) induction motor drive with no speed measurement. A literature study has been performed in order to reveal new areas where the DTC technology can expand to, and this knowledge was compared with the accuracy data to determine the most feasible areas of expansion. The most promising new technique is to combine the DTC technique, with its estimation of speed, torque and power, with a model based method of estimating load state variables. If the load is observable using the DTC estimates, and the estimates are considered accurate enough for control purposes, this could potentially replace load process measurements such as mass flow or process pressure. A model based method could also increase the knowledge available about the load, leading to more efficient control methods and reduced energy consumption. A MATLAB Simulink model of the DTC drive was implemented using a DTC <b>drive</b> <b>block</b> from the SimPowerSystems library as basis. The original block speed controller relied on a speed measurement feedback, but a new speed, torque and flux estimator using only current and voltage measurements was implemented, and the speed measurement feedback replaced with a speed estimate feedback. Lab measurements from a preliminary project were analyzed and compared to the simulation setup results. A simplified transfer function from measured speed to DTC estimated speed is suggested. It is equal to the speed estimate low pass filter transfer function. Several analyses show this to be a good approximation. The unfiltered speed estimation is shown to have a very high accuracy of better than 0. 3 % error for applied load torque frequencies of up to 10 Hz, when the estimated data is used as input to frequency analyses. But the unfiltered speed signal also has a very high ripple, explaining the need for the low pass speed filter. The filtered speed estimate has some measurement errors, due to the damping in the speed filter. The estimated electromagnetic torque is very accurate, {{which is one of the}} strengths of DTC. The different parameters in the DTC setup, and their impact on the speed and torque estimates, were analyzed. The speed filter setting and the DTC speed sampling time was found to be the most important settings considering {{the accuracy of}} the speed estimation. Some improvements in the speed estimate calculation in the simulation model are suggested to improve the speed estimate. Improvements are also suggested for the ACS 800 DTC drive in the lab setup. Where increasing the memory available for sampling would significantly improve the frequency analyses...|$|E

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{breakdown}} {{point of the}} subsampling quantile of a general statistic, and show that it is increasing in the subsampling block size and the breakdown point of the statistic. These results imply fragile subsampling quantiles for moderate block sizes, also when subsampling procedures are applied to robust statistics. This instability is inherited by data <b>driven</b> <b>block</b> size selection procedures based on the minimum confidence interval volatility (MCIV) index. To overcome these problems, we propose for the linear regression setting a robust subsampling method, which implies a su±ciently high breakdown point and is consistent under standard conditions. Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analysis in the linear regression setting show that the robust subsampling with block size selection based on the MCIV index outperforms the subsampling, the classical bootstrap and the robust bootstrap, in terms of accuracy and robustness. These results show that robustness is a key aspect in selecting data <b>driven</b> subsampling <b>block</b> sizes. Subsampling, bootstrap, breakdown point, robustness, regression...|$|R
