In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} retirements over a 4 -year period among Australian general practitioners (UPs) and specialists aged 65 {{years and}} over, and factors influencing retirement. METHODS: Data from Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) {{for the years}} 2009 - 12 were analysed for 435 GPs and 643 specialists aged 65 years and over {{at the time of}} entry to the MABEL survey. Discrete time survival analysis was used. RESULTS: The retirement rates were 4. 1 % (2009), 5. 1 % (2010), 4. 2 % (2011) and 10. 4 % (2012). Retirement was associated with: (1) the intention to leave medical work in 2009 and 2010; (2) working <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> private consulting rooms in 2010 and 2012; (3) having lower job satisfaction in 2009 and 2011; (4) being older in 2009; (5) working <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> a public hospital in 2012; and (6) working <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> a private hospital in 2010. Doctors who intended to reduce their working hours were less likely to retire in 2009. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to support doctors at the late career stage to provide their valued contributions to the medical workforce {{for as long as possible}} may include increasing job satisfaction and addressing barriers to reducing work hours...|$|R
5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active for a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend on}} the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, a VNQDD member injured a {{policeman}} at a Hanoi checkpoint; at night, Arts students threw bombs at government buildings, which they regarded {{as part of}} the repressive power of the colonial state. On the night of February 1516, Học and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of Phu Duc and Vĩnh Bảo, in Thái Bình and Hải Dương provinces respectively, for a <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>In</b> the second village, the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD's last base at Co Am village; on the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior René Robin dispatched 200 Gardes indigènes, eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors. A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22, when Governor-General Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated. Học and his lieutenants, Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended.|$|E
5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring to a tree. During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up corms.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of very few varieties, known as teinturiers, most wine grapes produce clear or colorless juice. This includes such well known red wine grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir. The color in red wine comes from phenolics in the skin called anthocyanins that react with other components in wine (such as tannins, acetaldehyde and pyruvic acid) to form polymeric pigments. The anthocyanins are extracted from the skin {{during the process of}} maceration which can last from a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the case of some rosés (which usually only have 20–50mg/l of anthocyanins) to several days in the case of most red wines (which often have in excess of 250mg/l of anthocyanins).|$|E

25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> each cycle.|$|E
25|$|In 1354 Charles {{crossed the}} Alps without an army, {{received}} the Lombard crown in St. Ambrose Basilica, Milan, on 5January1355, and was crowned emperor at Rome by a cardinal in April {{of the same}} year.

He only remained in the city for a <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>in</b> spite of the expressed wishes of the Roman people. Having virtually abandoned all the Imperial rights in Italy, the emperor re-crossed the Alps, pursued by the scornful words of Petrarch, but laden with considerable wealth. On his return, Charles was occupied with the administration of the Empire, then just recovering from the Black Death, and in 1356 he promulgated the famous Golden Bull to regulate the election of the king.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses National Longitudinal Surveys data {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between part-week work and the wages and postschool human capital investment of married women. The empirical evidence presented is consistent with the hypothesis that part-week workers and their employers will have relatively lower incentive to invest in on-the-job training since part-week work means <b>fewer</b> <b>hours</b> <b>in</b> the labor market than full-week employment. The effect of part-week work by women on the male-female wage differential is ambiguous because the labor force participation of married women is discontinuous over the life cycle. ...|$|R
