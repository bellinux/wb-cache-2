40|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boats</b> were {{considered}} a negligible threat when the U. S. Navy focused on blue water operations away from shore. Now that the Navy's focus {{has shifted to}} the littorals, where these ships <b>patrol,</b> the <b>Fast</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boat's</b> potential as a credible adversary is gaining acceptance. Moreover, the threat may be greatly enhanced if <b>Fast</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boats</b> employ Commercial Off-The-Shelf Command and Control equipment to coordinate their efforts. This paper presents the design and results of a wargaming experiment conducted with Batman & Robin at the Naval Postgraduate School to examine this issue. The research question is how would U. S. Navy Surface Action Groups perform against <b>Fast</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boats</b> equipped with Commercial Off-The-Shelf Command and Control equipment which enables these comparatively unsophisticated ships to conduct coordinated attacks. The experiment also looked at two other factors: Surface Action Group work load, which might exacerbate the offensive capability of <b>Fast</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boats</b> conducting coordinated attacks with advanced Command and Control; {{and the quality of}} information our Surface Action Groups are provided which could likewise play a pivotal role in a confrontation or engagement. A two-cubed factorial experiment was conducted to test seven hypotheses. Data were collected on ten performance measures for 128 trials total. Significant results were obtained for three factors and three interactions. Operational explanations are provided[URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} adverse reproductive outcomes among {{male employees}} in the Royal Norwegian Navy exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields aboard <b>fast</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>boats.</b> Methods: Cohort study of Royal Norwegian Navy servicemen linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, including singleton offspring born between 1967 and 2008 (n = 37, 920). Exposure during the last 3 months before conception (acute) and exposure more than 3 months before conception (nonacute) were analyzed. Results: Perinatal mortality and preeclampsia increased after service aboard <b>fast</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>boats</b> during an acute period and also after increased estimated radiofrequency exposure during an acute period, compared with service aboard other vessels. No associations were found between nonacute exposure and any of the reproductive outcomes. Conclusions: Paternal work aboard <b>fast</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>boats</b> during an acute period was associated with perinatal mortality and preeclampsia, but the cause is not clear...|$|R
