5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by <b>industrial</b> <b>robots.</b> A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|The robot creator Doctor Light created two human-like robots with {{advanced}} artificial intelligence named Mega and Roll. Following this, he created eight more robots intended for industrial use: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, Elec Man, Time Man, and Oil Man. He received a Nobel Prize for Physics, and his old colleague and rival Doctor Wily has grown bitter {{for not being}} acknowledged {{for his work on}} the project. Wily discovered a prototype robot made by Doctor Light before Mega and Roll called Proto Man, who is in danger of having his energy generator go critical. Wily gave him a nuclear energy supply to extend his life. He later steals and reprograms the eight <b>industrial</b> <b>robots</b> to attempt world domination. Mega volunteered to stop Wily and the robots and was converted into a fighting robot called Mega Man. After defeating all eight robots, Mega Man goes through Dr. Wily's fortress and challenges him. After beating Wily, he surrenders and asks Mega Man to spare him.|$|E

The Human-Machine Interaction developed from using wired devices such as the mouse and the keyboard till using touch screens and nowadays is evolving to the gesture interaction. Simultaneously, the machine or the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> in particular is developing as well. The usual trend of using an <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> in a typical factory is to isolate it from the workers during the operation, due to the safety regulations. However, nowadays {{a new generation of}} a safe cooperative <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> exists. These robots are no longer dangerous to work around the humans. In a flexible manufacturing system, a cooperative scenario between the worker and the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> can achieve the flexible manufacturing objectives. Therefore, during this research we propose and implement a holonic control system architecture which connects the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> with the worker together in the same work environment in a flexible cooperative scenario. Moreover, we use the worker hand gestures to generate control events associated with the worker activities. Accordingly, the interaction between the worker and the <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> can be established...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{movement}} type in industrial production for the end-effector of <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> executing tasks according to desired track. High nonlinearity and coupling are shown from the dynamic characteristic of <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> because of the constrained relationship brought by desired task. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} establish dynamical equation with traditional Lagrange equation. Aiming at the dynamics modeling of <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> subject to constraint, the additional torque and dynamical equation of <b>industrial</b> <b>robot</b> subject to some desired trajectory is acquired based on the famous Udwadia–Kalaba equation in analytical mechanics field. The simple approach overcomes the disadvantage of obtaining dynamical equation from traditional Lagrange equation by Lagrange multiplier.
