40|$|Abstract Background Non-operative {{management}} of midshaft clavicle fractures is standard; however, surgical management is increasing. The {{purpose of this}} study is to compare the biomechanical performance of plate versus intramedullary fixation in cyclic bending for matched pairs of cadaveric clavicles. We hypothesized that the biomechanical properties are similar. Methods Eight sets of matched clavicles with vertical, midshaft osteotomies were prepared from fresh, frozen cadavers. A 3. 5 mm dynamic compression plate or a 3. 8 or 4. 5 mm intramedullary device were used for fixation. Clavicles were loaded in a four-point bend at 6 different loads for 3000 cycles at 1 Hz starting with 180 N and increasing by 180 N with sampling at 2 Hz. Failure was defined as 10 mm of displacement or catastrophic construct failure prior to 10 mm of displacement. Results Between constructs, there was a significant difference with large effect size in <b>displacement</b> at <b>fixed</b> loads of 180 N (P = 0. 001; Cohen's d = 1. 85), 360 N (P = 0. 033; Cohen's d = 1. 39), 540 N (P = 0. 003; Cohen's d = 0. 73) and 720 N (P = 0. 018; Cohen's d = 0. 72). There was a significant difference with large effect size in load at <b>fixed</b> <b>displacements</b> of 5 mm (P = 0. 001; Cohen's d = 1. 49), 7. 5 mm (P = 0. 011; Cohen's d = 1. 06), and 10 mm (P = 0. 026; Cohen's d = 0. 84). Conclusion Plate constructs are superior in showing less <b>displacement</b> at <b>fixed</b> loads and greater loads at <b>fixed</b> <b>displacements</b> over a broad range of loads and displacements with cyclic four-point bending. The clinical relevance is that plate fixation may provide a stronger construct for early rehabilitation protocols that focus on repetitive movements in the early pre-operative period. </p...|$|R

There are numerous configurations used for the exposed ends of the pistons but in all cases they bear against a cam. In variable displacement units, the cam is movable and commonly referred to as a swashplate, yoke or hanger. For conceptual purposes, the cam can be represented by a plane, the orientation of which, in combination with shaft rotation, provides the cam action that leads to piston reciprocation and thus pumping. The angle between a vector normal to the cam plane and the cylinder block axis of rotation, called the cam angle, is one variable that determines the displacement of the pump or the amount of fluid pumped per shaft revolution. Variable displacement units have the ability to vary the cam angle during operation whereas <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> units do not.|$|E

The three studies in this paper aim at explaining some of these discrepancies by clarifying to what extent listeners' emotional responses to microtiming depend {{on the distribution of}} microtiming deviations across instrumental parts (voicing) or other moderating factors like tempo or rhythmic density. The studies use data from two listening experiments involving expert bass and drums duo recordings in swing and funk style. – Study A investigates the effect of <b>fixed</b> time <b>displacements</b> within and between the parts played by different musicians. Listeners (n = 160) reacted negatively to irregularities within the drum track, but the mutual displacement of bass vs. drums did not have an effect. – Study B develops three metrics to calculate the average microtiming magnitude in a musical excerpt. The experiment showed that listeners' (n = 160) emotional responses to expert performance microtiming aligned with each other across styles, when microtiming magnitude was adjusted for rhythmic density. This indicates that rhythmic density is a unifying moderator for listeners' emotional response to microtiming in swing and funk. – Study C used the data from both experiments in order to compare the effect of <b>fixed</b> microtiming <b>displacements</b> (from Study A) with scaled versions of the originally performed microtiming patterns (from Study B).

5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be <b>fixed</b> <b>displacement</b> pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable displacement pumps, which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law.

5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (<b>fixed</b> <b>displacement)</b> {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E

40|$|The {{normal stress}} {{distribution}} across a slip plane {{has the effect}} of reducing the critical loading required for dislocation emission from a crack tip. The reduction by normal stresses was found to be very significant for Si, based on properties estimated for it using density functional theory, to be large for Fe as modeled by the embedded atom method (EAM), and to be smaller in AI, Ni and ordered Ni 3 A 1, estimated using the EAM. The general dependence over a wide range on parameters characterizing the tension-shear coupling was also determined. In the context of a Peierls model for dislocation nucleation at a crack tip (J. R. Rice, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 40 (1992) 239), our approach was to search for onset of the dislocation nucleation instability based on the numerical solution of the system of non-linear integral equations describing an incipient dislocation. The incipient dislocation consists of a distribution of sliding and opening displacements along a slip plane emanating from the crack tip; these displacements are related to the shear and tensile stresses across the slip plane by constitutive relations based on the atomic models mentioned. Results from the atomic models are used to parametrize constitutive relations involving a Frenkel sinusoidal dependence of shear stress on sliding <b>displacement</b> at any <b>fixed</b> opening <b>displacement,</b> and a Rose-Ferrante-Smith universal binding form of dependence of tensile stress on opening <b>displacement</b> at any <b>fixed</b> shear <b>displacement.</b> These relations then enter the system of integral equations, solved numerically, which describe the elasticity solution for a non-uniform distribution of sliding and opening along the sli...|$|R

Defining efficiency as 2 ̆ 2 desired output divided by required input, 2 ̆ 2 these traditional measures may not account for increase in required driving current or force. A sharp inside edge of a synthetic jet orifice can result in separated flow and increased momentum flux (due to the decreased flow area) for a <b>fixed</b> driver <b>displacement.</b> This can lead one to believe that efficiency has been improved, when, in reality, much more power was required for the driver.
