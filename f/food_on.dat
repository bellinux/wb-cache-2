5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} to walk on either two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for <b>food</b> <b>on</b> four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E

In The Rugrats Movie, the 1998 film based on the series, Tommy is prepared to pour banana baby <b>food</b> <b>on</b> his infant brother Dil, which would attract a group of vicious monkeys who would likely harm the young baby; the scene parallels the Sacrifice of Isaac, a primal covenant in Jewish studies.|$|E
5|$|Scotch bonnets are predators; {{they search}} for their <b>food</b> <b>on</b> sandy {{stretches}} of the ocean floor, where they consume echinoderms such as sand dollars, sea biscuits, and other sea urchins (such as Echinocardium cordatum), drilling into their tests {{with the aid of}} sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and <b>food</b> <b>on</b> the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E

5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably {{to protect it}} when searching for <b>food</b> <b>on</b> the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E
5|$|At the Sci-Fi Dine-In, lunch guests {{stay for}} an average of fifty minutes and dinner guests {{for an average}} of just longer than an hour, with lunch and dinner guests being served their <b>food</b> <b>on</b> average five and ten minutes after {{ordering}} respectively. The restaurant participates in the Disney Dining Plan. Meals are served starting at 10:30a.m. on Sundays and Wednesdays, and starting at 11:00a.m. every other day of the week. The restaurant closes each day {{at the same time that}} the park does, which is in the late evening. The menu is the same all day, without a distinction between lunch and dinner. A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for <b>food</b> <b>on</b> marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. <b>Food</b> <b>on</b> the black market was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration {{were involved in the}} black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their <b>food</b> <b>on</b> land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for <b>food</b> <b>on</b> dry land at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often {{alone or in}} a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning (chapter 38), the enthroned {{figure of}} High {{explains}} that Odin gives {{all of the}} <b>food</b> <b>on</b> his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin requires no food, for wine is to him both meat and drink. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza from the poem Grímnismál in support. In chapter 75 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál {{a list of names}} for wargs and wolves is provided that includes both Geri and Freki.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches forage along {{tree trunks}} and {{branches}} and {{are members of}} the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek <b>food</b> <b>on</b> rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for <b>food</b> <b>on</b> the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate <b>food</b> <b>on</b> tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island {{horses are}} a feral horse {{population}} that is entirely unmanaged: they {{are not subject to}} any kind of interference. Observational research, which is considered noninvasive to the herd, has been conducted by various entities over several decades. The population in recent years (2009 and onward) has varied between 400 and 550 animals. Due to the lack of predators, older horses often die of starvation after their teeth are worn down by a lifetime of exposure to sand and marram, a tough grass. A lack of nutritional <b>food</b> <b>on</b> the island limits the horses' size, and the offspring of those removed from the island and raised on better diets are significantly larger.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch forages alone, {{in pairs}} {{or in small}} groups of four to five individuals, though an unusual gathering of 21 individuals was observed in one tree in Bhutan. It often takes part in mixed-species foraging flocks, and has been notably observed feeding with the Himalayan cutia (Cutia nipalensis) and the velvet-fronted nuthatch (Sitta frontalis) – two other species that prospect for <b>food</b> <b>on</b> tree trunks. Other foraging flock partners surveyed are the long-tailed broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae), the lesser racket-tailed drongo (Dicrurus remifer), the maroon oriole (Oriolus traillii) and the white-browed scimitar babbler (Pomatorhinus schisticeps).|$|E
