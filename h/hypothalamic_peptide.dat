The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the in vivo effects of an intravenous bolus of LHRH and TRH on plasma interferon (IFN) -gamma production in five normoprolactinemic women with irregular menstrual cycles. We also determined prolactin (PRL), thyrotropin (TSH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels before and after intravenous administration of LHRH and TRH. The results demonstrate that intravenous bolus of LHRH/TRH increases plasma IFN-gamma levels, with the maximum response 45 min after in vivo administration of <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>peptides</b> and after peak levels of adenohypophyseal hormones (PRL: 15 min; TSH: 30 min; FSH: 30 min; LH: 30 min). In order to investigate a possible direct action of hypothalamic hormones on immune cells, we also evaluated, in the same subjects, the influence of LHRH and TRH on IFN-gamma production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), collected before the intravenous administration of the peptides and stimulated in vitro with bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) and concanavalin A (Con A). LHRH and TRH, separately and together, significantly enhanced in vitro IFN-gamma production by SEA- and ConA-activated PBMCs.

40|$|Carter, K. and Lester, E. The role of <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>peptides</b> in consummatory feeding behavior. There are two {{components}} of feeding behavior {{that are highly}} regulated, an appetitive component, which involves the motivated acquisition of food, and the consummatory component, which involves the chewing and swallowing of food once {{it is in the}} mouth. Norepinephrine (NE), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and Agouti-gene-related protein (AgRP) were administered intracranially into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) {{to examine the effects of}} these peptides on consummatory feeding behavior in the rat. Milk was subsequently infused intraorally through a chronic cheek fistula until rejected in order to measure the consummatory food intake. It was found that injection of NE, NPY, and AgRP all significantly increased intraoral intake. In conjunction with prior research, these findings suggest that NE, NPY, and AgRP all increase feeding. These results show that these peptides increase both the appetitive and consummatory feeding behaviors in response to intracranial injection into the PVN. Because all NE innervation of the PVN and approximately 50 % of the NPY innervation arises from hindbrain NE and NPY neurons, the findings from this study are in agreement with other studies suggesting that the circuitry for consummatory ingestive responses is controlled in part by hindbrain mechanisms.

Based on this theoretical framework, we discuss translational implications for clinical trials and identify open questions for future research.
