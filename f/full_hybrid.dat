25|$|The Prius is a {{power-split}} or series-parallel (<b>full)</b> <b>hybrid,</b> {{sometimes referred}} to as a combined hybrid, a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline or electric power or both. Wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25 (0.29 for 2000 model) with a Kammback design to reduce air resistance. Lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction. An electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts. In the US and Canada, a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time. The Prius engine makes use of the Atkinson cycle.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 15 th Global Warming International Conference in San Francisco, April 22, 2004 This paper {{is concerned with the}} present status and future projections for emerging technologies that can be utilized in light-duty vehicles in the next five to ten years to significantly reduce their CO 2 emissions. The emerging technologies considered are modern clean diesel engines and hybrid-electric powertrains using batteries and/or ultracapacitors for energy storage. Throughout the study, six classes of vehiclesâ€”compact passenger cars to large SUVsâ€”were considered. For each vehicle class, computer simulations (Advisor 2002) and cost analyses were performed for conventional ICE and mild and <b>full</b> parallel <b>hybrids</b> using port-fuel injected and lean burn gasoline engines and direct-injection turbo-charged diesel engines to determine the fuel economy and differential costs for the various vehicle designs using the conventional gasoline PFI engine vehicle as the baseline. CO 2 emissions (gmCO 2 /mi) for each driveline and vehicle case were calculated from the fuel economy values. On a percentage or ratio basis, the analyses indicated that the fuel economy gains, CO 2 emissions reductions, and cost/price increases due {{to the use of the}} advanced engines and hybrid-electric drivelines were essentially independent of vehicle class. This means that a regulation specifying the same fractional reductions in CO 2 emissions for all the vehicle classes would not favor one class over the others. The results of the study were then used to calculate the increase in the CAFE standard (miles per gallon gasoline for the new car fleet) that was feasible using each of the emerging technologies and the associated vehicle price increase that would be incurred. It was determined that the CAFE standard could be increased to 38 mpg and 48 mpg using the PFI and lean-burn gasoline engines, respectively, in mild hybrids with an associated percentage price increase of 7 - 9 %. The CAFE standard could be increased to 42 mpg and 52 mpg using the PFI and lean-burn gasoline engines, respectively, in <b>full</b> <b>hybrids</b> with an associated cost increase of 16 - 18 %. The CAFE increases using the diesel engines in mild hybrids were close to those of gasoline engines in <b>full</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The vehicle price increases using diesel engines in hybrids were 17 - 23 % compared to the baseline ICE vehicles using the PFI engine. The fleet CO 2 emissions corresponding to the cited CAFE standards were 185 - 234 gmCO 2 /mi for the mild hybrids using gasoline engines and 170 - 208 gmCO 2 /mi for <b>full</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The corresponding values using diesel engines are 189 - 216 gmCO 2 /mi.

25|$|Mild hybrid, is {{a vehicle}} that cannot be driven solely on its {{electric}} motor, because the electric motor {{does not have enough}} power to propel the vehicle on its own. Mild hybrids only include some of the features found in hybrid technology, and usually achieve limited fuel consumption savings, up to 15 percent in urban driving and 8 to 10 percent overall cycle. A mild hybrid is essentially a conventional vehicle with oversize starter motor, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly and cleanly. The motor is often mounted between the engine and transmission, taking the place of the torque converter, and is used to supply additional propulsion energy when accelerating. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the gasoline engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, the motor is used for regenerative braking to recapture energy. As compared to <b>full</b> <b>hybrids,</b> mild hybrids have smaller batteries and a smaller, weaker motor/generator, which allows manufacturers to reduce cost and weight.|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this section}} is to {{highlight}} the novelty introduced by the present approach. First of all, it is worth analyzing the results achieved {{so far in the}} literature on the same topic, that is, the coexistence of some synchronization types in different dimensional fractional-order chaotic systems. This topic is almost unexplored in the literature [31, 32]. For example, in [31] the authors have presented a hybrid synchronization method for fractional-order systems, which is a combination of only two synchronization types, that is, generalized synchronization and inverse generalized synchronization. Our approach is more general than that in [31], since it guarantees the coexistence of three different synchronization types, that is, identical synchronization (IS), antiphase synchronization (AS), and inverse <b>full</b> state <b>hybrid</b> projective synchronization (IFSHPS). Another method for fractional-order systems has been developed in [32], where a combination of <b>full</b> state <b>hybrid</b> projective synchronization (FSHPS) and inverse <b>full</b> state <b>hybrid</b> projective synchronization (IFSHPS) has been presented. However, the method in [32] can only be applied to incommensurate systems, besides the fact that it allows the coexistence of only two synchronization types. Our approach is more general than that in [32], since it can be applied to both commensurate and incommensurate systems (see Theorems 3 and 4, respectively), besides the fact that it guarantees the coexistence of three different synchronization types (instead of only two, as in [32]).|$|R
