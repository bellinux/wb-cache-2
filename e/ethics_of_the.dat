5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|On August 28, the {{occupation}} of Japan led by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers began. The surrender ceremony was held on September 2, aboard the United States Navy battleship , at which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, thereby ending the hostilities. Allied civilians and military personnel alike celebrated V-J Day, {{the end of the}} war; however, some isolated soldiers and personnel from Japan's far-flung forces throughout Asia and the Pacific islands refused to surrender for months and years afterwards, some even refusing into the 1970s. The role of the atomic bombings in Japan's unconditional surrender, and the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two attacks, is still debated. The state of war formally ended when the Treaty of San Francisco came into force on April 28, 1952. Four more years passed before Japan and the Soviet Union signed the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which formally brought an end to their state of war.|$|E
5|$|Lou coerces Nina into a {{date and}} threatens {{to end his}} {{business}} with her unless she has sex with him, knowing her job depends on his footage; she reluctantly agrees. The next day he turns down a business offer from Loder, who beats him to an important plane crash story later that night. Nina berates Lou to get better footage and keep his end of their bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joe's van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath. Later, Lou and Rick arrive before the police {{at the site of}} a home invasion in an affluent neighborhood. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the victims in the house. The news staff fret over the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri (Michael Hyatt) questions Lou about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the home invasion, cutting out the parts with the gunmen. That night, he and Rick track down the gunmen; Lou plans to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Lou's crimes; Lou agrees.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure {{the protection of the}} seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|A Tale of a Tub was {{the first}} major work written by Jonathan Swift, arguably his most {{difficult}} satire and perhaps his most masterly. The Tale is a prose parody divided into sections each delving into the morals and <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English. Composed between 1694 and 1697, it was eventually published in 1704. It was long regarded as a satire on religion, and has famously been attacked for that, starting with William Wotton.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis {{interpreted the}} biblical phrase heed my ordinance (Hebrew: ushmartem et mishmarti), which {{appears in the}} holiness code, to mean that they should (metaphorically) create a protective fence around the biblical laws, an attitude particularly expressed by The <b>Ethics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fathers (a Mishnaic tractate discussing the ethics surrounding adherence to biblical rules).

The bar or bat mitzvah ceremony is usually held on the first Shabbat after a boy's thirteenth and a girl's twelfth birthday (or thirteenth in Reform congregations).|$|E
