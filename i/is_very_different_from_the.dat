5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926. Petrie says that he made 220 measurements, and records slight grooves across the neck, and from the shoulders down to the armpits. He also notes a row of pits suggesting {{the place of the}} spine. He concludes that the Giant <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Spira is {{the fictional}} world of the Square {{role-playing}} video games Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2. Spira is the first Final Fantasy world to feature consistent, all-encompassing spiritual and mythological influences within the planet's civilizations and their inhabitants' daily lives. The world of Spira itself <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainly European-style worlds found in previous Final Fantasy games, being much more closely modeled on southeast Asia, most notably with respect to its vegetation, topography and architecture.|$|E
5|$|From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel {{was built}} on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta. The Order's last major {{fortification}} in the harbour area was Fort Tigné, built at Tigné Point between 1793 and 1795. It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it {{has been described as}} among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort. Many other polygonal forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost double that of radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it {{would be one of the}} densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E
5|$|The Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Ragusa Superiore {{was built}} between 1718 and 1778. Its {{principal}} façade is pure Baroque, containing fine carvings and sculptures. The cathedral {{has a high}} Sicilian belfry in the same style. The ornate Baroque interior is separated into three colonnaded aisles (Illustration 3). Ragusa Superiore, the most badly damaged part of the town, was replanned following 1693 around the cathedral and displays an unusual phenomenon of Sicilian Baroque: the palazzi here are peculiar to this town, of only two storeys and long, with the central bay only emphasised by a balcony and an arch to the inner garden. This very Portuguese style, probably designed to minimise damage in future earthquakes, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, which are in true Sicilian style. Unusually, Baroque lingered on here until the early 19th century. The last palazzo built here was in the Baroque form but with columns of Roman Doric and neoclassical balconies.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

5|$|Today's {{economic}} position <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, {{when its}} prosperity {{was based on}} chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the carriage works (known as Asea Brown Boveri or ABB {{at the time of}} closure), which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestlé York (formerly Nestlé Rowntrees) and home to the KitKat and eponymous Yorkie bar chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, makers of the Chocolate Orange, was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland. The historic factory building is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, {{the sight of the}} other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

25|$|Hindemith {{is among}} the most {{significant}} German composers of his time. His early works are in a late romantic idiom, and he later produced expressionist works, rather in the style of early Arnold Schoenberg, before developing a leaner, contrapuntally complex style in the 1920s. This style has been described as neoclassical, but <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> works by Igor Stravinsky labeled with that term, owing more to the contrapuntal language of Johann Sebastian Bach and Max Reger than the Classical clarity of Mozart.|$|E

25|$|The folk {{religious}} practices offer {{a very different}} aspect of life from the Buddhist practices. Burmese folk faith consists of {{many different kinds of}} festivals that all involve singing and dancing, drinking and merriment, or nat-pwes. These festivals are a way for people to let go, and enjoy themselves. This idea of relieving stress and indulging in various pleasures <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional doctrine of Buddhism, which emphasises losing all desires. This can often be done by fasting or through deep meditation in a quiet temple. These traditional Buddhist practices offer a starkly different way of achieving religious consciousness.|$|E
