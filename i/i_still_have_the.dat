500|$|In September 2010, Waters {{commenced}} The Wall Live tour, {{an updated}} version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall. Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it." [...] At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing [...] "Comfortably Numb", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for [...] "Outside the Wall". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. As of 2013, The Wall Live is the highest-grossing tour of all time by a solo artist. Waters performed at [...] at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. Waters was accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} his lyrical content relatively {{similar to the}} group's prior releases: [...] "The topics are universal. There {{is a lot of}} angst that could be teen angst or it could be angst of everyday life. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same emotions I had 20 years ago – I get frustrated or I get excited. I still feel like I'm falling in love with my wife." [...] Hoppus considered common topics he wrote about to be [...] "miscommunication, loss of identity and questioning of identity which is a process we went through just by being in the studio, writing a new Blink record and having a new iteration of Blink." [...] Though in the past he preferred to ruminate on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things." [...] Hoppus's self-doubt on his own creative process is referenced in the opening lyrics of [...] "Cynical". [...] "I start every song with this fear, thinking I'm never going to write another good song," [...] he told Upset. Skiba said {{that at the time of}} writing the album, he and Hoppus were both reading books such as , Blood Meridian, and The Revenant, and he felt the prose impacted their lyrics: [...] "there were a lot of rushing rivers and the whole idea of using metaphors to describe loneliness, just like settler, Native American and Southern Gothic influence of literature, that was kind of our rhyming dictionary." ...|$|E
2500|$|By a month later, McCain demurred {{from putting}} too much {{stress on the}} effect the {{economic}} crisis had had on his {{chance to win the}} presidency: [...] "That would sound like I am detracting from President-elect Obama's campaign. I don't want to do that... Nobody likes a sore loser." [...] McCain said, [...] "I spent a period of time feeling sorry for myself. It's wonderful. It's one of the most enjoyable experiences that you can have. But the point is: You've got to move on ... I'm still a senator from the state of Arizona. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> privilege and honor of serving this country, which I've done all my life, and it's a great honor to do so." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} by the Arizona Republic Newspaper, {{he was asked}} about his many patents that expiredtoo early for him to capitalize on them. He responded with a smile, saying: [...] "I was born thirty-five years too soon. If <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> patents on my inventions, Bill Gates would have to stand aside for me." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{walked along}} the dark streets, running like thieves round corners when we heard the heavy {{footsteps}} of the watch. The Palazzo Aste was all dark; we waited outside a little while, but no one came, and I dared not knock. Then I remembered <b>the</b> side door. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> key, and <b>I</b> took it from my pocket.|$|R
2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Further {{than the}} brief answer I first gave, Nic, don't press me to-night. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> old affection for you, or I {{should not have}} sought you. Let that suffice for the moment.' ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{was upset}} there weren't {{four or five}} more rounds in there. After that, I ran and jumped in a ditch. The dumbest thing is, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> service {{revolver}} in my hand. I was afraid when more police came they'd think I {{was one of the}} gunman. So I put it behind me and said, 'They went that way.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|On 14 September 2007, Grönholm {{announced}} long-rumoured {{plans to}} retire from rallying {{at the end of}} the 2007 season, stating that [...] "I wanted to stop while <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> speed to win rallies. I didn't want to leave the decision too late so that I wasn't capable of winning any longer", also citing the opportunity ahead of him to potentially retire as a three-time World Rally Champion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go!" [...] she said, {{once more}} {{pointing}} toward the peaceful and distant horizon now wrapped in the veil of night. [...] "Go! while <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> strength to keep silent, save for a prayer for your safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'm {{not quite}} so sure about you," [...] he observed, {{watching}} the colour rise quickly in her cheeks. [...] "Off with you to dress, young woman. It's past seven, and we must be there early. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> wine to order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Anton, Yes, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ring. I {{should be}} very {{glad to see you}} again. You can come here to college for me, or I will meet you somewhere in the town. Will you let me know? Your sincere friend----" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> idea of remaking Billa. The same {{producer}} came up {{with the}} proposal of remaking it with Ravi Teja as hero. I watched the movie again with Ravi Teja in my mind. I modified certain scenes to suit him. Then I opined that a high budget film might not work out with Ravi Teja as hero. The producer will end up suffering for the kind of budget we ask for. Hence we collectively decided not to make the movie.|$|R
5000|$|Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani {{chimed in}} and {{suggested}} that the court decision in Delaware would harm Delaware's status as a popular business incorporation state. NY Justice Schweitzer also publicly commented on the case in Delaware, saying, [...] "I was kind of shocked at how extreme the result was... The company is still doing phenomenally well and I thought there were steps {{that should have been}} taken short of ordering a sale. That's would I would <b>have</b> done if <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> case." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the fresh}} air my senses {{gradually}} came back to me, and I began to understand why it was I {{could not see the}} cow. The reason was that the house was between us. By some mysterious process I had been discharged into <b>the</b> back garden. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> milking-stool in my hand, but the cow no longer troubled me. Let her see if she could wake Veronica by merely bellowing outside the door; it was more than I had ever been able to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{glad to have you}} with me," [...] Captain Martin said. [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> supercargo, but that is not like going ashore and seeing people one's self. However, we can go on as we are for a bit. You have been {{striking}} a blow for freedom, lad, I mean to do my best to strike one tomorrow or next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was a most}} disagreeable child, perverse,--cantankerous--I {{can hear}} my mother saying it! As for the gardens--they have given me {{something}} to do, they have kept me out of mischief. I suppose I ought to be thankful, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> rebellious streak when I see what others have done, what others are doing, and I sometimes wonder what right I ever had to think that I might create something worth while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> best of it, for my romance {{finished}} up delightfully, as you shall hear. We did well all winter, and no wonder. What was {{needed was a}} little 'boost' in the right direction, and I could give it; so my Millers were much comforted, and we were good friends. But in March Grammer died suddenly, and poor Almiry mourned {{as if she had}} been the sweetest mother in the world. The old lady's last wishes were to be 'laid out harnsome in a cap with a pale blue satin ribbin, white wasn't becomin', to hev at least three carriages to the funeral, and be sure a paper with her death in it was sent to N. Baxter, Westminster, Vermont.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite this, Cook {{went on to}} {{pass for}} 1,854 yards and led the Bengals to wins over the Chiefs and the Oakland Raiders, {{two of the three}} best teams in the AFL. His 9.411 yards per pass attempt and 17.5 yard per {{completion}} are rookie records that still stand. Cook was UPI's choice for AFL Rookie of the year. Cook recalled, [...] "I took cortisone shots and played in pain, but the shoulder hadn't started to deteriorate yet, so <b>I</b> could <b>still</b> function. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> strength. <b>I</b> felt obligated to finish the season. I'd gotten off to a good start. I didn't want to relinquish that." ...|$|R
60|$|Poor little Flossie cried very much, {{and gave}} me a lock of her bright hair in return, which <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have.</b> <b>The</b> cheque I gave her was for a {{thousand}} pounds (which being now well off, and having no calls upon me except those of charity, I could well afford), and in the note I directed her father to invest it for her in Government security, and when she married or came of age to buy her the best diamond necklace he could get for the money and accumulated interest. I chose diamonds because I think that now that King Solomon's Mines are lost to the world, their price will never be much lower than it is at present, so that if in after-life she should ever be in pecuniary difficulties, she will be able to turn them into money.|$|E
6000|$|I {{note with}} pride and {{pleasure}} that I told no untruths in my unsent answer. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> habit of keeping unfinished books lying around years and years, waiting. I have four or five novels on hand at present in a half-finished condition, and {{it is more than}} three years since I have looked at any of them. I have no intention of finishing them. I could complete all of them in less than a year, if the impulse should come powerfully upon me: Long, long ago money-necessity furnished that impulse once, ("Following the Equator"), but mere desire for money has never furnished it, so far as I remember. Not even money-necessity was able to overcome me on a couple of occasions when perhaps I ought to have allowed it to succeed. While I was a bankrupt and in debt two offers were made me for weekly literary contributions to continue during a year, and they would have made a debtless man of me, but I declined them, with my wife's full approval, for I had known of no instance where a man had pumped himself out once a week and failed to run [...] "emptyings" [...] before the year was finished.|$|E
6000|$|She {{opened her}} lips to speak, but he lifted his hand and went on. [...] "Listen before you give that ready answer which it {{is so hard to}} recall, or smooth away. I know all my disadvantages, my years, which to you may seem many; my modest origin; my trade, which, not {{altogether}} without reason, you despise and dislike. Well, the first two cannot be changed except for the worse; the second can be, and already is, buried beneath the gold and ermine of wealth and titles. What does it matter if I am the son of a City clerk who never earned more than £2 a week and was born in a tenement at Battersea, when I am one of the rich men of this rich land and shall die a peer in a palace, leaving millions and honours to my children? As for the third, my occupation, I am prepared to give it up. It has served my turn, and after next week I shall have earned the amount that years ago I determined to earn. Thenceforth, set above the accidents of fortune, I propose to devote myself to higher aims, those of legitimate ambition. So far as my time would allow I have already taken some share in politics as a worker; I intend to continue in them as a ruler which <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> health and ability to do. I mean {{to be one of the}} first men in this Empire, to ride to power over the heads of all the nonentities whose only claim upon the confidence of their countrymen is that they were born in a certain class, with money in their pockets and without the need to spend the best of their manhood in work. With you at my side I can do all these things and more, and such is the future that I have to offer you." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1963, North's mother {{enrolled}} him in prep school, but due to his part-time education while filming Dennis The Menace, combined with not having been allowed to socialize with other children, he struggled {{to keep up with}} his studies at his new school and was nervous interacting with the other students. [...] North continued to audition, and in 1964, he appeared in an episode of Wagon Train, but found himself typecast as the impish Dennis Mitchell and had trouble finding steady work. [...] In 1999, North told the E! network, [...] "I <b>had</b> to fight <b>the</b> ghost of Dennis the Menace, and I was typecast. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> face, and that's what casting directors, producers and directors saw when I would go in to read for a role." ...|$|R

6000|$|I am not sure, but I {{think it}} was through some volume which I found in his charge that I first came to know of De Quincey; {{he was fond of}} Dr. Holmes's poetry; he loved Whittier and Longfellow, each {{represented}} in his slender stock by some distinctive work. There were several stray volumes of Thackeray's minor writings, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> 'Yellowplush Papers' in the smooth red cloth (now pretty well tattered) of Appleton's Popular Library, which I bought there. But most of the books were in the famous old brown cloth of Ticknor & Fields, which was a warrant of excellence in the literature it covered. Besides these there were standard volumes of poetry, published by Phillips & Sampson, from worn- out plates; for a birthday present my mother got me Wordsworth in this shape, and I am glad to think that I once read the [...] "Excursion" [...] in it, for I do not think I could do so now, and I have a feeling that it is very right and fit to have read the [...] "Excursion." [...] To be honest, it was very hard reading even then, and I cannot truthfully pretend that I have ever liked Wordsworth except in parts, though for the matter of that, I do not suppose that any one ever did. I tried hard enough to like everything in him, for I had already learned enough to know that I ought to like him, and that if I did not, it was a proof of intellectual and moral inferiority in me. My early idol, Pope, had already been tumbled into the dust by Lowell, whose lectures on English Poetry had lately been given in Boston, and had met with my rapturous acceptance in such newspaper report as I had of them. So, my preoccupations were all in favor of the Lake School, and it was both in my will and my conscience to like Wordsworth. If I did not do so it was not my fault, and the fault remains very much what it first was.|$|E

You may smile as I do at the sometimes sophomoric aspect of his excitement, but I hope you will respect, as I do, the purity of his feeling and the honest concern which he had in his heart for the basic problem of mankind, which is to dignify our lives with a certain freedom.|$|R
