5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), <b>frosted</b> <b>elfin</b> (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E

40|$|Historically {{the natural}} habitat for this species was grassy {{openings}} dominated by Andropogon spp. and burned areas in oak barrens and savannas with sandy/rocky soils. Today, the species occurs mostly in open habitats created and maintained by human {{activities such as}} powerline and railroad right of ways, along sand or gravel roads in dry woods and barrens habitats, and around rock outcrops and old gravel pits. Active roadways with host plants are not good habitat because annual spring mowing will kill the larvae, and vehicle traffic will drive off adults. Nearby tree cover is an important habitat component, because it provides shelter from the wind and sun. Adult males tend to congregate in open grassy areas with food plants in cool to moderate weather where they defend grass clumps, but they often move to shady woodland edges at about 82 °F. <b>Frosted</b> <b>elfins</b> occur in two population types, one with caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus perennis), {{and the other with}} caterpillars that feed on wild indigo (Baptisia tinctoria). All populations in Pennsylvania are thought to be wild indigo feeders, even if lupine is also available. Adults are usually found very close to wild indigo plants (e. g. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{recorded}} five {{species of}} elfins (Callophrys) during annual spring surveys targeting <b>frosted</b> <b>elfin</b> C. irus (state-listed as threatened) in 19 pine-oak barrens in central Wisconsin USA during 1994 – 2013. At the northwest {{end of its}} range here, C. irus co-varied with spring temperature, but declined significantly over time (eight sites verified extant of originally 17). Two other specialists increased significantly. The northern specialist, hoary elfin C. polios (nine sites), correlated positively with the previous year’s growing season precipitation. The southern specialist, Henry’s elfin C. henrici (11 sites), co-varied with winter precipitation and spring temperature and dryness. The two resident generalists had stable trends. For all species, the first observed date per year became earlier over time and varied more than the last observed date. Thus, flight period span increased with earlier first observed dates. Elfin abundance increased significantly with earlier first observed dates in the current and/or prior year. Three species (C. irus, C. henrici, a generalist) had more positive population trends in reserves than non-reserves. This suggests that C. irus declines correspond to habitat conditions. Thus, monitoring programs and habitat management specifically for C. irus appear necessary to obtain a long-term stable trend for this species in Wisconsin...|$|E
40|$|Butterflies {{such as the}} atala hairstreak, Eumaeus atala Poey, and the <b>frosted</b> <b>elfin,</b> Callophrys irus Godart, are {{restricted}} to frequently disturbed habitats where their larval host plants occur. Pupae of these butterflies are noted to reside {{at the base of}} host plants or in the leaf litter and soil, which may allow them to escape direct mortality by fire, a prominent disturbance in many areas they inhabit. The capacity of these species to cope with fire is a critical consideration for land management and conservation strategies in the locations where they are found. Survival of E. atala pupae in relation to temperature and duration of heat pulse was tested using controlled water bath experiments and a series of prescribed fire field experiments. Survival of E. atala pupae was correlated to peak temperature and heat exposure in both laboratory and field trials. In addition, E. atala survival following field trials was correlated to depth of burial; complete mortality was observed for pupae at the soil surface. Fifty percent of E. atala survived the heat generated by prescribed fire when experimentally placed at depths ≥ 1. 75 cm, suggesting that pupation of butterflies in the soil at depth can protect from fatal temperatures caused by fire. For a species such as E. atala that pupates above ground, a population reduction from a burn event is a significant loss, and so decreasing the impact of prescribed fire on populations is critical...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2015. Major: Natural Resources Science and Management. Advisor: Linda Nagel. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 230 pages. Midwestern oak savannas {{are among the}} rarest ecosystems in North America. While these systems were historically fairly common across the Midwestern United States and Canada, a combination of land use change and fire suppression has led to significant habitat loss [...] {{it is estimated that}} {{less than one percent of}} the pre-European settlement oak savanna remains on the landscape. As a result, many species associated with oak savanna systems have become threatened or endangered, such as the Karner Blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), <b>frosted</b> <b>elfin</b> (Callophrys irus), and Persius duskywing (Erynnis persius). In addition, the removal of fire from the landscape has resulted in the mesophication of many oak-dominated systems and a loss of early-successional oak habitat across the Eastern United States. In the context of global environmental change, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the structure and function of rare ecosystems, especially in the context of changing disturbance regimes. In addition, climate change is likely to alter the geographic ranges and distribution of suitable habitat for a number of taxa. Because resources are often limited in conservation and restoration efforts, effectively identifying the most viable sites for management is critically important, in both the short- and long-term. In this context, the work presented here explores the plant community composition of Michigan oak savannas, their response to different management approaches, and the use of the Karner Blue butterfly and other rare species as focal points for site selection at the management-scale, and regionally in the context of climate change. As a whole, the results of this work address several knowledge gaps regarding oak savannas, and Michigan oak savannas in particular. Results suggest that sites within the same oak savanna community type can have quantifiably distinct plant communities as a result of differences in disturbance regime. The demonstrated importance of disturbance frequency and type is further illustrated in a restoration experiment, where results suggest that shear cutting trees may be the most effective mechanical harvesting approach for meeting local management goals. In addition to site-level characteristics, this work indicates that both landscape-level environmental factors as well as climatic factors are important in defining habitat suitability for the Karner Blue, an important and endangered oak savanna indicator species. Finally, this research suggests that climate change is likely to have variable but significant (in terms of conservation) effects on the distribution and accessibility of suitable habitat for three rare oak savanna butterflies...|$|E
