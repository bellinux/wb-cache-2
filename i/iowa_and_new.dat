5|$|Bayh spent a {{considerable}} amount of time campaigning throughout the early primary states (particularly <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire) for most of 2005 and 2006. The staff from his All America Political Action Committee (PAC) worked as his campaign team.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{continued}} {{campaigning in}} <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire visiting {{up to four}} different cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Chris Dodd was launched on January 11, 2007 and ended on January 3, 2008 after a sixth-place {{finish in the}} Iowa caucuses. Dodd, the Senior Senator from Connecticut, sought the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Centering his campaign in the strategically important states of <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, he tried to bring forth a platform of change. Dodd's performance in the opinion polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who had sufficiently funded his campaign.|$|E

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the range of}} the mockingbird {{expanded}} northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, <b>Iowa,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties. Islands that saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
25|$|Romney was {{the first}} {{candidate}} in the 2008 election to begin airing TV and radio advertisements, beginning in February 2007. His advertisements, most of which focus primarily on Romney's conservative credentials, have aired mainly in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, which experts credit with helping his early lead in those and other early primary states. Romney's campaign advisors explained that their early advertisement push was {{to make up for}} Romney being relatively unknown compared to contenders Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Fred Thompson. On September 4, 2007, Romney was estimated to have spent $2 million in advertisements in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} New Hampshire primary the {{following}} week, Iowa's caucuses {{have become the}} starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president. The national and international media give <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage. Those who enter the caucus race often expend enormous effort to reach voters in each of Iowa's 99 counties.|$|E
25|$|The {{role played}} by the Iowa Caucuses is viewed with envy by states across the country. Traditionally, Iowa has been first and then {{followed}} by the state of New Hampshire, but states such as South Carolina, Nevada, and Florida have been moving up the dates of their presidential primaries to try to capture some of the media and political attention that <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire receive.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{candidates}} started their campaigns in mid-2011, but after the first two primaries in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, only four well-funded campaigns (Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, and Paul) remained for the Republican Party nomination; Gary Johnson had withdrawn to run on the Libertarian ticket, and Buddy Roemer sought the American Elect nomination. At the beginning of May, Gingrich and Santorum suspended their campaigns; Romney was widely reported as the presumptive nominee, with Paul the only other major candidate running an active campaign.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the {{primaries}} and caucuses, Richardson lagged behind fellow Democrats in polling data. Despite campaigning heavily in early {{states such as}} <b>Iowa,</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, <b>and</b> Nevada, Richardson continued to barely register in polls. Richardson competed only in the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire primary due to his withdrawal prior to caucuses in Nevada.|$|R
25|$|Mike Huckabee's {{results in}} the opinion polls rose from 29% in the Des Moines Register's poll in late November 2007. Mitt Romney rose two points from 24% in November to 26% in December. John McCain enjoyed the biggest {{increase}} from November, increasing six points from 7% to 13%, while Rudy Giuliani suffered the biggest drop from November, decreasing eight points from 13% to 5%. Giuliani's large drop was attributed to his strategy of skipping early states such as <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire in favor of larger, delegate-rich states such as Florida, California, and New York. No other candidate polled more than 10%.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in 1924 in Joliet, Illinois. Son of a Baptist minister, he lived in various {{communities}} in Illinois, Indiana, <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York State. During World War II he served as an ensign in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific theater. In 1946 he married Mary Beck (better known later as Becky) and in 1948 completed his B.A. degree in history at Wheaton College (Illinois). Becky and Edward studied descriptive linguistics at the Summer Institute of Linguistics program at the University of Oklahoma. In 1951 they went {{to live in the}} Mexican state of Sonora to live with the Seri people and learn the Seri language {{under the auspices of the}} Summer Institute of Linguistics.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in modern Republican Party history, three {{different}} candidates won the first three state contests in January (the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, and the South Carolina primary). Although Romney had been expected to win in at least <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, Rick Santorum won the non-binding poll at caucus sites in Iowa by 34 votes, as near as can be determined from the incomplete tally, earning him a declaration as winner by state party leaders, although vote totals were missing from eight precincts. The election of county delegates at the caucuses would eventually lead to Ron Paul earning 22 of the 28 Iowa delegates to the Republican National Convention. Newt Gingrich won South Carolina by a surprisingly large margin, and Romney won only in New Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|A McCain victory {{quickly became}} {{improbable}} as Obama amassed early wins {{in his home}} state of Illinois, the Northeast, and the critical battleground states of Ohio (which no Republican has ever been elected President without winning) and Pennsylvania by 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and his home state of Arizona. McCain, unlike Bush in 2000 and 2004, failed to win all the southern states: Obama won Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia. Obama also won the hotly contested states of <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Mexico, which Al Gore had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since 1940 (1964 being the other), Indiana went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since Richard Nixon in 1972.|$|E

500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire. When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E
