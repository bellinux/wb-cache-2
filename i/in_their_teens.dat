5|$|Comics {{historian}} Peter Sanderson {{compares the}} 1960s DC {{to a large}} Hollywood studio, and argues that after having reinvented the superhero archetype, DC by {{the latter part of}} the decade was suffering from a creative drought. The audience for comics was no longer just children, and Sanderson sees the 1960s Marvel as the comic equivalent of the French New Wave, developing new methods of storytelling that drew in and retained readers who were <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>teens</b> and older and thus influencing the comics writers and artists of the future.|$|E
5|$|Lowland Scotland {{was part}} of the pattern of late {{marriage}} {{for both men and women}} (between the mid and late 20s), with a relatively large proportion of the population remaining unmarried. In the Highland and Islands marriage ages may have been lower and more closely resembled Gaelic Ireland. Throughout the period, women could legally marry from the age of 12 and boys from 14. However, while many girls from the social elite married <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>teens,</b> most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature and the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s. They could also act as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in Scotland kinship was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor. Women {{retained}} their original surname at marriage, symbolising that they did not join their husband's kin, and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>teens,</b> most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties, by which they accrued resources, status and skills {{that would allow them to}} establish a household. Normally marriage followed handfasting, a period of betrothal, which in the Highlands may have effectively been a period of trial marriage, in which sexual activity may have been accepted as legitimate. Highland women, based on the higher birth rate of the Highlands, might have married earlier than their Lowland counterparts.|$|E

25|$|Antiandrogens affect {{existing}} {{facial hair}} only slightly; patients may see slower growth and some reduction in density and coverage.

Patients taking antiandrogens tend to have better results with electrolysis and laser hair removal than those who are not. In patients <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>teens</b> or early twenties, antiandrogens prevent new facial hair from developing if testosterone levels are within the normal female range.|$|E
25|$|Foreign dance trends, such as ballroom, {{which had}} been {{suppressed}} during the Cultural Revolution, returned.

5000|$|Imperial Rome largely {{conforms}} {{to what is}} known as the [...] "Mediterranean" [...] pattern of marital fertility: men married late and women married early.

25|$|By {{the late}} Medieval era, Lowland society was {{probably}} {{part of the}} north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed {{by the need to}} acquire the resources needed to be able to form a household. Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived through both males and females), women retained their original surname at marriage and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship. Women could marry from the age of 12 (while for boys it was from 14) and, while many girls from the social elite married <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>teens,</b> {{by the end of the}} period most in the Lowlands only married after a period of life-cycle service, in their twenties. The extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery.|$|E
500|$|As {{more land}} was won for cultivation, this trend changed.
