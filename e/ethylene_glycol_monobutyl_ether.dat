40|$|This {{piece of}} work focused on the {{synthesis}} of polyoxyalkylene copolymers from polyoxyalkylene amine or alcohol by cyanuric chloride coupling. A series of derivatives were synthesized in a selective manner by controlling the reaction temperature. Different POE and POP blocks in copolymers were made to have various polarity and molecular weight. (1) Synthesis of star-shape copolymers by cyanuric chloride and polyoxyalkylene amine. Star-shape copolymers are similar to hyperbranch structure which is different from linear-type. We can design molecule configuration of different property and remain reactive functionalities. The structures are constituted of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic poly(oxyalkylene) -segments which could reduce surface tension as low as 34. 3 mN/m, and exhibits the capability of reducing interfacial tension (toluene/water) until 1. 3 mN/m (0. 001 wt %). (2) A series of cross-linked structure were synthesized with cyanuric chloride and polyoxyalkylene amine by controlling diverse reactive groups. The presence of the poly(oxyethylene) block structure afforded the copolymers properties such as hydrophilicity and metal chelation. (3) The selectivity of cyanuric chloride and glycol was investigated with poly(propylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> [PPG(mono-) - 340]. By varying the molar ratios of PPG(mono-) - 340 and temperature, the suitable reaction conditions of the three active sites in cyanuric chloride were found.

In order to determine the presence of 2 -BE in hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, a reliable method for recovering 2 -BE from aqueous phases by liquid-liquid extraction combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was established. The liquid-liquid extraction method was applied to samples matrices containing various amounts of salt. Using methylene chloride for liquid-liquid extraction in a sample to solvent ratio of 1 : 3, ≥ 99 % 2 -BE recovery may be achieved with less than 5 % standard error. The limit of detection was determined to be 0. 957  mg L− 1 2 -BE. Accuracy was determined to be 2. 58 % and precision was determined using the coefficient of variation, which was 3. 5 %.

The substrates were prepared by coating porous sinter metal disks with a porous yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layer acting as a barrier against intermetallic diffusion between the sinter metal and the Pd membrane (diffusion barrier layer, DBL). Before applying the Pd coating, the sinter metal substrates were characterized by N 2 permeance measurements. The maximum pore sizes before and after coating of the DBL were determined. For SPS of Pd, particles with diameters in the range between 250 nm and 550 nm were suspended in ethyl cellulose containing diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> solution.

The in vitro battery consisted of: the Salmonella mutagenicity test, the L 5178 Y mouse lymphoma test, a cytogenetics assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells and the unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat hepatocytes. Results of the Salmonella mutagenicity test, the cytogenetics test, and the rat hepatocyte assay were negative at concentrations up to 20 FL/plate, 7. 92,uL/mL, and 4. 4,uL/mL, respectively. Toxicity was clearly demonstrated at all high doses. A weak, but dose-related increase in the mutation frequency (4 -fold increase over the solvent control at 5. 6 UL/mL with 12 % survival) was obtained in the L 5178 Y lymphoma test {{in the absence of}} metabolic activation. Results of the mouse lymphoma assay were negative {{in the presence of the}} S- 9 activation system. The significance of the mouse lymphoma assay results were assessed by performing the Tier II sex-linked recessive lethal assay in Drosophila in which the target tissue is maturing germinal cells. Both feeding (11, 000 ppm for 3 days) and injection (0. 3,uL of 14, 000 ppm solution) routes of administration were employed in the Drosophila assay. Approximately 11, 000 individual crosses with an equal number of negative controls were performed for each route of administration. diEGBE produced no increase in recessive lethals under these conditions. We conclude that the weak response in the mouse lymphoma assay does not have mutagenic significance because of the clear negative obtained in the in vivo assay which detects the same types of mutations in germinal cells...|$|R

The study was commissioned by the company to confirm or refute a previous observation (Vobecky et al., Cancer 54 : 2537 - 2542, 1984) that there were higher mortality rates from colorectal cancer among male employees of the textiles unit, the cellulose acetate fiber manufacturing unit, and the cellulose triacetate and polypropylene extrusion units and to investigate whether mortality rates for other sites of cancer were associated with employment in each area of the plant and with occupational exposures. Workers {{with more than one}} year experience at the plant were eligible for study if they were employed on January 1, 1947 or if they were newly hired between that date and December 31, 1977. Vital status as of December 31, 1986 was ascertained for 7, 422 men and 2, 720 women through a probabilistic record linkage to the Canadian Mortality Data Base. Among men, there were about 220, 000 person-years of observation and 1, 738 deaths and, among women, there were about 89, 000 person-years of observation and 241 deaths. Three reference regions were used to derive standardized mortality ratios (SMR) : the entire Province of Quebec, semi-rural regions of the Province, and the area in which the plant is located. Results based on rates for these regions were generally similar. For men, the SMR for all causes of death was significantly less than unity (SMR = 0. 71, 95 %CI: 0. 68 - 0. 74), as were the SMRs for most sites of cancer (SMR all neoplasms = 0. 73, 95 %CI: 0. 66 - 0. 80). The SMR for colorectal cancer was 0. 68 (95 %CI: 0. 51 - 0. 91). Of the 20 cancer sites examined in men, reticulum cell sarcoma was the only one having a significantly elevated SMR, and this occurred only among the subcohort of men hired prior to 1947 (SMR = 2. 84, 95 %CI: 1. 04 - 6. 18, 6 deaths). For women, the SMR for all causes of death was 0. 75 (95 %CI: 0. 66 - 0. 85) and there were moderately elevated SMRs for a number of sites of cancer, but none were significantly greater than expectation (SMR all neoplasms = 0. 97, 95 %CI: 0. 80 - 1. 17). SMRs were also calculated according to employment in each processing unit and exposure to occupational agents, and case-control analyses were carried out within the cohort for selected sites of cancer. Of the scores of associations tested, very few were significantly elevated. There were excesses of biliary cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas among workers in the cellulose acetate fiber manufacturing unit. There were also significant associations between stomach cancer and exposure to cutting oils, and between prostate cancer and exposure to <b>glycol</b> <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether.</b> However, none of these associations were persuasive. With regards to colorectal cancer, there was a nonsignificant elevation in risk among workers who had ever worked in the polypropylene and cellulose triacetate extrusion unit (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 2. 3, 95 %CI: 0. 5 - 9. 9) but there was no apparent increase in risk with increasing duration of employment. Thus, the evidence for an association was not convincing. For the cellulose acetate fiber manufacturing unit, the evidence of an increase, although based on few cases, was slightly more persuasive (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 1. 9, 95 %CI: 1. 0 - 3. 6), but no trend was observed with duration. No association was observed with employment in the textiles unit (OR$ sb{ rm e}$ = 1. 1, 95 %CI: 0. 6 - 2. 2) nor were there any noteworthy associations between colorectal cancer and any of the agents evaluated in the case-control analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{separation of}} 13 kinds of organic solvents {{has been carried}} out with Hitachi model 163 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector, using a stainless steel column (3 mm × 4) packed with 10 % silicone gum SE 30 on chromosorb W 80 -l 00 mesh (AW, DMCS) and as a carrier gas, nitrogen gas of flow rate of 20 ml/min. The satisfactory separation has been achieved only when the column temperature first was set at 80 ℃ and then increased at the temperature ratio of 10 ℃/min immediately after benzene peak appeared. The retention time was the smallest in methyl alcohol, followed by ethyl alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, isobutyl alcohol, benzene, methyl iso-butyl ketone, iso-butyl acetate, toluene, n-butyl acetate, iso-amyl acetate, <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether,</b> in order of retention time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEthylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE) and <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> acetate (EGBEA) {{were tested}} for their acute and chronic {{toxicity}} to various organisms occupying different trophic {{levels in the}} aquatic ecosystems. The obtained results and those collected from the literature clearly show that EGBE affects the survival, growth, and reproduction of aquatic organisms only at concentrations of approximately 100 mg/L or more. EGBEA appears to be slightly more ecotoxic to aquatic species. At 1000 and 10, 000 mg/L, both chemicals strongly affect {{the early stages of}} development of the Japanese oyster, but such concentrations are too high to be found in aquatic environments. Micronucleus tests on Xenopus laevis show that EGBE and EGBEA are not genotoxic in the range of concentrations tested. Consequently, neither chemical presents a risk to the aquatic environment. EGBE does affect the gonadosomatic index of adult male zebra fish (Danio rerio), however these are preliminary results and must be confirmed by additional experiments...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{concerned}} with skin layer formation kinetics of Polyethersulfone with Cardo (PES-C) asymmetric membranes by the phase inversion method. Gelation process was observed using an online optical microscope-CCD camera experimental system, the result indicated that a single linear correlation between square value of precipitation front move (X(2)) and time (t) did not exist for the whole gelation process, which {{was different from the}} traditional conclusion. The effect of <b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EGME) on skin layer gelation process was investigated, and the skin layer formation kinetics equation was determined, which could be described with gelation rate constant equation. The gelation rate constant decreased with the increase of concentration of EGME. EGME concentrations affected the viscous flow activation energy, and the increase of viscous flow activation energy led to the decrease of gelation rate. The change trend of the gelation rate was exactly {{the same as that of}} the flux. The results helped to understand the asymmetric membrane skin layer formation process better, which was important for controlling the membrane separation properties and designing the membranes for a specific application.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the use of near-/super-critical carbon dioxide has {{received}} much attention as a green alternative to organic solvents for chemical reactions, separations, and extractions because of its pressure-tunable physicochemical properties and economic advantages. However the advantages are diminished because of a relative narrow range of CO 2 -soluble materials. The goal of this work is to identify, design and synthesize oxygenated hydrocarbon-based CO 2 -soluble polymers that are able to serve as construction blocks for copolymers, dispersants, surfactants, thickeners, and chelating agents. Without concerning on the cost and the environmental persistence like fluorinated materials, the inexpensive, environmentally benign materials would significantly enhance the viability of near-/super-critical carbon dioxide-based technology. Based on both experimental heuristics and ab initio simulation results of molecular modeling (performed by Dr. Johnson's group), we proposed specific new polymer structures: poly(3 -acetoxy oxetane) (PAO), poly(vinyl methoxymethyl ether) (PVMME), poly(vinyl 1 -methoxyethyl ether) (PVMEE), and cellulose triacetate (CTA) oligomers. Phase behavior studies were also performed with novel CO 2 -philic compounds containing vinyl acetate, propylene glycol, or multiple tert-butyl groups. PAO, PVMME and PVMME were soluble in CO 2, but not as soluble as poly(vinyl acetate). Oligomers of cellulose triacetate with as many as four repeat units solubilized into dense CO 2 less than 14 MPa in the concentration range of 1 - 5 wt%. Phase behaviors of more than thirty compounds in dense CO 2 were studied in this project. A new type of phase behavior for solid (at ambient temperature) CO 2 -philes that melt and dissolve in CO 2 was detailed using a model binary mixture of β-D-maltose octaacetate and CO 2. Copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and vinyl acetate (VAc) exhibited lower miscibility pressures than either of the homopolymers, probably due to quadradentate binding configurations with CO 2. Phase behavior investigation of poly(propylene <b>glycol)</b> (PPG) <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> in CO 2 demonstrated ether-CO 2 interactions should receive as much attention as carbonyl-CO 2 interactions when designing CO 2 -philic functional groups. 1, 3, 5 -tri-tert-butylbenzene and tri-tert-butyl-phenol were both extraordinarily soluble in CO 2, and are excellent candidates for CO 2 -soluble sand binders. In summary, although a new CO 2 thickener was not identified, new non-fluorous CO 2 -soluble materials were identified that were, in general, acetate-rich with flexible chains, weak self-interactions, and multidentate interaction between CO 2 and solute functional groups...|$|R
