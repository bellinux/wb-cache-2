They {{are based on a}} purchase obligation and act either by price (feed-in tariffs) or by quantity (bidding for new RES-E capacities; RES-E quotas). From the Public Economics perspective, the two instruments are distinct in terms of cost-efficacy and market incentives in a world of imperfect information. <b>Exchangeable</b> quotas of <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> are preferred because this instrument allows better control over consumer costs and whilst retaining market incentives. Transaction cost economics (TCE) contributes to the assessment of these instruments, by introducing RES-E investment safeguard as a major determinant of social efficiency, and the instruments' conformity to its institutional environment as a determinant of its viability. In light of this additional consideration, the arrangements between RES-E producers and obligated buyers inherent in each instrument are in fact quite similar-either long-term contracting or vertical integration. We compare and assess RES-E price- and quantity-instruments on several dimensions from both the public economics and TCE perspectives: control of the cost for consumers, safeguards of RES-E investments, adaptability of the instrument in order to preserve its stability in the long run, market incentive intensity, and conformity with the new market regime of electricity industry. It shows neither instruments offer an optimal solution in each of these dimensions. The government will thus select an instrument in accordance with the relative importance of its objectives.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the combination of}} an equilibrium model for electricity- and certificate supply and demand of and real options valuation theory for evaluating the effectiveness of support schemes applied in the electricity market. We study how a <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> scheme affects investment behavior for a potential wind farm. The investor is assumed {{to take into account}} the micro-structural properties of supply and demand through explicitly considering a simultaneous equilibrium in the <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market and the electricity market. The source of uncertainty in the model lies in the investment cost, which is described as a mean reverting process. At any time the investor possesses an option to develop the wind farm or postpone the decision. Regarding future revenues as deterministic and the investment cost as a one-time expense at exercise, we derive a real options-based rule for the optimal investment timing. Using the Swedish/Norwegian <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market as foundation for calibration and focusing on support scheme efficiency, the resulting renewable power development rates are compared to the case where there are no subsidies, as well as the case of a feed-in tariff system. We highlight policy insights from investment aspects that interact with the simultaneous equilibrium in the electricity and <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> markets. We conclude that for the specific goal of boosting investment in production capacity for renewable energy, and within the framework constructed by the assumptions made in this model, the feed-in tariff will perform better than the <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> scheme. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{electricity}} markets evolving towards liberalisation and internationalisation, <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> {{are seen as}} an important tool to promote production of renewable energy. In a <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market producers sell certificates received per unit of electricity generated from renewable energy.

Using a simple model, the effects of an EU system for tradable <b>green</b> <b>certificates,</b> compared to national implementation, are tested for the period 2000 – 2010. The simulations show a clear increase of cost effectiveness and large changes in the geographical balance of renewable energy when reaching the EU 22 per cent target. Less competitive technologies, such as solar power, are not deployed at all. The situation is however similar without international trade. Rather than implementing a certificate market with all EU member states, but with different support schemes, a smaller market, only with countries that combine the certificate market with renewables obligation, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} model for an energy market that {{includes}} a <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> for suppliers of energy from renewables and a purchaser commitment to buy these certificates. We show that price and volume effects in the energy market are ambigous under {{a wide range of}} alternative levels of the purchaser commitment. We calibrate our model to data for the Norwegian economy. Simulations shows a downward movement in energy prices as the government starts increasing the level of the purchaser commitment. This implies that the producer of ordinary energy pays for the restriction in the market while energy consumption and consumer surplus increases. When the purchaser commitment increases above a certain level, the purchaser price increases and the volume effect is negative. Although the effects are sensitive to elasticities of demand and supply of both technologies, the main results are robust against a variety of combinations of elasticities. The article discusses effects both under autarky and free trade of both energy and <b>green</b> <b>certificates.</b> The results vary denpendent upon whether only one or a majority of actual countires introduces a domestic market or allows for international trade both in energy and the <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> instrument.

The large multinational company successfully enrol themselves in the development of this concept. The field of renewable energy is only a part of the whole.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the political economy}} of establishing bilateral trade in <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> markets as one step towards harmonization of European green electricity support systems. We outline some of the economic principles of an integrated bilateral <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> market, and then discuss a number of issues that are deemed to be critical for the effectiveness, stability and legitimacy of such a market. By drawing on some of the lessons of the fairly recent intentions to integrate a future <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market in Norway with the existing Swedish one, we highlight, exemplify and discuss some critical policy implementation and design issues. These include, for instance, the system's connection to climate policy targets, the role of other support schemes and the definition of what green electricity technologies should be included. Furthermore, the establishment of an international market presumes that the benefits of renewable power (e. g., its impacts on the environment, diversification of the power mix, self-sufficiency, etc.) are approached and valued from an international perspective rather than from a national one, thus implying lesser emphasis on, for instance, employment and regional development impacts. A bilateral <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> system thus faces a number of important policy challenges, {{but at the same time}} it could provide important institutional learning effects that can be useful for future attempts aiming at achieving greater policy integration in the European renewable energy sector. ...|$|R

The findings from the case studies are synthesized and analyzed {{with respect to their}} relevance for Norway, particularly in terms of energy resources, production, potential, relevant policies and barriers. Potential policy instruments for Norway include feed-in tariffs, <b>green</b> <b>certificates</b> under quota obligations, and subsidies for research and development, and are discussed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses.

The <b>green</b> <b>certificate</b> market is a fi-nancial instrument to stimulate renewables {{within the context of}} liberalized, transnational electricity markets (a kind of market-oriented subsidy scheme). <b>Green</b> <b>certificates</b> are fi-nancial assets issued to green producers that can be traded freely. Previous system dynam-ics studies showed that trading- and investment behaviour were critical factors in analyzing the market dynamics. As a follow-up, this experimental economics study con-ducted 14 laboratory experiments with about 10 to 20 students per session. A particular feature is that participants handle both short-term trading and long-term investments, which allow us to analyse the interplay between these types of decisions without imposing behavioural assumptions on the two types of decisions. The laboratory experiment shows that the market is likely to crash, due to the long time delays of supply side adjustment. The study provided new insights concerning agents trading and investment strategies, and the performance of various market designs. The mix of trading strategies employed in re-sponse to the experiments, are difficult to capture in an SD model. ...|$|R

Support schemes differ in many aspects, not only in their effectivity and efficiency but also in the long-term incentives provided and in the financial risk involved for investors. This research compares the performance of different policy mechanisms analyzing the interaction between carbon reduction and renewable support policies.

40|$|The {{liberalisation}} of Western European electricity sectors challenged {{governments to}} revise the support systems for the reduction of market barriers of renewable technologies. One {{of the most frequently}} discussed support approaches is the imposition of legal quota obligations for the generation, trade or consumption of renewable electricity that can be implemented through tradable <b>green</b> <b>certificates.</b> But there are substantial uncertainties regarding the impacts this new support approach could have on the diffusion of renewable technologies.
