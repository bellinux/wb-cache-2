5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to <b>keep</b> <b>growing.</b> However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E

25|$|Male M. rosenbergii prawns have {{a strict}} hierarchy: the {{territorial}} BC males dominate the OCs, {{which in turn}} dominate the SMs. The presence of BC males inhibits the growth of SMs and delays the metamorphosis of OCs into BCs; an OC will <b>keep</b> <b>growing</b> until it {{is larger than the}} largest BC male in its neighbourhood before transforming.

2500|$|The Methodists were methodical in {{collecting}} statistics on membership. Their growth was rapid, from 58,000 in 1790 to 302,000 in 1830 and 518,000 in 1850.

Growth was steady in both rural and urban areas, despite disruption caused by numerous schisms; these resulted in separate denominations (or [...] "connexions") such as the Wesleyan Methodist Church, the first and largest, followed by the New Connexion, the Bible Christian Church and the Primitive Methodist Church. (They were reunited in the Methodist Union of 1932.) [...] Some of the growth {{can be attributed to}} the failure of the established Church of England to provide church facilities. A series of reforms in the established church help correct that failure, so there were fewer opportunities for the nonconformists in general and the Methodists in particular to <b>keep</b> <b>growing.</b> Membership reached 602,000 in 1870 and peaked at 841,000 in 1910.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, the {{population}} of Mexico City alone had risen to over one million people. A population explosion began early in the 20th century, with {{the population of}} the city itself doubling approximately every 15years since 1900, partly attributed {{to the fact that the}} federal government has favored development of the metropolitan area over other areas of the country. This has spurred investment in infrastructure for the city, such as electricity, other power sources, water supply and drainage. These have attracted businesses which in turn have attracted more population. Since the 1950s, urbanization has spread out from beyond the bounds of the Federal District to the surrounding jurisdictions, especially to the north into the State of Mexico making for the Mexico City Metropolitan area, which fills most of the valley. Today, this metropolitan area accounts for 45per cent of the country's industrial activity, 38percent of GNP, and 25percent of the population. Much of its industry is concentrated in the northern part of the Federal District and the adjoining cities in the state of Mexico. While population growth has slowed and even declined in the city proper, the outer limits of the metropolitan area <b>keep</b> <b>growing.</b> Much of this growth has occurred on the mountainsides of the valley, in the form of illegal settlements in ecologically sensitive areas.
