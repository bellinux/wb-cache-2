5|$|Brave Benbow lost <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> by chain shot.|$|E
5|$|His pale, heavy-boned face {{showed signs}} of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over {{the sides of the}} seat; <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> were spread wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.|$|E
5|$|Marseille always {{strove to}} improve his abilities. He worked to {{strengthen}} <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and abdominal muscles, to help him tolerate the extreme g forces of air combat. Marseille also drank an abnormal amount of milk and shunned sunglasses, {{to improve his}} eyesight.|$|E
50|$|Shaquille Vance (born March 22, 1991) is an American T42 Paralympic sprint runner {{and shot}} putter. Vance lost <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> in an American {{football}} accident in 2009.

5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> could carry him.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 {{he began}} to {{experience}} hip and leg problems; one of <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> had shortened {{an inch and a}} half and he had to learn to walk again. Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's health {{began to}} fail {{in the spring}} of 1824. He was {{suffering}} from obesity, gout and gangrene, both dry and wet, in <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and spine.

5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E
25|$|By 1916, Arbuckle was {{experiencing}} serious health problems. An infection that developed on <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> became a carbuncle {{so severe that}} doctors considered amputation. Although Arbuckle {{was able to keep}} <b>his</b> <b>leg,</b> he became addicted to the pain killer morphine.|$|R
50|$|While {{working as}} a bus driver in 1988, {{because he was a}} large man, he had to put his seat all the way back, but that day, he banged the back of <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> on the seat track and <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> was cut open.

5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage with <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> {{protecting}} {{her while she}} moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new carapace, {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay her eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{bankruptcy}} the United States Post Office Department began investigating him for mail fraud, and Brinkley became a patient himself, having suffered three {{heart attacks and}} the amputation of one of <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> due to poor circulation.

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man {{match in}} the seventh match, as then-champion, A.J. Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles {{following}} bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90°, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the Angel's Wings. Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece. Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Bramham tells several {{stories about}} how he lost his leg; one story {{involves}} <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> being eaten off by an alligator. [...] Another story is that a shark attacked him. A third story, one he often tells international journalists, involves <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> being [...] "chomped off by a kangaroo". [...] The reality {{is that he was}} born missing part of his limb: he has no femur. [...] What remained of <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> was amputated when he was five years old.|$|R

5|$|The fight {{began with}} Jackson looking {{to close the}} {{distance}} early. Jackson immediately went for a double-leg takedown, and picked Silva up. Silva then locked <b>his</b> <b>legs,</b> creating a standing closed guard, and applied a guillotine choke. The two stayed in this position until Jackson loosened his own grip, taking the fight to the ground for the first time, with Silva holding onto the chokehold.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
50|$|During a war, {{he stepped}} on a land mine and injured <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> badly. Due to {{non-availability}} of morphine or pethidine, and absence of medics, <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> could not be amputated the surgical way. His fellow soldiers could not do it either seeing the risks involved. He used a kukri to cut <b>his</b> own <b>leg</b> finally. After this, he was treated by Pakistani pow surgeon Major Mohamed Akram and subsequently recovered.|$|R
2500|$|While {{serving on}} the salvage ship [...] during {{recovery}} operations, Navy diver Carl Brashear had <b>his</b> <b>leg</b> crushed in a deck accident and lost {{the lower part of}} <b>his</b> left <b>leg.</b> <b>His</b> story was the inspiration for the 2000 film Men of Honor.|$|R

5|$|Turning Point {{is remembered}} for the {{disbanding}} of Triple X and for Elix Skipper pulling Chris Harris {{off the top}} of a cage with <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> to perform a move he named the New School.

The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the event a 7 out of 10, which was the same as the 2005 event's rating.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male then walks with erect and displaying by waving <b>his</b> <b>legs</b> and palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the male stands his ground {{and she does}} not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did not intervene in the Genoese–Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula Kristó says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula. While he was hunting in Zólyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a brown bear attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on <b>his</b> <b>legs.</b> Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John Besenyő, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E
