5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|By 22:00, the Rangers and ex-POWs {{arrived at}} Plateros, where they rested {{for half an}} hour. A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, a deaf British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|In Baxter's eyes, {{the main}} {{role of the}} {{university}} was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was {{far short of the}} university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, but even more so when they dropped out or failed their courses. While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided expert assistance in 1959.|$|E

25|$|In 1907, David {{was arrested}} for helping to plan a bakers' strike and was held for three days.

25|$|From one rivalry to the other, it {{had been}} {{simmering}} for some time between Mick Foley and Randy Orton. In June 2003, following an on-air ceremony honoring Foley for his achievements, Orton and Ric Flair attacked him backstage and threw him {{down a flight of}} stairs. In December 2003, Foley returned as the replacement for Steve Austin as Raw co-general manager and gave himself a shot at Orton's Intercontinental Championship, but <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the match and would not face Orton even after the champion spat on his face. In January 2004, a furious Austin declared that Foley would be entered in the Royal Rumble match and he expected him to return and wrestle, which he did by eliminating Orton (and himself) from the match. Foley was later joined by The Rock in the feud, and the reformed Rock 'n' Sock Connection challenged Orton, Batista, and Flair to a handicap tag team match at WrestleMania.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{returned}} in June 2003 to referee the Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a Raw broadcast in Madison Square Garden, he was honored for his achievements {{in the ring}} and presented with the retired WWE Hardcore Championship belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down stairs by Randy Orton and Ric Flair. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of Raw. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton on the December 15 episode of Raw {{and walked out of}} the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face.

25|$|Annadurai opposed {{this move}} and the schism between his {{supporters}} and Periyar widened. He saw the gaining of independence as an overall achievement of India rather than solely that of Aryan North. Moreover, Periyar's decision on giving up participating in democratic elections was also opposed by Annadurai, {{in reaction to}} which <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a party meeting in 1948. Periyar considered that candidates in elections must compromise their ideologies. Moreover, it was Periyar's idea that social reformation can be better achieved outside politics, through education and canvassing the masses, rather than governments. Eventually, when Periyar married Maniammai, who was 40 years younger than he, the personal differences between Annadurai and Periyar split their supporters. Annadurai launched his own party with his party fragment, along with E. V. K. Sampath (Periyar's nephew and until then considered his political heir). The new party was named Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. DMK's presence was initially restricted to urban centres and its surrounding areas. But by appealing to the urban lower, lower middle and working classes, students, Dalits and lower castes, Annadurai was able to accelerate its growth and spread. He fought for the social justice of the lower castes and thus rapidly gained popular support.|$|E

25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he got in the way of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E

After stealing the driver's taxi, the two were caught in an alley and placed under citizen's arrest by Charles Conant and his brother-in-law Ronald Maske, who were both armed with guns.

500|$|Wisden's {{obituary}} described Hammond {{as one of}} the {{top four}} batsmen who had ever played, calling him [...] "a most exciting cricketer. ... The instant <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a pavilion, white-spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket, bat tucked underarm, cap at a hint of an angle, he was identifiable as a thoroughbred." [...] Throughout the 1930s, the public and critics regarded Hammond as England's best batsman, succeeding Jack Hobbs, and next to Bradman, the best in the world (although George Headley also had a claim). Among English batsmen, only Herbert Sutcliffe, with a higher Test average, was similarly successful. According to Alan Gibson, however, although Sutcliffe was dependable in a crisis, [...] "his batting never gave quite the same sense of majesty and excitement that Hammond's did". More recently, Hammond w{{as one of the}} inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, launched in January 2009, and was selected by a jury of cricket journalists as a member of England's all-time XI in August 2009.|$|E

[...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for My Pillow, after <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a performance: [...] "I have to tell the story of how it really was.
