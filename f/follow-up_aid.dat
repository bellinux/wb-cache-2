40|$|IMPORTANCE: BRAF inhibitors {{have become}} the {{standard}} of care in metastatic BRAF-mutant melanomas. Compared with chemotherapies, BRAF inhibitors improve overall and disease-free survival and speed the recovery of symptomatic patients with metastatic disease. The most worrisome finding is the possible development of resistance to new malignant tumors. OBSERVATIONS: A patient in her 30 s developed massive BRAFV 600 E melanoma metastasis during her 30 th week of pregnancy. After emergency cesarean delivery, oral dabrafenib treatment was initiated, and a partial radiologic response was confirmed within 1 month. At dermatologic digital <b>follow-up</b> <b>aided</b> by confocal microscopy 8 weeks after initiation of dabrafenib treatment, 4 melanomas were detected. Unfortunately, within the next month, the melanoma rapidly progressed. The 4 new melanomas were wild-type BRAFmelanomas, whereas the new metastasis carried a different BRAF mutation (S 467 L). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cutaneous malignant tumors are the most frequent adverse events of BRAF inhibitors; therefore, strict dermatologic surveillance in a referral center <b>aided</b> by digital <b>follow-up</b> is mandatory, especially when multiple nevi are present and these drugs are used in an adjuvant setting. In view of our findings, the pathogenesis {{of the development of}} new melanomas seems to be different from therapy resistance. Whether paradoxical RAF activation could explain these BRAF wild-type secondary malignant tumors is still unknown...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Intraoperative {{radiotherapy}} (IORT) is {{a relatively}} new technique in which irradiation with electrons is performed during an open surgery procedure. This approach poses significant problems in obtaining accurate dosimetry, since neither the pre- nor the postoperative patient images actually matches the irradiation field. Our objective was to implement a software tool able to provide an estimate of the dose distribution, overcoming the problem of the geometrical mismatch between the images and the surgical field during the irradiation. The program was developed in the C programming language, on a noncommercial version of a Philips EasyVision workstation. The application allows to create a new data set by manipulating the preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance images in order to simulate the final geometry of the surgical area during the IORT procedure. The exact dose distribution can then be calculated by transferring these new images to a standard radiotherapy planning system. Also an approximate dose distribution can be quickly displayed by superimposing isodose curves obtained from a water phantom. The proposed approach introduces a helpful tool for dosimetry and planning in IORT protocols, improving their accuracy and safety and allowing for more objective quality control and patient <b>follow-up.</b> Comp <b>Aid</b> Surg 2 : 333 – 339 (1997). � 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with a large {{majority}} of prevalence (85 %) in developing countries. As of 2012, it accounts for 7. 5 % of all female cancer deaths. Despite its high prevalence, skeletal muscle metastasis from cervical cancer is extremely uncommon. In our extensive literature search, we were able to find only 8 cases where skeletal muscle metastasis was the only site of recurrence. We report a case of a 52 -year-old African-American woman with a past medical history of cervical cancer (stage IIIB) who presented with pain and swelling in her left upper arm over the preceding 2 months. MRI of the left upper arm showed a solid well-circumscribed mass measuring 7. 0 × 2. 8 × 2. 5 cm, deep to the biceps. Biopsy of the mass revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma that was p 16 -positive. PET scan showed that the lesion was the sole site of metastasis. She received local radiation with concurrent chemotherapy. Follow-up MRI 6 months after the completion of therapy showed resolution of the mass. She has remained disease-free for the last 24 months as evidenced by a PET/CT scan in May 2016. In this case report, we discuss the role of imaging and pathology in the diagnosis of a solitary metastatic lesion.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature and}} prevalence of ophthalmological findings for a cohort of children in a paediatric cochlear implant program and to assist the clinician in devising an investigative plan for this population. Retrospective medical record review of children who underwent multichannel cochlear implantation at a tertiary care hospital between February 1996 and July 2008. In all, 141 children (mean age 28 months, range 16 months to 9 years) had complete medical record documentation consisting of orthoptic and opthalmological examination, including cycloplegic refraction. A total of 59 children (41. 8 %) had ocular abnormalities with refractive errors being the most common abnormality. Hypermetropia {{was the most common}} refractive error and was found in 21 children (14. 8 %). Strabismus was found in six patients, with constant esotropia being the most common. Ocular pathology (excluding refractive or muscle abnormalities) were found in nine patients (6. 3 %). Three patients had syndromes associated with ocular findings including Waardenburg and Usher syndrome. During the follow-up period, 14 children were fitted with prescription lenses, 3 had strabismus surgery, and 2 underwent ptosis. Routine orthoptic and ophthalmologic examination can be beneficial in the initial evaluation of children assessed for cochlear implants. Electroretinography is useful in evaluating children with unexplained congenital sensorineural hearing loss, suggestive symptoms including night blindness, unexplained reduction in visual acuity, or delayed motor milestones.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that lower vaccine uptake in childhood among some groups, such as children of lone parents or from larger families, {{may be due}} to their higher levels of residential mobility. This paper aimed to explore this association in a large cohort of children born in the UK {{at the turn of the}} century. Using multi-variable Poisson regression we found that children who lived in families which had moved during pregnancy or more frequently were more likely to be partially immunised with the primary immunisations and unimmunised against measles, mumps and rubella. Mobility was not associated with being unimmunised with the primary vaccines, or with single measles, mumps and rubella antigen vaccine use.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acute-phase {{proteins}} (APPs) {{are sensitive}} markers of inflammation, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) recently {{has been shown}} to be a useful diagnostic marker in dogs with bacterial pneumonia (BP). In humans with community-acquired pneumonia, APPs also have great utility as <b>follow-up</b> markers <b>aiding</b> in the assessment of treatment response. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the applicability of APPs as markers of treatment response in dogs with BP. ANIMALS: Nineteen dogs diagnosed with BP and 64 healthy dogs. METHODS: The study was conducted as a prospective longitudinal observational study. Serum CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), and haptoglobin concentrations were followed during a natural course of BP. Normalization of serum CRP was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment (treatment was stopped 5 - 7 days after CRP normalized) in 8 of 17 dogs surviving to discharge; 9 of 17 dogs were treated according to conventional recommendations. RESULTS: All measured APPs initially were significantly increased, but the magnitude of increase was not correlated to disease severity. C-reactive protein and SAA concentrations decreased rapidly after initiation of antimicrobial treatment. When normalization of serum CRP was used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, treatment duration was significantly (P =. 015) decreased without increasing the number of relapses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Serum CRP and SAA reflected the recovery process well and therefore may be used as markers of treatment response. According to the results, the normalization of serum CRP may be used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment in dogs with BP...|$|R
40|$|HYPOTHESIS: The {{floating}} mass transducer (FMT) of the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) can be interposed in {{the middle}} ear {{in case of an}} absent incus. BACKGROUND: The VSB is a middle ear implant in which the FMT is attached to the long process of the incus to directly drive the ossicular chain. In this case report, there was gradual deterioration in speech perception after VSB fitting and deterioration in hearing thresholds. During exploratory resurgery, {{it became clear that the}} ossicular chain was interrupted due to necrosis of the long process of the incus. The VSB could no longer function because there was no connection between the incus and stapes. METHODS: Reconnection of the FMT to the anterior crus of the stapes on 1 side and the tympanic membrane on the other side. RESULTS: Reconnection of the FMT to the stapes head led to obvious improvement in audiometric results. The air-bone gap was reduced from approximately 35 to approximately 25 dB, which indicated that the construction with the FMT was working like a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis. At 1. 5 years' <b>follow-up,</b> the <b>aided</b> hearing thresholds of approximately 45 dB hearing level were slightly poorer than those measured after the first procedure with classical positioning of the FMT. However, the speech recognition score in quiet at 65 dB sound pressure level was 70 % with the classical FMT application and with the FMT connected between the stapes and tympanic membrane. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that when the incus is absent, placement of the FMT directly on to the stapes is an acceptable solution...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To screen {{hearing and}} {{evaluate}} outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Method: Three thousand and twenty-five adults responded to {{an invitation to}} be screened by questionnaire, otoscopy, and pure-tone audiometry. Pure-tone average (PTA) > 35 dB HL in the worse ear, unilateral hearing loss, or otoscopic findings were the criteria for referral for services. A questionnaire related to compliance with referral recommendations was completed by telephone interview for 160 randomly selected participants after 1 - 2 years from referral. Results: The referral rate for audiologic/hearing aid evaluation was 46 %, and referral for cerumen removal/medical evaluation was 17 %. Of the people referred for audiologic/hearing aid evaluation, 18 % tried a hearing aid; 2 years later, 11 % were using a hearing aid.

40|$|International {{audience}} BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Esophageal video capsule endoscopy (ECE) is a {{new technique}} that allows examination of the esophagus using a noninvasive approach. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare ECE with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for the diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 330 patients with cirrhosis and with no known esophageal varices were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent ECE first, followed by EGD (gold standard). The endoscopists who performed EGD were blind to the ECE result. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a visual analog scale (maximum score 100). RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were excluded from the analysis because they did not undergo any endoscopic examinations. Patients (mean age 56 years; 216 male) had mainly alcoholic (45  %) or viral (27  %) cirrhosis. The diagnostic indices of ECE to diagnose and correctly stage esophageal varices were: sensitivity 76  % and 64  %, specificity 91  % and 93  %, positive predictive value 88  % and 88  %, and negative predictive value 81  % and 78  %, respectively. ECE patient satisfaction scored significantly higher than EGD (87  ±  22 vs. 58  ±  35; P <  0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: ECE was well tolerated and safe in patients with liver cirrhosis and suspicion of portal hypertension. The sensitivity of ECE is not currently sufficient to replace EGD as a first exploration in these patients.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prospective association between measured hearing impairment, self-reported hearing handicap and hearing aid use with quality of life. Study design: 829 Blue Mountains Hearing Study participants (≥ 55 years) were examined between 1997 - 1999 and 2007 - 2009. The shortened version of the hearing handicap inventory was administered. Hearing levels were measured using pure-tone audiometry. Quality of life was assessed using the 36 -Item Short-Form Survey (SF- 36); higher scores reflect better quality of life. Results: Hearing impairment at baseline compared with no impairment was associated with lower mean SF- 36 mental composite score 10 years later (multivariable-adjusted p = 0. 03). Physical composite score and mean scores for seven of the eight SF- 36 domains after 10 -year follow-up were significantl y lower among participants who self-reported hearing handicap at baseline. Differences in the adjusted means between participants with and without hearing handicap ranged from 2. 7 (physical composite score) to 10. 4 units ('role limitations due to physical problems' domain). Individuals who developed incident hearing impairment {{compared to those who}} did not, had adjusted mean scores 9. 5 - and 7. 7 -units lower in the 'role limitation due to physical problems', and 'bodily pain' domains, respectively, at the 10 -year <b>follow-up.</b> Hearing <b>aid</b> users versus non-users at baseline showed a 1. 82 -point (p = 0. 03) and 3. 32 -point (p = 0. 01) increase in SF- 36 mental composite score and mental health domain over the 10 -year follow-up, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: The primary aim was {{to compare}} the {{objective}} and the subjective assessments of hearing aid use among elderly people at a 6 -month follow-up after fitting. A secondary {{aim was to}} determine whether advanced knowledge of <b>follow-up</b> impacts hearing <b>aid</b> use. Design: Hearing aid use was assessed by datalogging (objective) and self-report (subjective) 6 months after initial fitting. Participants were also randomised to an intervention (informed of 6 -month follow-up at fitting) or control group (informed just prior to follow-up). Study sample: A total of 181 hearing aid recipients 60 years (mean age= 79. 2 years). Results: Daily hearing aid use based on datalogging (mean= 6. 12 h, SD= 4. 94) was significantly less than self-reports (mean= 8. 39 h, SD= 5. 07). More severe hearing impairment and prior hearing aid experience were associated with increased hearing aid use. Advanced knowledge of the follow-up had no significant impact on use, which did not differ between intervention (n= 93) and control (n= 88) groups.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the imaging and histopathologic appearance of fractures {{of the hands}} and feet in abused infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The imaging findings in 11 abused infants with fractures of the hands and feet were examined retrospectively. All 11 infants underwent skeletal surveys; five infants also underwent nuclear bone scanning. Postmortem radiographs of the specimen and histopathologic data were available in two infants. RESULTS: A total of 22 fractures were noted. Six infants had fractures of the hands: six metacarpal and nine proximal phalangeal fractures. Five infants had fractures of the feet: six metatarsal fractures and one proximal phalangeal fracture. Torus fractures predominated, and these patterns were confirmed at the histologic examinations. These morphologic features were consistent with a mechanism of forced hyperextension. Oblique views of the hands and <b>follow-up</b> skeletal surveys <b>aided</b> in detection of these injuries.

40|$|Abstract Background To date, {{there are}} no empirically {{validated}} treatments of good quality for adolescents showing suicidality and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. Risk factors for suicide are impulsive and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, depression, conduct disorders and child abuse. Behind this background, we tested the main hypothesis of our study; that Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents is an effective treatment for these patients. Methods Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) has been developed by Marsha Linehan - especially for the outpatient treatment of chronically non-suicidal patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The modified version of DBT for Adolescents (DBT-A) from Rathus & Miller has been adapted for a 16 - 24 week outpatient treatment in the German-speaking area by our group. The efficacy of treatment was measured by a pre-/post- comparison and a one-year <b>follow-up</b> with the <b>aid</b> of standardized instruments (SCL- 90 -R, CBCL, YSR, ILC, CGI). Results In the pilot study, 12 adolescents were treated. At the beginning of therapy, 83 % of patients fulfilled five or more DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder. From the beginning of therapy to one year after its end, the mean value of these diagnostic criteria decreased significantly from 5. 8 to 2. 75. 75 % of patients were kept in therapy. For the behavioral domains according to the SCL- 90 -R and YSR, we have found effect sizes between 0. 54 and 2. 14. During treatment, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior reduced significantly. Before the start of therapy, 8 of 12 patients had attempted suicide at least once. There were neither suicidal attempts during treatment with DBT-A nor at the one-year follow-up. Conclusions The promising {{results suggest that the}} interventions were well accepted by the patients and their families, and were associated with improvement in multiple domains including suicidality, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, emotion dysregulation and depression from the beginning of therapy to the one-year follow-up. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Region 4 Midwest Genetics Collaborative, made up {{of seven}} {{regional}} states (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin), brought together pediatric endocrinologists, state laboratory experts, public health follow-up specialists, and {{parents of children with}} congenital hypothyroidism (CH) to identify the three-year follow-up management and education patterns of primary care clinicians and pediatric endocrinologists in the care of children diagnosed with CH by state newborn screening (NBS) programs. Among a number of challenges, each state had different NBS methods, data systems, public health laws, and institutional review board (IRB) requirements. Furthermore, the diagnosis of CH was complicated by the timing of the NBS sample, the gestational age, weight, and co-morbidities at delivery. There were 409 children with CH identified through NBS in 2007 in the seven state region. The clinician of record and the parents of these children were invited to participate in a voluntary survey. Approximately 64 % of clinician surveys were collected with responses to questions relating to treatment, monitoring practices, educational resources, genetic counseling, and services provided to children with confirmed CH and their families. Nearly one-quarter (24 %) of parents surveyed responded to questions relating to treatment, education, genetic counseling, resources, and services they received or would like to receive. De-identified data from six of the seven states were compiled for analysis, with one state being unable to obtain IRB approval within the study timeline.

40|$|Abstract Background Hearing {{impairment}} is {{the most}} common body system disability in veterans. In 2008, nearly 520, 000 veterans had a disability for hearing loss through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Changes in eligibility for hearing aid services, along with the aging population, contributed to a greater than 300 % {{increase in the number of}} hearing aids dispensed from 1996 to 2006. In 2006, the VA committed to having no wait times for patient visits while providing quality clinically-appropriate care. One approach to achieving this goal is the use of group visits as an alternative to individual visits. We sought to determine: 1) if group hearing <b>aid</b> fitting and <b>follow-up</b> visits were at least as effective as individual visits, and 2) whether group visits lead to cost savings through the six month period after the hearing aid fitting. We describe the rationale, design, and characteristics of the baseline cohort of the first randomized clinical trial to study the impact of group versus individual hearing <b>aid</b> fitting and <b>follow-up</b> visits. Methods Participants were recruited from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System Audiology Clinic. Eligible patients had no previous hearing aid use and monaural or binaural air-conduction hearing aids were ordered at the evaluation visit. Participants were randomized to receive the hearing aid fitting and the hearing <b>aid</b> <b>follow-up</b> in an individual or group visit. The primary outcomes were hearing-related function, measured with the first module of the Effectiveness of Aural Rehabilitation (Inner EAR), and hearing aid adherence. We tracked the total cost of planned and unplanned audiology visits over the 6 -month interval after the hearing aid fitting. Discussion A cohort of 659 participants was randomized to receive group or individual hearing <b>aid</b> fitting and <b>follow-up</b> visits. Baseline demographic and self-reported health status and hearing-related measures were evenly distributed across the treatment arms. Outcomes after the 6 -month follow-up period are needed to determine if group visits were as least as good as those for individual visits and will be reported in subsequent publication.

40|$|The {{effects of}} lay {{outreach}} on access to prenatal care were evaluated in an African American inner-city population. Lay workers provided door-to-door casefinding and <b>follow-up</b> with material <b>aid,</b> emotional support, {{and social service}} referrals in a neighborhood {{at high risk for}} infant mortality. The study, based on the conceptual framework of access to health care developed by Aday and Andersen (1981), employed a comparison group design. The sample consisted of consecutive patients registered at the intervention health center (n = 111), and an adjoining health center without the intervention (n = 122). In both sites, nurse practitioners provided the publically funded prenatal care and coordinated with related social services. Data from prenatal questionnaires and prenatal and delivery records revealed that the intervention and comparison groups were similar in age, education, past pregnancies, past premature deliveries, and prenatal hemoglobin. Tobacco and cocaine use were significantly greater in the intervention group. In the casefinding area, 41 more women than expected began prenatal care (X 2 = 35. 47, df = 1, p 3 ̆c. 001). The intervention group received more childcare during clinic visits and more permanent housing and had greater satisfaction with care. No {{significant differences were found between}} the intervention and the comparison groups in barriers to prenatal care, number of prenatal visits, total social services received, birth weight, estimated gestational age, or baby 2 ̆ 7 s and mother 2 ̆ 7 s length of hospital stay. The comparison group began care an average 3. 5 weeks earlier than the intervention group. Barriers were not related to use of care, satisfaction, or health outcomes. Records reviewed for women without prenatal care from both neighborhoods (n = 72, 76) showed they were similar to the prenatal care groups in age and education but had significantly greater past pregnancies, past premature deliveries, and tobacco and cocaine use. Their infant outcomes were significantly worse. Confirming previous studies, lay outreach was effective in increasing prenatal care enrollment by 11...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Explore action {{research}} methodology to identify occupational {{needs of a}} target population. Discuss the impact of relationship building in addressing needs of a target population Outline opportunities for occupational scientists to use this methodology to address specific needs. Statement of Purpose: The purpose of this action based, case study research, utilizing a concurrent embedded mixed methods approach, {{was to examine the}} effects of a home-based, student-led caregiver education program to meet the occupational needs of caregivers of older adults. Many caregivers experience occupational imbalance in their attempts to meet the needs of the care recipient(s) in addition to their own needs. Many caregiver training programs have taken an educational approach, providing information. But a more active learning approach was undertaken in the current study to allow caregivers to learn specific skills and techniques within the context of their own home or environment of their choice. Description of methods: In order to best address the needs of five participants, a semi-structured interview was conducted and analyzed for themes in addition to obtaining perceptions of quality of life (Quality of Life Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale related to caregiving role), and burden (Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale) through Likert scale ratings. Specific skills or areas to focus the training were identified. At least 3 - 4 contacts were made with caregivers to establish rapport, understand the context of caregiving, identify occupational needs of the caregiver, teach skills and techniques, provide information, and follow-up through phone and/or email. All training was provided on an individual basis but participants gathered for a final group session to learn of additional resources and share experiences. Pre-intervention data from the questionnaires were compared with post-intervention data. Additionally, the Modified Multi-axial Assessment of Caregiver Intervention Outcomes was used to determine the effectiveness of the training to meet the targeted needs. Results: Two participants discontinued participation due to death or illness after the initial contacts. The remaining participants demonstrated improvements in their quality of life, efficacy, and burden based on observed scores. There was no statistically significant difference due to small sample. Qualitatively, participants reported benefitting from the training and were better prepared to handle the challenges of caregiving. Two cases are highlighted that best illustrates this {{action research}} methodology to understand and address the occupational needs of caregivers. Discussion/implications as related to occupational science: The home-based training program and engagement of caregivers in learning and applying new skills and knowledge was successful in addressing specific caregiver needs. The action based methodology employed in natural contexts allowed researchers to obtain the lived experience of caregivers. Researchers became more comfortable and used as knowledgeable resources for the caregiver. <b>Follow-up</b> contacts <b>aided</b> both caregivers and researchers to address unforeseen issues which also shed light on the participation patterns of the caregivers enabling the researchers to affectively experience the meaning and value placed on certain occupations performed in the caregiving role. This deeper level of knowledge of the occupational engagement of caregivers can enable more creative and effective training programs to be developed.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Realizar o levantamento do quantitativo dos procedimentos relacionados à adaptação de aparelho de amplificação sonora {{individual}} (AASI) incluídos na Tabela do Sistema Único de Saúde (Tabela SUS). MÉTODOS: Os dados sobre os procedimentos relacionados à adaptação de AASI incluídos na Tabela SUS foram levantados no site www. datasus. gov. br. Após o levantamento desses dados, foi realizada a organização e a análise descritiva da produção dos atendimentos ambulatoriais registrados pelos serviços de saúde auditiva do Brasil, durante o período de novembro de 2004 a julho de 2010. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente. RESULTADOS: Quanto aos procedimentos relacionados à dispensação de AASI no território nacional no âmbito da saúde auditiva, em 2006, a terapia fonoaudiológica ultrapassou o quantitativo obtido pela adaptação de AASI e, o acompanhamento fonoaudiológico, por sua vez, foi pouco realizado no país. Os AASI com tecnologias B e C vem sendo mais adaptados do que os AASI de tecnologia A e a realização de medida com microfone sonda ou acoplador de 2 cc na adaptação dos AASI é pouco realizada em comparação ao ganho funcional. CONCLUSÃO: Houve grandes avanços na atenção ao deficiente auditivo no país, mas é necessário aprimorar o acompanhamento dos usuários de AASI, e revisar procedimentos como medidas com microfone sonda e tecnologias dos AASI. PURPOSE: To quantity {{the procedures}} related to hearing aid fitting included in Hearing Health Care National Policy (Tabela SUS). METHODS: Data about fitting procedures included in Tabela SUS were {{gathered in the}} website www. datasus. gov. br. After data collection, it was conducted the organization and descriptive analysis of the production of ambulatory consults registered by hearing health services in Brazil, {{during the period from}} November 2004 to July 2010. Data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Regarding procedures related to dispensing hearing aids in national territory, in 2006, speech-language therapy exceeded the amount obtained by hearing aid fitting, and audiological follow-up was little frequent. Hearing aids with technologies B and C have been adapted more than hearing aids with technology A, and the use of measures with a real-ear measurement or 2 cc coupler in the adaptation of hearing aids is uncommon, in comparison to functional gain measures. CONCLUSION: There has been great progresses in the area of hearing impaired attention in the country, but it is necessary to improve the audiological <b>follow-up</b> to hearing <b>aid</b> users, and to review procedures such as the real-ear measurement and technologies of hearing aids...|$|R
40|$|Presbyacusis is {{the most}} common cause of hearing loss and is {{considered}} to be among the three most commonly reported chronic health problems of the elderly. In future years, the problem is predicted to be aggravated as the expected life span of the population increases. The psychological and social consequences of hearing impairment have been the subject of several texts. Numerous articles have been published expressing concerns involving the considerable number of hearing aids that are not being put to use and are permanently ending up in drawers. However, several unresolved issues regarding the practical implications of hearing loss, including the expectations and motivational factors regarding hearing aid use, still remain. These issues concern the elderly population, who represent the primary hearing aid users in society, in particular. Declining health, varying conditions of life, increased age and the considerable number of individuals living alone may influence the experience of hearing loss. Such knowledge could be of substantial importance to treatment and potentially be beneficial to the development of rehabilitation programmes. Objective and aims. The overall objective of this thesis was to obtain understanding and knowledge regarding hearing loss and hearing aid use among the elderly, in order to develop suitable audiological rehabilitation programmes. The specific aims: - To assess daily life consequences of hearing loss in older adults and to explore the influence of hearing loss through a subjective assessment of health and general life satisfaction, gender, age and marital status. - To describe preconceptions and expectations of older adults about getting hearing aids and to explore the influences of hearing loss, hearing aid experience, gender, age and marital status on these preconceptions and expectations. - To describe hearing aid use among older adults and to identify motivational factors associated with their use. Subjective and methods. This thesis is based on data from 174 men and women randomly selected from a waiting list for hearing aid fittings. The participants were all clients of the Department of Otolaryngology at the Lovisenberg Diakonale Hospital, a community hospital in Oslo. The inclusion criteria were that the participants were aged 65 years and above and that they expressed a need for hearing aids. Exclusion criteria were serious illness, senility and not being able to communicate in Norwegian. The study sample consisted of 174 individuals: 113 women (65 %) and 61 men (35 %) with an age range of 65 – 93 years. The mean age was 79. 7 years. All participants were examined by an ear, nose and throat specialist and were given a hearing test at their initial appointment at the hospital. Hearing loss was measured using pure tone audiometry according to recommended procedures. The Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale (HDHS) was used to measure perceived activity limitation and perceived participation restriction. The hearing aid scale, a 35 -item questionnaire in three sections, was constructed with specific focus on preconceptions and expectations regarding obtaining hearing aids and experiences regarding previous use. Demographic data were gathered to describe the study sample. Main findings. Perceived activity limitation was significantly associated with increased hearing loss and decreased health, and participation restriction significantly was associated with decreased life satisfaction. Gender, age and marital status did not appear to be determinant factors for perceived activity limitation and participation restriction. (Article I). Preconceptions and expectations of older adults regarding obtaining hearing aids revealed three factors: positive expectations, barriers and social pressure. Participants with moderate to severe hearing loss and hearing aid experience had significantly higher expectations towards hearing aids than participants with mild hearing loss and no hearing aid experience. The male gender was associated with fewer barriers toward hearing aids. Age and marital status had no influence on the three factors (Article II). The use of hearing aids was positively and significantly associated with follow-up support and acceptance of need. Twenty-two per cent had used their previously fitted hearing aids less than one hour a day. The degree of hearing loss, gender, age and marital status demographics were all not significantly associated with hearing aid use (Article III). Conclusions and implications for practice. The findings suggest that daily life consequences of hearing loss, health conditions and life satisfaction are closely related. The findings are also enlightening regarding the considerable impact on the individual experiencing hearing loss, whose life is affected and activities in daily life are limited. Health factors and psychosocial aspects should be considered as a part of the overall situation during the process of hearing aid fitting and rehabilitation. There are also indications of considerably varied preconceptions and expectations towards hearing aids among elderly hearing-impaired individuals. Less positive expectations and more problemoriented preconceptions among subjects with mild hearing loss may explain why hearing aids are scarcely used. The subjective acceptance of hearing loss, assessed need for hearing aids and experiences with follow-up support seem to be equally important to the benefits and use of hearing <b>aids.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> support, including individual rehabilitation programmes, may be of great importance to hearing aids being used, especially among individuals with a slight loss of hearing. Hearing aid fitting must be considered a long-term process that includes sufficient time for information, education and training as well as easy access to professionals when problems arise. The individual should be well informed regarding what the hearing rehabilitation process involves and what is required as far as individual achievements and patience. Our findings indicate an unmet need for audiological rehabilitation and follow-up support among elderly hearing aid users, which, at least to some extent, is verified by the vast number of fitted hearing aids that are seldom or never used. Audiological rehabilitation, including psychosocial aspects and educational aspects of hearing aids and communication, may well constitute an important contribution to increased social activity and participation rates by the elderly population with hearing impairments...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Patients with femoral neck {{fractures}} (FNFs) {{constitute an}} increasing health care problem which affect patient’s daily living after the trauma, reduce self-care possibilities, and increases mortality. Treatment {{of these patients}} is associated with increasing costs. Prospective systematic audit and national registers have been suggested {{as one of the}} best approaches to measuring and improving outcomes. Previously neither detailed audit of patients with hip fracture nor further analysis of data was conducted in Lithuania Aim of the research project – to estimate factors affecting outcome in patients with FNF and to audit patients’ care, assessing importance to the outcome results, comparing FNF patients treated in Lithuania and Sweden. Tasks of the research project: 1. 	To identify factors affecting functional outcome and quality of life in femoral neck fracture patients at four months follow-up. 2. 	To estimate the changes in functional outcome and quality of life in fe-moral neck fracture patients at four months and at one year follow-up. 3. 	To compare hip fracture patients care in Kaunas Clinics and Lund University Hospital and identify differences during patients’ trans¬por-tation, preoperative, and postoperative time periods. 4. 	To compare functional and quality of life outcome in femoral neck fracture patients treated in Kaunas Clinics and Lund University Hos-pital. Patients and methods To achieve the aims of the research project, three consequential stu¬dies were conducted. The first study investigated patients with FNF treated in Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Clinics (Kaunas Clinics, KC) from 1 st January, 2008 to 31 st May, 2010. The following forms and questionnaires were used: Standardized Hip Fracture Register Form No 1, Mini Mental State Examination questionnaire, Mini Nutritional Assess¬ment questionnaire. Patients’ risk of pressure ulcers assessment was done by nurses at the admission to the department using Norton Scale. The pain in fractured hip before and after the surgery was evaluated using self-reported numeric pain measurement scale. Confusion Assessment Method was used for recognition of postoperative delirium. The patients had been investigated at four months and at one year after the fracture for hip joint function and health related quality of life (HRQL). The factors affecting patients’ hip functional status and HRQL were identified. In the second study we performed an audit of care for patients with hip fracture in Kaunas Clinics from 2 nd January, 2009 to 31 st December, 2009. The information about the following procedures applied during hip fracture patients’ transportation to the hospital and their stay in Acute and Emergency department was collected: pain and use of analgesics, infusion therapy, oxygen therapy, blood test sampling, and immobilization. Similarly the information about the procedures applied during the patients stay in the orthopaedic ward before and after the surgery was collected. The information about mean time period from admission to health care institution to surgery, length of stay in the orthopaedic de-partment, incidence of pressure ulcers, and information about discharge location was collected. The audit results were compared to hip fracture care in LUH In the third study we compared FNF patients, treated in Kaunas Clinics from 1 st January, 2008 to 31 st August, 2010 and Lund University Hospital, treated from 1 st March, 2009 to 1 st March, 2010, in respect to their functional outcome and HRQL at four months follow-up. All patients included into the study were investigated prospectively according to the National Swedish Hip Fracture Register model and the same study protocol was applied for patients in Kaunas and Lund. Four months after the injury additionally Euro Qol- 5 D questionnaire was used for analysis. Results The first study results. There were 145 FNF patients from Kaunas Clinics included into the study. Hip joint function and HRQL results were analysed for 97 patients. At four months follow-up patients were using more walking aids (p< 0. 001), and mobility function was worse (p= 0. 001) than before the fracture. In regression analysis patients with higher ASA grade (p= 0. 008) and those, who were living alone (p= 0. 049) before the fracture, rated significantly worse their ability to perform usual activities in daily living according HOOS questionnaire. Regression analysis of EQ- 5 D showed that worse mobility, use of more walking aids before the fracture, living alone, and higher ASA grade significantly correlated all five dimensions at four months follow-up. At one year follow-up hip joint function and HRQL was evaluated for 86 patients. Patients’ mobility remained significantly worse than before the fracture (p< 0. 001). The hip related quality of life subscale from HOOS patients evaluated significantly better at one year follow-up (p= 0. 02). Comparison analysis of EQ- 5 D mobility dimension showed the significant improvement (p= 0. 03) in mobility when compared four months and one year after the fracture follow-up. The EQ- 5 D VAS analysis did not revealed statistically significant changes (p= 0. 6) in patients self-reported health status assessment at four months (56. 9; SD – 22) and one year (55. 8; SD – 23) follow-up after FNF. The second study results. During patients’ transportation to Kaunas Clinics, immobilization and pain relief drugs were used occasionally dur¬ing patients’ care. No oxygen therapy and no blood sample and ECG were taken before admission to Kaunas Clinics. That was not the case in LUH, where all these interventions were performed. At postoperative period the main differences in patient care were found in pressure ulcers prophylactic and nutritional state evaluation and correction. The mean time period from admission to surgery in Kaunas Clinics was 67 hours (CI 47 – 87) as compared to 25 hours (CI 22 – 28) in LUH. The third study results. Functional and quality of life outcome at four months of 99 FNF patients treated with arthroplasty in Kaunas and 117 in Lund was investigated. The patients in Kaunas were more mobile (p< 0. 001) and were using less walking aids (p< 0. 001) before trauma and at four moths follow-up. According EQ- 5 D questionnaire results at 4 months, patients in Lund reported significantly better self-care (p< 0. 001), felt less pain and discomfort (0. 007), and had less anxiety and depression symptoms (p= 0. 01). Worse mobility in EQ- 5 D was related to worse mo¬bility before fracture (p< 0. 001) and higher ASA grade (p= 0. 008). Sweden as country of residence (p< 0. 001), better mobility before and after the trauma (p= 0. 001), and lower ASA grade (p< 0. 001) significantly affected better patients self care from EQ- 5 D. Better rates of usual activities from EQ- 5 D were significantly related to Sweden as country of residence (p< 0. 001), younger age (p= 0. 004), and better mobility before and after the trauma (p< 0. 001). Better rating of pain/discomfort dimension from EQ- 5 D significantly related to Sweden as country of residence (p< 0. 001) and usage of less walking <b>aids</b> at <b>follow-up</b> (0. 001). Better rating of anxiety/ depression from EQ- 5 D was significantly related to country of residence (Sweden) (p< 0. 001) and better mobility at follow up (p< 0. 001). Conclusions 1. 	Patients’ with higher preoperative physical status classification grade and living alone had worse functional results at four months <b>follow-up.</b> Walking <b>aids</b> usage before fracture, greater physical status clas¬sification grade, worse mobility before fracture, and living alone nega¬tively affected femoral neck fracture patients’ health related quality of life. 2. 	The main improvement in femoral neck fracture patients’ hip function occurred during first four months postoperatively. No significant positive changes in patients’ hip function assessed by self-report were found during period from four months to one year after trauma; but significant improvement of health related quality of life was observed. 3. 	The major differences observed during patients transportation to the hospital and management after admission until the surgery may have a negative effect on the outcome. Based on these differences a new patients care algorithm was introduced in Kaunas Clinics. 4. 	Femoral neck fracture patients in Kaunas Clinics were more mobile before fracture and at four months follow-up as compared to Lund University Hospital; however patients in Lund were rating their health related quality of life higher at one year follow-up after the treatment.
