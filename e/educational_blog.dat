30|$|In the {{previous}} studies, news, emails and blogs are usually taken as data source for topic detection. Compared with normative text, documents in social networks, such as forums and micro-blogs, exhibit more informal oral language. So we conducted two case studies to verify our approach. The {{results show that}} our proposed approach performs satisfactory to extract hot topics for datasets of both the <b>educational</b> <b>blog</b> and the “parent–child” forum. Though the topic evolution pattern of the two datasets differs, the common finding is that the hot topics discovered in the {{two different types of}} communities could virtually reflect the situations in the physical world, and thus the visualization of such discovery will help users to easily find out the focus of discussions and better understand of the topic evolution. For instance, regarding the <b>educational</b> <b>blog,</b> we can see a growing and waning interest in NCEE in a certain period, which indicates that the external factors like dates of exams and news stories lead to the emergence of new hot topics, and correspondingly the fading of interests in physical world will cause the decline of the hot topics. As for the “parent–child” forum, the discovered hot topics indicate the lasting interests that parents hold. For example, the hot topics such as “English” and “Habit” remain relatively stable, which implies that the main issues of concern to many Chinese parents are children’s early English learning and habit fostering. Further exploration of this observation reveals that the participants in the forum are mainly parents of primary students while the blog authors are some authorized education experts or the ones who tend to express their opinions in education.|$|E

The research questions were: 1) what possible evidence of reflective processes can be observed in the interactions among the participants?, and 2) how the group sought to build reflective processes in this virtual environment?

The detailed description of such <b>educational</b> <b>blog</b> types as a tutor blog, a learner blog and a group blog is presented since these types are considered to be the most effective ones for language study among all other types of blogs.

The recommendations are based on the personal author experience which was gained while English language teaching at technical university. The author considers that blog technology for educational purposes is proved.

40|$|Accompanying the {{emergence}} of blog technology as a dominant online publishing paradigm is a growing interest in its educational benefits and applications. This study sets out to develop an empirically grounded framework for <b>educational</b> <b>blogging</b> {{in the context of}} teacher education. A working framework was first proposed that highlights four areas: self-expression, self-reflection, social interaction, and reflective dialogue. An exploratory study was then conducted to examine the framework by involving two groups of student teachers during their teaching practice. This study revealed that the salient values of blogs centered on emotionally charged and social-oriented individual expressions as well as self-reflection. The interactive functionality of blogs was used mostly for exchanging social support rather than reflective dialogue. A new dimension - blog-reading - has emerged through the investigation and been added to the original framework.
