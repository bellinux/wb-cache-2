" In light of this ongoing approach, we sought to assess impacts of enforcement on <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> behaviors <b>among</b> a cohort of injection drug users (IDU) in Thailand. We examined <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> patterns <b>among</b> IDU participating in a cross-sectional study conducted in Bangkok (n = 252). Participants were asked to provide data regarding patterns of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> in the previous six months, including types of drugs consumed, method of consumption, frequency of use, and weekly income spent on drugs. We also conducted bivariate analyses to identify a possible effect of a reported increase in police presence on measures of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and related risk behaviors among study participants. One hundred fifty-five (61. 5 %) individuals reported injection heroin use and 132 (52. 4 %) individuals reported injection midazolam use at least daily in the past six months. Additionally, 86 (34. 1 %) individuals reported at least daily injection Yaba and Ice (i. e., methamphetamine) use. Participants in our study reported high levels of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> including the injection of both illicit and licit drugs. In bivariate analyses, no association between increased police presence and <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> behaviors was observed. These findings demonstrate high ongoing rates of drug injecting in Thailand despite reports of increased levels of strict enforcement and enforcement-related violence, and raise questions regarding the merits of this approach. </p...|$|R

A total of 318 students completed a self-reported questionnaire that solicited information related to their demographics and activities, measures of threat appraisal and coping appraisal, and the intention to <b>use</b> <b>drugs.</b> Logistic regression analysis showed that intrinsic and extrinsic rewards were significant predictors of intention. The odds ratios were equal to 2. 90 (p < 0. 05) and 8. 04 (p < 0. 001), respectively. The logistic regression model analysis resulted in a high Nagelkerke R 2 of 0. 49, which suggests that PMT related measures could be <b>used</b> in predicting <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> intention <b>among</b> adolescents.
