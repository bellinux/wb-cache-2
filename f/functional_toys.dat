40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the Gram-negative {{bacterial}} outer membrane glycolipid, induces sepsis {{through its}} interaction with myeloid differentiation protein- 2 (MD- 2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). To block interaction between LPS/MD- 2 complex and TLR 4, we designed and generated soluble fusion proteins capable of binding MD- 2, dubbed TLR 4 decoy receptor (TOY) using ‘the Hybrid leucine-rich repeats (LRR) technique’. TOY contains the MD- 2 binding ectodomain of TLR 4, the LRR motif of hagfish variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR), and the Fc domain of IgG 1 {{to make it}} soluble, productive, and <b>functional.</b> <b>TOY</b> exhibited strong binding to MD- 2, {{but not to the}} extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in vivo. TOY significantly extended the lifespan, when administered in either preventive or therapeutic manners, in both the LPS- and cecal ligation/puncture-induced sepsis models in mice. TOY markedly attenuated LPS-triggered NF-kB activation, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and thrombus formation in multiple organs. Taken together, the targeting strategy for sequestration of LPS/MD- 2 complex using the decoy receptor TOY is effective in treating LPS- and bacteria-induced sepsis; furthermore, the strategy used in TOY development {{can be applied to the}} generation o...|$|R

In an {{interview}} with CNBC, Telfer states that {{she came up with}} the idea of <b>functional</b> stuffed <b>toys</b> when her oldest son, then seven, flattened out one of his stuffed animals from sleeping with it often. She decided on a combination of a pillow and a stuffed animal as the concept for Pillow Pets. Telfer and her husband proposed a meeting with a plush manufacturer at a tradeshow in Las Vegas, and decided to wholesale the toys themselves through their company, CJ Products (CJ is a combination of their first initials). Following the meeting, the Telfers were prepared to sell the first toys.|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{measurement system}} {{was developed to}} monitor play in children with autism and typically developing children. The {{study was conducted in}} a preschool operated in conjunction with a center-based program for children with autism. The development of the measurement system was based on observations of four children with autism and three typically developing children during social and play activites. Data were collected on material use and several dimensions of play: Simple Manipulation, <b>Functional</b> Manipulation, Symbolic <b>Toy</b> Play, Symbolic Role Play and Play Themes. The results indicated that the measurement system consistently measured a wide range of play behaviors across children and materials. Significance of the information gathered from the measurement system in assessing play and designing interventions is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{constraint}} functional logic programming approach over finite domain (CFLP(FD)) for solving typical combinatorial problems. Our approach adds to former approaches as (Constraint) Logic Programming, and Functional Logic Programming both expressiveness and further efficiency by combining combinatorial search wit h propagation. We integrate finite domain constraints into the <b>functional</b> logic language <b>TOY.</b> CFLP(FD) programs consist of TOY rules with finite domain constraints declared as functions. CFLP(FD) seamlessly combines {{the power of}} the constraint logic programming over finite domains with the higher order characteristics of the functional logic programming paradigm. This paper describes a language for CFLP(FD), the evaluation mechanism of CFLP(FD) programs, an implementation of our language for CFLP(FD) and programming examples that demonstrate the potential of the integration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} for {{the integration of the}} cooperative constraint solving of numeric constraint domains into higher-order functional and logic programming on λ-abstractions, using an instance of a generic Constraint Functional Logic Programming (CFLP) scheme over a so-called higher-order coordination domain. We provide this framework as a powerful computational model for the higher-order cooperation of algebraic constraint domains over real numbers and integers, which has been useful in practical applications involving the hybrid combination of its components, so that more declarative and efficient solutions can be promoted. Our proposal of computational model has been proved sound and complete with respect to the declarative semantics provided by the CFLP scheme, and enriched with new mechanisms for modeling the intended cooperation among the numeric domains and a novel higher-order constraint domain equipped with a sound and complete constraint solver for solving higher-order equations. We argue the applicability of our approach describing a prototype implementation on top of the constraint <b>functional</b> logic system <b>TOY...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} simple call-by-value and call-by-name abstract machines, expressed {{with the}} help of Felleisen’s evaluation contexts, for a <b>toy</b> <b>functional</b> language. Then we add a simple control operator and extend the abstract machines accordingly. We give some examples of their use. Then, restricting our attention to the sole core (typed) λ-calculus fragment augmented with the control operator, we give a logical status to the machinery. Evaluation contexts are typed “on the left”, as they are directed towards their hole, or their input, in contrast to terms, whose type is that of their output. A machine state consists of a term and a context, and corresponds logically to a cut between a formula on the left (context) and a formula on the right (term). Evaluation, viewed logically, is cut-elimination: this is the essence of the so-called Curry-Howard isomorphism. Control operators correspond to classical reasoning principles, as was first observed by Griffin. 1 A simple call-by-value evaluator Consider the following simple functional programming language, whose data types are (nonnegative) integers and lists...|$|R
40|$|Pax 6 genes encode {{transcription}} factors {{with two}} DNA-binding domains {{that are highly}} conserved during evolution. In Drosophila, two Pax 6 genes function in a pathway in which twin of eyeless (toy) directly regulates eyeless (ey), which is necessary for initiating the eye developmental pathway. To investigate the gene duplication of Pax 6 that occurred in holometabolous insects like Drosophila and silkworm, we used different truncated forms of toy and small eyes (sey), and tested their capacity to induce ectopic eye development in an ey-independent manner. Even though the Paired domains of TOY and SEY have DNA-binding properties that {{differ from those of}} the Paired domain of EY, they all are capable of inducing ectopic eye development in an ey mutant background. We also show that one of the main <b>functional</b> differences between <b>toy</b> and ey lies in the C-terminal region of their protein products, implying differences in their transactivation potential. Furthermore, we show that only the homeodomain (HD) of EY is able to downregulate the expression of Distal-less (Dll), a feature that is required during endogenous eye development. These results suggest distinct functions of the two DNA-binding domains of TOY and EY, and significant evolutionary divergence between the two Drosophila Pax 6 genes...|$|R
