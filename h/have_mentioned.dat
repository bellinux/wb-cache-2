5|$|Since its premiere, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and interpreted by professional film critics, amateur writers and science fiction fans, {{virtually all of}} whom <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> its deliberate ambiguity. Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in the universe, to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as {{the meaning of the}} monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
5|$|In 733, Bede {{travelled}} to York {{to visit}} Ecgbert, {{who was then}} bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, {{and it is likely}} that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, and at some point visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and {{due to the fact that}} many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.|$|E

25|$|Euclid is {{sometimes}} reported to <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> the camera obscura phenomenon {{as a demonstration}} that light travels in straight lines in his very influential Optics (circa 300 BCE). However, in common translations no remarks of anything that resembles camera obscura can be found. Claims could be based on later versions, since Ignazio Danti added a description of camera obscura in his 1573 annotated translation.|$|E

25|$|Diamonds {{were first}} mined in India. Pliny may <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> them, {{although}} there is some debate as to {{the exact nature of}} the stone he referred to as Adamas; In 2005, Australia, Botswana, Russia and Canada ranked among the primary sources of gemstone diamond production. There are negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas. Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and other nations have been labelled as blood diamonds when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} fashion blogs {{also serve as}} a source of {{advertisement}} to both designers and fashion retail stores. These advertisements have had a heavy influence on fashion designers of various standings, helping to give a name to small up-and-coming designers as well as bringing high-end designers back to life. Many of the top fashion bloggers are said to have received free samples of the designer pieces that they <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> in their blogs and some top fashion bloggers got paid for wearing and publishing a brand name product on their Instagram account.|$|E
25|$|The {{objection}} although partially true {{is itself}} flawed. Strabo interjects his own {{view of the}} location of Celtica, that it was opposite to Britain, end to end. Pytheas, however, places it further south, around {{the mouth of the}} Loire (see above), from which it might justifiably be several days' sail. The people across from Britain in Caesar's time are the Germani in the north and the Belgae in the south. Still, some of the Celtic lands were on the channel and were visible from it, which Pytheas should <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> but Strabo implies he did not.|$|E

The crew quickly settled the subject of payment by deciding that each member would get one share of the treasure, and the captain would get two. Every then renamed the Charles II the Fancy—a name which reflected both the crew's renewed hope in their journey {{and the quality of}} the ship—and set a course for the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E
25|$|The pitches on the organistrum {{were set}} {{according}} to Pythagorean temperament and {{the instrument was}} primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music. Abbot Odo of Cluny (died 942) {{is supposed to have}} written a short description of the construction of the organistrum entitled Quomodo organistrum construatur (How the Organistrum Is Made), known through a much later copy, but its authenticity is very doubtful. Another 10th century treatise thought to <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an Arabic musical compendium written by Al Zirikli. One of the earliest visual depictions of the organistrum is from the twelfth-century Pórtico da Gloria (Portal of Glory) on the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain: it has a carving of two musicians playing an organistrum.|$|E
25|$|We <b>have</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{that natural}} {{selection}} has not played its part {{for a long}} while. That many inferior individuals have been conserved {{through the efforts of}} hygiene and medicine. But we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal. Or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weaklings in a litter of puppies. The only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong. Our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless. We should, then, turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit. By making the strong still stronger, we could effectively help the weak; For the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite. Instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities, we should amplify them and construct greater men.|$|E
