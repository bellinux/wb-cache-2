(2) Frequency dependencies of tanδ a about 400 – 8000 Hz showed that <b>impregnated</b> <b>wood</b> has much lower tan δ than untreated wood at around 9 % mois ture content (MC), except for the high-frequency region.

In Denmark wood waste containing creosote or As is classified as hazardous waste. Creosote was never used to a larger extent in Denmark and As has not been used in wood preservatives since 1993 where the use was forbidden.

40|$|The common {{method to}} <b>impregnate</b> <b>wood</b> with {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) is {{to store the}} samples for several weeks in aqueous PEG-solution, allowing for diffusion of PEG into the wood.

Using European oak wood and three variants of PEG, including silane-functionalized PEG, impregnation experiments at different PEG concentrations were performed. Significant uptake of PEG resulted in clearly altered wood-water relations and improved dimensional stability of oak wood.
