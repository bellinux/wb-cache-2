2500|$|In 2002, X, {{designed}} by Arrow, opened in Six Flags Magic Mountain. It is marketed as the world's first Fourth dimension roller coaster, capable of rotating riders upside-down independently of any track elements. This adds difficulty in delineating {{the number of}} inversions such rides have. As the riders physically rotate 360 degrees forward and backwards, proponents insist the number of inversions should not include only track elements. According to Guinness World Records, the roller coaster with the most inversions counted this way is Eejanaika ( [...] , Ain't it great?), essentially a clone of X, in Fuji-Q Highland of Fujiyoshida, Japan, which rotates riders 14 times. Counting only track elements, however, The Smiler at Alton Towers, Staffordshire, England <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> record for the world's first 14 looping roller coaster.

As Randy is the first American to ever receive the award, the American government holds a ceremony to honor his achievement. However, it is interrupted by a video of Bono, the previous record holder, claiming he has just taken a crap weighing 9.5 courics, and is therefore still the record holder. His claim is accepted, despite protests that his only proof is an unverified photo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{highest of}} Hanif's Test centuries {{was a famous}} 337 made against West Indies in a six-day test at Bridgetown in 1957/58. After Pakistan found itself {{following}} on from a first-innings deficit of 473 runs {{on the afternoon of}} the third day, Hanif spent more than sixteen hours at the crease compiling his runs, allowing Pakistan to draw the game. It remains the longest innings in Test history (and stood as the longest in all first-class cricket for over 40 years). It was the only Test match instance of a triple century in a team's second innings until it was equaled by New Zealand cricketer Brendon McCullum against India in 2014. Displays such as this earned him the nickname [...] "Little Master".

2500|$|A special {{portion of}} Negoiţescu's essays {{deals with the}} meeting point between the {{currents}} of Romanian nationalism and the themes recovered by the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. During his exile years, he was especially vocal in condemning Constantin Noica's late essays, which communist authorities tolerated for their critique of the Western world. To Noica's claim that Westerners had been pushed to [...] "hate the world", forgetting their roots and heading for a collective disaster, he replied: [...] "Is there now {{a place in the}} world that is more evidently heading for catastrophe than Romania is? [...] Where <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> been tarnished and where is it still tarnished more than in Noica's homeland? Where o where is European culture more degraded at this time than in the country where the very monuments of European significance and value are being more and more systematically torn down or mutilated in every way conceivable?" [...] Deeming his adversary's statements [...] "an offense to liberty itself", Negoiţescu also placed Noica's isolationism and anti-Europeanism in connection with a common attitude in post-World War II Romania. According to this claim, the country had been abandoned by Europe: [...] "like Noica, whose writings have no echo in the Occident, [...] feel that they are shouting in the desert and curse the desert which does not hear and does not answer them." [...] He believed to have identified the roots of this mentality in the political and cultural clashes of the Cold War, extending his earlier comments regarding the continental alignment of Romanian culture: [...] "after 1947 our culture has been forcefully torn from its natural European context." ...|$|E
