60|$|Already {{the evening}} had been vastly {{profitable}} to him. There would be three goats for {{the initiation of}} the three youths into full-fledged warriorship, and besides these he had received several <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> and beads, together {{with a piece of}} copper wire from admiring and terrified members of his audience.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their farm, the Bushes ran a roadside hotel for free. Wayfarers traveling between Cowlitz Landing and Puget Sound liked to stop there. It was open to anyone who came through the area. The Bushes would give visitors a good square meal and gave <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> and fruit grown on the Bush farm.|$|E
5000|$|By 124 BC, he {{had been}} elected {{to the office of}} Praetor, since in 123 BC, he was {{appointed}} Propraetorial governor in Hispania. Whilst there, he was censured by the Senate, following a motion by Gaius Gracchus, for extorting <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> from a Spanish town. Then in 121 BC, he was elected consul alongside Lucius Opimius. During his consulship, he campaigned in Gallia Transalpina (in the modern day Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes regions) with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus against the Gallic tribes of the Allobroges and Arverni. After his consulship expired, he replaced Domitius Ahenobarbus as Proconsul in Gaul (120 BC), during which time he completed the defeat of the Allobroges and Averni [...] For this he was awarded the honour of a triumph and given the agnomen Allobrogicus. The triumph he held was famous for its spectacle, including the captive Arvernian king Bituitus in his silver battle armor. From the plunder of the Auvergne, Fabius erected the Fornix Fabianus (121 BC) crossing the Via Sacra at the Forum Romanum, placing a statue of himself on top of the arch.|$|E
5000|$|At Athens some {{citizens}} {{were far more}} active than others, but the vast numbers required for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation among those eligible that greatly surpassed any present-day democracy. Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizens—after the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC, they [...] "would be confined to those whose parents were bothAthenian". Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later, when a free <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> had arrived from the Egyptian king, to be distributed among all citizens, [...] "many 'illegitimates' were discovered" [...] and removed from the registers.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the legend is that Sikandar Lodhi {{on one of his}} visits to the area played a prank on his Prime Minister by giving him a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> a <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> moth (lentil). The Wazir {{accepted}} the gift in good grace and instead of throwing it away planted it in his garden. Over the years repeated plantation resulted in a rich harvest that provided a surplus income to the Wazir. Thereafter, the wazir, with the revenue earned from the lentil grains, decided to build a mosque. On completion, he invited the Sultan to visit the mosque and narrated the sequence of events which led to the building of the mosque. Impressed by this unique achievement, the Lodi named the mosque as [...] "Moth Ki Masjid" [...] or the Mosque from the Moth Lentil.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Emil Gayk" [...] sketch was {{the only}} one which is {{precisely}} dated to the early stages of World War I, focusing its satire on the debates of neutralists and interventionists. Gayk, the ever-vigilant, gun-tauting, bird-like civilian, who sleeps in his tailcoat but otherwise wears only a festooned drape, swims about in just one direction ("for fear of coming out of his neutrality") and gets inspired by the military muses. His career is in foreign relations, which he revolutionizes with such novel ideas as the negotiated annexation of a unidimensional, arrow-like, territory at Năsăud—pointed toward Luxembourg, in memory of the 1914 invasion. Gayk has an adoptive daughter, educated on his behalf by waiters, who makes her home in the fields and eventually demands access to the sea. Angered by this claim, Gayk begins a large-scale war against her; the conflict ends in a stalemate, as Gayk can no longer accessorize his marshal's uniform, and the girl has lost her supplies of gasoline and beans. The father is placated with regular <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> feed <b>grain,</b> whereas the daughter is allowed a two-centimeter-wide littoral.|$|R
40|$|Digitized {{microfilm}} {{of correspondence}} and papers from the Andrew Dickson White collection. The {{first part of}} this reel covers the period White and his wife were shopping in Europe for their St. Petersburg household. Wurts wrote lengthy letters arranging for the apartment and furniture and advising in detail the clothing Mrs. White would need for her official social life. White commissioned copyists to paint portraits of famous jurors to hang in the new law school at Cornell. He received letters from Huffcut, Schurman, and Thurston as well as reports from the librarians and Ulysses Grant Weatherly, who was conducting research for White's Warfare of Science chapters. There are letters concerning <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> American <b>grain</b> and loans made the Russian government for famine relief. Early reports show White discouraged by his inability to effect any change in the plight of the Russian Jews. The agreement on extradition being negotiated with the Russians is referred to, but there is little mention of the Bering Sea negotiations, which were conducted through official diplomatic channels. Several writers mention preparations for the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, and Holls reported on American political matters...|$|R
500|$|The stele is a late {{example of}} a class of {{donation}} stelae, which depicts the reigning monarch granting a tax exemption to the resident priesthood. Pharaohs had erected these stelae over the previous 2,000 years, the earliest examples dating from the Egyptian Old Kingdom. In earlier periods, all such decrees were issued by the king himself, but the Memphis decree was issued by the priests, as the maintainers of traditional Egyptian culture. The decree records that PtolemyV gave a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> silver and <b>grain</b> to the temples. It also records that there was particularly high flooding of the Nile in the eighth year of his reign, {{and he had the}} excess waters dammed {{for the benefit of the}} farmers. In return for these concessions, the priesthood pledged that the king's birthday and coronation days would be celebrated annually, and that all the priests of Egypt would serve him alongside the other gods. The decree concludes with the instruction that a copy was to be placed in every temple, inscribed in the [...] "language of the gods" [...] (hieroglyphs), the [...] "language of documents" [...] (demotic), and the [...] "language of the Greeks" [...] as used by the Ptolemaic government.|$|R
