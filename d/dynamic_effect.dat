25|$|The north Atlantic is {{characterized}} by strong, large-scale anomalies of the gravity field and the geoid. The geoid rises up to 70 m above the geodetic reference ellipsoid in an approximately circular area with a diameter of several hundred kilometers. In {{the context of the}} plume hypothesis, this has been explained by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>effect</b> of the upwelling plume which bulges up the surface of the Earth. Furthermore, the plume and the thickened crust cause a positive gravity anomaly of about 60 mGal (=0.0006m/s²) (free-air).|$|E
25|$|Danish cinema {{dates back}} to 1897 and since the 1980s has {{maintained}} {{a steady stream of}} product due largely to funding by the state-supported Danish Film Institute. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the silent era; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the Dogme 95 movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to <b>dynamic</b> <b>effect</b> in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer (1889–1968) {{is considered one of the}} greatest directors of early cinema.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, {{the water}} {{retention}} characteristic is measured under equilibrium or steady-state flow conditions, {{and it is}} assumed that the so-determined properties can be used to model transient water flow under field conditions. However, comparison of retention data obtained with the conventional method and using transient methods indicate the presence of “dynamic effects ” which show up as differences between static and dynamic hydraulic functions. This paper reviews previous evidence of <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects,</b> illustrates the presence of <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> during a multistep outflow/inflow experiment, and discusses an experiment specifically designed to quantify <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects.</b> Finally, a comparison of simulations with the classical Richards model and a two-phase flow model show that <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> are to a considerable part caused by non-negligible resistances of air flow...|$|R
40|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> {{associated}} with fibre breakage in single- and multiple-fibre composites were investigated using the finite element method. The {{goal of this}} work {{was to determine if}} the dynamic stresses differed significantly from the static stresses and, consequently, if <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> were important in the prediction of subsequent fracture of the composite. For single-fibre composites, dynamic and static analyses were performed over a range of modulus values for epoxy matrices with a glass fibre to establish a range of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects.</b> The maximum <b>dynamic</b> stresses, spatial distribution of dynamic stresses, and corresponding times were evaluated. For multiple-fibre composites, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> {{associated with}} single- and double-fibre breakage were investigated for a typical epoxy/glass composite and compared to the corresponding static problems. 1...|$|R

Due to the wide frame, moving a {{character}} forward did not produce the <b>dynamic</b> <b>effect</b> Suzuki desired. Instead, he relied on spotlighting and chiaroscuro imagery to create excitement and suspense. Conventional framing and film grammar were disregarded in favour of spontaneous inspiration. In editing, Suzuki frequently abandoned continuity, favouring abstract jumps in time and space as he found it made the film more interesting. Critic David Chute suggested that Suzuki's stylistics had intensified—in seeming congruence with the studio's demands that he conform: ...|$|E
500|$|This {{painting}} has a Ben-Day dots background {{with four}} layered vigorous brushstrokes atop them in white, yellow, green, and red. The focal {{point is the}} topmost central red brushstroke that depicts dripping paint. The black contours contribute a <b>dynamic</b> <b>effect</b> to the two-dimensional work. The subject of the painting {{is the process of}} Abstract Expressionist painting via sweeping brushstrokes and drips, but the result of Lichtenstein's simplification that uses a Ben-Day dots background is a representation of the mechanical/industrial color printing reproduction. [...] Big Painting No. 6 [...] is depicts imitations of what could be typical Abstract Expressionist brushstrokes on an extremely large scale. Since it is depicted as a reproduction of an imitation the painting is two steps removed from an original. While each Abstract Expressionist brushstroke is an instantaneous effort, the satire includes the fact that Lichtenstein took {{a great deal of time}} to achieve the complicated reproduction.|$|E

They should be given into some real manly charge. And there should be some actual initiation into sex life.

In short, a long, violent initiation, from which the lad emerges emaciated, but cut off forever from childhood, entered into the serious, responsible pale of manhood.

40|$|For the {{quantification}} {{of vehicle}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> at passing over turnouts {{at a higher}} speed there was developed a methodology for evaluating of acceleration measured on vehicle axle boxes in the year 2003. The methodology is based on statistical evaluation of lateral and vertical acceleration measured values at passing over both critical parts of a turnout (tongue, frog). The created methodology was used for investigation of vehicle <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> by running at speed up to 230 km/h in the year 2004 in terms of high speed tests of tilting-body unit class 680 CD. There was found relatively high values of <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> already at a speed 160 km/h. In terms of tilting-body unit class 680 tests at a higher speed in curves of chosen track lines of 1 st and 2 nd corridor of Czech Railways there was carried out also verification of curved turnouts state according to methodology mentioned above {{with a view to}} possibility of speed increasing at curved throats of chosen stations. Lateral vehicle <b>dynamic</b> <b>effects</b> at passing over a curved turnout frog area were evaluated. There were carried out simulation calculations of vehicle passing over a turnout based on measured geometric parameters of wheelset as well as chosen turnouts.
