25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays <b>hauteur.</b> Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E
25|$|He {{was mostly}} based in Genoa, {{although}} he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed {{for some time}} in Palermo in Sicily. For the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures {{look down on the}} viewer with great <b>hauteur.</b> In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of Brussels he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695. He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630 he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large altarpieces, and began his printmaking (see below).|$|E
500|$|Cavendish {{had been}} acquainted with Lord Granville {{her whole life}} and never {{particularly}} cared for him, having disapproved alike of his lofty <b>hauteur</b> and his illicit liaison with her aunt. Now however, she came to appreciate Granville's finer qualities: historians describe him as handsome, intelligent, of good family, {{and a member of}} the British parliament. The historian K. D. Reynolds writes that Granville was [...] "considered one of the most handsome men of his time; his curly brown hair, blue eyes, and sensuous features brought him strings of female admirers." [...] While eager to leave Devonshire House, the morally upright girl insisted that his affair with her aunt be truly over. Granville was unsure if he wanted the unglamorous Cavendish as a marriage partner, however, and spent his time pursuing other candidates; their refusals, often in response to his womanising reputation, led him to ultimately choose Cavendish.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian who {{compared}} the singer's performance with Tina Turner praised the show's [...] "bombastic" [...] opening and wrote that [...] "there's something powerful and relentless" [...] about it. He concluded [...] "while onstage Beyoncé feels weirdly unassailable". [...] Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times noted, [...] "What left the deepest impression was {{something far more}} elemental: Beyoncé's ability to make self-aggrandizement seem like an expression of humility... ambition seemed in proportion with her fans' expectations; she came by the sense of scale honestly." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire highlighted the art direction of the show as [...] "nothing short of breathtaking, making awesome and repeated use of silhouette, of great white blocks of video screens, of live dancers interacting with video". She praised the singer's [...] "fierce" [...] tireless dancing and concluded, [...] "But for all the <b>hauteur</b> here, in couture and bearing, Beyoncé delivers genuine warmth at close range." [...] Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph found [...] "air of an ancient goddess worship ceremony... of an expensive revue show" [...] in the concert. Although she felt that the choreographies often outshined the music, McNulty concluded: [...] "Yet Beyonce was never less than compelling to watch, and often blistering in her vocal attack".|$|E
500|$|Although Warner Brothers studio {{had assumed}} that the many costumed films that studios like MGM had earlier {{produced}} would never succeed {{during the years of}} the Great Depression, they nonetheless took a chance by producing Captain Blood in 1935. The film is a swashbuckler action drama based on the popular novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. It would star a then unknown extra, Errol Flynn, alongside the little-known de Havilland. According to film historian Tony Thomas, both actors had [...] "classic good looks, cultured speaking voices, and a sense of distant aristocracy about them". Filmed between August 5 and October 29, 1935, Captain Blood gave deHavilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic, a genre to which she was well suited, given her beauty and elegance. In the film, she played Arabella Bishop, the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner, who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude. The on-screen chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together, where clashes between her character's spirited <b>hauteur</b> and his character's playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other. Arabella is a feisty young woman who knows what she wants and is willing to fight for it. The bantering tone of their exchanges in the filmthe healthy give-and-take and mutual respectbecame the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films. Captain Blood was released on December 28, 1935, and received good reviews and wide public appeal. DeHavilland's performance was singled out in The New York Times and Variety. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple, led to seven additional collaborations.|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and <b>hauteur</b> that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Houston starred {{alongside}} Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon in {{her second}} film, Waiting to Exhale, a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer {{in love with}} a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as [...] "a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers". After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide, it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as How Stella Got Her Groove Back and the Tyler Perry movies that became popular in the 2000s. The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes. The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast. The New York Times said: [...] "Ms. Houston has shed the defensive <b>hauteur</b> that made her portrayal of a pop star in 'The Bodyguard' seem so distant." [...] Houston was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture", but lost to her co-star Bassett.|$|E

Roger Ebert said the ending was lackluster, [...] "while at the end, I didn't yearn for spectacular special effects, I did wish for spectacular information — something awesome, not just a fade-to-white". In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell said the movie was [...] "about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of The Blair Witch Project, and not nearly as funny". Entertainment Weekly rated the film [...] "D+", and Lisa Schwarzbaum said it had an [...] "aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and <b>hauteur</b> in a film not even a star as foxed, and foxy, as Johnny Depp, himself, could save". In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan said the film was [...] "too laid-back, and unconcerned about the pacing of its story to be satisfying", because [...] "a thriller that's not high-powered, is an intriguing concept, in reality it can hold our attention for only so long". In the Village Voice, J. Hoberman said the film was [...] "barely releasable hokum, stuffed with cheesy blah-blah". European reviews were generally more attentive and praised the film's fine pace and irony.|$|E
