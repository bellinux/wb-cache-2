40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the effect of essential oil (EO) from Cymbopogon citratus leaves against the spoilage flora of <b>fresh</b> <b>orange</b> juice. Thus, the EO was extracted by hydrodistillation from fresh leaves of Cymbopogon citratus collected in southern Benin and its chemical composition was determined by gas chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Orange samples were collected from large production areas of South and Central Benin and juices were extracted by mechanical pressing. After identification of spoilage flora of <b>fresh</b> <b>orange</b> juice, antimicrobial tests were carried out with the EO of Cymbopogon citratus to evaluate its antimicrobial activity on spoilage flora of <b>fresh</b> <b>orange</b> juice.   Results indicate that the spoilage flora of <b>fresh</b> <b>orange</b> juice is mainly composed of fungi belonging to the genera of Cladosporium, Penicillium and Fusarium. Bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were also identified in some samples. The major compounds identified in the EO by GC/MS are Neral (33. 0 %) and geranial (41. 3 %) with a predominance of oxygenated monoterpenes (85. 5 %). Antimicrobial tests have revealed a high antibacterial activity of the EO, with minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) between 0. 1 and 0. 15 μL. mL- 1. Antifungal tests revealed that fungi are also susceptible to this EO with minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) between 0. 15 and 0. 25 μL. mL- 1. Results obtained during {{the evaluation of the}} physicochemical characteristics of the orange juice stored by adding EO, indicated a significant decrease in the pH and vitamin C content. However, with EO concentration of 0. 250 μL. mL- 1, the pH of stored juice was 6. 4 ± 0. 1 after 15 days of preservation, with a best vitamin C content of 28. 06 ± 0. 03 mg / 100 mL.

Spain's large empire and many ports of call made it easier to acquire fresh fruit.The City Gazette and Daily Advertiser (Charleston, South Carolina), 19 July 1797, carried a report of the expedition:VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY: The following particulars of the last attempt of a voyage of discovery, which has made but little noise, and has not even been mentioned by an English journal, cannot fail to procure attention. A magnificent work is at this present moment in the Madrid press, containing a full and ample detail of all the transactions that occurred during this voyage of discovery; and, on its publication, we shall be gratified with an account of the manners and customs of the Babaco Babao/Vavau Isles, a non-descript cluster, then visited for the first time by Europeans. The two sloops called the Discovery and the Subtile, the former commanded by Don Alexander Malespina sic, and the latter by Don Joseph de Bastamente sic, sailed in company from the port of Cadiz, on the 30th of July, 1789, in order to co-operate with the other maritime powers in the extension of the human knowledge, and more particularly of navigation. The commanders of these vessels made correct charts of the coasts of America and the adjacent islands, from the river La Plata to Cape Horn, and from that cape to the farthermost northern extremeties sic of that part of the world. Their intentions in this was merely to repeat the attempts of the same kind, formerly undertaken either by foreigners or their own countrymen, and thus acquire a more minute knowledge of the subject. On their arrival at the north-west coast of America, in lat 59.60. and 61 degrees, they searched, in vain, for a passage by which they might penetrate into the Atlantic ocean; they accordingly concluded that the predictions of Cook were founded in sound reasoning, and that the gut mentioned by Maldonado, an old Spanish navigator, had no existence, except in his own brain. In {{the beginning of the year}} 1792, the Subtile, and a galliot, called the Mexicana, under the command of don Dion Galvano Galiano and don Cais de Taldes Valdes, joined the English squadron commanded by captain Vancouver, with an intention to examine the immense Archipelago, known by the name of the Admiral’s Fonte de Fonte, and Juan de Fuca. They continued the greater part of the year 1792 in visiting the Mariannes and Philippines, as also the Macas Macao, on the coast of Guiana China. They afterwards passed between the isles Mindanoa and the isles called Mountay Morintay, shaping course along the coasts of New-Guinea, and crossing the equator. On this occasion they discovered a gulph of about 500 maritime leagues in extent, which no former navigator had traversed. They then stopped at New-Zealand and New-Holland, and discovered in the Archipelago, called the Friendly Isles, the Babacos Babaos/Vavau, a range of islands which had never before been seen by any European mariner. After a variety of other researches in the southern ocean, they arrived in June 1793, at Callao. From this port they made other occasional expeditions; and each separately examined the port of Conception, and the rest of the coast of America, which extends to the south-west, as well as the western coast of Moluccas Malvinas/Malouines/Falklands. They then entered the river La Plata, after having surmounted all the dangers incident to those southern latitudes. Having been equipped and supplied anew with provisions at Montevedia Montevideo, they joined a fleet of frigates and register ships, and sailed for Cadiz, where they arrived after a passage of nine days weeks, with cargoes to the amount of eight millions of dollars in money and merchandize. These voyages have not a little contributed to the extension of botany, mineralogy and navigation. In both hemispheres, and in a variety of different latitudes, many experiments were made relative to the weight of bodies gravity, which will tend to very important discoveries, connected with the irregular form of our globe; these will also be highly useful, so far as respects a fixed and general measure system. While examining the inhabitants, our travellers collected all the monuments that could throw any light either on the migration of nations, or on their progress in civilization. Luckily for the interests of humanity, these discoveries have not caused a single tear to be shed. On the contrary, all the tribes with whom they had any connexion will bless the memory of these navigators who have furnished them with a variety of instruments, and made them acquainted with several arts, of which they were before entirely ignorant. The vessels brought back nearly the whole of their crews; neither of them, in short, lost more than three or four men; which is wonderful, if we but consider the unhealthy climates of the Torrid Zone, to which they were so long exposed. Don Antonio de Valdes, the minister of the marine, who encouraged and supported the expedition, is busied at this moment in drawing up a detailed account of this voyage, so as to render the enterprize of general utility. It will soon be published; and the curious will be gratified with charts, maps, and engravings, now preparing to accompany it. In the mean time he has presented to the king the captains, Don Alexander Malespina Malaspina, Don Joseph de Bastamente Bustamante and Don Dion Galeano Galiano, and lieutenant Don Carlos Ciriaco de Cevallos. These officers are entitled to, and will soon experience, the royal munificence.|$|E

Export supply was positively related to lagged net export realisation price relative to domestic orange price, the SA fresh orange price in the UK relative to the SA fresh orange price in France, lagged exports (export orientation), and supply shocks. The relative price elasticity of export demand was inelastic in both the short- and long-run, indicating that Capespan International and other future exporters may need to diversify fresh orange exports to alternative export markets to increase real revenue. Long-run export supply was inelastic with respect to relative price, implying that if SA fresh orange exports are included in a Free Trade Agreement with the EU, they are unlikely to have a marked adverse affect on EU fresh orange producers.
