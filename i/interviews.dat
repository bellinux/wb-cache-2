A Modified Cognitive <b>Interview</b> elicited more correct details and improved overall accuracy compared to a control <b>interview</b> in both age groups, although the young adults recollected three times more correct information in a Modified Cognitive <b>Interview</b> than the older adults.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the job <b>interview</b> for both the candidate and the employer in the hiring process has been established. The job <b>interview</b> may be given greater weight in decisions involving recent college graduates, who often have little experience. Research has focused on behaviors related to successful <b>interviewing,</b> both verbal and non-verbal, and on interventions aimed at improving <b>interview</b> performance. Yet no intervention {{has proven to be}} significantly more effective than others. ^ The purpose of this correlational {{study was to examine the}} relationship between confidence in <b>interviewing,</b> knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions, and job <b>interview</b> performance. Confidence and knowledge are factors assumed to influence job <b>interview</b> performance but no research has examined the validity of this assumption or whether a relationship exists between confidence and knowledge. ^ Results showed negative relationships between knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions and job <b>interview</b> performance, and between knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions and confidence in <b>interviewing.</b> A positive relationship existed between confidence in <b>interviewing</b> and job <b>interview</b> performance. This study has significance for anyone involved in a job search, professional interviewers, and those in education [...] teachers, trainers, administrators, and curriculum planners. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Interview</b> phase:The <b>interview</b> phase {{entails the}} actual {{conduct of the}} <b>interview,</b> the {{interaction}} between the interviewer and the applicant.

40|$|Performing well in an <b>interview</b> is {{of crucial}} {{importance}} {{to a job}} seeker. While much advice and training exists regarding <b>interview</b> performance, {{little is known about}} what parts of training successfully improve <b>interview</b> skills. This study proposes the following research question: does <b>interview</b> performance improve with practice alone or is some type of feedback required? Participants were split into four treatment groups that either 1) did not practice an <b>interview,</b> 2) practiced an <b>interview,</b> 3) practiced an <b>interview</b> and generated their own self-feedback or 4) practiced an <b>interview</b> and received feedback from a counselor. The study isolates the effects of practice and feedback to demonstrate that increasing levels of practice and feedback produce a pattern of increasing <b>interview</b> ratings. Post-interview anxiety demonstrates a significant negative correlation with <b>interview</b> ratings. Post-interview impression management is significantly related to <b>interview</b> ratings. The counselor treatment group demonstrates significantly lower communications anxiety than the control group. The {{results of this study suggest}} that feedback will help improve <b>interview</b> performance beyond that of practice alone and that anxiety and impression management continue to be candidate characteristics of interest whe...|$|R
