Its decline has also been linked to areas inhabited by the introduced bullfrog and related to loss and degradation of breeding habitat such as may result from dam construction, alteration of drainage patterns, dewatering due to urban and agricultural use of water, <b>excessive</b> livestock <b>grazing,</b> and other human activities that reduce or eliminate lentic shallow water.|$|R
50|$|Tourism, {{especially}} in the Segur/Masinagudi area, is claimed by some to {{pose a threat to}} the region, but this is strongly repudiated by persons who live and work in the area.

5000|$|Other {{threats to}} the grebe {{population}} are; <b>excessive</b> <b>grazing</b> by sheep (this leads to erosion at land shores and limits the growth of vegetation), attacks by Flying steamer ducks (Tachyeres patachonicus) [...] and predation by Kelp Gulls.

50|$|Having {{and using}} all these {{resources}} has some negatives.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis (Effect of grazing for forest damage and related aridization of {{northern}} Mongolia) is mainly focused to study and {{assess the impact of}} <b>excessive</b> forest <b>grazing</b> on the ability of natural regeneration with consequent negative impact on increase of aridization and desertification elswhere in northern Mongolia. The research was focused on sites Goricho, Barun Bayan and Dzun Bayan in the national park Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area and the area of the National park Khowsgol Nur Lake. The significant damage of larch forests was found and studied in all four study areas. The main role have livestock grazing, {{and to a lesser extent}} also a wildlife. Among the most affected young trees dominated tree species: Larix sibirica, Betulaspp. and Pinus sibirica. Studied forests of the Goricho display high mortality, and their natural regeneration is strongly reduced due <b>excessive</b> forest <b>grazing.</b> Locations Barun Bayan and Dzun Bayan are due to their remoteness damaged to a lesser extent than Goricho. Natural regeneration at the site Khowsgol Nur is subjected to heavy grazing pressure, especially from goats and sheep, regeneration is severely damaged. Larix sibirica was examined at this Khowsgol Nur site as damaged in lesser extent (damaged individuals outweighed healthy individuals). Due to the high damage raid on Goricho and Khowsgol Nur is the decreased ability of vegetation to restore forests naturally. All these areas are highly vulnerable to increasing aridization and desertification. The process of desertification, which is among the planned priority and dealt with development aid projects in Mongolia, is currently very topical in other arid parts of the world and this is the main reason why the present research is realized. Both aridization and desertification along Northern Mongolia is documented by significant signs of water and wind erosion and increase of annual temperature and context of lower water supply...|$|R

50|$|The Homestead Act 1862 {{opened up}} great expanses of virgin prairie {{in the west}} to early settlers. By 1905 about 41 million {{hectares}} of the west had been homesteaded (Olsen 1997). Much of this land was in semi-arid rangelands with sub-marginal precipitation to support crop production (Olsen 1997). The plowing of this land represented a permanent change {{in the nature of the}} land. Another contributor to habitat fragmentation for grouse is unmonitored and <b>excessive</b> cattle <b>grazing</b> (Kirsch et al. 1973; Giesen and Connelly 1993; Kirby and Grosz 1995; Reece et al. 2001; Sidle 2005). Cattle can be an important tool to manage habitat structure for sharp-tailed grouse when managed properly (Evens 1968; Kirby and Grosz 1995; Sidle 2005). The habitat of sharp-tailed grouse was severely affected by early settlers before cattle grazers understood the impact to the environment from overgrazing.|$|R

40|$|Snow leopards have {{a narrow}} diet {{spectrum}} {{and tend to}} prefer mountain ungulates, even where this prey is much less abundant than livestock. This feature makes the snow leopard particularly sensitive to human-induced local depletion of wild prey, as retaliatory killing by herders can exert a heavy toll on snow leopards' feeding on domestic ungulates. In this paper we report on survival of this cat in areas where its natural prey supply has been depleted by humans: the Sagarmatha National Park, Nepal, and the Spiti Valley, India, where snow leopards and their prey have been monitored for 8 and 15 years, respectively. Both case studies have pointed out the importance of wild ungulates as prey for snow leopards, {{as well as the}} reciprocal impacts of this predator and its wild prey on each other. Livestock does not seem to work well as an alternative food resource. The restoration of a community of wild prey species, for example, through reintroductions and/or freeing up areas from <b>excessive</b> livestock <b>grazing,</b> would be important management instruments to promote the local persistence of the snow leopard...|$|R
40|$|Along the prairie/forest {{transition}} zone oak savannas have been severely degraded by logging, clearing for agriculture, fire suppression, invasion of exotic plants, and <b>excessive</b> livestock <b>grazing.</b> Savanna shares equal billing with tallgrass prairie {{as the most}} threatened plant community in the Midwest. As such, there is increasing interest in restoring these communities. Conservation criteria have not been developed for the post oak (Querces stellata) and blackjack oak (Querces marilandica) savanna of the Cross Timbers. Oak savanna was arguably {{an important component of}} the historical Cross Timbers region. Following settlement, overgrazing in conjunction with a decrease in fire frequency and/or intensity has increased the density of oak stands to the point where they resemble closed-canopy forests rather than savanna. This is a threat to the biodiversity of the Cross Timbers. Proactive land management practices are recommended for restoring savanna communities. Such efforts may require thinning-out areas of degraded oak savanna to help re-establish the herbaceous understory. Fire is recommended to restore ecological processes that limit woody plant encroachment and promote biodiversity. Further research should investigate the ecological dynamics and functions of oak savannas, as well as provide further guidelines for its conservation...|$|R

5000|$|The {{butterfly}} {{was listed}} as an endangered species in 1992. Habitat loss due to residential and commercial land development has extirpated these butterflies from parts of their range and may threaten some of the remaining populations. Maintaining larval and nectar plants is critical for conservation of these butterflies. Changes in natural fire patterns, introduction of exotic plants, and successional changes in the plant community have reduced the availability of host plants. Either <b>excessive</b> or inadequate <b>grazing</b> activity can result in plant communities unfavorable to the butterflies. Measures for habitat improvement may include eradication of invasive exotics such as iceplant (Mesembryanthemum spp.) and identifying appropriate grazing and/or burning regimes in grassland and scrub areas. These butterflies are highly prized by insect collectors, and are vulnerable due to their small population. Silverspot butterfly larvae are also extremely sensitive to pesticides.|$|R
40|$|The history, {{ecology and}} {{management}} of Partry House Estate Woodlands situated {{on the shores of}} Lough Carra were examined by investigating their current ecology and structural development and contrasting this information with the historical evidence of their management. By combining the historical documentary evidence with the ecological data, the structural processes occurring in each of the woodlands were established leading to a greater understanding of the woodland development processes taking place. Also, valuable baseline data on species composition and diversity was gathered for the woodlands and vegetation maps were established. Partry House Estate {{has a long history of}} establishment that has not been researched in the past and this study rectifies this. Using a combination of historical documents and sources, a chronology of events, management and ownership was ascertained. As part of the study a deer exclusion experiment was set up in each of the woodlands to determine the effect of deer grazing on the vegetation layer and tree regeneration. The initial findings of the experiment indicate that <b>excessive</b> deer <b>grazing</b> is resulting in the loss of species diversity and regeneration. Their presence is influencing the natural successional processes in the woodlands which are negatively impacting upon the biodiversity value of Partry House Estate Woodlands. The combined results of the field survey data and the historical data were used to guide the decision whether to manage the woodlands or not. It has been suggested that active adaptive management would be the most suitable approach to managing the woodlands of Partry House Estate and management prescriptions are outlined in a ten year management plan for these woodlands...|$|R

5000|$|A common {{property}} {{system is}} a particular social arrangement regulating the preservation, maintenance, and consumption of a common-pool resource. The {{use of the term}} [...] "common property resource" [...] to designate a type of good has been criticized, because common-pool resources are not necessarily governed by common property protocols. Examples of common-pool resources include irrigation systems, fishing grounds, pastures, forests, water or the atmosphere. A pasture, for instance, allows for a certain amount of grazing to occur each year without the core resource being harmed. In the case of <b>excessive</b> <b>grazing,</b> however, the pasture may become more prone to erosion and eventually yield less benefit to its users. Because the core resources are vulnerable, common-pool resources are generally subject to problems of congestion, overuse, pollution, and potential destruction unless harvesting or use limits are devised and enforced.|$|E
50|$|As {{the warrior}} bush is {{currently}} abundant within its vegetation zone, we may consider current animal grazing patterns, {{agriculture and forestry}} practices which {{have the potential to}} pose future threats to the Apophyllum species. These may include widespread overstocking of sheep and cattle which graze on the warrior bush and cause major soil erosion. In semi-arid areas, goats further add to this <b>excessive</b> <b>grazing</b> pressure on herbage and shrubs. The diet of a bush goat is primarily influenced by what choice is available. Bush goats are herbivores and are commonly found in semi-arid areas of Australia and are recorded to find the warrior bush to be palatable. There appears to be a correlation between growth and breeding rates of feral goats in semi-arid vegetation zones where herbage and shrub such as the warrior bush are prevalent, this in turn affects the regeneration of the species as well as damaging their growth when trampled.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{investigate}} the different responses of vegetation to the major environmental disturbances and discontinuities in Kordofan region of the Sudan. Data used have been obtained from fieldwork survey, aerial photographs and a landsat image in combination with existing maps and statistics on vegetation, climate, agriculture and population. Results obtained have shown that most plant species are neither randomly distributed nor indications of the postulated regularity of distribution were detected. Such a distributional pattern was explained through the pattern of surface properties. These have included rainfall, soil characteristics, micro-topography and the type of vegetation itself. The different types of vegetation identified were shown to reflect various succession stages following either <b>excessive</b> cultivation, <b>grazing</b> or both. Climatically conditioned natural vegetation is virtually absent as the effect is almost entirely masked by man's activities. Evidence presented showed that various types of woodland were formerly more extensive and that they have been replaced by secondary shrubland, bushland and grassland. Most plant communities have been explained by their history of cultivation and grazing pressure. These two were found to interpret the process of successional changes, to radically alter its dynamics and to set plant species {{on a wide variety of}} paths which is largely controlled by the pressure exerted. Achieved result indicated that vegetation in the area has persisted to exist and to re-establish itself after virtual elimination. This is shown to reflect a high degree of resilience in the system. Evidence were shown that if the vegetation is protected and the climatic and edaphic conditions were favourable, it will eventually be succeeded by a richer type of vegetation. It has not been possible to prove neither to reject the claim often found in literature that the vegetation zones in this region are constantly shifting southward as a result of overgrazing, overcultivation and accelerated soil erosion. However, it has been possible to recognise a process of successional changes which varies from one place to another in terms of nature and intensity depending largely on site characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Sagebrush {{ecosystems}} exhibit widespread degrada-tion due to {{a variety}} of causes, including invasion by exotic plants, expansion of pinyon and juniper, altered fire regimes, <b>excessive</b> livestock <b>grazing,</b> urbanization and land development, conversion to agriculture, road development and use, mining, and energy development. These ecosystems have been identified as the most en-dangered in the United States with 20 percent of plant and animals associated with sagebrush ecosystems at risk of extirpation. Federal, state, and private land managers are increasingly concerned about the fate of sagebrush ecosystems and their associated species and are actively seeking approaches to restore and maintain them. Key Issues Invasive alien plants are expanding throughout the region affecting plant community composition and dis-turbance regimes—The most significant of these are fire-adapted annual grasses, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and medusahead (Taenatherum caput-medusa), that have resulted in an annual grass-fire cycle and are rapidly replacing sagebrush and salt desert ecosystems. It is estimated that cheatgrass dominated a minimum of 2 million ha (7, 720 mi 2) or 5 percent of the Great Basin in the 1990 s (Bradley and Mustard 2005) - an additional 15 million ha (57, 900 mi 2) have been estimated to be at high risk of cheatgrass invasion within the next 30 years (Suring and others 2005). The expansion of invasive an-nual grasses across the region has increased fine fuels and the rate of fire spread, particularly in more arid Wyoming and basin big sagebrush ecosystems (Link and others 2006). In many parts of the region, an annual grass-fire cycle now exists in which fire return intervals have de-creased from about 60 to 110 years to as little as 3 to 5 years (Whisenant 1990). More recently, noxious weedy forbs have spread across the Great Basin. Particularly problematic in Wyoming and mountain big sagebrush communities are squarrose knapweed (Centaurea squar-rosa), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), and rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea).

40|$|Deforestation in African dry forests is {{widespread}} and its drivers {{are complex and}} vary in space and time. In this paper, we assessed impacts of immigration on dry forests and options for improved management in a resettlement district in north-western Ethiopia. Key informants interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaire survey were used to collect data. The results indicated that forests of the district are degrading in spatial coverage and quality. The most important drivers were land use change, <b>excessive</b> wood harvest, <b>grazing</b> pressure and forest fire following immigration. The continuous influx of people with different origins, cultures, religions and lengths of residence in the district underscores absence of social bonds for collective action to regulate access. This, coupled with weak formal regulatory system, market forces and policy incentives for farming, resulted in a near open access situation. Our findings confirm the negative relationships between migration and environment not necessarily because of the mere population number added through immigration but {{because of lack of}} regulatory frameworks (formal or informal) and poor social capital. Enforcing existing policy of farm size and putting institutional framework on the ground to regulate rate of immigration, extraction of forest products and to encourage tree planting to meet wood demand are suggested measures. We conclude that Government programmes that opt for resettlement as a measure for poverty alleviation must also have mitigating measures to reducing negative impacts on the natural resource base. Thus, the trade-off between environment and development must be carefully managed...|$|R
