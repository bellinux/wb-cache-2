5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray {{prefers to}} pick prey {{from the surface}} of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. Caridean shrimp are by far the most important food source. It also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods, and rarely penaeid prawns, molluscs, and small bony fishes. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, {{the grey}} currawong is {{generally}} sedentary, {{although it is}} a winter visitor in the southeastern corner of Australia. Comparatively little studied, much of its behaviour and habits is poorly known. Omnivorous, it has a <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal than the pied currawong, the grey currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in much of its range. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas as well as scrubland in dryer parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) {{decided to}} draft {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Hinomaru and Kimigayo official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation {{to be completed by}} the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. This {{is not the first time}} legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play Kimigayo, Kakuei wanted students to raise the Hinomaru flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the <b>Diet</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw {{a major change}} in <b>diet</b> <b>that</b> {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage resulted in a shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E

5|$|With the new consensus, {{the major}} issues {{concerning}} Poland and Germany were settled in {{the second week of}} February 1815. Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal <b>Diet</b> <b>that</b> could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.|$|E
