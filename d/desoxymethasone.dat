40|$|In {{a double}} blind paired {{comparison}} study, the patients with steroid responsive dermatoses received <b>desoxymethasone</b> 0. 25 % on lesions {{on both sides}} of the body for first 4 days and <b>desoxymethasone</b> 0. 25 % on one side and 0. 05 % on the other side for the next 10 days. There was no significant difference in the percent reduction in severity scores of symptoms in global assessment or patient preference between the two treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} and acceptability of 0. 25 % and 0. 05 % desoxy-methasone, 0. 1 % betamethasone valerate and 1 % hydrocortisone creams were compared {{in patients with}} eczema. A double-blind parallel group multi-centre design was employed in which 96 patients were recruited by four centres. Patients used one cream for a 3 -week period and follow-up assessment visits were made at weekly intervals. Efficacy variables were: erythema/redness, scaling, itching and extent of area affected. These variables were assessed by both the investigator and the patient. The 0. 25 % <b>desoxymethasone</b> was the most effective treatment, producing the greatest degree of improve-ment in all clinical parameters, hydrocortisone was the least effective and 0. 05 % <b>desoxymethasone</b> was of intermediate effectiveness. The 0. 1 % betamethasone produced similar results to 0. 25 % desoxymetha-sone for half the assessments; for the other half the results were similar to 0. 05 % <b>desoxymethasone.</b> No adverse effects were reported during the study. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} physical properties of the vehicles and corticosteroid potency. Received for publication 2 March 1987...|$|E
