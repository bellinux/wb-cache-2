5|$|Abbe was {{involved}} in a car accident in 1960 which left him with severe neck <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> had lasting effects on his health. While the precise date is unclear, Abbe had been promoted to 8th dan by late 1960. Independent sources from the late 1960s include this rank with his name. In addition to his ranks in judo, aikido, and kendo, he held the rank of 5th dan in karate and dan ranks in kyūdō and jūkendō.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. <b>Injuries</b> <b>that</b> may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Findings on the {{frequency}} of each level of severity vary based on the definitions and methods used in studies. A World Health Organization study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> receive treatment are mild, and a US study found that moderate and severe injuries each account for 10% of TBIs, with the rest mild.|$|E

Although he was healthy, he decided to retire before he suffered any <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> would hurt him in his future life outside the ring. On his website, he posted {{a list of the}} ten wrestlers he wished to face before retiring. The list includes such wrestlers as Samoa Joe, Aaron Idol, Bryan Danielson, and Steve Corino.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 1819, Royton (like its neighbours) sent a {{contingent}} of its townsfolk to Manchester to join the mass political demonstration {{now known as the}} Peterloo massacre (owing to the 15 deaths and 400–700 <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> followed). Royton's contingent was of particular note, in that it sent a sizable female section to the demonstration.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} an injury-plagued one for Ginóbili, who {{suffered}} foot and ankle <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> hindered {{his ability to}} play.

During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 {{winning season}} would be {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith. After starting the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North, Urlacher suffered several <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> sidelined him {{for a majority of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> had {{previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After {{he suffered a}} hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench {{in the second half}} and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.|$|E

5|$|Against the Chicago Bulls in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade shook off a few <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> scared Heat fans, {{including}} a severely bruised hip in Game 5. Returning late in the half, Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain, leading the Heat to the much-needed 3–2 series lead. After this, Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals, despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons. He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game, including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter that put the game out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Alonso was ever-present in {{the first}} team in the 2005–06 season, largely {{avoiding}} <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> had marred his first season at the club. The summer transfer window brought Peter Crouch to Liverpool and the striker's height sparked accusations that the team would change to long ball tactics. Crouch denied this, highlighting that Alonso's passing ability, alongside Gerrard, would define Liverpool's style of play. Alonso faced more competition for {{his place in the}} form of new arrival Mohamed Sissoko. However, Steven Gerrard's injuries and Rafael Benítez's favouring of a 4–5–1 formation ensured Alonso's place in the team. Alonso appeared in all of Liverpool's games in the Champions League but the dominance shown in the previous season had gone as the team lost to Benfica in the knockout stage.|$|E
5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was born}} in Connecticut and was a {{merchant}} operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces time to prepare New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which {{he was promoted to}} major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> halted his combat career for several years.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

5|$|Chicago's {{top four}} {{receivers}} (Alshon Jeffery, Kevin White, Eddie Royal and Marquess Wilson) missed a combined 35 of 64 games. Jeffery, who never played four consecutive games in 2015, recorded 54 receptions for 807 {{yards and four}} touchdowns, while Zach Miller led the team in receiving touchdowns with five. Without the four, the Bears relied on Marc Mariani, Joshua Bellamy, Cameron Meredith and Deonte Thompson. Mariani recorded 22 receptions for 300 yards, while excelling on third down, recording eleven catches that resulted in first downs. Tight ends Martellus Bennett and Zach Miller also suffered <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> led to them missing games; the former scored three times in eleven games, while the latter led the Bears in touchdowns with five.|$|E
5|$|For the 1996 championship, Canavan {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} of Tyrone, and was Ulster's leading scorer {{for the third}} year in a row, and subsequently awarded his third successive All Star. Tyrone reached the All-Ireland semi-final against Meath, but Canavan was one of six Tyrone players to sustain <b>injuries</b> <b>that</b> day, which some Tyrone fans attribute to Meath's heavy-handedness. Canavan's injury was so severe that he was still feeling the effects for over a year, and there was speculation as to whether he had been playing on a broken foot.|$|E
