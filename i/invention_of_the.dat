5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weeding rake. The <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese weed rake is derived from the <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. Harrows were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The harrows seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E

5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} the <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward {{of a ship}} named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in {{the port city of}} Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E

5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine.

5|$|Hip-hop {{dance is}} not a studio-derived style. Street dancers {{developed}} it in urban neighborhoods without a formal process.

5|$|However, known {{cases of}} the {{diffusion}} of writing, such as Sequoyah's <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cherokee syllabary after seeing the power of English-language newspapers, or Uyaquk's <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yugtun script inspired by readings from Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, {{as might be expected}} for Rapa Nui representatives writing with the novel instrument of pen on paper. The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the tangata rongorongo (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.|$|E
