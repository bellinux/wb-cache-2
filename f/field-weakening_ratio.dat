40|$|The {{commonly}} known technology of field weakening for permanent-magnet (PM) motors {{is achieved by}} controlling the direct-axis current component through an inverter, without using mechanical variation of the air gap, a new machine approach for field weakening of PM machines by direct control of air-gap fluxes is introduced. The demagnetization situation due to field weakening {{is not an issue}} with this new method. In fact, the PMs are strengthened at field weakening. The <b>field-weakening</b> <b>ratio</b> can reach 1 O: 1 or higher. This technology is particularly useful for the PM generators and electric vehicle drives...|$|E
