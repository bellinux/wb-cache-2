5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of the}} crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> over 21 years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the master}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> over a decade, Caravaggio's style was still highly {{influential}} and converted many painters to following his style (the so-called Caravaggisti), such as Artemisia's father Orazio, Carlo Saraceni (who returned to Venice 1620), Bartolomeo Manfredi, and Simon Vouet. Painting styles in Rome {{during the early}} seventeenth century were diverse, however, demonstrating a more classic manner of the Bolognese disciples of the Carracci and the baroque style of Pietro da Cortona.|$|E

25|$|In his {{capacity}} as Vice President of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, later renamed Exit, Koestler wrote a pamphlet on suicide, outlining the case both for and against, with a section dealing specifically with {{how best to}} do it. He and Cynthia killed themselves {{on the evening of}} 1 March 1983 with overdoses of the barbiturate Tuinal taken with alcohol. Their bodies were discovered on the morning of 3 March, by which time they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for thirty-six hours.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 1950, {{the body}} of 41-year-old Robert Robertson was found at a {{business}} at 2138 Davenport Avenue in Cleveland. Police believed he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> {{six to eight weeks}} and appeared to have been intentionally decapitated. His death appeared to fit the profile of other victims: He was estranged from his family, had an arrest record and a drinking problem, and was on the fringes of society. Despite widespread newspaper coverage linking the murder to the crimes in the 1930s, detectives investigating Robertson's death treated it as an isolated crime.|$|E
25|$|At 12:10a.m. on June 13, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman {{were found}} murdered outside of Nicole's Bundy Drive {{condominium}} in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Brown had been stabbed multiple {{times in the}} head and neck, and had defensive wounds on her hands. The larynx could be seen through the gaping wound in her neck, and vertebra C3 was incised; her head remained barely attached to the body. Both victims <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for about two hours prior to being discovered by police. Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.|$|E

25|$|The Pope had {{appointed}} Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was {{a nephew}} of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated {{himself as a}} dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for forty years. The Fabbrica or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary {{as to how the}} building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|By 1860 Charlotte <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> {{for five}} years, {{and the only}} people living at the parsonage were Mr. Brontë, his son-in-law, Arthur Bell Nicholls, and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell's {{biography}} of Charlotte was published and though Mr. Brontë at its first reading approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, who hated Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte's writing {{and she had to}} struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters – although this never actually happened.|$|E
25|$|On December 24, 2008 {{at about}} 3:30p.m. (JST), Iijima {{was found dead}} in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment, not far from Shibuya Crossing.

On March 3, 2007, Sports Nippon had {{reported}} that Ai Iijima was suffering from hay fever, pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), cystitis, and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. In February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia, {{and that there was no}} suggestion of either suicide or murder.|$|E

25|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} {{politically}} and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal. In 65 BC, newly elected curule aedile Julius Caesar held games that he justified as munus to his father, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used three hundred and twenty gladiator pairs in silvered armour. He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as {{the maximum number of}} gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome. Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense; he had staged a munus as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between munus and ludi.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one year}} later, on July 5, 1968, the {{partially}} decomposed, mutilated {{body of a}} 20-year-old art student named Joan Elspeth Schell was found by construction workers on an Ann Arbor roadside. She had been raped, then stabbed 25 times with a knife estimated to have measured four inches in length. Several of these wounds had punctured her lungs, liver and carotid artery, with one additional wound inflicted behind her left ear fracturing her skull. In addition, her throat had been slashed, and her miniskirt then tied around her neck. Although Schell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for several days, her entire lower body was in a remarkably preserved condition, whereas her head, shoulders and breasts were in an advanced state of decomposition, leading the pathologist to conclude her body had been stored in a naturally cool environment, but with the upper third of her body exposed to natural heat.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On {{them had been}} carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for several years, {{as well as a}} many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the {{architrave}} was a repoussé medallion of Christ. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.|$|E
