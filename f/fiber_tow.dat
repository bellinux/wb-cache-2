40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringThis {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a combined experimental and numerical investigation of the thermal and mechanical response of a plain woven textile composite material. In order to experimentally investigate the thermo-mechanical behavior of the textile composite, panels are first made using the vacuum assisted resign transfer molding (VARTM) process. Then, specimens are cut from the panels according to the ASTM standard. Tensile tests are performed on the specimens at various temperatures with the directions of <b>fiber</b> <b>tows</b> aligned at 0 and 45 degrees {{with respect to the}} loading direction, respectively. Digital image correlation (DIC) technique is employed to obtain real-time full-field strain and deformation data. From the stress-strain data obtained at room temperature, basic mechanical properties of the textile composite such as stiffnesses and strengths are identified. Different failure modes are observed when the <b>fiber</b> <b>tows</b> are aligned with the loading direction and they are oriented at 45 degrees. It is imparted, from the tests results with different ranges of temperature, that the thermo-mechanical behavior of the composite is greatly influenced by the thermal degradation of the matrix material. Numerical analysis is also performed using a finite element-based representative volume element (RVE) model to have an in-depth understanding of the thermo-mechanical behavior of the composite material. Optical images are taken at various sections and geometrical data of in situ fabric architecture in the composite are extensively measured to create the RVE model. Matrix properties are also measured per ASTM standard at various temperatures and it is found that the matrix exhibits strong nonlinear stress-strain response and its mechanical properties are degraded as the temperature increases. Special homogenization technique for <b>fiber</b> <b>tows</b> are employed in order to account for directionally-dependent non-linearities of the tows. In the RVE model, <b>fiber</b> <b>tows</b> are considered as a nonlinear transversely isotropic continuum. Mechanical behavior of the <b>fiber</b> <b>tows</b> in the direction transverse to the fibers is greatly influenced by the matrix material but the property in the fiber direction is mostly determined by the strong fibers. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the RVE model to apply tensile and shear loading to the textile composite model. Using thermally degraded matrix properties, thermo-mechanical response of the plain woven textile composite material are obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) and the results agree very well with the experimental data. Different stresses and strain distributions on the <b>fiber</b> <b>tows</b> and matrix under tensile and shear loading cases are also be obtained and regions where stresses are significantly accumulated or mechanical performances are weakened are identified. ope...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{explores the}} effect of fiber {{diameter}} and fiber bundle count on tow impregnation during liquid molding processes. Resin and fiber wetting properties {{play an important role}} on the resin infiltration behavior within a single <b>fiber</b> <b>tow.</b> Dynamic and equilibrium microflow models, based on Darcyâ€™s Law and force equilibrium at the resin flow front, assume that the infiltration of the resin is driven through capillary pressure and hindered by the entrapped gas within the tow. The results of the dynamic model show that the <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> count and the fiber diameter {{have a significant effect on}} the tow infiltration time. The infiltration time is 10 times longer for a 60 K carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> than for a 6 K one. The infiltration time is also inversely proportional to the fiber diameter. As the fiber diameter is decreased 100 times, from 3. 5 mm to 35 nm, the infiltration time increases 100 times for the same diameter tow. It also shows that fiber volume fraction also has a significant effect on the tow infiltration time and any fiber volume variations along the <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> could lead to dry spots in the composite due to the large differences in infiltration rates. The model indicates that the entrapment of a critical amount of air within a tow wil...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{investigate}} the strength and effectiveness when induced with 'in plane <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> waviness' in a composite ply of carbon/epoxy AS 4 / 3501 - 6. Fiber waviness is usually induced by infusion processes and inherent in fabric architectures. Composite structural details like ply drops and ply joints can cause serious fiber misalignment. These are usually dependent on parameters such as ply thickness, percentage of plies dropped, and mold geometry and pressure, and pressure of the resin which slides the dry fibers during the resin transfer molding process. Fiber disorientation due to <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> waviness in 'in-plane' direction has been the subject of recent studies on wind turbine blade materials and other aerospace laminates with reports of compression strengths and failure strains that are borderline, depending upon the reinforcement architecture, matrix resin and environment. Waviness is expected to reduce compressive strength due to two primary factors. The fibers may be oriented in such a way that the geometry that results because of the orientation may exacerbate the basic fiber, strand, or layer buckling mode of failure. The waviness could also shift the fiber orientation of the axis of the ply longitudinal direction which eventually results in matrix dominated failures for plies normally orientated in the primary load direction (0). Both global and local stress & strain values generated by the finite element model were validated by the traditional mechanical methods using ply/local stiffness matrix and global/reduced stiffness matrix. A precise geometry of waviness on different materials was modeled with different wave severity factor and a parametric study was conducted. Three different defects were modeled where the angle of misalignment ranged from 5 to 15 degrees with wavelength ranging from 1 inch to 1. 5 inches and amplitude ranging from 0. 03 inches to 0. 7 inches.

40|$|Advani, Suresh G. In Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) processes, a fibrous {{reinforcement}} preform {{is placed}} or draped over a mold surface, the mold is closed and a resin is either injected under pressure or infused under vacuum {{to cover all}} the spaces in between the fibers of the preform to create a composite part. LCM is used in a variety of manufacturing applications, from the aerospace to the medical industries. In this manufacturing process, the properties of the fibrous reinforcement inside the closed mold is of great concern. Preform structure, volume fraction, and permeability all influence the processing characteristics and final part integrity. When preform fabrics are draped over a mold surface, the geometry and characteristics of both the bulk fabric and <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> bundles change as the fabric shears to conform to the mold curvature. Numerical simulations can predict resin flow in dual scale fabrics in which one can separately track the filling of the fiber tows in addition to flow of resin within the bulk fabric. The effect of the deformation of the bulk fabric due to draping over the tool surface has been previously addressed by accounting for the change in fiber volume fraction and permeability during the filling of a mold. In this work, we investigate the effect of shearing of the fiber tows in addition to bulk deformation during the dual scale filling. We model the influence of change in <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> characteristics due to draping and deformation on mold filling and compare it with the results when the <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> deformation effect is ignored. Model experiments are designed and conducted with a dual scale fabric to characterize the change in permeability of <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> with deformation angle. Simulations which account for dual scale shear demonstrate that the tow saturation rate is affected, requiring longer fill times, or higher pressures to completely saturate fiber tows in areas of a mold with high local shear. This should prove useful in design of components for applications in which it is imperative to ensure that there are no unfilled fiber tows in the final fabricated component.

40|$|An {{alternative}} powder prepregging {{technique is}} discussed {{that is based}} on the deposition of powder onto carbon fibers that have been moistened using an ultrasonic humidifier. The dry <b>fiber</b> <b>tow</b> is initially spread to allow a greater amount of the fiber surface to be exposed to the powder, thus ensuring a significant amount of intimate contact between the fiber and the matrix. Moisture in the form of ultrafine water droplets is then deposited onto the spread <b>fiber</b> <b>tow.</b> The moisture promotes adhesion to the fiber until the powder can be tacked to the fibers by melting. Powdered resin is then sieved onto the fibers and then tacked onto the fibers by quick heating in a convective oven.

40|$|Performance {{prediction}} of off-axis laminates is of significant interest in designing composite structures for energy absorption. Phenomenological models available {{in most of}} the commercial programs, where the fiber and resin properties are smeared, are very efficient for large scale structural analysis, but lack the ability to model the complex nonlinear behavior of the resin and fail to capture the complex load transfer mechanisms between the fiber and the resin matrix.
