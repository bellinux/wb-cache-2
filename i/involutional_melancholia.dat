2500|$|An {{elaborate}} {{classification of}} mental disorders {{was developed in the}} 10th century by Arabian psychologist Najab ud-din Unhammad. His nosology included nine major categories {{of mental disorders}}, with 30 different mental illnesses in total. Some of the categories he described resembled obsessive-compulsive disorders, delusional disorders, degenerative diseases, <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia,</b> and states of abnormal excitement. Avicenna (980−1037 CE) in the Canon of Medicine listed a number of mental disorders, including [...] "passive male homosexuality".|$|E

50|$|Emil Kraepelin (1907) was {{the first}} to {{describe}} <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> as a distinct clinical entity separate from the manic-depressive psychosis, arguing that 'the processes of involution in the body are suited to engender mournful or anxious moodiness'. Right up until 'the seventh edition of his textbook Kraepelin considered <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> as a separate disease', of acquired origin, but (partly in response to Dreyfus) 'he decided to include it in the eighth edition under the general heading of manic depressive insanity'.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> or involutional {{depression}} {{is a traditional}} name for a psychiatric disorder affecting mainly elderly or late middle-aged people, usually accompanied with paranoia. It is classically defined as [...] "depression of gradual onset occurring during the involutional years (40-55 in women and 50-65 in men), with symptoms of marked anxiety, agitation, restlessness, somatic concerns, hypochondriasis, occasional somatic or nihilistic delusions, insomnia, anorexia, and weight loss." [...] <b>Involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> is not recognized as a psychiatric disorder by the DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool.|$|E

50|$|Dreyfus (1907) had {{challenged}} Kraepelin's {{concept of}} an acquired origin, maintaining it to be endogenous in origin - although 'a recent statistical study of Dreyfus's old series has also shown that his conclusion that {{the natural history of}} <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> was no different from that of depression affecting younger subjects was wrong'. Kirby (1909) described it as a distinctive syndrome, as did Hoch and MacCurdy in 1922. Titley (1936) described the premorbid personality and narrow range of interests, etc., Kallman (1959) found incidence of schizophrenia in the families of such patients.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the ABO, A 1, D, E, C, and Kell blood types in relation to selected psychiatric diagnoses was studied in over 700 consecutive admissions to a provincial mental hospital.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{importance}} Emil Kraepelin put on disease course as a classificatory principle. It then outlines the academic reception of Kraepelin's disease entities outside Germany, charts the uptake of his diagnostic concepts within clinical practice in Britain, and compares data on admissions for bipolar disorders, <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> and postpartum psychoses to the North Wales asylum {{during the period}} Kraepelin was working to data on contemporary admissions {{in an effort to}} shed further light on the validity of his diagnostic concepts...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of three controlled studies comparing mianserin and clomipramine shows {{that none of}} them has elicited statistically {{significant differences between the two}} drugs, although populations were different: primary depression almost equally divided in endogenous and exogenous cases (de Buck), primary depression mostly neurotic (Pinder), <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia</b> (Blaha). The only difference found as to efficacy was earlier onset of action for mianserin in the group of the endogenous depressions (de Buck). Mianserin causes significantly less side effects, above all as to hypotension, dry mouth, tremor and blurred vision. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Forty-four {{selected}} {{patients with}} “hard core” functional psychiatric illness were treated by bimedial prefrontal leukotomy, {{in which only}} the medial half of the prefrontal white matter of both frontal lobes was divided. This operation differs from the conventional or “standard” leukotomy which divides the entire prefrontal white matter. There were six patients with personality disorders, 25 psychoneurotics, 12 schizophrenics, and one with <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia.</b> Forty-two of the 44 patients had thorough psychiatric follow-up, ranging from one to seven years postoperatively. They were assessed clinically and also on a point-rating scale of assessment...|$|E
40|$|Electric shock {{treatment}} {{of mental disorders}} has considerably increased its field of application. This treatment is, however, not without dangers and complications, although the fatalities are extremely rare. " ' Among the complications, memory disorders often associated with profound electroencephalographic changes have particularly attracted attention of physicians, physiologists, and psychologists. These changes are usually only temporary. They suggest, however, {{the possibility of a}} structural damage to the brain, as actually described by some authors. 1 ' 2 8, 5, 11 In the classical technic the city current is used (A. C.; 60 per second; 100 - 150 volts; short time of application, 0. 1 - 0. 4 second). The electrodes are applied to both temples. Recently an attempt to change this technic has been made. 4 ' 1 The Friedman-Wilcox-Reiter (FWR) procedure uses pulses of unidirectional current by eliminating the alternative oscillation of the city current. The frequency remains the same (60 per second). The time of application is considerably longer (1 to 4 seconds), and the voltage is lower than in the classical technic. The electrodes are applied unilaterally on the left temporal region and on the vertex. The total electrical energy is decreased. Although the therapeutic results (at least in <b>involutional</b> <b>melancholia,</b> according to our controls) are approximately the same, the memory disorders following a complete treatment are considerably less marked with the FWR technic. Moreover, the EEG changes after a series of treatments are less pronounced with this method than with the classical one (Cf. Proctor and Goodwin" 2). Thiey are perfectly symmetrical despite the unilateral application of the current. This suggests a physiological mechanism in the production of the EEG a;bnormality following this method of electric treatment. Unfortunately, patients treated with the FWR technic develop, i...|$|E
