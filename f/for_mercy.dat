In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> as he was detained by authorities.|$|E

Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder, on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor, Therefore, no trial was needed before his execution. Despite begging <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> and claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven. His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch.|$|E

5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words from {{personal}} experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path {{was formed by}} a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God <b>for</b> <b>mercy,</b> a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E

5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E
5|$|While {{stopped on}} the Biggerstaff land, the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were testified against by Patriots who had {{previously}} fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought {{an end to the}} proceedings. His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> from one of the Biggerstaff women, although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff, Aaron's wife, or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff, Benjamin's wife. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands. The column finally made camp at Salem, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's {{influence}} declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence. In 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal {{in less than three}} hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliation which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British. Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> and granting him the keys {{of the city and the}} royal treasury. A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.|$|E
