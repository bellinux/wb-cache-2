40|$|A {{fishery is}} {{simulated}} in which 20 artificial vessels {{learn to make}} decisions through an artificial neural network in order to search for schools of fish among the available fishing grounds. Three scenarios with different degrees of variability including uncertainty in the searching process, are considered. The simulation model accounts for the main features commonly observed in a purse seine tuna fishery in a time and a space scale. Vessel strategies are chosen by the artificial neural network, {{on the basis of}} the following decision criteria: information concerning time searching in a specific area, previous performance in this area, knowledge of the quality of surrounding fishing grounds, presence of other vessels <b>fishing</b> <b>actively</b> and trip length. An analysis of the effects of sharing information between vessels is done and this was compared to individual artificial fishing vessels. In general, a group of fishing vessels show higher performance than individual vessels. A convex performance comparison curve for several group sizes is found in all scenarios considered. The optimum group size differs according to the variability of the artificial world. At bigger group sizes performance decreases, probably due to competition and depletion effects of some fishing grounds. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

50|$|A fish {{wheel is}} a device for {{catching}} fish which operates {{much as a}} water-powered mill wheel. A wheel complete with baskets and paddles is situated on the river, usually upon a floating dock.

50|$|In {{addition}} to adapting locomotor behavior, controlling buoyancy effects {{is critical for}} aquatic survival since aquatic ecosystems vary greatly by depth.

[...] The gulf darter has a low tolerance for brackish water.|$|R
50|$|Remoras, {{like many}} other fishes, have two {{different}} modes of ventilation. Ram ventilation is the process in which at higher speeds, the remora uses {{the force of the}} water moving past it to create movement of fluid in the gills. Alternatively, at lower speeds the remora will use a form of active ventilation, in which the <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> moves fluid through its gills. In order to use active ventilation, a <b>fish</b> must <b>actively</b> use energy to move the fluid; however, determining this energy cost is normally complicated due to the movement of the fish when using either method. As a result, the remora has proved invaluable in finding this cost difference, (since they will stick to a shark or tube, and hence remain stationary despite the movement or lack thereof of water.) Experimental data from studies on remora found that the associated cost for active ventilation created a 3.7-5.1% increased energy consumption {{in order to maintain the}} same quantity of fluid flow the fish obtained by using ram ventilation.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the factors}} {{contributing}} to seasonal changes and heterogeneous distribution of zooplankton biomass should be a trophic pressure imposed by myctophids. These <b>fishes</b> <b>actively</b> ingest zooplankton, in particular at night when myctophids migrate to upper layers from the deep. Fish trawls and echo-soundings carried out during five seasonal cruises have implied dense layers of myctophids, 20 – 40  m thick, at about a 200 – 450  m depth, extending offshore from the shelf {{during the day and}} ascending to the upper layer at night, along the shelf edge. The myctophid biomass varied gradually over seasons and was composed mainly of Benthosema pterotum. For instance in the Ras al Hadd region, total myctophid catches accounted for 155 t km− 2 during the Spring Inter-monsoon, with a subsequent increase of up to 1.2  M t km− 2 {{by the end of the}} South-west Monsoon (Devine and Macaulay 2009). Interestingly, these huge changes did not induce an immediate reduction of zooplankton biomass in summer, although the mean value was minimal during the subsequent Fall Inter-monsoon season (Table  2).|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{movement}} patterns, habitat use {{and behaviour}} of fish {{is critical to}} determining how targeted species may respond to protection provided by "no-take" sanctuary zones within marine parks. We assessed the fine and broad scale movement patterns of an exploited herbivore, luderick (Girella tricuspidata), using acoustic telemetry to evaluate how this species may respond to protection within Jervis Bay (New South Wales, Australia). We surgically implanted fourteen fish with acoustic transmitters and actively and passively tracked individuals to determine fine and broad scale movement patterns respectively. Eight <b>fish</b> were <b>actively</b> tracked for 24 h d¯(1) for 6 d (May 2011), and then intermittently over the following 30 d. Six fish were passively tracked from December 2011 to March 2012, using a fixed array of receivers deployed across rocky reefs {{around the perimeter of}} the bay. Luderick exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs, tending to remain on or return consistently to the reef where they were caught and released. All eight <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> tracked used core areas solely on their release reef, with the exception of one fish that used multiple core areas, and four of the six fish passively tracked spent between 75 to 96 % of days on release reefs over the entire tracking period. Luderick did move frequently to adjacent reefs, and occasionally to more distant reefs, however consistently returned to their release reef. Luderick also exhibited predictable patterns in movement between spatially distinct daytime and night-time core use areas. Night-time core use areas were generally located in sheltered areas behind the edge of reefs. Overall, our data indicate luderick exhibit strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs in Jervis Bay and suggests that this important herbivore may be likely to show a positive response to protection within the marine park...|$|R
2500|$|The {{nature of}} prey {{selection}} by two centrarchids (white crappie and bluegill) {{has been presented}} as a model incorporating optimal foraging strategies by Manatunge & Asaeda [...] The visual field of the foraging fish as represented by the reactive distance was [...] analysed in detail to estimate the number of prey encounters per search bout. The predicted reactive distances were compared with experimental data. The energetic cost associated with fish foraging behaviour was calculated based on {{the sequence of events}} that takes place for each prey consumed. Comparisons of the relative abundance of prey species and size categories in the stomach to the lake environment indicated that both white crappie and bluegill (length < 100nbsp&mm) strongly select prey utilizing an energy optimization strategy. In most cases, the fish exclusively selected large Daphnia ignoring evasive prey types (Cyclops, Diaptomids) and small cladocera. This selectivity is the result of <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> avoiding prey with high evasion capabilities even though they appear to be high in energetic content and having translated this into optimal selectivity through capture success rates. The energy consideration and visual system, apart from the forager's ability to capture prey, are the major determinants of prey selectivity for large-sized bluegill and white crappie still at planktivorous stages.|$|R
40|$|A {{dearth of}} basic {{biological}} information for wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri, currently hinders {{the ability of}} scientists and managers to assess population sustainability and appropriately manage the dramatically increasing global catch. This study examined the gonads of 382 wahoo collected off eastern Australia during 2008 - 2011 to quantify their reproductive biology in the region. The overall sex ratio {{of the sample was}} 3. 2 : 1 (females:males), however this differed significantly among fishing sectors and areas. The estimated fork length at which 50 % of female wahoo reach maturity was 1, 046 mm. Similar to the Atlantic Ocean, female wahoo have a protracted summer spawning season during October-February. The mean spawning frequency of female wahoo was uncertain but may be approximately 2 - 3 days, with evidence of <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> spawning on consecutive days. Batch fecundity of females was positively correlated with fish size and estimates ranged between 0. 65 and 5. 12 million oocytes. Relative fecundity was estimated at 122. 0 (+/- 9. 7) oocytes per gram of ovary free body weight and did not differ with fish size or throughout the spawning season. Estimation of reproductive parameters such as size- and age-at-maturity may facilitate the construction of per-recruit stock assessments of wahoo in the region...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that fishes in short-hydroperiod wetlands display pulses in activity tied to seasonal flooding and drying, with relatively low activity during intervening periods. To evaluate this hypothesis, sampling devices that funnel fish into traps (drift fences) {{were used to}} investigate fish movement across the Everglades, U. S. A. Samples were collected at six sites in the Rocky Glades, a seasonally flooded karstic habitat located on the southeastern edge of the Everglades. Four species that display distinct recovery patterns following drought in long-hydroperiod wetlands were studied: eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and flagfish (Jordanella floridae) (rapid recovery); and bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei) and least killifish (Heterandria formosa) (slow recovery). Consistent with our hypothesized conceptual model, fishes increased movement soon after flooding (immigration period) and just before drying (emigration period), but decreased activity in the intervening foraging period. We also found that eastern mosquitofish and flagfish arrived earlier and showed stronger responses to hydrological variation than either least killifish or bluefin killifish. We concluded that these <b>fishes</b> <b>actively</b> colonize and escape ephemeral wetlands in response to flooding and drying, and display species-specific differences related to flooding and drying that reflect differences in dispersal ability.

40|$|The {{importance}} of drifting objects to small juvenile pelagic fish was investigated {{off the coast}} of New South Wales, Australia. Distance-related and temporal patterns in the distribution of clumps of drifting algae were investigated with 5000 m 2 transects at five distances from shore (0. 1, 0. 5, 1, 5 and 10 km), two to three times per season for 2 years. Juvenile fish associated with drift algae were collected. Clumps of algae, predominantly Sargassum spp., were most abundant in spring, which coincided with the highest abundance of alga-associated post-flexion juvenile fish. Drift algae were also most abundant close to shore, probably due to the proximity to source and the dominant onshore winds. Fish were quickly attracted to drifting artificial objects (fish aggregation device; FADs), although the magnitude of attraction varied greatly among days. The relative abundance of small fish in open waters available to colonise FADs and differing weather conditions may explain much of this variability. More fish colonised FADs with an odour source than unscented control FADs, indicating small fish may use chemical cues to locate drifting structures. We conclude that juvenile <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> seek drifting objects as pre-settlement habitat, which may reduce predation and enhance settlement opportunities...|$|R
50|$|Southern {{black bream}} are {{opportunistic}} omnivores, consuming {{a wide range}} of prey, including sessile, burrowing, benthic and pelagic species. The diet of the species varies between rivers, with their opportunistic feeding methods showing little pattern between seasons, although they appear to have certain prey preferences when two or more possible prey species are present. Crustaceans, including crabs, prawns, amphipods and copepods, are commonly taken, as are a number of polychaete and annelid worms. Bivalves such as mussels and cockles are crushed in the bream's powerful jaws, with small fish such as gobies and anchovies also taken. Algae of the genus Enteromorpha are also a major component of most fish's diets. Fish feeding in the upper reaches of river have different prey, reflecting the freshwater fauna, with insects, hardyheads, tadpoles, brine shrimp and gastropods taken. Studies from the Swan River suggest that there is a shift in diet with age. Younger fish consume amphipods, polychaetes and small individuals of various molluscs. The number of amphipods consumed decreased in the diets of older fish while the number of large molluscs, crabs and teleosts taken increased. The <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> forage the substrate while swimming with their head down, snapping their prey down with little chewing.|$|R

40|$|Post-release {{survival}} of line-caught pearl perch (Glaucosoma scapulare) was assessed via field experiments where fish were angled using methods {{similar to those}} used by commercial, recreational and charter fishers. One hundred and eighty-three individuals were caught during four experiments, of which > 91 % survived up to three days post-capture. Hook location was found to be the best predictor of survival, with the {{survival of}} throat- or stomach-hooked pearl perch significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than those hooked in either the mouth or lip. Post-release survival was similar for both legal (≥ 35 cm) and sub-legal (< 35 cm) pearl perch, while those individuals showing no signs of barotrauma were more likely to survive in the short term. Examination of the swim bladders in the laboratory, combined with observations in the field, revealed that swim bladders rupture during ascent from depth allowing swim bladder gases to escape into the gut cavity. As angled fish approach the surface, the alimentary tract ruptures near the anus allowing swim bladder gases to escape the gut cavity. As a result, very few pearl perch exhibit barotrauma symptoms and no barotrauma mitigation strategies were recommended. The results of this study show that pearl perch are relatively resilient to catch-and-release suggesting that post-release mortality would not contribute significantly to total fishing mortality. We recommend the use of circle hooks, <b>fished</b> <b>actively</b> on tight lines, combined with minimal handling in order to maximise the post-release survival of pearl perch...|$|R
40|$|During summer 2000, fish {{distribution}} {{patterns were}} examined in three oxbow lakes with beaver dams across outlet streams, {{as well as in}} the adjacent river in interior Alaska. Sampling was conducted with 5 cm and 11 cm stretched mesh gillnets on three occasions; mid-June, late July, and mid-September. All fish captured were measured, weighed, and sexed. Feeding condition was noted for all fish and stomach contents of feeding fish were identified when possible. Otoliths were collected for age estimation. Electronic stream gauges recorded the time and duration of high flow events that allowed fish passage over beaver dams. A total of six fish species were captured during the project. Northern pike, humpback whitefish, least cisco, and broad whitefish made up more than 98 % of the catch. A single inconnu, a single Arctic grayling, and two individuals of a hybrid whitefish form were also captured. Two additional species, longnose sucker and Arctic lamprey, were identified in northern pike stomachs. Adults of the four primary species were captured in lentic (lake) and lotic (flowing water) habitats. Juveniles were captured in lentic habitat only. Relative fish abundance, based on catch-per-unit-effort, was different among study lakes, and was greater in lentic than lotic habitat.

In this study, {{in an attempt to}} clarify the mechanism for the Na+ uptake, we performed a systematic analysis of gene expression patterns of zebrafish carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms and found that, of 12 CA isoforms, CA 2 a and CA 15 a are highly expressed in H-MRCs at larval stages. The ca 2 a and ca 15 a mRNA expression were salinity-dependent; they were up-regulated in 0. 03 mM Na+ water whereas ca 15 a but not ca 2 a was down-regulated in 70 mM Na+ water. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic distribution of CA 2 a and apical membrane localization of CA 15 a. Furthermore, cell-surface immunofluorescence staining revealed external surface localization of CA 15 a. Depletion of either CA 2 a or CA 15 a expression by Morphorino antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a significant decrease in Na+ accumulation in H-MRCs. An in situ proximity ligation assay demonstrated a very close association of CA 2 a, CA 15 a, Na+/H+ exchanger 3 b (Nhe 3 b), and Rhcg 1 ammonia transporter in H-MRC.

We experimentally manipulated the parasite load of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and introduced fish either infected with the ectoparasites Gyrodactylus spp. (experimental) or uninfected (control) into replicated semi-natural populations of eight size-matched female guppies. We quantified the behaviour and social associations of both the introduced fish and the population fish. We found that infected experimental fish spent less time associating with the population fish than the uninfected control fish. Using information on which fish initiated shoal fission (splitting) events, our results demonstrate that the population <b>fish</b> <b>actively</b> avoided infected experimental fish. We also found that the presence of an infected individual resulted in a continued decline in social network clustering up to at least 24 h after the introduction of the infected fish, whereas in the control treatment, the clustering coefficient showed an increase at this time point.

These active sensing strategies are expected to adaptively optimize ongoing behavior with respect to either motor efficiency or sensory information gained. The tight link between the motor domain and sensory perception in active electrolocation make weakly electric fish like Gnathonemus petersii an ideal system for studying sensory-motor interactions in the form of active sensing strategies. Analyzing the movements and electric signals of solitary fish during unrestrained exploration of objects in the dark, we here present the first formal quantification of motor patterns used by fish during electrolocation. Based on a cluster analysis of the kinematic values we categorized the basic units of motion. These were then analyzed for their associative grouping to identify and extract short coherent chains of behavior. This enabled the description of sensory behavior on different levels of complexity: from single movements, over short behaviors to more complex behavioral sequences during which the kinematics alter between different behaviors. We present detailed data for three classified patterns and provide evidence that these can be considered as motor components of active sensing strategies. In accordance with the idea of active sensing strategies, we found categorical motor patterns to be modified by the sensory context. In addition these motor patterns were linked with changes in the temporal sampling in form of differing electric organ discharge frequencies and differing spatial distributions. The ability to detect such strategies quantitatively will allow future research to investigate the impact of such behaviors on sensing...|$|R

Laboratory studies have demonstrated the effect of elevated turbidity levels on the physiology and behavior of salmonids. However, the effects of turbidity on fish in a natural setting are largely uncertain. The goal {{of this study was}} to extend the understanding of turbidity effects to natural settings in coastal northern California where impacts to salmonids may occur both as a result of impaired visual capability and reduced prey availability. I compared foraging success and growth of rainbow trout/steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in reaches immediately above and below a sediment point source in each of two tributaries of the Mad River (Maple and Ca??on creeks) during small storm events in 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006. Movements of tagged individuals within and between reaches of Maple Creek were monitored using paired fixed antennas at the upper and lower ends of each reach. Increases in turbidity above background levels did not appear to have substantial negative effects on the feeding success or growth of salmonids. <b>Fish</b> <b>actively</b> fed during small storm events, as evidenced by stomach fullness values.

Seventy-one sites were sampled across three subcatchments in the Foyle catchment in Northern Ireland.

5000|$|Anglers can now use many {{available}} {{maps and}} surveys to help pinpoint lakes and areas within those lakes {{that make sense}} to try for specific fish, noting those locations in latitude and longitude coordinates. They are then able to use a handheld GPS receiver to aim them to those spots, usually with accuracy of less than 20 feet. Ice anglers then drill holes with whichever auger they have, checking the ice thickness for safety as they go. Using sonar, the angler can determine {{the depth of the}} water, bottom content, weed and structure cover, and even see if there are fish there. Also, by using sonar, they can place the bait according to where they think the fish are. If they are using [...] "tip-ups" [...] they can carpet the area at different depths and with different presentations (the number allowed being determined by local laws) and see what is the most productive. Modern ice anglers can also use modern reels mounted on shorter (18"-36"/45-90 cm long) <b>fishing</b> rods to <b>actively</b> <b>fish</b> by watching, by using their sonar, where their lure is relative to the fish, and jig accordingly to entice a bite.|$|R
40|$|Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) {{occur in}} drought prone {{habitats}} and exhibit behavioural responses {{that are likely}} to enhance drought survival. This study investigated whether deteriorating environmental conditions apply size-dependent constraints on N. burrowsius, leading to differing behavioural strategies of survival. During a drought, numerous N. burrowsius were discovered in a subterranean cavity in an area that had desiccated. Mortality of these emersed fish was substantial and was dependent on substratum characteristics. Neochanna burrowsius were also still present in an adjacent remnant pool. There were significant differences in the sizes of fish successfully adopting the differing strategies of immersion and emersion. These results suggest that larger <b>fish</b> may <b>actively</b> leave the water and find refuge, leaving smaller fish still immersed in remnant pools. This field-based study supports laboratory studies and physiological theory that have emphasised the importance of size in determining the affects of drought on fish...|$|R
