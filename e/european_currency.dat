5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common <b>European</b> <b>currency</b> is that {{differences}} in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> Unit (ECU).

5|$|The name euro {{was officially}} adopted on 16 December 1995 in Madrid. The euro was {{introduced}} to world financial markets as an accounting currency on 1 January 1999, replacing the former <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> Unit (ECU) {{at a ratio of}} 1:1 (US$1.1743). Physical euro coins and banknotes entered into circulation on 1 January 2002, making it the day-to-day operating currency of its original members, and by May 2002 had completely replaced the former currencies. While the euro dropped subsequently to US$0.8252 within two years (26 October 2000), it has traded above the U.S. dollar since the end of 2002, peaking at US$1.6038 on 18 July 2008. Since late 2009, the euro has been immersed in the European sovereign-debt crisis which has {{led to the creation of}} the European Financial Stability Facility as well as other reforms aimed at stabilising the currency. In July 2012, the euro fell below US$1.21 for the first time in two years, following concerns raised over Greek debt and Spain's troubled banking sector.

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the <b>European</b> <b>Currency</b> Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro raised two questions: what was the appropriate exchange rate of the <b>European</b> <b>currencies</b> for entry in the EMU? What were the main determinants of the external value of the euro? To bring some insight in the matter, the concept of equilibrium exchange rates was used, which illustrated the divergence between exchange rates and long run fundamentals. For each country, the equilibrium exchange rate was calculated from a simplified model of external trade which, in its reduced form, allows one to explicitly represent the structural determinants of exchange rates. To obtain supplementary results we also make an analysis of unit cost levels. The results suggest that although the central parities in force within the EMS were rather satisfactory and ought not to give rise subsequently to intra-European tensions, the <b>European</b> <b>currencies</b> were overvalued in terms of their equilibrium exchange rates and the dollar was undervalued. This misalignment thus provides support to justify the depreciation of the euro since its launch. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{external}} {{value of}} the euro declined steadily against the dollar and the yen between its launch and November 2000. After that, it experienced two cycles of limited appreciation followed by depreciation, hovering around a rate of. 89 euros per dollar, and slightly below 110 yen (see Figu-re 2. 1). If measured in effective terms against an index of currencies of major trading partners (according to IMF calculations), the euro depreci-ated in real and nominal terms roughly by 17 per cent between January 1999 {{and the end of}} the year 2000. It has gained slightly since then (see Figure 2. 2). Looking back in time, we note that most <b>European</b> <b>currencies</b> started to depreciate against the dollar as early as 1995. As shown in Figure 2. 2, the depre-ciation of the euro can be seen as the continuation of a phase of dollar strength starting three years earlier. Relative to the synthetic euro – calculated as a weighted average of the <b>European</b> <b>currencies</b> in the euro basket – the dollar appre-ciated by 35 per cent between 1995 and 2000. In effective terms, the {{value of the}} euro in November 2001 is about the same as in 1985, cor-responding to the peak of dol-lar strength during the Reagan years, and to an historical low for <b>European</b> <b>currencies.</b> Indi-vidual currencies in the euro basket, however, experienced different developments. Fi-gure 2. 3 shows that the deutsch-mark was actually much weaker in 1985 than in 2000 and 2001 (as implicit in the euro). Translated into euros, the peak of the dollar relative to the deutschmark during the year 1995 would correspond to a price of only 56 US cents per euro. Conversely, liras and pesetas have never been weak-er than in 2000 and 2001. The balance of payments data for the Euro area show that the current account moved from...|$|R
