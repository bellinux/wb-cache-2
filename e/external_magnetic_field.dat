5|$|The Moon has an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{of about}} 1–100 nanoteslas, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. It does not {{currently}} have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization, probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating. Alternatively, {{some of the}} remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud {{in the presence of}} an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (2HNMR) is a technique that uses an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and deuterium to replace the ordinary form of hydrogen. The ordinary form of hydrogen refers to the elemental form of hydrogen with a molecular weight of approximately 1 g/mol. It contains only one proton and has no neutrons. Deuterium is the isotope form of hydrogen which has a heavier mass compared to ordinary hydrogen. It contains one proton and neutron and has a molecular weight of approximately 2 g/mol. This technique {{can be used to}} investigate motions of acyl chains in lipids. It measures carbon and deuterium interactions and the mobility of these interactions within various regions of the lipid and also determines order parameters. The process involves using quadrupole signaling properties for examining lamellar versus non–lamellar phases as well. An <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> monitors the alignment of paramagnetic compounds and uses changes in the positive or negative magnetic spin values to detect these changes.|$|E

The effects of spatially limited <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> on short sample tests are discussed by comparing the test results for narrow and broad <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The authors tested short samples of pool-cooled 10 kA class superconductors using two kinds of split coils which are different in bore size. The measured recovery currents for the narrow external field are more than twice those for the broad field.

50|$|They need {{extensive}} shielding against <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The ballistic transistors {{currently under}} development employ a similar principle.|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of an <b>external</b> <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>field,</b> the ground and excited states are split by the magnetic interaction between the two unpaired electrons at the N-V− center (see microscopic model): when two electrons have parallel spins (ms=±1), their energy is higher than when spins are antiparallel (ms=0). The farther apart the electrons are, the weaker their interaction energy D (roughly Dnbsp&~1/r3). Thus the smaller splitting in the excited state can be viewed in terms of larger electron-electron separation in the excited state. When an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is applied to the N-V− center, it does not affect the ms=0 states nor the 1A state (because it has Snbsp&= 0), but it splits the msnbsp&= ±1 levels. If a magnetic field is oriented along the defect axis and reaches about 1027 G (or 508 G) then the msnbsp&= –1 and msnbsp&= 0 states in the ground (or excited) state become equal in energy; they strongly interact resulting in so-called spin polarization, which strongly affects the intensity of optical absorption and luminescence transitions involving those states.|$|E
25|$|In a {{paramagnetic}} material there are unpaired electrons, i.e. atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons {{are required by}} the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves {{in the same direction}} as the applied field, thus reinforcing it.|$|E
25|$|When a {{superconductor}} {{is placed}} in a weak <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> H, and cooled below its transition temperature, the magnetic field is ejected. The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameterλ, called the London penetration depth, decaying exponentially to zero within {{the bulk of the}} material. The Meissner effect is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100nm.|$|E

40|$|Iron oxide {{nanoparticles}} can be {{used for}} the actuation of nanostructures with <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Most commonly the iron oxides magnetite or maghemite are used. Iron oxides are advantageous for actuation, as they have a high permanent magnetic moment, are nontoxic and relatively stable. <b>External</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> can exert forces and torques on the particles, which {{can be used}} to actuate individual nanostructures or to guide the self-assembly of large numbers of <b>magnetic</b> nanostructures. The <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> can thus act as a fuel for nanomachines or can provide the energy needed to drive a system of interacting nanostructures out of thermal equilibrium. Many interesting discoveries have been made along these lines in recent years, some of which are reviewed in this chapter...|$|R
40|$|Under {{perpendicular}} <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> two-dimensional carriers exhibit Landau levels (LLs). However, it {{has recently}} been reported that LLs have been observed on graphene and graphite surfaces without <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> being applied. These anomalous LLs have been ascribed primarily to a strain of graphene sheets, leading to in-plane hopping modulation of electrons. Here, we report the observation of the LLs of massive Dirac fermions on atomically flat areas of a nitrogen-doped graphite surface {{in the absence of}} <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The corresponding <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> were estimated to be as much as approximately 100 [*]T. The generation of the LLs at the area with negligible strain can be explained by inequivalent hopping of π electrons that takes place at the perimeter of high-potential domains surrounded by positively charged substituted graphitic-nitrogen atoms...|$|R
25|$|The {{order of}} the superconducting phase {{transition}} was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no latent heat. However, {{in the presence of}} an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence, when the magnetic field is increased beyond the critical field, the resulting phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting material.|$|E
25|$|These {{studies are}} {{possible}} because nuclei {{are surrounded by}} orbiting electrons, which are charged particles that generate small, local magnetic fields that add to or subtract from the <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> and so will partially shield the nuclei. The amount of shielding depends on the exact local environment. For example, a hydrogen bonded to an oxygen will be shielded differently from a hydrogen bonded to a carbon atom. In addition, two hydrogen nuclei can interact via {{a process known as}} spin-spin coupling, if they are on the same molecule, which will split the lines of the spectra in a recognizable way.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned an EPR spectra is usually directly measured {{as the first}} derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field {{is applied to the}} <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at a typical frequency of 100kHz. By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.|$|E

40|$|We study, within Ginzburg-Landau theory, the {{responses}} of three-flavor superfluid quark-gluon plasmas to <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and rotation, in both the color-flavor locked and isoscalar color-antitriplet diquark phases near the critical temperature. Fields are incorporated in the gradient energy arising from long wavelength distortions of the condensate, via covariant derivatives to satisfy local gauge symmetries associated with color and electric charge. Magnetic vortex formation, in response to <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> is possible only in the isoscalar phase; in the color-flavor locked phase, <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are incompletely screened by the Meissner effect. On the other hand, rotation of the superfluid produces vortices in the color-flavor locked phase; in the isoscalar phase, it produces a London gluon-photon mixed field.

25|$|This {{happens because}} {{transitions}} between electronic states are mediated by a photon which cannot change overall spin. Thus optical transitions must preserve the total spin and occur between {{levels of the}} same total spin. For this reason, transitions 3E↔1A and 1A ↔ 3A are non-radiative and quench the luminescence. Whereas msnbsp&= −1 (excited state) ↔ msnbsp&= 0 (ground state) transition was forbidden {{in the absence of}} an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> it becomes allowed when a magnetic field mixes the msnbsp&= −1 and msnbsp&= 0 levels in the ground state. As a measurable outcome of this phenomenon, luminescence intensity can be strongly modulated by magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|In zero field NMR all {{magnetic}} fields are shielded such that {{magnetic fields}} below 1nT (nanotesla) are achieved {{and the nuclear}} precession frequencies of all nuclei are close to zero and indistinguishable. Under those circumstances the observed spectra are no-longer dictated by chemical shifts but primarily by J-coupling interactions which are independent of the <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Since inductive detection schemes are not sensitive at very low frequencies, {{on the order of}} the J-couplings (typically between 0 and 1000Hz), alternative detection schemes are used. Specifically, sensitive magnetometers turn out to be good detectors for zero field NMR. A zero magnetic field environment does not provide any polarization hence it is the combination of zero field NMR with hyperpolarization schemes that makes zero field NMR attractive.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with that}} of Earth, the Moon has only a very weak <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Other major {{differences}} are that the Moon does not currently have a dipolar magnetic field (as would be generated by a geodynamo in its core), and the magnetizations that are present are almost entirely crustal in origin. One hypothesis holds that the crustal magnetizations were acquired early in lunar history when a geodynamo was still operating. The small size of the lunar core, however, is a potential obstacle to this hypothesis. Alternatively, {{it is possible that}} on airless bodies such as the Moon, transient magnetic fields could be generated during impact processes. In support of this, it has been noted that the largest crustal magnetizations appear to be located near the antipodes of the largest impact basins.|$|E

25|$|Considerable efforts {{has been}} devoted towards {{controlling}} the particle formation process of magnetite nanoparticles due to the challenging and complex chemistry reactions involved in the phase transformations prior {{to the formation of}} the magnetite spinel structure. Magnetite particles are of interests in bioscience applications such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since iron oxide magnetite nanoparticles represent a non-toxic alternative to currently employed gadolinium-based contrast agents. However, due to lack of control over the specific transformations involved {{in the formation of the}} particles, truly superparamagnetic particles have not yet been prepared from magnetite, i.e. magnetite nanoparticles that completely lose their permanent magnetic characteristic in the absence of an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (which by definition show a coercivity of 0 A/m).

25|$|MRI was {{originally}} called 'NMRI' (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging). It {{is based upon}} the science of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb and emit radio frequency energy when placed in an <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas in close proximity to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms exist naturally in people and other biological organisms in abundance, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.|$|E
25|$|The analyte {{molecules}} {{in a sample}} can be partially ordered {{with respect to the}} <b>external</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> of the spectrometer by manipulating the sample conditions. Common techniques include addition of bacteriophages or bicelles to the sample, or preparation of the sample in a stretched polyacrylamide gel. This creates a local environment that favours certain orientations of nonspherical molecules. Normally in solution NMR the dipolar couplings between nuclei are averaged out because of the fast tumbling of the molecule. The slight overpopulation of one orientation means that a residual dipolar coupling remains to be observed. The dipolar coupling is commonly used in solid state NMR and provides information about the relative orientation of the bond vectors relative to a single global reference frame. Typically the orientation of the N-H vector is probed in a HSQC like experiment. Initially, residual dipolar couplings were used for refinement of previously determined structures, but attempts at de novo structure determination have also been made.|$|E
