5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> his Catholic opponents at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.|$|E

5|$|In April 1876 he {{returned}} to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 {{he returned}} home at Christmas <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.|$|E
5|$|In August 1900, the {{commander}} of German forces at Victoria (present-day Limbe) appointed Atangana interpreter for 500 Bulu hostages, who were being pressed into labour. Atangana kept the post <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to Buea to work as an office clerk. At some point {{between the end of}} his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although she was a little older and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{the example}} of Daniel Johnston, Diamandis decided to compose her own music and stop going to auditions; she taught herself {{how to play the}} piano and {{recorded}} music on a keyboard. She self-composed and produced her earlier demos with GarageBand, and independently released her debut extended play Mermaid vs. Sailor through Myspace in 2007. She held discussions with fourteen music labels, rejecting all but one as she believed it was the only one which would not dictate her image. She {{came to the attention of}} Neon Gold Records' Derek Davies in 2008, which managed her <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> was hired as the supporting act for Australian recording artist Gotye. In October, Diamandis finalised a recording contract with 679 Recordings (eventually renamed 679 Artists), a subdivision of Warner Music Group.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, an {{intelligent}} {{fuzzy logic system}} using genetic algorithms for the prediction and modelling of interest rates is developed. The proposed system uses a Hierarchical Fuzzy Logic system in which a genetic algorithm {{is used as a}} training method for learning the fuzzy rules knowledge bases. A fuzzy logic system is developed to model <b>and</b> predict three <b>month</b> quarterly interest rate fluctuations. The system is further trained to model and predict interest rates <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> one year periods. The proposed system is developed with first two, three, then four and finally five hierarchical knowledge bases to model and predict interest rates. A Feed Forward Fuzzy Logic system using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms is developed to predict interest rates for three months periods. A back-propagation Hierarchical Neural Network system is further developed to predict interest rates <b>for</b> three <b>months,</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> one year periods. These two systems are then compared with the Hierarchical Fuzzy Logic system results and conclusions on their accuracy of prediction are compared...|$|R
5|$|The RAN's jet {{aircraft}} operational conversion unit, 724 Squadron, was also equipped with Skyhawks during 1968. By December {{of that year}} the squadron was operating a mixed fleet of TA-4G Skyhawks, de Havilland Sea Vampires and Sea Venoms from Albatross. The Skyhawk conversion courses conducted by this unit lasted <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> involved {{a total of about}} 110 hours of flying in TA-4Gs and A-4Gs. During this period pilots became familiar with flying the type and practised combat missions as well as air-to-air refuelling from other Skyhawks using buddy fuel tanks. They were also required to complete about 100 simulated carrier landings at Albatross before landing a Skyhawk on board Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Vidya Balan came with Sarkar's prior work {{experience}} {{with her in}} three music videos. Chopra said that Vidya was screen-tested <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> only then they were sure of her acting abilities.

However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita.|$|E
5|$|Bullion prices {{continued}} to drop through the 1880s, increasing the loss by anyone {{forced to sell}} at melt value after accepting a trade dollar at face value. Despite the support of Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, {{the question of the}} redemption of the trade dollar became caught up in controversy over the heavy coinage of the new Morgan dollar under the inflationary Bland–Allison Act. Silver interests objected to the silver from redeemed trade dollars being counted towards the Mint's monthly quota under the act, preferring to sell newly mined silver instead, and opposed acts which so provided. It was not until 1887 that Congress, ostensibly to relieve the poor (though most trade dollars were by then in the hands of speculators), provided for the redemption of unmutilated trade dollars. The act, which did not count the redeemed silver towards the Bland–Allison Act quota, passed into law on February 14, 1887, when the ten-day period which President Grover Cleveland had to either sign or veto it expired with no action by the President. Many coins were not redeemable due to chop marks or holes applied by Chinese businessmen, which was done to affirm the coin's silver content. The dollars were only redeemable <b>for</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> the recovered silver was struck into dimes, quarters, and half dollars.|$|E
