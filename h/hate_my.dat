500|$|A {{highlight}} {{derived from}} Ephron's book {{and that was}} consistently praised was the O'Donnell portrayal {{of the role of}} the purse in the scene [...] "I <b>Hate</b> <b>My</b> Purse!". While Reiner says, [...] "There's an amusing 'I <b>hate</b> <b>my</b> purse' segment", Isherwood notes [...] "The smartest and shapeliest piece of writing in the show is that acerbic essay by Nora Ephron about her troublesome relationship with purses...Entrusted to Ms. O'Donnell, who does it proud, the essay is a defiant denunciation of the tyranny of the pocketbook, a 'j'accuse' for the era of the 'it' bag." [...] Shaw described O'Donnell's purse performance as an aria, and Jerry Tallmer of The Villager called it [...] "one of the pillars of the show". This scene is sometimes performed alone outside of the theatre.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album were written by A.C. Newman and Destroyer {{frontman}} Dan Bejar. Newman recalled that he thought [...] "'How could we lose?' You could just take some interesting elements and put them together. Even taking myself out of the picture, when I looked at the band I just thought, 'This band's got to be great.' I thought, 'Okay, everyone can <b>hate</b> <b>my</b> songs, they can dismiss them.' But I have the most confidence in Dan's songs because I'm totally outside of him, looking in. I'm just a fan of him." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{songs on}} Tormented are about {{topics such as}} pain, animosity, suicide and depression. Author Tommy Udo wrote: [...] "Tormented is one long rush of {{hardcore}} [...] a 900mph scream of a man smashing his head against a wall with frustration". Described as alternative metal by AllMusic, Tormented is also somewhat of a concept album that {{tells the story of}} a depressed person who eventually commits suicide. This is hinted by the spoken-word line, [...] "it's been like this forever... no more... I <b>hate</b> <b>my</b> fucking life", followed by the sound of a gun being cocked before the first song, [...] "Tolerate"; this thematic device returns with the line [...] "there's nothing left for me" [...] and then the sound of a gunshot immediately after the song [...] "Four Walls" [...] and before the hidden track [...] "Funeral".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Black {{expanded}} on {{her views}} in a talk to Investors In People. When outlining the common causes of sickness absence, she said: [...] "Very often what the GP will write on a medical certificate...isn't really the truth. When I did the independent review on sickness absence for the government, I talked {{to lots of}} people who were collecting their sicknotes and what they said is: 'I <b>hate</b> <b>my</b> line manager. I'm never going back to that job'. But no GP I've ever known writes anything other than a 'medical' diagnosis; the closest they get is 'stress' or 'anxiety' - often not the truth at all". At the same time she drew a sharp distinction between what she called [...] "real" [...] illnesses such as [...] "cancer", [...] "diabetes" [...] and [...] "endogenous depression", and other phenomena such as [...] "stress, anxiety, and mild depression", which she claimed were characterised by [...] "little or no objective disease or impairment" [...] and were [...] "not serious illnesses". They were, she said, usually just a normal human response to something like an unhealthy workplace or a poor line manager and should be handled accordingly.|$|E

It always {{seemed to me that}} if I had been homely Dick would never have thought of me. I <b>hated</b> <b>my</b> beauty because it had {{attracted}} him, but now--oh, I'm glad that I have it. It's all I have to offer Owen,--his artist soul delights in it. I feel as if I do not come to him quite empty-handed." ...|$|R

That year he also publicly reflected on {{his career in}} law enforcement writing two articles for the Saturday Evening Post - a two part series Crime was my business. In it of his twenty five years in police work he said [...] "It's {{a long time to}} last without becoming a cynic" [...] and:During some of those years I was ridden by fear of being double-crossed out of my job by politicians. Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down when I needed to be backed up. And after I got to be chief, there was never a time when someone didn't <b>hate</b> <b>my</b> guts, and I had to be up on my toes to keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives.|$|E

6000|$|An {{extraordinary}} expression flashed {{across her}} face, {{very different from}} pity, modesty, remorse, or anything her companion had expected: her voice became suddenly strong and full.
