5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops seized control of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of two weeks.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, the German ships {{closed to}} attack. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of five minutes, the German cruisers' guns had seriously damaged Good Hope, which was {{destroyed}} by a magazine explosion. Monmouth attempted to escape to the south; she was burning furiously and her guns had fallen silent. Nürnberg closed to point-blank range of Monmouth and poured shells into her. Glasgow was forced to abandon Monmouth after 20:20, before fleeing south and meeting with Canopus. Monmouth eventually capsized and sank at 21:18. Over 1,600men {{were killed in the}} sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Admiral Craddock; German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply.|$|E

5|$|Endtroducing..... is {{the debut}} studio album by American music {{producer}} DJ Shadow, released on September 16, 1996 by the British independent record label Mo' Wax Recordings. The album {{is known for}} being composed almost entirely of sampled content, most of which originated from various vinyl records obtained by DJ Shadow during trips to record shops. Endtroducing..... was produced by Shadow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of two years using minimal amounts of equipment, most notably the Akai MPC60 sampler. In creating the album's overall atmosphere, he strived to capture the downbeat nature of his previous releases for the Mo' Wax label. The album's content features both moody, slow-paced tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of DJ Shadow's early hip hop influences.|$|E

5|$|The 1954 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season resulted in over $750million in damage, {{the most of}} any season at the time. The season officially began on June15, and nine days later the first named storm developed. Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande, producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55people. Activity was slow until late August; only Barbara, a minimal tropical storm, developed in July. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of two weeks, hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes.

5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and is vulnerable to both large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda Trench, a convergent plate boundary where the Australian tectonic plate is subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the trench. The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic strain energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became {{the hallmark of the}} Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} opened at Hofstra's James M. Shuart Stadium with the Maryland–Syracuse match-up.

Syracuse scored three {{unanswered}} goals {{in the first quarter}} before Maryland goalie Brian Phipps suffered an ACL tear. Terrapins midfielder Grant Catalino narrowed the deficit to 5–3 before halftime on an extra-man score. In the second half, Syracuse made defensive adjustments to shut down Maryland's behind-the-goal attack, and the Orange tallied three times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of 2:10 to pull away in the third quarter.

5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force winds were reported for 18hours, and tropical storm-force winds were reported for 30hours. As the eye was crossing the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of a few minutes; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E
5|$|Already {{frequently}} {{compared to}} compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>span</b> of three weeks. During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal {{remarkably similar to}} Maradona's goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected {{the ball on the}} right side near the halfway line, ran , and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done. A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match. As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.|$|E

Most of the northern areas of the island received more than 510mm (20in) of rain but the southern areas of Guam reported much lower totals. At Anderson Air Force Base, a total of 287.78mm (11.33in) of rain was recorded over a 30-hour span. Rota recorded much less rainfall than Guam, having 145.28mm (5.72in) during 24hours and a storm total of 221.99mm (8.75in). No rainfall was recorded on both Tinian and Pagan Island {{due to the lack}} of observations. On Saipan, a total of 197.61mm (7.78in) was measured.|$|E
