5|$|The English Cocker Spaniel is {{the most}} {{successful}} breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928. This was mostly due {{to the success of}} <b>dog</b> <b>breeder</b> H.S. Lloyd's Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 19301950. They are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700. The English Cocker's popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th.|$|E
5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, <b>dog</b> <b>breeder</b> and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Canine von Willebrand’s disease – {{knowledge}} and awareness among dog breed-ers and owners in Poland. Von Willebrand’s dis-ease (vWD), {{one of the}} most common congenital bleeding diatheses caused by a de ¿ cient or de-fective von Willebrand’s factor (vWF), is found in different breeds of dogs. The objective of the study was to perform a preliminary analysis of the {{knowledge and}} awareness of von Willebrand’s disease among <b>dog</b> <b>breeders</b> and owners in Po-land. The online survey was addressed to <b>dog</b> <b>breeders</b> and owners, comprised 25 questions and was voluntary and anonymous. It was placed on 12 thematic Internet forums dedicated to differ-ent breeds of dogs. The respondents provided 231 answers, 76 of which were complete. The results of the survey indicate that the <b>dog</b> <b>breeders</b> and owners are highly interested in genetic tests and want more general access to scienti ¿ c informa-tion. By their own admission, the <b>dog</b> owners and <b>breeders</b> have partly insuf ¿ cient knowledge about vWD. Considerable gaps in their knowl-edge about other issues (including breeding work) were also evidenced. Being a contribution to the discussion about canine vWD, this article high-lighted the need to improve the education of <b>dog</b> <b>breeders</b> and owners, and to make them aware of their role in canine health care...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1830s, Heinrich Essig, a <b>dog</b> <b>breeder</b> and seller {{and mayor}} {{of the town of}} Leonberg near Stuttgart in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, claimed to have created the Leonberger by {{crossing}} a female Landseer Newfoundland with a [...] "barry" [...] male from the Great St. Bernard Hospice and Monastery (which would later create the Saint Bernard breed). Later, according to Essig, a Pyrenean Mountain Dog was added, resulting in very large dogs with the long white coats that were the fashion for the time, and pleasant temperament. The first dogs registered as Leonbergers were born in 1846 and had many of the prized qualities of the breeds from which they were derived. The popular legend is that it was bred to resemble the coat-of-arms animal of Leonberg, the lion. The Leonberger dog became popular with several European royal households, including Napoleon II, Empress Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary, the Prince of Wales, Otto Von Bismarck, Emperor Napoleon III and Umberto I of Italy. Essig's claim of breeding the dog as described is disputed. Records from as early as 1585 may indicate the existence of Leonberger type dogs; documents dating from 1601 held by the Metternich family describe similar dogs used to deter the theft of livestock. [...] Either way, {{there is no doubt that}} Essig named and registered the breed first. A black and white engraving of the Leonberger was included in [...] "The Illustrated Book of the Dog" [...] by Vero Shaw (at p.488) in 1881. [...] At the time, Essig's Leonbergers were denounced as an indifferent knockoff of a St. Bernard—not a stable and recognized breed—and a product of a popular fad or fashion for large and strong dogs, fomented in part by Essig's prodigious marketing skills (he gave dogs to the rich and famous).|$|E
