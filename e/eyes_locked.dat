2500|$|On February 1, 2011, Sondheim joined former Salt Lake Tribune theatre critic Nancy Melich {{before an}} {{audience}} of 1,200 at Kingsbury Hall. Melich described the evening: He was visibly taken by the university choir, who sang two songs during the evening, [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] and [...] "Sunday", {{and then returned to}} reprise [...] "Sunday". During that final moment, Sondheim and I were standing, facing the choir of students from the University of Utah's opera program, our backs to the audience, and I could see tears welling in his eyes as the voices rang out. Then, all of a sudden, he raised his arms and began conducting, urging the student singers to go full out, which they did, the crescendo building, their <b>eyes</b> <b>locked</b> with his, until the final [...] "on an ordinary Sunday" [...] was sung. It was thrilling, and a perfect conclusion to a remarkable evening – nothing ordinary about it.|$|E

Dante saw two at his feet so closely stuck together, that the very hairs of their heads were mingled. He asked them who they were, and as they lifted up their heads for astonishment, and felt the cold doubly congeal them, they dashed their heads against one another for hate and fury. They were two {{brothers}} who had murdered each other.[44] Near them were other Tuscans, one of whom the cold had deprived of his ears; and thousands more were seen grinning like dogs, for the pain.|$|E

5000|$|Nettles met Applewhite in March 1972, though {{where they}} met is uncertain. According to the {{writings}} of Applewhite, [...] "Applewhite was visiting a hospitalized friend when Mrs. Nettles entered the room and their <b>eyes</b> <b>locked</b> in a shared recognition of esoteric secrets." [...] However, Applewhite's writings were prone to hyperbole or relaying everything as some occurrence of fate. Terrie Nettles, Bonnie's daughter, has stated that [...] "The two met at a drama school in a theater." [...] and that Applewhite had been teaching in the school, with one of Bonnie's sons attending it. Bonnie's son, Joe Nettles, also corroborated this version of events.|$|E

6000|$|One of the {{earliest}} maps ever published, which appeared at Rome in the sixteenth century, intimates a similar belief in the connexion of the heathen nations of the north of Europe with the demons of the spiritual world. In Esthonia, Lithuania, Courland, and such districts, the chart, for want, it may be supposed, of an accurate account of the country, exhibits rude cuts of the fur-clad natives paying homage at the shrines of demons, who make themselves visibly present to them; while at other places they are displayed as doing battle with the Teutonic knights, or other military associations formed for the conversion or expulsion of the heathens in these parts. Amid the pagans, armed with scimitars and dressed in caftans, the fiends are painted as assisting them, pourtrayed in all the modern horrors of the cloven foot, or, as the Germans term it, horse's foot, bat wings, saucer <b>eyes,</b> <b>locks</b> like serpents, and tail like a dragon. These attributes, it may be cursorily noticed, themselves intimate the connexion of modern demonology with the mythology of the ancients. The cloven foot is the attribute of Pan--to whose talents for inspiring terror we owe the word panic--the snaky tresses are borrowed from the shield of Minerva, and the dragon train alone seems to be connected with the Scriptural history.[5] ...|$|R
