It is named for Benjamin Widom, who derived it in 1963. [...] In general, there are two theoretical approaches to determining the statistical mechanical properties of materials. The first is the direct calculation of the overall partition function of the system, which directly yields the system free energy. The second approach, known as the Widom <b>Insertion</b> <b>method,</b> instead derives from calculations centering on one molecule.

For the special case that distances satisfy the triangle inequality, many approximation algorithms have been developed and analyzed. The approximation factor of such an algorithm is the ratio between the length of the tour obtained by the algorithm and the optimal tour.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 273 patients with adenomyosis who were receiving Mirena for treatment of menorrhagia and/or dysmenorrhea between 2001 and 2008.

50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{categories}} of tree construction methods: top-down, bottom-up, and <b>insertion</b> <b>methods.</b> Top-down methods proceed by partitioning the input set into two (or more) subsets, bounding {{them in the}} chosen bounding volume, then keep partitioning (and bounding) recursively until each subset consists of only a single primitive (leaf nodes are reached). Top-down methods are easy to implement, fast to construct and {{by far the most}} popular, but do not result in the best possible trees in general. Bottom-up methods start with the input set as the leaves of the tree and then group two (or more) of them to form a new (internal) node, proceed in the same manner until everything has been grouped under a single node (the root of the tree). Bottom-up methods are more difficult to implement, but likely to produce better trees in general. Both top-down and bottom-up methods are considered off-line methods as they both require all primitives to be available before construction starts. <b>Insertion</b> <b>methods</b> build the tree by inserting one object at a time, starting from an empty tree. The insertion location should be chosen that causes the tree to grow as little as possible according to a cost metric. <b>Insertion</b> <b>methods</b> are considered on-line methods since they do not require all primitives to be available before construction starts and thus allow updates to be performed at runtime.|$|R
