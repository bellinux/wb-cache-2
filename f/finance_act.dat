5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} <b>Finance</b> <b>Act,</b> for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

25|$|Being a {{registered}} charity is conclusive proof of charitable status, {{but is not}} the only method to establish it. Simply being owned by a charity will not, however, be sufficient to qualify for the reliefs. The property must also be used wholly or mainly for charitable purposes, and the criteria set out in the Local Government <b>Finance</b> <b>Act</b> 1988 must also be met. The criteria for eligibility are not straightforward and there is some case law, especially in relation to charity shops, which provides guidance.|$|E
25|$|Other {{provisions}} in the Taxes Acts sometimes deem there to be accounting periods for specific purposes only. This is typically on {{the introduction of new}} legislation.

25|$|The Local Government <b>Finance</b> <b>Act</b> 1988 gives broad {{authorisation}} for regulations {{to be made}} about alterations, which can include alterations by the Valuation Office Agency to maintain the list accurately, or proposals by interested parties to change the list. The regulations have differed widely, changing the time-frame of when alterations are effective. For example, proposals to alter the 2000 rating list by an occupier were restricted to take effect in the financial year {{in which they were}} made, but the 2005 rating list removed this restriction, so that a successful proposal can have effect as far back as 1 April 2005.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} {{development}} of trades in uncertificated stock, the UK <b>Finance</b> <b>Act</b> 1986 introduced the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) {{at a rate of}} 0.5% on share purchases, raising around €3.8bn per year, of which 40% is paid by foreign residents. The tax is charged whether the transaction takes place in the UK or overseas, and whether either party is resident of the UK or not. Securities issued by companies overseas are not taxed. This means that—just like the standard stamp duty—the tax is paid by foreign and UK-based investors who invest in UK incorporated companies. In other words, the tax applies to all companies which are headquartered in the UK, albeit there is a relief for intermediaries (such as market makers and large banks that are members of a qualifying exchange) as a condition of their obligation to provide liquidity.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 2013 a {{new system}} of {{business}} rates retention began in England. Before April 2013 all business rate income collected by councils formed a single, national pot, which was then distributed by government in the form of formula grant. Through the Local Government <b>Finance</b> <b>Act</b> 2012, and regulations that followed, the Government gave local authorities the power to keep up to half of business rate income and transfer half of it centrally, to central government. The central share is then distributed to councils in the form of Revenue Support Grant. The other half kept by local authorities are then subjected to tariff, levy, top up and safety payments depending on the financial position of the council. According to the government the change gives financial incentives to councils to grow their local economies and increase their income from business rates. At the same time the new scheme has resulted in more risk and uncertainty.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the British {{government}} {{announced plans to}} introduce civil partnerships which would allow same-sex couples the rights and responsibilities resulting from marriage. The Civil Partnership Bill was introduced into the House of Lords on March 30, 2004. After considering amendments made by the House of Commons, it {{was passed by the}} House of Lords, its final legislative hurdle, on November 17, 2004, and received Royal Assent on November 18. The Act came into force on 5 December 2005, and same-sex, but not opposite-sex, couples were able to form the civil partnerships from 19 December 2005 in Northern Ireland, 20 December 2005 in Scotland and 21 December 2005 in England and Wales. Separate provisions were included in the first <b>Finance</b> <b>Act</b> 2005 to allow regulations to be made to amend tax laws to give the same tax advantages and disadvantages to couples in civil partnerships as apply to married couples. At that time, the Church of England, the state church in England, permitted clergy to enter into same-sex civil partnerships.|$|E

500|$|Hart {{and nine}} others were {{teachers}} at Malvern College, where from 1983 to 1986 they {{took advantage of}} a [...] "concessionary fee" [...] scheme, which allowed their children to be educated at rates one fifth of those paid by other pupils. They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 <b>Finance</b> <b>Act,</b> Section 63 of which said that: [...] The Inland Revenue, attempting to tax this benefit, argued that the [...] "cost" [...] of the benefit meant an average {{of the cost of}} providing it; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £1,000,000 a year to run, the [...] "cost" [...] per pupil was £10,000. Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead marginal cost, saying that other than food, stationery, laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children's presence that would not be there already. The Special Commissioners (an appellate body for income tax claims), ruling in favour of Hart, noted that not only was the school not full to capacity, with the teachers' children having no impact on waiting lists, but that the [...] "concessionary fee" [...] covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating those particular pupils. It was found, however, that during debate on the <b>Finance</b> <b>Act,</b> ministers had made statements in the House of Commons which supported the idea that such [...] "benefits" [...] should be excluded from tax.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom {{joined the}} European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973, which {{transformed}} {{itself into the}} European Union (EU) in 1993 via the Maastricht Treaty. The EU differed from the EEC in having greater political authority, resulting in some reduction of the sovereignty of its member-states. The UK's ratification of the treaty in 1992, followed by its passing of the European Communities (<b>Finance)</b> <b>Act</b> in 1994–95, had generated much controversy and infighting within the UK's Conservative Party, which was then in government under Prime Minister John Major. This caused much damage to [...] Major's administration, which was increasingly unpopular among the British population. Various British newspapers, among them The Sun, The Daily Telegraph and The Times, had adopted a consistently Eurosceptic position. Opinion polls suggested growing opposition to aspects of the EU in the UK. More widely, the acceleration of the EU's integration process had resulted {{in the growth of}} Eurosceptic parties across many of its member states.|$|E
500|$|John Hart {{and nine}} others were {{teachers}} at Malvern College who {{benefited from a}} [...] "concessionary fee" [...] scheme that allowed their children to be educated at the college for one fifth of the normal fees of a pupil. The Inland Revenue attempted to tax this benefit based on the <b>Finance</b> <b>Act</b> 1976. There was a dispute over the correct interpretation of the Act. [...] The Special Commissioners charged with assessing the tax found in favour of Hart, but both the High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal of England and Wales found in favour of the Inland Revenue. The case {{then went to the}} House of Lords, which, making use of statements in Parliament as recorded in Hansard, found in favour of Hart. [...] Lord Mackay, dissenting, argued that Hansard should not be considered admissible evidence because of the time and expense involved in a lawyer having to look up every debate and discussion on a particular statute when giving legal advice or preparing a case.|$|E
