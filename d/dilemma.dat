40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of a {{research}} project aimed at constructing and validating moral <b>dilemmas</b> for students of rural contexts. In the first phase the teacher compiled moral situations of interest to her students. During the second phase, the researchers designed <b>dilemmas</b> responding to predetermined criteria, and in the third phase the teacher presented 9 <b>dilemmas</b> to her class.   The group analyzed the information in videos, students’ posters and worksheets, the teacher’s daily activity report, and the researchers’ observation log. Fifteen moral <b>dilemmas</b> resulted at the end, from which nine were put into practice, and of those six were validated. The remaining three <b>dilemmas</b> that were not validated could be polished thanks to the learning experience gained by the research team in relation to creating <b>dilemmas,</b> the students’ performance at facing <b>dilemmas</b> and the teacher´s role in the development of <b>dilemmas</b> in class. This opens a new panorama full of different research problems related to moral <b>dilemmas...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} {{the tension between}} utilitarian and non-utilitarian (characteristically deontological) judgments.

These high-conflict <b>dilemmas</b> share a similar structure in which one person can be harmed in order to achieve a greater benefit. To avoid repetition, we presented these “high-conflict ” <b>dilemmas</b> {{along with the rest of}} our standard battery of moral <b>dilemmas</b> (Greene et al., 2001, 2004), which includes “impersonal ” and “low-conflict ” personal moral <b>dilemmas</b> that have different structures. These <b>dilemmas</b> are not suitable for testing our hypothesis because they typically involve no clear conflict between utilitarian and non-utilitarian moral principles. We present data for these <b>dilemmas</b> here.

40|$|Moral <b>dilemmas</b> often pose {{dramatic}} and gut-wrenching emotional choices. It is now widely accepted that emotions {{are not simply}} experienced alongside people's judgments about moral <b>dilemmas,</b> but that our affective processes {{play a central role}} in determining those judgments. However, much of the evidence purporting to demonstrate the connection between people's emotional responses and their judgments about moral <b>dilemmas</b> has recently been called into question. In the present studies, we reexamined the role of emotion in people's judgments about moral <b>dilemmas</b> using a validated self-report measure of emotion. We measured participants' specific emotional responses to moral <b>dilemmas</b> and, although we found that moral <b>dilemmas</b> evoked strong emotional responses, we found that these responses were only weakly correlated with participants' moral judgments. We argue that the purportedly strong connection between emotion and judgments of moral <b>dilemmas</b> may have been overestimated...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown the {{existence}} of a relationship between sleep and moral judgment. In this study, we investigated whether one night of sleep deprivation affects the ability to judge the appropriateness of moral <b>dilemmas.</b> Forty-eight students had to judge 30 moral <b>dilemmas</b> at test, after a night of home sleep, and another 30 <b>dilemmas</b> at retest, following one night of continuous wakefulness. The 60 <b>dilemmas</b> (20 moral impersonal, 20 moral personal, and 20 non-moral) were selected from Greene's <b>dilemmas.</b> Both groups judged the appropriateness of personal and impersonal <b>dilemmas</b> in the same way. A close to significant effect of sleep deprivation was observed on the reaction times for impersonal moral <b>dilemmas,</b> to which the deprived subjects responded faster (p =. 05) than the control subjects. However, {{this was not the case}} for personal ones, for which no difference was significant. This result shows a greater ease/speed in responding to the (impersonal) <b>dilemmas,</b> which induce low emotional engagement after sleep deprivation, although the willingness to accept moral violations is not affected. This suggests that one night of sleep loss selectively influences the response speed only for moral impersonal <b>dilemmas,</b> probably due to disinhibition processes. The quality of moral judgment <b>dilemmas</b> does not seem to be easily influenced by a single night of sleep deprivation, but only by a longer lack of sleep...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} cognitive conflicts using the repertory grid technique is presented. By means of this technique, implicative <b>dilemmas</b> can be identified, cognitive structures {{in which a}} personal construct for which change is wished for implies undesirable change on another construct.

In addition, participants in both groups with this type of conflict showed more depressive symptoms and general distress than those without <b>dilemmas.</b> Furthermore, a greater number of implicative <b>dilemmas</b> was associated with higher levels of symptom severity. Finally, content analysis results showed that implicative <b>dilemmas</b> are frequently composed of a constellation of moral values and emotion, indicating that symptoms are often related to moral aspects of the self and so change processes may be hindered.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about social <b>dilemmas</b> in non-embedded settings. Social <b>dilemmas</b> are {{situations}} where {{individual and collective}} interests are in conflict. Collective action problems, problems of trust, and cooperation are examples of social <b>dilemmas.</b> The standard rational choice model successfully explains behavior in embedded social <b>dilemmas,</b> i. e, social <b>dilemmas</b> {{that take place in}} repeated interactions, that are embedded in a social network or in an institutional context. However, the standard rational choice model fails to explain behavior in non-embedded social <b>dilemmas.</b> Non-embedded social <b>dilemmas</b> are social <b>dilemmas</b> that take place among strangers in social encounters. In four of the six empirical chapters, this thesis offers a revision of the standard rational choice model and explains behavior in non-embedded social <b>dilemmas</b> by three factors: (1) heterogeneous social preferences, (2) ego-centered [...] -consensus type [...] -biases in beliefs, and (3) evaluation error. These three factors correspond to two core assumptions of the standard rational choice model. The first factor revises the selfishness assumption and the other two ``stretch" the rationality assumption of the standard model. The final two empirical chapters include two applications of this theoretical framework. Chapter 6 experimentally studies the influence of procedural justice on cooperation. Chapter 7 reports an international inter-ethnic experiment with Turkish, Dutch, and Turkish-Dutch respondents, and shows clear inter-group differences in social preferences resembling the ``North vs. South" effect, but no ingroup favoritism is foun...|$|R
