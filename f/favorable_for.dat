5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe weather was issued for April 26 for {{portions}} of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas along and near the Interstate 30 corridor as conditions became even more <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> extreme weather.

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance southwest of Manzanillo, Colima became a tropical depression on September 12 when its convection became persistent around a newly formed center of circulation. Conditions were not <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> development because of strong wind shear environment {{caused by a}} trough. The depression took a northward track and dissipates on September 13 as it was being sheared {{just south of the}} Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping {{to be able to}} identify conditions which were <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and decided it would be difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the storm, gale warnings were issued on August 19 from Jacksonville, Florida to Virginia Beach, Virginia. A hurricane watch was also posted between Savannah, Georgia and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The hurricane watch was later extended to Jacksonville when conditions appeared more <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> the storm's intensification, but was soon discontinued. Flooding rains were anticipated in the Carolinas, though, in contrast, Dottie was compared to a mere thunderstorm by some local officials.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in El Niño years. During El Niño years, {{conditions}} are more <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> tropical cyclones because of warmer sea surface temperatures and reduced wind shear. This is why Category5s cluster in single seasons. The effects of El Niño are most {{significant in the}} central Pacific (140°W to the dateline).|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 2007, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa, producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms. It encountered conditions <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> gradual development, and on August12 it gained organization and became a low. Strong upper-level easterly winds slowed development, but on August13 the tropical wave gained enough organization that the National Hurricane Center designated it Tropical Depression Four. At this time it was centered about 520mi (835km) west-southwest of Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|On August 3, 2006, Klotzbach's team {{lowered its}} season {{estimate}} to15 named storms, with7 becoming hurricanes and 3becoming major hurricanes, noting that conditions had become less <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> storms {{than they had}} been earlier in the year. The sea-level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal, while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2001, NOAA revised {{its season}} {{estimate}} slightly upwards to nine to twelve named storms, of which 6 to 8 {{were to be}} hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes. The agency noted that sea surface temperatures continued to be <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> above-average hurricane activity, and due to the likelihood that El Nino would not develop during {{the peak of the}} season, there was a reduced likelihood of a below-average year.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{system from}} which Hurricane Alex {{developed}} was first discernible as a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June17, 2010. Over {{the next few}} days, most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within the ITCZ. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned it {{as a candidate for}} tropical cyclone formation on June20, while it was crossing the Windward Islands into the southeastern Caribbean Sea; at the time, some upper-level wind shear was present, leading to conditions only marginally <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> development. The system moved through the Caribbean, and on June21, it developed {{to the extent that the}} NHC assessed a 50%chance of development into a tropical depression within 48hours. The next day, however, the feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across the Greater Antilles, although the upper-level regime remained <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> eventual redevelopment.|$|E

5|$|A weak surface trough, located to {{the west}} of an upper-level low, {{developed}} convection to the east of the Bahamas on July 26. A tropical wave entered the area two days later, resulting in an increase of convective organization and area. Although conditions were not <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> tropical cyclone formation, it sped to the northwest and steadily organized, developing a surface area of low pressure on the 30th. On July 31, the system continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression One while located 200miles (320km) to the east of Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
5|$|A weather system {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September3. The {{disturbance}} was small and became unidentifiable within 24hours of formation. Satellite imagery indicated that the disturbance may have acquired a circulation on September7, but the circulation was gone by the next day. The remaining tropical wave moved into the Lesser Antilles on September11 and a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed. The aircraft found circulation; however, by the next day, only a strong wave was detected. Atmospheric conditions became more <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> development, yielding lower wind shear near Hispaniola for several days. The system moved into this area as the latest Reconnaissance aircraft was deployed, declaring it a tropical depression on September13 near the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado {{was part of a larger}} severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the moist and unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as a result of an eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March28 as the conditions <b>favorable</b> <b>for</b> tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E
