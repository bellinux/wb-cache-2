5|$|IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is {{a binary}} star {{system in the}} {{constellation}} Pegasus. It is just luminous enough {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye, at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 150 light years from the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which Mars's geocentric {{longitude}} is 180° different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and about 103millionkm due to the planets' elliptical orbits, which causes comparable variation in angular size. The last Mars opposition occurred on May 22, 2016 at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 76millionkm. The next Mars opposition occurs on July 27, 2018 at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 58millionkm. The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its synodic period, is 780 days; {{but the number of}} days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.|$|E

The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures {{that are associated with}} intense magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|Humpback whales {{have been}} sighted {{in the lower}} region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good {{locations}} to see humpback whales from a safe <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> a quarter mile.

5|$|Jupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35AU (the mean {{semi-major axis}} is 5.2±0.15AU), and are {{distributed}} throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along {{the orbit of}} Jupiter, amounting to a total <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 2.5AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two Hill's radii, which {{in the case of}} Jupiter amounts to about 0.6AU. Many of Jupiter trojans have large orbital inclinations relative to Jupiter's orbital plane—up to 40°.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Derrick Watson's C Platoon set out {{at around}} 06:15 and {{advanced}} {{to the edge of}} Village 3, a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> , before becoming pinned down by heavy Japanese fire. King then sent Captain Gordon Blainey's A Platoon around the right flank, towards the high ground on Mission Hill which overlooked the battlefield. It was secured by 07:30. In the meantime, some of the 2/6th Independent Company's signallers and headquarters personnel gathered together what ammunition they could, and delivered it to C Platoon at around 07:00. C Platoon then fixed bayonets and continued its advance.|$|E
5|$|Pleione {{is known}} to be a speckle binary, {{although}} its orbital parameters have yet to be fully established. In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an angular separation between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E
50|$|The Ballochney Railway used a “dandy-cart” {{on the two}} “Ballochney Inclines” each {{having a}} grade of around 1 in 23 for <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 1000 yards.

The crew {{abandoned}} ship in three lifeboats within 15 minutes. After she questioned the crew, {{she began to}} shell the ship from a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> , firing at least 60 shells (some survivors said as many as 150) until the ship sank. The crewmen were rescued by Soviet patrol boats later that day.|$|E
5|$|Thebe is the {{outermost}} {{of the inner}} Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 222,000km (3.11 Jupiter radii). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.018, and an inclination of 1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter. These values are unusually high for an inner satellite and {{can be explained by}} the past influence of the innermost Galilean satellite, Io; in the past, several mean-motion resonances with Io would have passed through Thebe's orbit as Io gradually receded from Jupiter, and these excited Thebe's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Titania orbits Uranus at the <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> , {{being the}} second {{farthest}} {{from the planet}} among its five major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.|$|E
500|$|Various {{catalogues}} list up to nine faint visual companions to Betelgeuse. [...] They are at <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> {{one to four}} arc-minutes and all are fainter than 10th magnitude. [...] Betelgeuse {{is generally}} considered to be a single isolated star and a runaway star, not currently associated with any cluster or star-forming region, although its birthplace is unclear.|$|R

5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E
5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 584,000km, {{being the}} {{farthest}} {{from the planet}} among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends {{a significant part of}} its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E

5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
30|$|For link <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 50 m, {{our results}} show that the channel {{estimation}} with minimum energy is achieved using two preamble symbols per transmit antenna when the target estimation MSE is − 10 dB. For <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> approximately 120 m, the minimum energy consumption required to achieve the same estimation quality increases tenfold for both algorithms due to path loss. This indicates that longer range MIMO communications can be performed more energy-efficiently by multi-hop routes than over single-hop links.|$|R

The time difference in the daily ring is to avoid interference with the nearby courthouse bells, which ring exactly at noon.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the dipole-dipole interaction on the quantum jump statistics of three atoms. This is done for three-level systems in a V and in a D configuration. The transition rates between the four different intensity periods are calculated in closed form. Cooperative effects are shown to increase by a factor of two compared to two of either three-level systems. This results in transition rates that are, for <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> one wavelength <b>of</b> the strong transition, up to 100 % higher than for independent systems. In addition the double and triple jump rates are calculated from the transition rates. In this case cooperative effects of up to 170 % for <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> one wavelength and still up to 15 % around ten wavelengths are found. Nevertheless, for the parameters of an experiment with Hg+ ions the effects are negligible, in agreement with the experimental data. For three Ba+ ions this seems to indicate that the large cooperative effects observed experimentally can not be explained by the dipole-dipole interaction...|$|R
