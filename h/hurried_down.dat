He took it as a premonition and the next day <b>hurried</b> <b>down</b> to Burlington Street, where he noticed a sign on a building advertising what Shackleton called the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. He promptly entered the building whereupon he met Shackleton. After a few minutes of conversation, Shackleton offered him the captaincy of the Endurance, which Worsley accepted.|$|E

Yue Jin defeated and totally routed the forces of Du Pu and Liang Da.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1179, King Baldwin had set up an outpost {{on the road to}} Damascus and aimed to fortify a passage over the Jordan River, known as Jacob's Ford, that {{commanded}} the approach to the Banias plain (the plain was divided by the Muslims and the Christians). Saladin had offered 100,000 gold pieces to Baldwin to abandon the project, which was particularly offensive to the Muslims, but to no avail. He then resolved to destroy the fortress, called Chastellet and manned by the Templars, moving his headquarters to Banias. As the Crusaders <b>hurried</b> <b>down</b> to attack the Muslim forces, they fell into disorder, with the infantry falling behind. Despite early success, they pursued the Muslims far enough to become scattered, and Saladin took advantage by rallying his troops and charged at the Crusaders. The engagement ended in a decisive Ayyubid victory, and many high-ranking knights were captured. Saladin then moved to besiege the fortress, which fell on 30 August 1179.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1863, during Gettysburg, Roebling {{was one of}} {{the initial}} {{officers}} on Little Round Top. Observing signs of Confederate troops approaching, he <b>hurried</b> <b>down</b> the hill to report to Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, for whom Roebling was aide-de-camp. General Warren and Roebling then descended the hill to find troops to secure this important tactical position. Roebling assisted in hoisting artillery up the hill, while Warren sent two of his aides, one of whom was Lt. Ranald S. Mackenzie, searching for infantry support. The two aides were able to secure a brigade from the Union V Corps. This brigade was commanded by Col. Strong Vincent whose brigade immediately occupied the hill and defended the left flank of the Army of the Potomac against repeated Confederate attacks. As Vincent's brigade began moving into position, Warren and Roebling had left the hill and Roebling was able to send the 140th New York Volunteers to the hill, not knowing that Vincent's brigade was already engaging advancing Confederate troops. However, the 140th New York provided much needed reinforcements.|$|E
2500|$|... "Awkward" [...] Davies / Davis {{has long}} {{followed}} Aubrey from ship to ship. As his nickname suggests, he is a clumsy sailor, known for dropping sharp edged tools from great heights, narrowly missing his shipmates. This, coupled with his immense strength and his hot temper, make him an undesirable crew mate. Despite this, he is valued {{as a powerful}} fighter useful for boarding and cutting out expeditions. In The Ionian Mission and Treason's Harbour, he is called Davis, with the same description as Davies, and was saved from drowning just once. In Treason's Harbour (Chapter 7), in port at Suez, he negotiated with a bear leader to buy the cub, when [...] "a fight {{broke out in the}} square below, a fight between Davis and the bear, which resented his familiarity in chucking it under the chin. ...
