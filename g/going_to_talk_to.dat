500|$|During filming, Roth held {{a grudge}} against Heston {{due to his}} work with the National Rifle Association: [...] "It was very {{difficult}} for me. On one level, there's the man and he's my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing is what it is now. I'm so against it, very vocally so. But it was inappropriate for the workplace. If I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, I'll talk to him outside the workplace. So it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene." [...] Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston.|$|E
500|$|Tintin in the Congo {{has been}} criticised as {{presenting}} the Africans as naïve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing {{a class of}} African children. [...] "My dear friends," [...] he says, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you today about your fatherland: Belgium." [...] Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying, [...] "I portrayed these Africans according to... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time." [...] Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as [...] "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals", although Thompson noted her quote may have been [...] "taken out of context".|$|E
500|$|At Casterman's prompting, Tintin in the Congo was {{subsequently}} fully re-drawn, {{and the new}} version was published in 1946. As {{a part of this}} modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version, [...] "My dear friends, today I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about your country: Belgium!" [...] whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white [...] "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe." ...|$|E

500|$|During a {{subsequent}} NPR talk show, Savage {{said that he}} has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, [...] "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, [...] "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball." [...] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a [...] "foaming lunatic... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum... You're nobody and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you!" [...] At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.|$|E
2500|$|After the incidents, South Carolina {{governor}} Nikki Haley said on May 30, 2014 {{that with}} {{the damage to the}} area's reputation hurting tourism and efforts to attract other industries, [...] "It is time for that Bikefest to come to an end, and that is the way that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the elected officials of Atlantic Beach." [...] Haley, who was in Conway to talk about hurricane safety, emphasized that the incidents do not reflect the state as a whole. The previous day, Atlantic Beach Mayor Jake Evans said the event would not be cancelled; he pointed out {{that the vast majority of}} bikers are good people. Chief Warren Gall of the Myrtle Beach Police Department, however, believed the shooting was related to the rally.|$|E
2500|$|Keith Morris was the {{photographer}} who took Drake's photo {{for the cover}} of Bryter Layter (1971) and he was commissioned to photograph Drake for the cover of Pink Moon. However, the photos were not used as Drake's rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island's creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around {{the cover of the}} LP: [...] "I remember <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> , and he just sat there, hunched up, and even though he didn't speak, I knew the album was called Pink Moon, and I can't remember how he conveyed it, whether he wrote it down... he wanted a pink moon. He couldn't tell me what he wanted, but I had 'pink moon' to go on." [...] Island picked a piece of surrealist Dali-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake's sister Gabrielle. Although Drake was not outspoken in his opinion on the cover art of Pink Moon, many close to him felt that he approved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> over <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him, and I needn't {{keep you}} any {{longer in the}} meanwhile. You will {{remember}} that only you and I have got {{to know what the}} Canopus is really doing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him again, I can see," [...] Harris said. [...] "And he's {{applied for}} a {{permanent}} discharge from the Patrol? What reason did he give?" ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it." [...] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had [...] "grave consequences" [...] {{for the rest of}} the scene and that they did not know he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the press, as [...] "he had said nothing". He added that they became [...] "bloody angry" [...] and he, Tunsberg, was [...] "pissed off".|$|E
