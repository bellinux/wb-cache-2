5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in heavy weather.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E

5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges {{at the base of the}} spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
5|$|Pollen {{is removed}} from flowers {{deliberately}} or incidentally by bumblebees. Incidental removal occurs when bumblebees {{come in contact with}} the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar. When it enters a flower, the bumblebee's body hairs receive a <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> pollen from the anthers. In queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae (pollen baskets) on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains. Male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen. Bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination, in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{illustrated}} {{books of}} the time, Utamakura is devoid of accompanying text, and employs luxurious techniques such as embossing, the <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> mica for a glittering effect, and bokashi, a technique by which gradations of colour are achieved by applying different amounts of ink to the printing block.|$|E

40|$|Using <b>of</b> {{charcoal}} <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell in {{asphalt concrete}} mixture {{has been researched}} with some variations of number of blow to characteristic of asphalt concrete mixture type III. The aim {{of this research is}} to know characteristic of asphalt concrete mixture of type III which using charcoal <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell with vary number of blow. Scenarios of variation of number of blow were twice of 75, twice of 100, twice of 200, and twice of 250 of blows. Scenarious of variation <b>of</b> charcoal <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell content were 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 % and 8 %. Results of research showed that performance of stability, flow and durability of asphalt concrete mixture type III increase at using 2 % <b>of</b> charcoal <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell with twice of 75 of blows. The more number of blows at asphalt concrete mixture of type III, tend to increase MQ value of asphalt concrete mixture for both with or without charcoal <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell; which meant asphalt more stiff and tend to brittle, which it finally crash easily. The more number of blows and the higher percentage <b>of</b> charcoal <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> coconut shell in making specimen can decrease characteristic of durability of asphalt concrete...|$|R
500|$|January 8/9, 2010: Very light <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> snow seen in {{the eastern}} Jacksonville area. Light snow also fell in parts of central Florida, which briefly {{accumulated}} in Ocala {{and other parts of}} Marion County. A [...] "wintry mix" [...] of sleet and freezing rain was widespread, with reports of light snow across central Florida from Tampa to Orlando to Melbourne.

[...] Kiyonaga was the pre-eminent portraitist of beauties in the 1780s, and the tall, graceful beauties in his work had a great influence on Kitagawa Utamaro (–1806), who was to succeed him in fame. [...] Utamaro studied under Toriyama Sekien (1712–1788), who had trained in the Kanō school of painting. [...] Around 1782, Utamaro came to work for the publisher Tsutaya Jūzaburō.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape of}} the cap is {{initially}} convex before later becoming broadly convex to eventually flattened in maturity; {{the diameter of the}} cap is typically between [...] The cap surface is dry, with a velvet-like texture, although in age it can become rimose (developing a network of cracks and small crevices). The cap color is initially black to dark grayish brown; young specimens can have a whitish bloom (resembling a <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> fine powder) on the surface. Fruit bodies, especially young specimens, tend to be free of maggots and other insect larvae. As the mushroom matures, the bloom disappears and the color fades to become grayish to grayish brown. The cap flesh is whitish, but after it is cut or injured, it will stain pink to reddish gray, and eventually turn black.|$|E

500|$|The airline was {{established}} as Vestfoldfly by Øyvind Skaunfelt in 1961. He {{had been working}} at Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg, and offered to purchase the school and airplanes when Solberg retired. Two years earlier, Sandefjord Airport, Torp had opened a civilian sector and Skaunfelt decided to establish his company there. In May 1961, he received government permission for commercial flying. He started a newspaper route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and could also carry three passengers in his single-engined Cessna. The route continued onwards from Sandefjord to Tønsberg, Larvik and at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Vestfoldfly also started offering scenic trips and charter. During the summer, the airline also flew seaplanes south along the coast to Kragerø, Risør and Arendal. Other activities involved crop <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> forest for Felleskjøpet. The airline also provided a target service for the military. Four aircraft were permanently used to tow a target about [...] behind the aircraft, and military personnel would practice shooting at the target.|$|E
500|$|Generally speaking, {{the annual}} minimum {{temperature}} in Phoenix {{is in the}} mid-to-low 30s. It rarely drops to 32°F (0°C) or below, having done so in only seven of the years between 1995—2015 on a total of sixteen days. However, outlying portions of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area frequently see frost in the winter. The earliest freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred on March 31, 1987. The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix was [...] on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily high temperature ever recorded was [...] on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 23, 1979, to January 31, 1985. [...] Snow is a very rare occurrence {{for the city of}} Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and since then, accumulations of [...] or greater have occurred only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record dates to January 21–22, 1937, when [...] fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. The most recent significant snowfall occurred on December 6, 1998, across the northwest portions of the greater metro area. During the 1998 event, Sky Harbor reported a <b>dusting</b> <b>of</b> snow. On December 30, 2010 and February 20, 2013, graupel fell across much of the city; although, it was widely believed to be snow.|$|E
2500|$|Cyberskin is a {{synthetic}} material that {{feels more like}} human skin. It is a porous material and cannot be sterilized.

He also remarks that [...] "you {{get the impression}} that they would be happier making R". In conclusion, however, he states that [...] "the album's strike rate is far higher than you might expect from a manufactured pop act's fourth album; it avoids the obvious pitfalls and its highpoints are genuinely high", giving the album 3 out of 5 stars.|$|E
