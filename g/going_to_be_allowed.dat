Notwithstanding Indonesian {{public opinion in}} the 1990s occasionally showing begrudging appreciation of the Timorese position, it was widely feared that an independent East Timor would destabilise Indonesian unity. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, however, caused tremendous upheaval in Indonesia and led to Suharto's resignation in May 1998, ending his thirty-year presidency. Prabowo, by then {{in command of the}} powerful Indonesian Strategic Reserve, went into exile in Jordan and military operations in East Timor were costing the bankrupt Indonesian government a million dollars a day. The subsequent [...] "reformasi" [...] period of relative political openness and transition, included unprecedented debate about Indonesia's relationship with East Timor.|$|E

500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream.

After {{she goes to}} sleep, she wakes up and has lost three decades of her life. Woodburne told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison that Susan believes the year is 1972 and the night before was her sixteenth birthday, where she drank too much champagne. She does not recognise her house and thinks she passed out and ended up somewhere else. Susan's family {{take her to the}} hospital, where she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Karl becomes determined to tell her the truth about her condition, while her nephew, Darcy (Mark Raffety), insists they treat her [...] "with kid gloves." [...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up in the bathroom and she sees herself in the mirror {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman staring back at her.|$|E

On 26 June 1949, Kim Gu was assassinated by Ahn Doo-hee, who confessed that he assassinated Kim Gu by the order of Kim Chang-ryong.

40|$|Hybrid {{power plants}} offer the {{advantage}} of highly efficient power generation. The DLR Institute of Technical Thermodynamics {{is part of a}} research partnership developing a hybrid power plant. The project is divided into 3 phases lasting until 2012. The first phase focuses on modelling the components of the power plant. A model library for MATLAB Simulink containing several fuel cell models as well as balance of plant components has been developed. Utilizing these models the control system of the hybrid power plant can be designed and tested before the plant <b>is</b> built. <b>To</b> enable the control model to fit the needs of a real hybrid power plant high descriptive quality of the component models is required. Therefore the SOFC generator models are validated in house. DLR-TT has many years of experience in testing single cells as well as short stacks in SOFC as well as in PEMFC. For this project, a Siemens SFC- 5 system has been installed in Stuttgart. This system enables DLR to verify tubular SOFC models. In addition a new test rig <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built <b>allowing</b> measuring pressurized planar SOFC. Test results from both experimental set ups will <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> validate the models. The presentation focuses on the modelling performed so far in the project. A locally resolved fuel cell model will be presented. The model features air inlet tube and the fuel cell, both interacting with each other resulting in a 1 + 1 D model. Radiation heat transfer as well as convective heat transfer and heat conduction is included in the models. The fuel cell model is based on a Nernst approach. Open circuit voltage as well as over potentials are calculated depending on the local gas composition and temperatures...|$|R

40|$|As {{the usage}} of mobile {{telephones}} increased {{at the end of}} the nineties, the development of Location based services (LBS) started. LBS in a cellular telephone network are a service provided to the subscriber based on its current geographic location. The position can be known by user entry or a GPS receiver that the person carries with him. Mobile network operators continuously seek new innovative ways to increase profits and to create differentiation. One of the best ways <b>to</b> do this <b>is</b> through the delivery of highly personalized services. One way to personalize mobile services is based on location. Location-based services open a new market for developers, cellular network operators, and service providers to develop and deploy value-added services. There are a numbers of location-based services on the market today. Positioning within the vehicle business, positioning of emergency calls and commercial services like shopping offers, when the user <b>is</b> close <b>to</b> a supermarket <b>are</b> examples of LBS. This thesis is the result of a project that was conducted at Followit in Skellefteå during spring 2005. One of Followit’s products is a small unit called locator. This unit consists of a GSM and a GPS module and is mainly used for surveillance. It has many area of usage, for example the user can place it in the car and if someone steals it, the user can get its position and catch the thieves. The aim of this thesis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> investigate what limitations Followit’s system has. The thesis presents a platform that simulates a real environment by generating position events. Using this platform it <b>is</b> possible <b>to</b> explore how many SMS objects Followit’s platform can handle. In addition the simulated platform can also be in use, for example if the user of the Followit’s system wants to test a position in an almost inaccessible ground: the platform just easily simulates the position. The platform can also be in help looking for bugs in the software. An interface in Followit's platform <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> implemented <b>allowing</b> it <b>to</b> communicate with the simulated platform. This interface <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> communicate with another platform in Spain, called the Redbox platform.
