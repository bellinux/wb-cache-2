5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the creature that attacked him.|$|E

While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf, whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them.|$|E

40|$|Mean Shift is a {{well-known}} clustering algorithm that has attractive properties {{such as the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> non convex and local clusters even in high dimensional spaces, while remaining relatively insensitive to outliers. However, due to its poor computational performance, real-world applications are limited. In this thesis, we propose a novel acceleration strategy for the traditional Mean Shift algorithm, along with a two-layers strategy, resulting in a considerable performance increase, while maintaining high cluster quality. We also show <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> clusters in a streaming environment with bounded memory, in which queries can be answered at interactive rates, and for which no Mean Shift-based algorithm currently exists. Our online structure can be updated at very minimal cost and as infrequently as possible, and we show <b>how</b> <b>to</b> detect the time at which this update needs to be performed.
