25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases <b>ignitability.</b> Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|E

5000|$|Characteristic Waste: These are wastes {{that are}} defined {{based on their}} {{specific}} characteristics of <b>ignitability,</b> corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. Federal statute 40CFR§261 regulates these wastes. Ignitable wastes are defined by their combustion capacity under conditions when they consist of waste oils and solvents. Corrosive wastes like battery acids are characterized by their pH value - acids (pH ≤ 2) and bases (pH ≥ 12.5). Reactive wastes include lithium-sulfur batteries and explosives that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, or gases and toxic wastes that are harmful to human health or environment when inhaled or ingested or disposed. Examples of toxic wastes include mercury and lead.|$|E

It includes household chemicals and other substances {{for which the}} owner no longer has a use, such as consumer products sold for home care, personal care, automotive care, pest control and other purposes. These products exhibit {{many of the same}} dangerous characteristics as fully regulated hazardous waste due to their potential for reactivity, <b>ignitability,</b> corrosivity, toxicity, or persistence. Examples include drain cleaners, oil paint, motor oil, antifreeze, fuel, poisons, pesticides, herbicides and rodenticides, fluorescent lamps, lamp ballasts, smoke detectors, medical waste, some types of cleaning chemicals, and consumer electronics (such as televisions, computers, and cell phones).|$|E
5000|$|Waste {{disposal}} {{also may}} be restricted conditionally by requiring that a waste be treated in a specific fashion before it may be disposed of at a particular location.

These rules restrict the land disposal (placement in landfills, primarily) of hazardous waste without prior approved programs. The [...] "disposal prohibition" [...] mandates that hazardous waste cannot be disposed on land until it is treated to meet specified characteristics (acceptable <b>ignitability,</b> corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity), or is treated by specified approved treatment methods. The [...] "dilution prohibition" [...] proscribes adding large amounts of water, soil, or non-hazardous waste {{in order to avoid}} specified treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{demand for}} natural gas is {{increasing}} since recent climate change. Natural gas is considered an abundant energy source with low greenhouse-gas emissions. A natural gas engine usually operates in lean-burn mode to gain the advantage of high thermal efficiency and low nitrogen oxides emission. A problem typically associated with natural gas combustion in lean mode is poor <b>ignitability.</b> The objective {{of this study is}} to improve <b>ignitability</b> of lean natural gas combustion using gas-jet ignition method. Several experiments were done using a confined volume chamber apparatus. Images of the combustion flame were captured using a high speed camera, and hydrocarbon emissions were measured. The result showed that the gas-jet ignition method is effective in improving <b>ignitability</b> of lean natural gas mixture. An addition of 30 % hydrogen gas to the natural gas fuel improves both the <b>ignitability</b> and further flame propagation, thus lowering the hydrocarbon emission...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of fuel property effects in internal combustion engines is required to enable fuel diversification as well as applications to advanced engines being developed for operation {{with a variety of}} combustion modes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of fuel <b>ignitability</b> and volatility over a wide range on premixed low-temperature combustion (LTC) modes in diesel engines. Twenty three fuels were prepared from commercial gasoline, kerosene, and diesel as baseline fuels and with the addition of additives, to generate a cetane number (CN) range from 11 to 75. Experiments with a single cylinder diesel engine operated in moderately-advanced-injection LTC modes were conducted to evaluate these fuels. The combustion phasing is demonstrated to be a good indicator to estimate the in-cylinder peak pressure, exhaust gas emissions, and thermal efficiency in the LTC mode. Fuel <b>ignitability</b> affects the combustion phasing by changing the ignition delay. The predicted cetane number (PCN) based on fuel molecular structure analysis can be fitted to the ignition delays with a higher coefficient of determination than CN, suggesting a good potential as a fuel <b>ignitability</b> measure over a wide range. The stable operating load range in the smokeless LTC mode depends more on the actual ignition delay or PCN rather than CN. With fixed injection timing and intake oxygen concentration, O_[2 in], only when PCN < 40, the load range can be expanded significantly to higher loads. With holding the combustion phasing at TDC and varying O_[2 in], the NOx and smoke emissions become limitations of the load expansion for some fuels. The effects of fuel volatility on the characteristics of LTC are small compared to <b>ignitability.</b> Finally, the operational injection timing range and robustness of the LTC to fuel <b>ignitability</b> are examined, showing that the advantageous <b>ignitability</b> range becomes narrower, with fuel <b>ignitability</b> decreasing...|$|E

The forest species selected: Pinus halepensis Mill., Quercus coccifera L., Pistacia lentiscus L., Arbutus unedo L., Cistus incanus L. and forest litter, are dominated in wildland/urban interface (WUI) regions in Mediterranean. The relationships of spontaneous with pilot ignition and <b>ignitability</b> with other flammability parameters (i. e., combustion duration), were investigated.

The possible errors in results were minimized using the very same external conditions. Both methods {{can be used to}} measure ignit-ability, although there is some systematic difference in the measured ignition times.

The <b>ignitability</b> tests were based on ignition delay time versus temperature measurements using five different forest species: Pin its halepensis, Pistacia lentiscus, Cupressus sempervirens, Olea europaea, Cistus incanus. These species are common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The ignition characteristics of the forest fuels examined were related to thermogravimetric analysis data. The DTG curves showed that the mass changes related to cellulose decomposition in the temperature range of 320 - 370 degreesC are greatly responsible for the ignition behavior of the species tested.

We investigated the thermal degradation of four species; DSC and TGA were used under air sweeping to record oxidative reactions in dynamic conditions. Heat released and mass loss are important data to be measured for wildland fires modelling purpose and fire hazard studies on ligno-cellulosic fuels. Around 638 K and 778 K, two dominating and overlapped exothermic peaks were recorded in DSC and individualized using a experimental and numerical separation. This stage allowed obtaining the enthalpy variation of each exothermic phenomenon.
