He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter <b>Easy</b> Date won the All American Futurity in 1974. <b>Easy</b> Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner.

To their left, mainly between the draws on the <b>Easy</b> Green / <b>Easy</b> Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Easy</b> {{developed}} on September1 from a trough {{in the western}} Caribbean, which persisted after Hurricane Baker moved through the region in late August. Moving northeastward, the hurricane crossed Cuba on September3 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. <b>Easy</b> turned to the northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane. At the time, <b>Easy</b> was located just off {{the west coast of}} Florida; however, a ridge to its north caused the hurricane to stall, execute a small loop, and make landfall near Cedar Key. Following the landfall, <b>Easy</b> moved offshore, turned to the southeast, and made a second landfall near Hernando Beach on September6. The hurricane turned northwestward over the Florida Peninsula, and gradually weakened as it moved into Georgia and the southeastern United States. On September9, <b>Easy</b> dissipated over northeastern Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Easy</b> was {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} storm, hurricane, and major hurricane of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season. The hurricane developed in the western Caribbean Sea on September 1, and tracked northeastward. After crossing Cuba, the hurricane rapidly strengthened in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to reach peak winds of 125mph (205km/h). <b>Easy</b> executed a cyclonic loop, moved northeastward to hit near Cedar Key, Florida, executed a second loop, and hit western Florida again. After rapidly weakening over Florida, the hurricane turned to the northwest, and ultimately dissipated over northeastern Arkansas on September 9. From the point when Hurricane <b>Easy</b> entered the Gulf of Mexico until it weakened to a tropical storm, it was observed nearly constantly from radars or Reconnaissance Aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the <b>Easy</b> Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an <b>Easy</b> Card or <b>Easy</b> Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the <b>Easy</b> Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of <b>Easy</b> Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on <b>Easy</b> Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash. Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|E
