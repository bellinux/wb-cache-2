500|$|The History of the Indies is a three-volume {{work begun}} in 1527 while Las Casas {{was in the}} Convent of Puerto de Plata. It found its final form in 1561, {{when he was working}} in the Colegio de San Gregorio. Originally planned as a six-volume work, each volume {{describes}} a decade {{of the history of the}} Indies from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 to 1520, and most of it is an eye-witness account. It was in the History of the Indies that Las Casas finally regretted his advocacy for African slavery, and included a sincere apology, writing, [...] "I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery... and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God." [...] (Vol II, p.257) ...|$|E
500|$|Mahalia Jackson's 1947 version {{received}} significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew {{throughout the}} 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public {{events such as}} concerts at Carnegie Hall. Author James Basker states that the song has been employed by African Americans as the [...] "paradigmatic Negro spiritual" [...] because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries. Anthony Heilbut, author of The Gospel Sound, states that the [...] "dangers, toils, and snares" [...] of Newton's words are a [...] "universal testimony" [...] of the African American experience. During the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it [...] "to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> the magic worked outside the church walls... {{in the open air}} of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances." [...] Folk singer Judy Collins, who knew the song before she could remember learning it, witnessed Fannie Lou Hamer leading marchers in Mississippi in 1964, singing [...] "Amazing Grace". Collins also considered it a [...] of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators. According to fellow folk singer Joan Baez, {{it was one of the}} most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had [...] "developed a life of its own". It even made an appearance at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969 during Arlo Guthrie's performance.|$|E
