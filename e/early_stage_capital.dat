40|$|The UK {{boasts the}} largest private equity market in Europe, {{investing}} £ 12 billion in 2007. However there are concerns about the diminishing volume of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> investment, including seed and start-up. These concerns have prompted successive governments to respond with various initiatives to address the so-called ‘equity gap’. This report seeks to provide answers to the following questions: • Has the supply of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> increased during the recent investment upswing? • Who are the main providers of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital?</b> • How significant are government interventions in increasing the supply of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital?</b> The report draws on two sources of statistics – the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) annual report on investment activity and the Library House database of investments – to bring an original perspective on {{the changing nature of}} the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> market. It does so by reworking some of the BVCA’s published statistics and by combining the BVCA’s statistics on investment activity with Library House’s database. These sources enable us to present a series of perspectives on different ‘slices’ of the market...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> {{investments}} declined sharply {{following the}} post- 2000 technology crash. Investment activity began to pick-up by mid-decade, {{in large measure}} {{as a result of}} increased public sector involvement, but has been brought to a halt by the global financial crisis. At the regional scale, several northern regions now have more than their expected share of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> investment. However, deal sizes are small, hence <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital,</b> measured by the total amount invested, remains over-concentrated in London and the south-east. Moreover, the public sector now dominates much of the investment activity in the midlands and north. The paper argues that public sector venture capital is unable to create entrepreneurial regions and that a regionally-based model of public sector venture capital is ineffective because it lacks scale. A new approach for venture capital-deficient regions is therefore required which gives greater emphasis to the demand-side...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the role of}} financial development in producing innovative products and services. The Venture Capitalists (VCs) {{plays a crucial role}} for the realization of product innovation and service innovation. Especially young entrepreneurs face the problem of financial constraints if starting their business and risk capital often is the only option for financing innovative projects. However, the level of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> (VC) investments across European countries differs profoundly. Here a panel analysis is employed to identify if technical and innovative opportunities as well as the entrepreneurial environment influence <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> investments. In addition the role of the financial system to generate or attract <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> VC is emphasized. The empirical analysis covers 15 European countries for the period from 1995 to 2005. The results show that technical and innovation opportunities and the entrepreneurial environment influence the level of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> risk <b>capital.</b> With respect to the financial system the analysis reveals that a bank based system has a negative impact on the relative amount of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> VC investments while a market based system generates risk capital for young entrepreneurs. Venture capital and debt provided by banks is found not to be complements but rather substitutes. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the relative underdevelopment of high tech {{industries in the}} Eurozone compared to high tech industries in the US. Based on a review of previous studies this study identifies a paradox, in which limited acquisition of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> hinders the growth of New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs) in the Eurozone, and in which underdevelopment of NTBFs results in the lagging development of high tech industries in the Eurozone. Further exploration of this paradox shows that it comprises an industry as well a firm level dimension, namely the market dynamics of HHTIs in the Eurozone and the willingness by NTBFs to accept <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> in the Eurozone. The study of these two dimensions leads {{to a discussion of}} technology-push versus demand-pull. The results show that ‘well developed’ industries in terms of relatively high R&D intensities go along with relatively more demand-pull in <b>early</b> <b>stages</b> of the development process of NTBFs. In addition this study relates a smaller willingness by NTBFs to accept <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> to the presence of relatively less tech technology-push at later stage in development process of NTBFs. A possible solution for escaping this paradox in the Eurozone should simultaneously address both elements, because as this study shows ‘technology-push’ cannot exist without ‘demand-pull’...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the impact of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> on innovation activities of Swiss start-ups.

The results support neither the hypothesis of {{a positive impact on}} initial innovation activities nor the hypothesis of a positive time-persistent effect on innovation performance of start-ups...|$|R

After a general overview of {{the function of the}} financial structure as well as financial development in realizing product and service innovations, this work examines a financial intermediary which is particularly specialized to finance high-tech innovations - the venture capitalist (VC). We employ a panel analysis to illustrate whether technical opportunities, taxes, stock market development, relative size of the banking sector, GDP growth and laterstage venture <b>capital</b> influence <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> investments. The empirical analysis was conducted in 15 European countries and looked at the period from 1995 to 2005. The results show that technical opportunities, size of the stock market and banking sector, interest rate growth and the amount of later-stage venture capital have a significant positive and corporate tax rate a negative impact on the amount of early s tage risk capital. The structure of the national financial system seems not to have a significant influence. <b>Early</b> <b>Stage</b> Venture <b>Capital,</b> Risk Capital, Financial System, Financing Innovations...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} small firms to access finance is {{hindered}} by persistent market failure, which creates funding gaps for new businesses, particularly in technology sectors, seeking {{small amounts of}} finance. This has prompted various forms of public sector intervention to increase the supply of both debt and risk finance. For the past decade (longer in the UK) both the EU and its member states have increasingly focused on the informal venture capital market {{as a means of}} increasing the supply of <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital.</b> This article describes the changing nature of the forms of intervention and provides a critical review of their effectiveness. The lack of data on angel investing means that there is very little evidence on the impact of these forms of intervention. The article advocates that governments should invest in appropriate methodologies which can accurately measure investment trends in the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> venture <b>capital</b> market, and specifically angel investment activity, so that the need for public sector intervention can be demonstrated and the impact of such interventions can be measured...|$|R
