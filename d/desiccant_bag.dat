40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{subjected}} the CSE SR-lOO self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) {{approved by}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{to a series of}} laboratory treatments designed to simulate various environmental conditions in underground coal mines. The tests were designed to predict the ability of the self-rescuers to withstand those environmental stresses without causing a decrease in wearer protection. The apparatus were heated to 710 C for 48 h, cooled to - 450 C for 16 h, vibrated for 9 h, and dropped 1 m on each axis. A critical concern was internal damage to an apparatus, without any obvious external signs, that would cause it to malfunction or seriously degrade its performance. Carbon dioxide (C 02) levels in apparatus with combined treatments were higher than in apparatus with individual treatments and untreated apparatus. The higher levels remained within safe limits, however. None of the treatments caused venting of the small oxygen cylinder that provides starter oxygen. Some bottles were found to be empty because of manufacturing defects in the burst disks. This problem was corrected in later models. The heat treatments did make the case ends more difficult to remove and the breathing bag sticky and subsequently more difficult to unfold. An apparatus that was dropped and vibrated had a broken <b>desiccant</b> <b>bag</b> that released some of its contents which compromised the seal of the relief valve. The case was dented from the drops. As with the first-generation self-rescuers, if there is visible damage to the case of the apparatus, the apparatus should be considered to be internally damaged and must be removed from service...|$|E
50|$|Film of {{the launch}} {{revealed}} {{a series of}} unexplained light flashes {{in the first stage}} exhaust plume, but telemetry data failed to indicate anything that could have caused them. Subsequent review of previous Gemini launches as well as film of Titan II ICBM tests also showed the presence of these light flashes. This phenomenon was thought to be caused by duct tape securing <b>desiccant</b> <b>bags</b> to the turbine exhaust pipe.|$|R
50|$|On 28 May 2012, {{shortly before}} a {{take-off}} run from Doncaster Sheffield Airport on a practice flight, both port engines developed a fault {{and had to}} be shut down, closing the airport for 90 minutes. The cause was ingestion of silica gel <b>desiccant</b> <b>bags</b> into No. 1 engine, which failed and led to debris entering No. 2 engine. Although no structural damage occurred, both engines were written off, requiring replacement from the Trust's stock of new engines.|$|R
