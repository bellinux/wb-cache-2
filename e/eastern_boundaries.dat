5|$|Shoshone National Forest borders Yellowstone National Park and Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The Continental Divide demarks the {{boundary}} between Shoshone and Bridger-Teton National Forests. Along the Montana border, Shoshone National Forest borders Custer National Forest to the north. Private property, property belonging {{to the state of}} Wyoming and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management form the <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Lastly, the Wind River Indian Reservation also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District.|$|E
5|$|Waterways in Tameside {{include the}} rivers Medlock and Etherow, which form parts of Tameside's western and <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> respectively, and the River Tame crosses the borough north to south, giving Tameside its name. The Ashton Canal, the Hollinwood Branch Canal, the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, and the Peak Forest Canal all {{run through the}} borough. There are also several reservoirs, {{including}} the Audenshaw Reservoirs. Greenspace accounts for 63.5% of the Tameside's total area, domestic buildings and gardens comprise 17.4%, {{and the rest is}} made up of roads and non-domestic buildings.|$|E
25|$|Starting at the Old State House, {{the road}} crossed the Connecticut River {{over the area}} that is now {{occupied}} by the Founders Bridge, initially by ferry and later by bridge. It is notable that until 1783, Hartford's <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> included present-day East Hartford and Manchester.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> {{currents}} {{are relatively}} shallow, broad and slow-flowing. They are {{found on the}} eastern side of oceanic basins (adjacent to the western coasts of continents). Subtropical <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> currents flow equatorward, transporting cold water from higher latitudes to lower latitudes; examples include the Benguela Current, the Canary Current, the Humboldt Current, and the California Current. Coastal upwelling often brings nutrient-rich water into <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> current regions, making them productive areas of the ocean.|$|R
50|$|Early maps {{show the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> of the {{district}} being the Murrumbidgee River, while an 1871 map shows the <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> being the Goodradigbee River, with the Monaro district in the area between the Goodradigbee and the Murrumbidgee.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the seasonal {{cycle of the}} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> contributions. The cycle has a magnitude of 6 Sv, {{as measured by the}} RAPID/MOCHA/WBTS project array at 26 °N, which is driven largely by the <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary.</b> The <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> variations are explored {{in the context of the}} regional circulation around the Canary Islands. There is a 3 month lag between maximum wind forcing and the largest <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary</b> transports, which is explained in terms of a model for Rossby wave generated at the <b>eastern</b> <b>boundary.</b> Two dynamic processes take place through the Lanzarote Passage (LP) in fall: the recirculation of the Canary Current and the northward flow of the Intermediate Poleward Undercurrent. In contrast, during the remaining seasons the transport through the LP is southward due to the Canary Upwelling Current. These processes are linked to the seasonal cycle of the AMOC...|$|R
25|$|The ideal type of guano {{is found}} in {{exceptionally}} s, as rainwater volatilizes and leaches nitrogen-containing ammonia from guano. In order to support large colonies of marine birds and the fish they feed on, these islands must be adjacent to regions of intense marine upwelling, such as those along the <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is part of}} the Serengeti {{ecosystem}} and, to the northwest, adjoins the SNP and is contiguous {{with the}} southern Serengeti plains. These plains also extend to the north into the unprotected Loliondo division and are kept open to wildlife through transhumance pastoralism practiced by the Maasai. The south and west of the area are volcanic highlands, including the famous Ngorongoro Crater and the lesser known Empakaa Crateri. The southern and <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> are approximately defined by the rim of the East African Rift wall, which also prevents animal migration in these directions.|$|E
25|$|The Province of Massachusetts Bay {{was formed}} in 1691–92 by the British monarchs William III and Mary II. It {{included}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, the Province of Maine (including the eastern territories that {{had been part of}} Province of New York), and Nova Scotia (which included present-day New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island). Dukes County, Massachusetts (Martha's Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands) and Nantucket were also transferred from the Province of New York. In 1696, Nova Scotia was restored to France (who called it Acadia), but the northern and <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> of Maine would not be fixed until the 1840s.|$|E

25|$|The {{religion}} Zoroastrianism {{is believed}} {{by some to}} have originated {{in what is now}} Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region {{around the time of the}} rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria within its <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries.</b> An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.|$|E
25|$|High Tove covers {{around one}} and a half miles of the north-south ridge, which is {{approximately}} a mile in width. It is bounded on the west by Watendlath Gill and its main feeder, Blea Tarn Gill. These flow to Watendlath Tarn, a popular beauty spot. The tarn is available for private fishing, being well stocked with trout. It holds a wide selection of flora, including water lilies and is at least 50ft deep. Fisher and Launchy Gills provide the <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> of High Tove, flowing north and south around Armboth Fell respectively. Both are feeders of Thirlmere.|$|E
25|$|The {{western and}} <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{of the city}} are marked by two burns that are tributaries of the River Tay. On the western-most {{boundary}} of the city, the Lochee burn meets the Fowlis burn, forming the Invergowrie burn, which meets the Tay at Invergowrie basin. The Dighty Water enters Dundee {{from the village of}} Strathmartine and marks the boundaries of a number of northern districts of the city, joining the Tay between Barnhill and Monifieth. The Scouring burn in the west end of the city and Dens Burn in the east, both of which played important roles in the industrial development of the city, have now been culverted over.|$|E

25|$|The {{colony of}} South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> set at 132° and 141° East of Greenwich, {{and to the}} north at {{latitude}} 26° South. The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 (Nicolas Baudin's priority being ignored). The northern boundary was set at the parallel of latitude 26° South by the British Parliament because that {{was considered to be}} the limit of effective control of territory that could be exercised by a settlement founded on the shores of Gulf St Vincent; the South Australian Company had proposed the parallel of 20° South, later reduced to the Tropic of Capricorn (the parallel of latitude 23° 37′ South).|$|E
25|$|After Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet partisans also {{developed}} and became militarily {{active in the}} General Government and, often aligned with the Polish leftist Armia Ludowa, posed a significant threat {{to the authority of}} the AK, which had not adopted a policy of more direct and widespread confrontations with the Nazis until 1943. The Soviet partisans were especially prevalent in Belarus and elsewhere in Kresy. The presence of the various partisan formations, including also the Jewish, National Armed Forces, Bataliony Chłopskie (some right-, some left-wing), and of criminal armed bands preying on local populations, led to armed clashes and a climate of uncertainty, just as the Soviet armies, having established their superiority on the Eastern Front, were about to approach Poland's prewar <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|E
25|$|The people shared similar {{culture with}} other Indo-Iranians. The ancient {{religion}} of Kafiristan survived here until the 19th century.

25|$|Israel {{is roughly}} equal {{in size to}} the state of New Jersey and is bordered by Lebanon and Syria to the north/north east, the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the deserts leading to the border with Egypt to the south west, the Jordan River and Dead Sea region along with the border to Jordan {{comprise}} the country's <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Vines are grown throughout the country ranging from the mountain ranges along the Lebanon, Syria borders down to Beersheba and Arad in the south. Small plantings are also found on the Mizpe Ramon plateau and at Neot Smadar in the desert north of Eilat. The vast majority of Israeli winemaking takes place in the more temperate northern climate: Galilee, Sharon Plain, Samson, Golan Heights, and the Judean foothills in the West Bank.|$|E
500|$|Flixton ward's {{southern}} boundary {{is formed}} by the River Mersey, opposite the neighbouring ward of Bucklow St Martins. [...] With {{the creation of the}} Manchester Ship Canal, which roughly followed the former path of the River Irwell, the township's western boundary with Irlam was adopted in 1896. [...] Today, the ward's western boundary lies further east, running south through farmland near Woodsend Circle. [...] Flixton's north and <b>eastern</b> <b>boundaries</b> are formed by Moorside Road and the area slightly east of Chassen Road railway station.
