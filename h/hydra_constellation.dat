5|$|Gliese 3634 (Often {{shortened}} to GJ 3634) is a {{red dwarf}} star in the <b>Hydra</b> <b>constellation.</b> One planet has been discovered in its orbit, Gliese 3634 b. GJ 3634 is under half the mass {{and size of the}} Sun, and is estimated to be at least a billion years younger, and lies near to Earth, with a distance of 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years). It was targeted by astronomers during an over six-year survey of red dwarfs. The astronomers had recently changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits so they could narrow down candidates that transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from the Earth. The Super-Earth GJ 3634 b was the first planet discovered using this new strategy. The planet was confirmed using Doppler spectroscopy, or the observation and extrapolation of data from a recorded Doppler effect in the star's light, but later observations found no transiting pattern. The planet was published by its discoverers on February 8, 2011.|$|E
500|$|WASP-15 is an F-type star {{located in}} the <b>Hydra</b> <b>constellation.</b> It is located {{approximately}} 308 parsecs (1,004 light years) from Earth and has an apparent magnitude of 10.9, making it invisible to the unaided eye. The star is 1.18 times more massive than the Sun, and has a radius that is 1.477 times larger {{than that of the}} Sun, making it more diffuse. WASP-15 has an effective temperature of 6300 K, and is thus hotter than the Sun, although at 3.9 billion years, it is also younger. WASP-15 has a metallicity of [...] of -0.17, which means that it has 68% of the iron found in the Sun.|$|E
500|$|GJ 3634 is an M-type red dwarf, a cool, {{small and}} dim star that shines with reddish light. It {{lies in the}} <b>Hydra</b> <b>constellation.</b> The star is 45% {{the mass of the}} Sun, and is 43% the Sun's size. GJ 3634, {{described}} by its discoverers as an [...] "intermediately active star," [...] has a luminosity of 0.02, meaning that it releases about 2% of the energy that the Sun radiates. The star is relatively metal-poor; with a metallicity of [...] -0.10, GJ 3634 has 79% the amount of iron that has been measured in the Sun. The star is younger than the Sun, with an estimated age of at most three billion years.|$|E
50|$|The dark flow was {{determined}} to be flowing {{in the direction of the}} Centaurus and <b>Hydra</b> <b>constellations.</b> This corresponds with the direction of the Great Attractor, which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the Norma Cluster, located about 250 million light-years away from the Milky Way.|$|R

It is radiating 58 times as much luminosity as the Sun. The star is now approaching the end of its life, and has expanded its outer envelope to become a red giant star.|$|E
50|$|NGC 5078 is {{a spiral}} galaxy in the <b>Hydra</b> <b>constellation,</b> {{approximately}} 94 million light-years away from Earth.

The dust lane of NGC 5078 is warped, probably by interaction with the nearby galaxy IC 879, which is itself distorted into an 'S' shape by the interaction. At the presumed distance the two galaxies would have a minimal separation of about 61,000 light-years. For comparison, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years from the Milky Way.|$|E
