40|$|Background: Launch {{of remote}} <b>follow-up</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe is {{currently}} underway. However, there is insufficient understanding of postimplant practices {{with respect to}} device follow-up, reprogramming of device features, and postshock clinic visits. Methods: We analyzed device-stored data from patients implanted with biventricular defibrillators (CRT-ICD) to characterize the management of patients in current clinical practice and {{the potential impact of}} remote <b>follow-up</b> <b>systems.</b> Results: Two hundred and seventeen patients were identified, all with complete device-data for at least one year. Over a follow-up period of 570 ± 158 days, 1, 959 device interrogations were performed. Of these, the majority (1, 280, 65 %) involved the reprogramming of device parameters. The mean time in-terval between interrogations was 70 ± 25 days. Overall, a marked reduction of interrogations requiring reprogramming was observed between {{the first six months of}} follow-up and subsequent periods (from 3. 6 ± 1. 8 to 1. 1 ± 1. 0 interrogations/six months). A mean of 6. 0 ± 5. 9 device parameters was reprogrammed during the first six months of follow-up, versus 4. 4 ± 5. 6 (P = 0. 000) during the subsequent period. From multivariate analysis, a higher-than-median number of interrogations was found to be significantly associ-ated with defibrillator shocks (OR: 2. 51; 95 %CI: 1. 42 – 4. 42).

40|$|Background: It was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to compare the {{repeatability}} of Spectralis optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal thickness measurements in healthy subjects and diabetic patients with clinically significant macular edema (CSME) with or without the use of the <b>follow-up</b> <b>system.</b> Methods: Thirty-eight eyes of 38 healthy subjects (control group) and 68 eyes of 68 diabetic patients with CSME were included in the study. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intrasession coefficients of variation were tested with 20 x 15 degree raster scans consisting of 19 high-resolution line scans (15 frames per scan) that were repeated 3 times by 1 experienced examiner. The first scan was set as the reference scan, whereas the second and third scans were the follow-up scans and were performed with and without the use of the follow-up mode, respectively. Results: The {{means and standard deviations for}} the central foveal subfield (CSF) in healthy subjects and diabetic patients were 289 +/- 21 and 402 +/- 105 mu m, respectively. Particularly in diabetic patients, examining the CSF, CR was 2. 67 % (10. 73 mu m) and 6. 73 % (27. 01 mu m) with and without using the follow-up mode, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: These results support the hypothesis that the <b>follow-up</b> <b>system</b> improves the repeatability either in healthy subjects or in diabetic patients with poor fixation. The wider improvement in repeatability in diabetic patients in the <b>follow-up</b> <b>system</b> group compared to the no <b>follow-up</b> <b>system</b> group are probably related to poor patient fixation or eye movement in patients with CSME.
