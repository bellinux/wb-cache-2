50|$|<b>Holoplankton</b> have unique {{traits that}} make {{reproduction}} {{in the water}} column possible. Both sexual and asexual reproduction are used {{depending on the type of}} plankton. Some invertebrate <b>holoplankton</b> release sperm into the water column which are then taken up by the females for fertilization. Other species release both sperm and egg to increase the likelihood of fertilization. Environmental, mechanical, or chemical cues can all trigger this release.|$|E
5000|$|Zooplankton {{have adapted}} by {{developing}} transparent bodies, bright colors, bad tastes and cyclomorphosis (seasonal changes in body shape). When predators release a chemical {{in the water}} to signal zooplankton; cyclomorphosis allows <b>holoplankton</b> to increase their spines and protective shields. Studies have shown that although small in size certain gelatinous zooplankton are rich in protein and lipid. [...] "Many <b>holoplankton</b> seem to have very little visible defense mechanisms; therefore, it is hypothesized that a chemical defense may be possible. Pelagic cnidarians have nematocysts that eject a tightly coiled venomous thread very rapidly. These threads penetrate the surface of their target and release a venom.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{plankton}}, <b>holoplankton</b> {{spend their}} entire life cycle as plankton (e.g. most algae, copepods, salps, and some jellyfish). By contrast, meroplankton are only planktic {{for part of}} their lives (usually the larval stage), and then graduate to either a nektic (swimming) or benthic (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine worms, and most fish.|$|E
50|$|Minute {{pelagic species}} in the phyla Foraminifera and Radiolaria also produce ornate {{calcareous}} skeletons. Many benthic mollusks have planktonic larvae called veligers that have calcareous shells, and these larvae are particularly vulnerable to changes in water chemistry; their shells are so thin that small changes in pH can have a large impact {{on their ability to}} survive. Some <b>holoplankton</b> (organisms that are planktonic for their full lives) have calcareous skeletons as well, and are even more susceptible to unfavorable shell deposition conditions, since they spend their entire lives in the water column.|$|E
40|$|The benthic {{metazoan}} fauna at Station CS 2 in the Celtic Sea has {{the familiar}} bimodal pattern of species size distribution, with a meiofaunal mode at 0. 63 µg dry weight, a macrofauna mode at 2. 03 mg and the trough between them at 60 µg. The pelagic community, {{on the other}} hand, has its centre of distribution corresponding with {{the position of the}} benthic trough. Differences in taxonomic composition cannot explain this pattern since within a single taxon, as exemplified by the Copepoda, there are marked size differences between the benthic and planktonic assemblage. Of the possible mechanisms of benthic/pelagic coupling which might influence species size distributions, interactions between macrobenthic larvae and <b>holoplankton</b> and the influence of the pelagic community {{on the nature of the}} benthic food supply are considered potentially important. Planktotrophic larvae of benthic macrofauna avoid competition with similarly sized meiobenthic organisms but settle when they reach the size of the <b>holoplankton.</b> Thus resource partitioning on a size basis between these larvae and the <b>holoplankton</b> may occur. Benthic communities enriched with non-phytoplankton organic material show size convergence of meiofauna and macrofauna, their species size distribution being similar to that of pelagic communities This may result from a relaxation of benthic/pelagic interaction...|$|E
40|$|Nine Asian copepod {{species have}} been {{introduced}} into the Northeast Pacific, seven of which are largely confined to the San Francisco estuary. However, several of these copepods recently invaded the Columbia–Snake River system in Washington state, USA. In addition to the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus inopinus, {{which appeared in the}} 1980 s, the Columbia River now has populations of the calanoids Pseudodiaptomus forbesi and Sinocalanus doerrii, and the cyclopoid copepod Limnoithona tetraspina. Sampling in the Columbia–Snake River system in 2005 and 2006 indicated that (i) newer invaders may have displaced the previously introduced P. inopinus; (ii) P. forbesi had moved upstream into the first five reservoirs in the system; (iii) the other species occurred only in the tidal regions of the lower river; (iv) P. forbesi dominates the late summer <b>holoplankton</b> in the lower river and estuary; and (v) P. forbesi is relatively rare, and the <b>holoplankton</b> is dominated by native species in upstream free-flowing segments of the Columbia River and in reservoirs of the Snake River. Zooplankton samples from ships in Puget Sound suggest that ballast water from California is a major source of the introduced copepods and that the Columbia River itself may be a new source of ballast-introduced copepods...|$|E
40|$|Surprising genetic {{diversity}} {{has been discovered}} in marine <b>holoplankton,</b> organisms that "drift" in water currents throughout their life cycle. This discovery challenges our assumptions and suggests that <b>holoplankton</b> species may have limited dispersal and/or have adapted to small-scale oceanographic features. In this study, I investigated population genetics of Acartia tonsa, a holoplanktonic estuarine copepod containing deeply-diverged mitochondrial lineages, on the United States Atlantic coast. The study goals include: 1) assessing its cryptic species/{{genetic diversity}}; 2) inferring evolutionary and geographic origins of its cryptic lineages; 3) testing environmental associations of cryptic lineages; 4) inferring evolutionary and ecological processes/mechanisms underlying population diversification of A. tonsa. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from two gene loci, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nITS), resolved five morphologically cryptic, genetically diverged lineages that were reproductively isolated species based on genealogical concordance principle. Three co-distributed, deeply-diverged mtCOI lineages (X, S, F) showed significant population differentiation within lineages and contrasting phylogeographic patterns among lineages. Population structures and isolation by distance patterns detected for all lineages suggested that dispersal of Acartia lineages {{was more or less}} limited to adjacent estuaries; geographic isolation was a key mechanism underlying population diversification of A. tonsa. The highly diversified, relatively recent lineage F demonstrated a southern center of origin in Florida with northward stepwise diversification. Its distinct localized population structure and strong association with low-salinity environments suggested that environmental stressors (such as salinity) could act as physiological barriers to gene flow, facilitating diversification of Acartia populations. Co-existing Acartia lineages were parapatrically distributed along the estuarine gradient across systems on the US Atlantic coast. Genetic, morphological and ecological evidence indicated niche partitioning and ecological differentiation of A. tonsa within estuaries. Multiple factors {{may have contributed to the}} observed parapatric distribution and niche partitioning, including selection by salinity, biological competition, and/or local adaptation. These findings in one of the best known estuarine copepods reinforce the general conclusion that marine biodiversity is substantially underestimated, not only in terms of species numbers, but also with respect to niche partitioning and the potential importance of ecological divergence in marine <b>holoplankton...</b>|$|E

40|$|Synopsis Although {{a number}} of recent studies of marine <b>holoplankton</b> have {{reported}} significant genetic structure among populations, little is currently known about the biological and oceanographic processes that influence population con-nectivity in oceanic plankton. In order to examine how depth preferences influence dispersal in oceanic plankton, I characterized the genetic structure of a copepod with diel vertical migration (DVM) (Pleuromamma xiphias), through-out its global distribution, and compared these results to those expected given the interaction of this species ’ habitat depth with ocean circulation and bathymetry. Mitochondrial COI sequences from 651 individuals from 28 sites in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans revealed highly significant genetic differentiation both within and among ocean basins. Limited dispersal among distinct pelagic provinces seems to have {{played a major role in}} population differentiation in this species, with strong genetic breaks observed across known oceanographic fronts or current systems in all three ocean basins. The Indo-West Pacific (IWP) holds a highly distinct genetic population of this species that was sampled in both the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans. This suggests that the IWP does not act as a strong barrier to gene flow between basins, as expected, despite the relatively shallow water depth (5200 m) and vertically extensive (4400 m) diel migration of this species. A pattern of isolation by distance was observed in the Indian Ocean with genetic differentiation among samples down to spatial scales of 800 km, indicating that realized dispersal in P. xiphias occurs over much smaller spatial scales than in previously reported oceanic <b>holoplankton.</b> Given its highly regionalize...|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{analyses}} {{the micro}} and mesozooplankton in Ushuaia and Golondrina Bays, the first research on these plankton fractions {{of these areas}} in wintertime (August 2004). The number of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton taxa was higher in Ushuaia Bay than in Golondrina Bay. Aloricate ciliates predominated over tintinnids in microzooplankton and <b>holoplankton</b> over meroplankton in mesozooplankton in both bays. Ctenocalanus citer, Drepanopus forcipatus and Clausocalanus brevipes presented the highest frequency of occurrence. Among the meroplankton, Halicarcinus planatus and Munida gregaria were the most frequent decapod larvae in both bays.

Meroplankton, mainly bivalve and gastropod larvae, was dominant. <b>Holoplankton</b> was dominated by copepods, the main species being Oithona spp., Paracalanus parvus, Clausocalanus spp., Corycaeus spp., Acartia fossae and Undinula vulgaris. The results suggest a clear wind influence on the structure and horizontal distribution of the zooplankton communities. The metazooplankton appeared to be controlled mainly by food resources, suggesting a bottom-up control.

40|$|The Kenya {{coast is}} characterised by the half-year {{reversing}} Monsoon winds and by similarly alternating {{wet and dry}} seasons, which influence the marine and coastal environment and {{the flora and fauna}} therein. The geomorphology of the coastline comprising of creeks, bays and lagoons; and associated with various habitats of mangals, seagrass beds and coral influence the abundance, diversity and distribution of zooplankton (Chapter 1). Physico-chemical variations of the water are confined within narrow ranges except salinity, which is drastically reduced during the wet season. The hydrographical profile, climate and marine habitats of Kenya are presented in Chapter 2 including historical weather records of temperature, rainfall, humidity and evaporation. Research methodologies and material used are presented in Chapter 3. This study reports that zooplankton population off the Kenya coast is rich, comprising more than 300 taxa of commonly occurring <b>holoplankton</b> and meroplankton. The zooplankton abundance varies depending on the season and the prevailing coastal geomorphology. Gazi Bay (Chapter 4) has near pristine conditions due to its location far away from major industries. Mtwapa Creek (Chapter 7) on the contrary is exposed to constant anthropogenic influence it has however, high rates of flushing resulting to efficient water exchange with the open ocean. Mida Creek (Chapter 8) lacks rivers but has substantial groundwater discharge. During the wet season, Gazi Bay and Mtwapa Creek, which have river inlets recorded high zooplankton abundances of up to 2, 000 m' 3. Mida Creek recorded lower abundance of about 1, 000 m‘ 3 during the wet season, but during the dry season it increased to about 2, 800 m' 3. The most abundant <b>holoplankton,</b> which accounted for approximately 98 % of this category were Copepoda, Medusae, Chaetognatha, Appendicularia, Foraminifera, Siphonophora, Ostracoda and Cladocera. <b>Holoplankton</b> taxa were consistently abundant in Gazi Bay and the Mombasa Marine Park lagoon with densities ranging from about 500 to 800 m' 3. They were moderately abundant in Mtwapa Creek and Mida Creek with approximate densities of between 200 and 600 m' 3. They were often less than 200 m 3 in Makupa Creek (Chapters 5, 6). This creek is almost completely enclosed, has poor flushing rates and has been subjected to long term dumping of industrial and domestic wastes. Meroplankton was mainly represented by Gastropoda, Brachyura zoea, Caridea, Pisces eggs and larvae, Decapoda and Isopoda. These taxa constituted approximately 77 % of the entire meroplankton category in numbers. They were mostly abundant in Makupa Creek (Chapters 5, 6) where they often occurred in monthly densities of between 200 and 400 m' 3 and occasionally more than 2, 000 m'J. Copepoda, whose abundance constituted more that 70 percent of the population numerically dominated the zooplankton community. Acrocalanus, Oithona, Acartia, Pseudodiaptomus, Undinula, Corycaeus, Tortanus and Oncaea were the dominant genera and accounted for more than 90 % of the total copepod population. Sixteen species of the copepod family Candaciidae were found to occur off the Kenya coast and were most abundant (up to 360 in 100 m 3) in the shelf waters (Chapter 9). Candacia bradyi A. Scott, 1902; C. bipinnata Giesbrecht, 1889; C. curta (Dana, 1849), C. tuberculata Wolfenden, 1905 and C. ethiopica (Dana, 1849) were reported as new records for Kenya.

40|$|A {{total of}} 61 {{zooplankton}} taxa {{were found in}} the southwestern Caspian Sea between 1996 and 2010. Thirteen of them were meroplankton taxa and forty-eight were <b>holoplankton</b> taxa. The occurrence of 14 freshwater taxa indicated the influence of the Anzali wetland and river inflows. The decrease in zooplankton taxa was detected since 1996 - 1997 and continued till 2010. Pleopis polyphemoides, the only one out of the nine recorded Cladocera species in 1996 - 1997, was found after 2001. Similarly, of the five Copepoda species recorded in 1996 - 1997, only one, Acartia tonsa, was found abundant during the 2001 – 2010 sampling period. It was striking that many species which were abundant in the Caspian Sea in 1996 - 1997 were not found after 2000. Many reasons could have contributed to the changes in the zooplankton composition of the southern Caspian Sea, notably the serious environmental degradation since the early 1990 s. It is also possible that invasive species might play a role in wiping out some sensitive endemic species...|$|E
40|$|Zooplankton {{composition}} and the {{spatial and temporal}} abundance distribution of copepods were examined on the southern Atlantic coast of Morocco. In 1998, 31 stations during March and 30 stations during July were sampled on the continent shelf between Cape Blanc (21 ° O’N) and Cape Boujdor (26 ° 30 ’N). <b>Holoplankton</b> dominated the zooplankton assemblages. Copepods represented 86 % of the zooplankton in March and 73 % in July. Herbivorous species were {{the main components of}} the 78 identified copepod species (60 species in March and 49 in July). Four species were recorded {{for the first time in}} this area: Calanus hyperboreus, Scaphocalanus brevicornis, S. medius, and Heterocope saliens. Both zooplankton abundance and diversity were related to changes in ecological parameters resulting from upwelling currents. The uplift of cold water enriched superficial water layers with nutrients and induced strong primary production upon which zooplankton depend.

40|$|Abstract Salps {{have higher}} {{filtration}} rates {{than most other}} <b>holoplankton,</b> and are capable of packaging and exporting primary production from surface waters. A method of kinematic analysis was employed to accurately measure salp feeding rates. The data were then used to explain how diverse body morphologies and swimming motions among species and lifecycle stages influence salp feeding performance. We selected five species, representing a range of morphologies and swimming styles, and used digitized outlines from video frames to measure body-shape change during a pulse cycle. Time-varying body volume was then calculated from the digitized salp outlines to estimate the amount of fluid passing through the filtering mesh. This non-invasive method produced higher feeding rates than other methods and revealed that body volume, pulse frequency and degree of contraction are important factors for determining volume filtered. Each species possessed a unique combination of these three characteristics that resulted in comparable filtration (range: 0. 44 - 15. 33 ml s- 1) and normalized filtration rates (range: 0. 21 – 1. 27 s- 1) across species. The convergence of different species with diverse morphologies on similar normalized filtration suggests a tendency towards a flow optimum...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{long-term}} time series of North Sea plankton and sea surface temperature (SST) data {{reveal that the}} annual planktonic larval abundance of three benthic phyla, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, and Mollusca, responds positively and immediately to SST. Long-term outcomes for the planktonic abundance of these three phyla are different, however. The planktonic larvae of echinoderms and decapod crustaceans have increased in abundance from 1958 to 2005, and especially since the mid- 1980 s, as North Sea SST has increased. In contrast, the abundance of bivalve mollusc larvae has declined, despite the positive year-to-year relationship between temperature and bivalve larval abundance continuing to hold. We argue that the changes in meroplankton abundance, coincident with increased phytoplankton and declining <b>holoplankton,</b> reflect the synchronous effect of rising SST and related changes in the pelagic community on the reproduction and recruitment of many benthic marine invertebrates. Under this scenario, the long-term decline in bivalve mollusc larvae will reflect increased predation on the settled larvae and adults by benthic decapods. These alterations in the zooplankton may therefore describe an ecosystem-wide restructuring of North Sea trophic interactions. Ocean warming over short timescales can bring about comprehensive changes in benthic communities (Schiel e...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from the}} {{continuous}} plankton recorder (CPR) survey {{collected in the}} late- 1940 s to early- 1960 s indicated that the abundance of decapod larvae was low and the seasonal peak of abundance was late following cold winters. The phenological effect of temperature was shown {{to be consistent with}} relationships between both geographical and interannual patterns of variation. Analyses of CPR data collected from the 1940 s to the present day reveal large-scale long-term changes in the abundance and phenology of the North Sea meroplankton. Echinoderm larvae, whose peak abundance has advanced by 47 days, show the greatest shift in timing. Echinoderm larvae have also increased in abundance to become the most abundant taxon in North Sea CPR samples. Genetic and morphological analyses of CPR samples show that the variations in echinoderm larvae are mainly attributable to an increasing abundance and earlier occurrence of the larvae of a resident species, Echinocardium cordatum, rather than a change in species composition. The remarkable scale of the changes in abundance and phenology of the meroplankton, which are greater than those seen in the <b>holoplankton,</b> has stimulated the development of further research into the causes and effects of these changes...|$|E
40|$|Because {{there are}} few obvious {{dispersal}} barriers in the open ocean, pelagic organisms are typically expected to experience high connectivity over long distances. However, very little {{work has been done}} to understand gene flow in pelagic <b>holoplankton</b> on a global scale. In this study, I investigated genetic connectivity among populations of the mesopelagic copepod, Haloptilus longicornis, using both empirical and biophysical modeling approaches. Using the mitochondrial marker, cytochrome oxidase subunit II (mtCOII, 43 locations, N = 1059), highly significant genetic structure was detected among ocean basins (global FST = 0. 20; p > 0. 05 for all). In combination, these results suggest that the significant result for IBD in the basin-scale comparisons was driven by the equatorial genetic breaks observed in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the Atlantic Ocean, the equatorial genetic break was accompanied by low abundance of H. longicornis (0 - 12 oN), and pilot studies indicated that reproductive failure was high in this region. These results indicate that the equatorial region may be poor quality habitat for this species and serve as a biophysical dispersal barrier to migrants traveling among subtropical gyre habitats. In order to better understand contemporary dispersal patterns and the mechanism underlying this dispersal barrier in the Atlantic Ocean, I simulated particle dispersal for 30 years using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) model coupled with a particle-tracking scheme. Particle dispersal was simulated using physical forcing alone and in combination with increased mortality or decreased reproduction in the equatorial region, in order to determine whether a physical or a biophysical dispersal barrier exists in the equatorial Atlantic. Particle dispersal forced with physical oceanographic processes predicted that 26 % of particles originating in the southern gyre dispersed to the northern gyre over the 30 -year simulation, which is an unrealistically high rate of connectivity given the empirical genetic divergence observed among these populations. When conservative biological processes were imposed in the equatorial region, connectivity among populations in the northern and southern subtropical gyres ceased. These results suggest that the dispersal barrier across the equatorial region must be biophysical in nature, and that it likely prevents contemporary dispersal among subtropical gyre populations. Therefore, populations of H. longicornis in the subtropical gyres of the northern and southern Atlantic are demographically as well as genetically isolated, and may evolve independently in response to local selective pressures. This is the first study on marine <b>holoplankton</b> to compare biophysical modeling predictions with empirical genetic data in order to identify the mechanism underlying a pelagic dispersal barrier...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} of plankton mortality and extinction at various temporal and spatial scales induced by man-made pol-lution, or by natural causes (ageing, competition, predation, diseases, natural pollution). If mortalities take place at large scale they might become of environmental concern and may impact other biotic compartments including fisheries substan-tially. Such mortalities are a consistent phenomenon at time scales from geological mass extinctions to regularly occurring HABs, {{that appear to be}} increasing on a global basis. Several mass mortalities might have escaped our notice for their patchy and erratic occurrences. This also holds for mortalities caused by hydrothermal vents (HVs) that cover possibly more than 1. 5 % of the ocean floor. We studied zooplankton diversity, abundance and distribution patterns above shallow water hydrothermal vents at Kueishan Tao (Turtle Island), off the northeast coast of Taiwan (West Pacific). The HVs at this side provide an opportunity for the study of mortality, community and population effects of HV effluents with ecophysiological investigations that are otherwise difficult to perform at the more common HV environment, the deep sea. We found evidence for a bottle-neck situation for plankton above vent sites since <b>holoplankton</b> was generally deadly affected when immersed directly in vent plumes.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to detemine the abundance of zooplankton in Morella coastal waters during Southeast Monsoon. This research was conducted in August 2011. Plankton samples were collected from five stations, by NORPAC net that was vertically hauled from 10 meter depth up to the surface (except in Station 5, less than 10 m). The result showed that composition of zooplankton in Morella consisted of 43 taxa of zooplankton (33 taxa of <b>holoplankton</b> and 10 taxa of meroplankton). Total abundance of zooplankton was between 752 and 1050 ind/m 3 (average 890 ± 128 ind/m 3), which was dominated by Copepods (53. 70 %). The abundace of the Copepods was between 368 and 742 ind/m 3 (average 481 ± 153 ind/m 3). Copepods that typically found in coastal water may have higher tolerant on oceanographic factors than one that typically found in oceanic water. Sagitta enflata was identified as the most abundant, followed by Oncaea sp and Acrocalanus gibber.

40|$|Although <b>holoplankton</b> are ocean drifters {{and exhibit}} high {{dispersal}} potential, {{a number of}} studies on single species are finding highly divergent genetic clades. These cryptic species complexes are important to discover and describe, as identification of common marine species is fundamental to understanding ecosystem dynamics. Here we investigate the global diversity within Pleuromamma piseki and P. gracilis, two dominant members of the migratory zooplankton assemblage in subtropical and tropical waters worldwide. Using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (mtCOII) from 522 specimens collected across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, we discover twelve well-resolved genetically distinct clades in this species complex (Bayesian posterior probabilities > 0. 7; 6. 3 - 17 % genetic divergence between clades). The morphologically described species P. piseki and P. gracilis did not form monophyletic groups, rather they were distributed throughout the phylogeny and sometimes co-occurred within well-resolved clades: this result suggests that morphological characters currently used for taxonomic identification of P. gracilis and P. piseki may be inaccurate as indicators of species' boundaries. Cryptic clades within the species complex ranged from being common to rare, and from cosmopolitan to highly restricted in distribution across the global ocean. These novel lineages appear to be ecologically divergent, with distinct biogeographic distributions across varied pelagic habitats.

Time-series waterfall plots and spectral analysis revealed that emergence patterns observed at 265 – 420 kHz (frequencies that detect animals larger than mesozooplankton) followed combinations of diel and tidal rhythms that differed with both depth {{in the water column}} and season. The dominant emergent species at the study site, Neomysis americana, showed nocturnal emergence in summer. Toward the end of its emergence season in fall, however, its dominant rhythm shifted to semidiurnal (12. 4 -h period). The timing of major emergence in the fall coincided with low slack tides near the surface but with peak flood speed near the bottom, providing plausible mechanisms of retention and selective tidal stream transport within the estuary. Our results confirm earlier suggestions from net sampling that emergence in this species is best conceived as a broadening of the vertical spread of the population distribution rather than a migration of the bulk of the population far off the bottom: Most individuals spent most of their time near the bottom, even during emergence. Prior acoustic work that did not resolve the lowermost water column reported emergent mysids to overwhelm the <b>holoplankton</b> in biovolume, but it, too, seriously underestimated mysid abundance because i...|$|E
40|$|The world-wide {{research}} on ship-aided dispersal of marineorganisms and invasions of non-indigenous species focuses primarilyon the plankters, which show {{the greatest potential}} for invadingnew areas and establishing viable populations in them, eitherin the water column (<b>holoplankton)</b> or on the bottom (meroplanktoniclarvae of benthic species settling on the sea floor). As meiobenthicanimals usually lack a pelagic larval stage in their life cycle,no biological invasion study has, to our knowledge, ever specificallytargeted marine transport {{as a means of}} meiofaunal dispersal. Here we present a set of data showing that the sedimentdeposited in a ship's ballast water tank does support a viablemeiobenthic assemblage. We examined 0. 015 -dm 3 aliquotsof a 1 dm 3 sample from a c. 1. 5 -cm thick layerof sediment residue in the ballast tank of MS Donnington, broughtto the "Gryfia" Repair Shipyard in Szczecin (Poland). The sampleswere found to contain representatives of calcareous Foraminifera,hydrozoans, nematodes, turbellarians, harpacticoid copepods andtheir nauplii, and cladocerans, as well as meiobenthic-sizedbivalves and gastropods. Nematodes proved to be the most constantand most numerous component of the assemblage. The sediment portionsexamined revealed the presence of 1 - 11 individuals representing 11 marine nematode genera. The viability of the meiobenthic assemblagewas evidenced by the presence of ovigerous females of both nematodesand harpacticoids. Survival of the meiobenthos in shipborne ballast tank sedimentresidues may provide at least a partial explanation for the cosmopolitandistribution of meiobenthic taxa and may underlie the successfulcolonisation of new habitats by invasive meiofaunal species...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{interdisciplinary}} {{field of}} marine invertebrate chemical ecology is relatively young, and particularly so in polar marine environments. In this review we present {{evidence that the}} incidence of chemical defense in antarctic benthic marine invertebrate phyla is widespread. Mechanisms of chemical defense have been detected in antarctic representatives of the Porifera, Cnidaria, Brachiopoda, Tunicata, Nemertea, Mollusca and Echinodermata. This argues against earh'er bio-geographic theories that predicted a low incidence of chemical defense in polar waters where levels of fish predation are low. Selection for chemical defense in benthic sessile and sluggish marine invertebrates is likely a response to an envi-ronmentally stable community shown to be structured primarily by biotic factors such as predation and competition. <b>Holoplankton</b> and the eggs, embryos and larvae of both benthic and planktonic antarctic macroinvertebrates may also employ chemical defense to offset mortality during characteristically slow development and long life span where susceptibility to predation is seemingly high. While most re-search to date has focused on the role of secondary metabolites in mediating pre-dation, it is likely that bioactive compounds in antarctic marine invertebrates also serve roles as antifoulants and allelochemics. The diversity of bioactive metabolites detected to date in antarctic marine invertebrates sets the stage both for continuing and for broadening efforts to evaluate their functional and ecological significance.

40|$|Zooplankton plays diverse crucial roles {{within the}} marine {{ecosystem}} {{and can also}} be used as bio- indicator of climate changes since it is very sensitive to environmental changes. Therefore it is essential to consider long-term plankton series. Given the analysis of plankton samples is time- consuming, it requires an effective and rapid analytical method. We have used in this work a supervised learning approach adapted for the semi-automatic classification of digital images of the mesozooplankton of the Bay of Calvi (Corsica, France) by using the Zoo/PhytoImage software. Together with a 11 -years long zooplankton time-series, a set of nine environmental variables were monitored in order to identify controlling factors and determine whether the communities were sensitive to global environmental changes. The main components of the mesozooplankton community were characterized by both seasonal and inter-annual variability. Additionally, variation of <b>holoplankton</b> and meroplankton differentiated one from each other. The holoplanktonic community could be split into two subgroups according to its variation in function of the environment: cladocerans and appendicularians, and to a lesser extent, copepods on one hand, and cnidarians, chaetognathes and thaliaceans, on the other hand. Regarding inter-annual variation, one year (2007) showed particularly low production of total zooplankton which was also the case for all the different holoplanktonic taxa. Accounting for that phenomenon were identified some potentially underlying environmental factors. Finally, although water temperature increased significantly over the last years along with the frequency of marine heat wave events, no evident change in the global zooplankton composition was observed yet.

40|$|Inter-Research 2015. Larvae of many {{intertidal}} species develop offshore {{and must}} cross the surf zone {{to complete their}} onshore migration to adult habitats. Depending on hydrodynamics, the surf zone may limit this migration, especially on reflective rocky shores. As a logistically tractable analog of a rocky shore environment, we carried out a comprehensive biological and physical study of the hydrodynamics of a steep reflective sandy beach. <b>Holoplankton</b> and precompetent larval invertebrates were much less abundant within the surf zone than offshore, and their concentrations {{inside and outside the}} surf zone were not significantly correlated, suggesting that they were not entering the surf zone. Persistent offshore flow throughout the water column at {{the outer edge of the}} surf zone may prevent these organisms from entering the surf zone. In contrast, the concentrations of detritus and a competent larval invertebrate (i. e. cyprids), while also not significantly correlated with concentrations offshore, were frequently more concentrated in the surf zone than offshore. Within the surf zone, the concentration of detritus was significantly correlated with concentrations of competent larval invertebrates (barnacles, gastropods, polychaetes, and bopyrid amphipod) and organisms that may be associated with detritus (amphipods and harpacticoid copepods). These concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with average daily wave height. We hypothesize that detritus and larvae enter the surf zone near the bottom during calm wave conditions by a process of near-bottom streaming. Near-bottom streaming is associated with all surf zones and may be a general mechanism for onshore transport of larvae close to the coast...|$|E
40|$|The {{tropical}} north-west of Australia {{boasts a}} marine environment with a {{diverse array of}} biota as well as highly dynamic oceanography because of large tidal fluctuations, seasonal monsoons, tropical cyclones and El Niño influences. Krill, {{as part of the}} <b>holoplankton,</b> are influenced by such oceanographic conditions. An investigation off the Kimberley coast during the austral autumn of 2010 revealed 20 species of krill, of which three, Euphausia fallax, Euphausia sibogae and Nematoscelis gracilis, were identified as new records for the region. Although the number of species increased from shelf to oceanic waters, concentrations of krill decreased. Pseudeuphausia latifrons was the most abundant species off the Kimberley coast, with concentrations highest in shelf waters sampled during the night (2. 84 ± 1. 95 m- 3). This species was also the most abundant at the 100 m and 200 m isobaths, but Stylocheiron carinatum dominated in the deeper waters (500 m, 1000 m and 2000 m stations). In terms of environmental influences on the krill assemblages, together mean seawater density, zooplankton settled volume and depth provided the highest correlation with krill assemblages (r 2 = 0. 69, P= 0. 002). Mean seawater density was used as an indicator for water masses, and two distinct water masses were identified in the study area, a warmer (300 °C), higher salinity (> 34. 7 psu) surface layer overlayed a cooler, less saline layer. The Kimberley coast is one of the least studied marine environments of Australia, particularly for zooplankton, and this study improves the understanding of oceanographic influences on krill diversity and distribution in this highly dynamic environment...|$|E
40|$|The North Sea {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically {{productive}} ecosystems in the world and supports important fisheries. Climate-induced changes occurred in the pelagic ecosystems of the North Sea during the 1980 s. These changes, which have been observed from phytoplankton to fish and among permanent (<b>holoplankton)</b> and temporary (meroplankton) plankton species, have resulted in alterations in plankton community composition and seasonality. Until now, the effects of climate-driven changes on biological linkages between pelagic and benthic ecosystems have not been examined. The present study indicates that changes in benthic organisms could have a profound effect on the trophodynamics of the pelagos. We demonstrate this by analyses of a long-term time series of North Sea plankton and sea surface temperature data. We discover that pronounced changes in the North Sea meroplankton, mainly related to an increased abundance and spatial distribution of the larvae of a benthic echinoderm, Echinocardium cordatum, result primarily from a stepwise increase in sea temperature after 1987 that has caused warmer conditions to occur earlier in the year than previously. Key stages of reproduction in E. cordatum, gametogenesis and spawning, appear to be influenced by winter and spring sea temperature and their larval development is affected by the quantity and quality of their phytoplankton food. Our analyses suggest that a new thermal regime in the North Sea in winter and spring may have benefited reproduction and survival in this benthic species. As a result, E. cordatum may be altering the trophodynamics of the summer pelagic ecosystem through competition between its larvae and holozooplankton taxa...|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{analyses}} {{the micro}} and mesozooplankton in Ushuaia and Golondrina Bays, the first research on these plankton fractions {{of these areas}} in wintertime (August 2004). The number of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton taxa was higher in Ushuaia Bay than in Golondrina Bay. Aloricate ciliates predominated over tintinnids in microzooplankton and <b>holoplankton</b> over meroplankton in mesozooplankton in both bays. Ctenocalanus citer, Drepanopus forcipatus and Clausocalanus brevipes presented the highest frequency of occurrence. Among the meroplankton, Halicarcinus planatus and Munida gregaria were the most frequent decapod larvae in both bays. The distribution of the different sampling station groups of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton as determined by cluster analysis suggests the influence of natural conditions in each bay and anthropogenic environmental {{differences between the two}} bays.
