Micronized particles were produced from this charcoal using a multi-step milling process and verified using a scanning electron microscope and laser diffraction system. Charcoal particles greater than 50 µm exhibited long needle shapes much like the parent biomass while particles less than 50 µm were produced with aspect ratios closer to unity. Laser diffraction measurements indicated D 10, D 50, and D 90 values of 4. 446 µm, 15. 83 µm, and 39. 69 µm, respectively.

The combustion tests proved that C content in the ash samples at the cyclone was very low and the combustion efficiency was higher than 99. 5 %. A temperature increase was registered in the freeboard with respect to the bed as consequence of volatile matter combustion, typical of biomass fuels.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the Soviet Union looked for {{new methods of}} using coal sludge for power generation. Coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> was made in a Ball mill which {{pulverised}} the coal or coal sludge. This was done near a coal mine in Belovo, Siberia. The coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> was transported through a pipeline to Novosibirskaya TEC-5, Novosibirsk, a distance of 262 km. The pipeline had three intermediate pumping stations. The Belovo Novosibirsk project used coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> in steam boilers {{at a rate of}} 1340 tonnes per hour. There was a further project at Belovo Novosibirsk between 1989 and 1993 and development of coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> technology for district heating stations and power stations. In 2004, a coal water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> production plant was opened at Enskiy village, Murmansk.|$|R

For example, low speed marine or modular power plant diesels can operate on pure coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> whereas medium speed diesels such as locomotive engines may need diesel 2 as a co-fuel which will act as an ignition source. Very small (5 to 10 micrometer) particle coal-water <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> has been trialled in combined cycle gas turbine power plants.

40|$|The use of coal as a {{fuel for}} diesel engines {{dates back to the}} early days of the {{development}} of the engine. Dr. Diesel envisioned his concept as a multi-fuel engine, with coal a prime candidate due to the fact that it was Germany`s primary domestic energy resource. It is interesting that the focus on coal burning diesel engines appears to peak about every twenty years as shortages of other energy resources increase the economic attractiveness of using coal. This periodic interest in coal started in Germany with the work of Diesel in the timeframe 1898 - 1906. Pawlikowski carried on the work from 1916 to 1928. Two German companies commercialized the technology prior to and during World War II. The next flurry of activity occurred in the United States in the period from 1957 - 69, with work done at Southwest Research Institute, Virginia Polytechnical University, and Howard University. The current period of activity started in 1978 with work sponsored by the Conservation and Renewable Energy Branch of the US Department of Energy. This work was done at Southwest Research Institute and by ThermoElectron at Sulzer Engine in Switzerland. In 1982, the Fossil Energy Branch of the US Department of Energy, through the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) initiated a concentrated effort to develop coal burning diesel and gas turbine engines. The diesel engine work in the METC sponsored program was performed at Arthur D. Little (Cooper-Bessemer as subcontractor), Bartlesville Energy Technology Center (now NIPER), Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel Corporation, General Motor Corporation (Electromotive Division), General Electric, Southwest Research Institute, and various universities and other research and development organizations. This DOE-METC coal engine RD & D initiative which spanned the 1982 - 1993 timeframe is the topic of this review document.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research program was to demonstrate EnerTech�s and the Energy & Environmental Research Center�s (EERC) process of slurry carbonization for producing homogeneous, pumpable titels from refuse-derived fuel (RDF) with continuous pilot plant facilities, and to characterize flue gas and ash emissions from combustion of the carbonizd RDF <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel.</b> Please note that �Wet Thermal Oxidation� is EnerTech�s trademark mme for combustion of the carbonized RDF <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel.</b> Carbonized RDF <b>slurry</b> <b>fuels</b> were produced with the EERC�S 7. 5 -tpd (wet basis) pilot plant facility. A hose diaphragm pump pressurized a 7 - lo-wt% feed RDF slurry, with a viscosity of 500 cP, to approximately 2500 psig. The pressurized RDF slurry was heated by indirect heat exchangers to between 5850 - 626 �F, and its temperature and pressure was maintained in a downflow reactor. The carbonized slurry was flashed, concentrated in a filter press, and ground in an attritor. During operation of the pilot plant, samples of the feed RDF slurry, carbonization gas, condensate, carbonized solids, and filtrate were taken and analyzed. Pilot-scale slurry carbonization experiments with RDF produced a homogeneous pumpable <b>slurry</b> <b>fuel</b> with a higher heating value (HHV) of 3, 000 - 6, 600 Btu/lb (as-received basis), at a viscosity of 500 CP at 100 Hz decreasing, and ambient temperature.

During slurry carbonization, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics in the feed RDF also decompose to form hydrochloric acid and salts. Pilot-scale slurty carbonization experiments extracted 82 - 94 % of the feed RDF chlorine content as chloride salts. Higher carbonization temperatures and higher alkali additions to the feed slurry produced a higher chlorine extraction...|$|R
