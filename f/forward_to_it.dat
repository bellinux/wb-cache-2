5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

Daniel Craig took over the role on 14 October 2005. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Brosnan was asked {{what he thought of}} Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.

In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's in front of you, and not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect." [...] The operative word was fear. Fear of the unknown. In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E

She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record.

In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> it's going to be unbelievable.

Two companies captured a chalk pit short of the trench; a communication trench was dug <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> {{and the rest of the}} Canadian line was reinforced. I Battalion, RIR 212 in the trenches east of Courcelette cemetery and the quarry to the north, made several counter-attacks which were repulsed.

That year, Ryan was rested from the soap on doctor's orders, by agreement from Louise Berridge, the executive producer, Ryan and her parents. Plans for character developments between Zoe and Anthony were delayed and plans for their on-screen marriage were pushed back, with the wedding storyline being re-written.

2500|$|Rehearsals for {{the live}} {{section of the}} episode started on 21 July 2012 and full dress rehearsals on 22 July, though there was some {{tentative}} rehearsal time before that when they were also busy filming other episodes. Fenwick said of his rehearsals, [...] "Summer arrives {{just in time for}} me to complete my 24th circuit of Albert Square and I'm sweltering. On the plus side, I'm starting to see abs, have buns of steel and the show is looking good too!" [...] He explained that he was inspired by Usain Bolt, saying, [...] "I watched a documentary on him [...] and he's inspired me to torch bear. Obviously I won't be going [...] near as fast him!" [...] He had to check the route for potholes beforehand, as well as making sure he knew his lines, and said he was looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> being over. He practiced the route at least 100 times, using washing line rope instead of the flame, and had cut down on alcohol to prepare. He was worried about sustaining an injury during rehearsals and about carrying the torch during the live broadcast, as he may have dropped it or it could have gone out. He stated that he, as an actor, was feeling more nervous than his character.|$|E

2500|$|Foley then {{returned}} to ECW to team with Tommy Dreamer. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley wasn't unique. Cactus began a gimmick where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce {{his status as a}} hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling to make people upset. He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with The Pitbulls against Raven, Stevie Richards and The Dudley Brothers (Dudley Dudley and Big Dick Dudley). [...] Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve Raven's [...] "higher purpose". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated 911. As part of Foley's heel gimmick, he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In Have a Nice Day, Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of [...] "You sold out" [...] by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater Shane Douglas, who won when he put Jack into a figure four leglock that allowed Mikey Whipwreck to hit him repeatedly with a steel chair. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, [...] "Please don't go!". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie to Frank Sinatra's song [...] "New York, New York". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.|$|E
