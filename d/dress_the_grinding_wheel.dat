50|$|A radius grinder (or {{radius tool}} grinder) {{is a special}} grinder used for {{grinding}} the most complex tool forms, and is the historical predecessor to the CNC tool and cutter grinder. Like the CNC grinder, it {{may be used for}} other tasks where grinding spherical surfaces is necessary. The tool itself consists of three parts: The grinder head, work table, and holding fixture. The grinder head has three degrees of freedom. Vertical movement, movement into the workpeice, and tilt. These are generally set statically, and left fixed throughout operations. The work table is a T-slotted X-axis table mounted on top of a radial fixture. Mounting the X axis on top of the radius table, as opposed to the other way around, allows for complex and accurate radius grinds. The holding fixtures can be anything one can mount on a slotted table, but most commonly used is a collet or chuck fixture that indexes and has a separate Y movement to allow accurate depth setting and endmill sharpening. The dressers used on these grinders are usually quite expensive, and can <b>dress</b> <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> itself with a particular radius.|$|E

Until now, only improvements in form accuracy and surface roughness of aspherical surfaces have been investigated. However, when the surface roughness becomes low, the small waviness of the surface becomes marked.

These materials have a long history in the manufacturing process of glass lenses. Since early days glass was polished with metal oxides. However, while today CeO 2 is meant to be state-of-the-art ferrous oxides known as rouge were used until few decades ago. Indeed, the iron oxides produced in the electrolytic process of ELID can have a special polishing effect on the components made of glass. For this reason Fraunhofer IPT is developing an Electrolytic Generated Polishing-Grinding (EGPG). As the polishing process of surfaces up to optical quality takes the biggest amount of time of the entire production chain, EGPG permits a considerable reduction of time and cost in producing of glass products with ultra precise optical surfaces. Especially in the manufacturing procedures of aspheric glass lenses production the conventional polishing steps contain enormous technological challenges and take up to 70 % of production time. At this point Polishing-Grinding offers the opportunity to integrate the polishing step into a grinding process. This will reduce the following polishing time or even make it redundant.

40|$|Milling is used widely as an {{efficient}} machining {{process in a}} variety of industrial applications, such as the complex surface machining and removing large amounts of material. Flutes make up {{the main part of the}} solid end-mill, which can significantly affect the tool’s life and machining quality in milling processes. The traditional method for end-mill flutes design is using try-errors based on cutting experiments with various flute parameters which is time- and resources-consuming. Hence, modeling the flutes of end-mill and simulating the cutting processes are crucial to improve the efficiency of end-mill design. Generally, in industry, the flutes are ground by CNC grinding machines via setting the position and orientation of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> to guarantee <b>the</b> designed flute parameters including rake angle, relief angle, flute angle and core radius. However, in previous researches, the designed flute profile was ground via building a specific <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> with a free-form profile in in <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> processes. And <b>the</b> free-form <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> will greatly increase the manufacturing cost, which is too complicated to implement in practice. In this research, the flute-grinding processes were developed with standard <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> via 2 -axis or 5 -axis CNC <b>grinding</b> operations. For <b>the</b> 2 -axis CNC flute-grinding processes, the flute was modelled via calculating the contact line between <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and cutters. <b>The</b> flute parameters in terms of the dimension and configuration of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> were expressed explicitly, which can be used to planning the CNC programming. For the 5 -axis CNC flute-grinding processes, the flute was obtained with a cylinder <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> via setting <b>the</b> wheel’s position and orientation rather than <b>dressing</b> <b>the</b> dimension of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> In this processes, optimization method was used to determine the wheel’s position and orientation and evaluating the machined flute parameters. Beside, based on the proposed flute model, various conditions for <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel’s</b> setting were discussed to avoid interference of flute profile. A free-form flute profile is consequently generated in its grinding processes. However, in the end-mill design, the flute profile is simplified with some arcs and lines to approximate the CAD model of end-mills, which would introduce errors in the simulation of cutting processes. Based on the proposed flute-grinding methods, a solid flute CAD model was built and a CAD/CAM/CAE integration approach for the end-mill was carried out to predict the cutting forces and tool deflection. And also, the prediction results with various methods are verified to demonstrate the advantage of proposed approach. This work lays a foundation of integration of CAD/CAM/CAE for the end-mill design and would benefit the industry efficiently. ...|$|R

40|$|Grinding is a {{critical}} manufacturing process and is often the only alternative when producing precision components or when machining brittle materials such as ceramics. Characterizing and modeling the surface finish in <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> process is a difficult task due to the stochastic nature of the size, shape and spatial distribution of abrasive grains that make up <b>the</b> surface of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels.</b> Since <b>the</b> surface finish obtained in grinding is a direct function of the wheel surface topography, which is conditioned by a single point <b>dressing</b> process, understanding <b>the</b> effects of <b>dressing</b> parameters on <b>the</b> wheel topography is essential. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are: 1) to experimentally characterize the three-dimensional surface topography of a conventional <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> including attributes such as the abrasive grain height distribution, grain geometry and spacing parameters and their respective statistical distributions, 2) {{to determine the effects}} of single point <b>dressing</b> conditions on <b>the</b> three-dimensional wheel surface topography parameters and their distributions, 3) to model and simulate the three-dimensional wheel surface topography, and 4) to experimentally validate the wheel topography model. In this research, new and existing characterization methods are used to characterize the wheel surface and the individual abrasive grains. The new techniques include the use of X-ray micro-tomography (μCT) to obtain a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel's</b> internal micro-structure, and a focus variation based optical measurement method and scanning electron microscopy to characterize previously ignored attributes such as the number of sides and aspect ratio of individual grains. A seeded gel (SG) vitrified bond conventional <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is used in the study. A full factorial design of single point wheel dressing experiments is performed to investigate the effects infeed and lead <b>dressing</b> parameters on <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> surface topography. A custom wheel indexing apparatus is built to facilitate precision relocation of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> surface to enable optical comparison of the pre- and post-dressing wheel surface topography to observe wheel surface generation mechanisms such as macro-fracture and grain dislodgement. Quantitative descriptions of how each <b>dressing</b> parameter affects <b>the</b> wheel surface characteristics are given in terms of the wheel surface roughness amplitude parameters (Sp, Ssk, Sku) and areal and volume parameters (Spk, Sk, Vmp, Vmp, Vvc, Smr 1) derived from the bearing area curve. A three-dimensional wheel topography simulation model that takes as input the abrasive grain height distribution and the statistical distributions for the various abrasive grain geometry parameters is developed and experimentally validated. The results of wheel characterization studies show that the actual abrasive grain height distribution in the SG wheel follows a beta distribution. The μCT work shows that the abrasives are polyhedral in shape, as opposed to the spherical or conical shapes commonly assumed in grinding literature. Grain spacing is found to follow a beta distribution while the number of sides of the grain and the grain aspect ratio are found to follow the gamma and the Weibull distribution, respectively. The results of <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> study show that <b>the</b> lead <b>dressing</b> parameter has <b>the</b> strongest effect on wheel topography. Using statistical distributions for the key parameters (e. g. grain height, number of sides, grain spacing), a stochastic three-dimensional model is developed to simulate the wheel surface topography under different <b>dressing</b> conditions. <b>The</b> resulting model is shown to yield realistic results compared to existing models mainly due the fact that additional abrasive grain geometry parameters and more realistic assumptions of the different grain attributes are used in the model. It is shown that the model follows the overall wheel surface topography trends during dressing but has difficulty in accurately simulating some of the wheel characteristics under specific <b>dressing</b> conditions. <b>The</b> thesis then concludes with a summary of the main findings and possible future research avenues including extending the model to rotary dressing and simulation of wheel-workpiece interaction.

A high-speed camera and subsequent image processing were utilized to visualize and quantitatively analyze <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> motion through a transparent arterial tissue-mimicking phantom made of polyvinyl chloride, while <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> forces were measured by a piezoelectric dynamometer. Observed under typical orbital atherectomy grinding rotational speeds of 60, 000, 90, 000, and 120, 000 rpm in a 4. 8 mm diameter vessel, <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> motion {{was a combination of}} a low-frequency orbiting at 18, 38, 40 Hz and a high-frequency rotation of 1000, 1500, and 1660. 4 - 1866. 1 Hz, respectively. Grinding forces consisted of the high and low frequencies that matched well with the wheel motion...|$|R

This paper {{reported}} a deterministic method to predict geometrical interferences between <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and workpiece on ultra-precision grinding for micro aspherical lens mould. An inclined axis grinding mode controlled by B axis is considered and investigated. For avoiding the interference between <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> workpiece, {{the relationship of}} the radius of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> should be analyzed in <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> process. In this paper, a geometrical mathematical model for avoiding interferences between <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and workpiece is built up, and three interference conditions are analyzed. The maximum diameter of <b>the</b> cylindrical <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> is computed and obtained for grinding axisymmetric aspheric surface...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} grinding is {{a process}} that produces engineering components with a desired surface roughness. <b>The</b> <b>grinding</b> efficiency of vitrified <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels</b> deteriorates as <b>the</b> sharp cutting edges become blunt due to the formation of wear flats. Dressing is essentially a sharpening operation designed to generate a specific topography on the working surface of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> use of high power lasers is being explored as a non-contact cleaning and <b>dressing</b> technique. In <b>the</b> present study, a high power laser was used to clean metal chips from the surface of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and to <b>dress</b> <b>the</b> wheel by causing phase transformations to occur on the surface of vitrified <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Experimental results indicated that laser modified <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels</b> are comparable in performance to conventionally cleaned and dressed <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} method of in-process dressing {{has been conducted}} by means of water-jet, as well its application investigated in the present study. While the workpiece is difficult to be ground by <b>the</b> surface <b>grinding</b> machine, <b>the</b> high pressure waterjet is supplied to <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> as a supplementary method. The principle of this method can be simply described as that the waterjet {{is a kind of}} processing technique, which is able to strip the chips on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> without damaging it by adjusting the injection pressure and stand-off distance. <b>The</b> <b>dressing</b> effects are examined according to the surface conditions of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and ground workpiece by a surface roughness and profile measuring device and a microscope. Because of the complexity of the interaction influences between the jet pump pressure and the stand-off distance on <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> results, in this report at fixed stand-off distance condition the effects of the jet pressure on <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> of CBN # 325 and finished surface of Ti 6 A 14 V materials have been clarified. From the results of the experiments, it was found that <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> life time of <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> roughness of the ground material finished surface have been improved distinctly when the injection pressure is 107. 1 MPa at stand-off distance 20 mm. On the other hand much lower pressure will have no influence on dressing results, and much higher one will damage the CBN wheel...|$|R
