500|$|The {{detected}} {{voltage signal}} {{output of the}} Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. [...] However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around [...] [...] This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the <b>detector</b> <b>output,</b> but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity. [...] Another technique {{is to reduce the}} range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum. [...] The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern. [...] This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.|$|E

40|$|A {{correlation}} spectrometer permanently incorporates a reference cell and an electro-optical phase modulator (EOPM) {{in the light}} path between a sample cell and a detector. The effect of the EOPM is such that its frequency modulates all of the monochromatic component of the incoherent radiation passing through it. The EOPM is adjusted so that when it is ON all of the energy in the monochromatic components is thrown into sidebands differing from the original frequencies by integral multiples of the modulation frequency with {{the total amount of}} energy absorbed from the original radiation remaining constant. When there is no coincidence between the constituents in the two cells, the <b>detector's</b> <b>output</b> is the same when the EOPM is ON and when it is OFF.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show how}} {{non-linear}} representations of local image structure {{can be used}} to improve the performance of model matching algorithms in medical image analysis tasks. Rather than represent the image structure using intensity values or gradients, we use measures that indicate the reliability of a set of local image feature <b>detector</b> <b>outputs.</b> These features are image edges, corners, and gradients. Feature <b>detector</b> <b>outputs</b> in flat, noisy regions tend to be ignored whereas those near strong structure are favoured. We demonstrate that combinations of these features give more accurate and reliable matching between models and new images than modelling image intensity alone. We also show that the approach is robust to non-linear changes in contrast, such as those found in multi-modal imaging. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{the damage}} to the eye's retina that occurs with long-term diabetes, which can eventually lead to blindness. Screening programs for DR are being introduced, however, an important prerequisite for automation is the accurate localization of the main anatomical features in the image, notably the optic disc (OD) and the macula. A series of interesting algorithms have been proposed in the recent past and the performance is generally good, but each method has situations, where it fails. This paper presents a novel framework for automatic detection of optic disc and macula in retinal fundus images using a combination of different optic disc and macula detectors represented by a weighted complete graph. A node pruning procedure removes the worst vertices of the graph by satisfying predefined geometric constraints and get best possible <b>detector</b> <b>outputs</b> to be combined using a weighted average. The extensive tests have shown that combining the predictions of multiple detectors is more accurate than any of the individual detectors making up the ensemble. time.
