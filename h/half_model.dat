25|$|From 1816 to the 1830s, the Navy {{accumulated}} extensive {{stocks of}} live oak timbers {{for use in}} new warship construction under {{the provisions of the}} Act for the Gradual Increase of the Navy of the United States, passed in 1816. In the early 1850s, the Navy decided to build a new sail-powered ship using these existing stockpiles, calling for a sloop-of-war that would be fast, with a long endurance, and sufficiently armed to be capable of engaging other warships of her type. This would produce a capable warship while keeping costs low since the material used was already on hand and an expensive steam engine would not be required. Chief Constructor John Lenthall prepared the design, along with Edward Delano, the constructor of the Gosport Shipyard. In June 1853, Lenthall completed the hull <b>half</b> <b>model,</b> which was necessary to scale up the design and to prepare the necessary hull timbers. During this period, the new vessel's namesake, , {{was in the process of}} being broken up a short distance away in the Gospart yard.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to evaluating the <b>half</b> <b>model,</b> the researchers also reviewed {{all the evidence}} used in the debate to date. With the help of FBI and BATF forensics investigators, they concluded that some 25 to 30 documents supporting the ship being a rebuild were forgeries. In 1991, they published their findings and conclusion that the current Constellation and the original frigate are two different ships. The authors {{did not agree with}} Chapelle, however, over the nature of the new ship's construction; they pointed out that the Act for the Gradual Increase authorized the Navy to build new ships from the oak acquired under its provisions, so {{there was no need to}} subvert Congress's authority on the matter. Lynaugh summarized the report in a separate article published in 1993, Discussion of the Origins of the Frigate and the Sloop Constellation, and concluded that [...] "though not built in Baltimore in 1797, the present ship was the last sail-only powered warship designed and built by the U.S. Navy. As such, it is a rare artifact of first importance and truly deserves to be preserved and displayed for the American public.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1991, {{researchers}} Dana M. Wegner and Colan Ratliff {{from the}} David Taylor Research Center and Kevin Lynaugh, from the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, published an exhaustive {{report on the}} question. Their research noted several key pieces of historical evidence that the two ships were not the same vessel. This included {{the fact that the}} timbers from the dismantled 1797 Constellation were auctioned off after the ship-breaking process ended in September 1853, the fact that the keel-laying for the 1854 ship had been done in June 1853, before the 1797 ship had been dismantled completely, and building records that meticulously accounted for each piece of timber that was used to build the new ship; in fact, only 204 oak knees were re-used, but these came from existing stocks, not the original vessel and they stated that, [...] "There was no evidence that any material was transferred directly from the old ship to the new." [...] In March 1989, they had come upon the builder's half-hull model of Constellation in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum. This was important because half-hull models are only built for new designs, not rebuilds, and the use of half-hull models was not introduced until after 1797. The authors conclude that this is definitive evidence that the vessel launched in 1854 was new, as it was [...] "impossible to accurately scale down the form of an existing ship to model format," [...] and that [...] "a new <b>half</b> <b>model</b> would not have been employed by Lenthall unless he was forging a fully new design." ...|$|E

Once the molds were transported to the timber crews, the templates were used to select the part of a tree that closely matched the template. From there the timber was felled and roughed out close to the required dimensions, then numbered for identification and loaded onto a ship for transport. An additional set of more detailed molds was required for each frigate for the construction crews to follow.|$|E

40|$|This is conference paper, {{presented}} at the 28 th AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference: [URL] <b>half</b> <b>model</b> wind tunnel technique suffers from aerodynamic loses due to {{the interaction of the}} tunnel wall boundary layer with the flow over the model and the formation of a horseshoe vortex in the model-floor junction. The vortex is believed to contribute to the degradation of the <b>half</b> <b>model</b> aerodynamic performance. An attempt was made to reduce the aerodynamics losses by modifying the junction horseshoe vortex through the use of localized suction just upstream of the model leading edge. Wind tunnel tests on a rectangular and untwisted, wing only, modified LS(1) - 0413 <b>half</b> <b>model</b> were conducted at Reynolds numbers of 0. 44 x 10 (6), 0. 88 x 10 (6) and 1 x 10 (6). Without suction the force and moment balance measurements of the <b>half</b> <b>model</b> showed the anticipated deviation from full model values, e. g. lower lift curve slope and higher drag values. Effects of localized suction were limited to Reynolds number of 0. 44 x 10 (6) and improvements were seen only near stall angles of attack. Flow visualization for the no suction case showed that a horseshoe vortex did not exist over much of the incidence range for this particular model and hence there was little room for suction to effect junction flow. Near stall, suction removed the horseshoe vortex around the upper surface of the model and significantly reduced flow separations occurring in the model-floor junction, leading to the improved stall characteristics...|$|E
