40|$|International audienceThe third-generation {{architectures}} have {{to support}} multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). They have also to host different types of these virtual operators. Virtualizing these architectures will allow the MVNOs to rapidly deploy their equipment. It will separate the management domain {{between them and the}} mobile <b>host</b> <b>operator.</b> It will also allow sharing resources and reducing the deployment cost. Motivated by these requirements, we propose some MVNO distributed architectures. First of all, we evaluate the physical and virtual deployment time, then we define the utility function of the equipment for the different types of MVNOs. The utility function evaluates the gain in deployment time for each type of MVNO. This function has to be maximized. Our study demonstrates that the data calls type is the best MVNO candidate for virtualization. This latter consistently yields the best overall utility across an important number of network equipment to be virtualized by varying the time required for software installation and the time spent to determine the physical position of the equipment...|$|R

40|$|Operators (MVNOs) the {{possibility}} to deploy their components more rapidly and at a lower cost. By optimizing multiple virtual machines (VMs) in the same physical server, we considerably reduce the cost and power consumption. Therefore, server virtualization can be exploited to run VMs on servers that provide the lowest delay to their users. Our goal is to install MVNO virtual machines {{on a set of}} <b>host</b> <b>operator</b> physical equipment, such that user latencies are minimal while all capacity constraints are satisfied. We formulate our VM location problem as a mixed integer-programming problem. We study the complexity of the problem. Then, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to study the impact of the user latencies change on the optimal solution. To reach a good feasible solution in less time, we propose an heuristic. It reaches solutions close to the optimal in a very little time. The running time improvement compared to the Branch and Bound model exceeds 90 % for larger topologies having more than 500 nodes. Our algorithm estimates the maximal number of VMs that can be created and then placed by our heuristic to provide the minimal latency subject to given capacity and cost budget. Optimizing the VM location contributes efficiently in the performance improvement of the SIP signaling delay...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and investigates a green {{virtualization}} {{framework for}} infrastructure sharing among multiple cellular operators whose networks are {{powered by a}} combination of conventional and renewable sources of energy. Under the proposed framework, the virtual network formed by unifying radio access infrastructures of all operators is optimized for minimum energy consumption by deactivating base stations (BSs) with low traffic loads. The users initially associated to those BSs are off-loaded to neighboring active ones. A fairness criterion for collaboration based on roaming prices is introduced to cover the additional energy costs incurred by <b>host</b> <b>operators.</b> The framework also ensures that any collaborating operator is not negatively affected by its participation in the proposed virtualization. A multi-objective linear programming problem is formulated to achieve energy and cost efficiency of the networks' operation by identifying the set of inter-operator roaming prices. For the case when collaboration among all operators is infeasible due to profitability, capacity, or power constraints, an iterative algorithm is proposed to determine the groups of operators that can viably collaborate. Results show significant energy savings using the proposed virtualization as compared to the standalone case. Moreover, collaborative operators exploiting locally generated renewable energy are rewarded more than traditional ones.

A model is defined to analyse the competition and strategic interactions between the two players and their economic consequences. Two different scenarios are envisaged to observe the effects when varying the interconnection charges and structural characteristics of the operators. The analysis of the results obtained from the model focuses on retail price strategies and on market shares and profits in an attempt to provide recommendations which may be utilised in the decision-making process...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the branding efforts by Langkawi Island based on various slogans and taglines used from 1974 until present. Secondary sources such as government reports, destination marketing organization websites, brochures and previous studies were referred to identify those slogans. This paper argues that destination branding process is not as easy as most destination marketing thought. The process is complex and it may need involvement from various stakeholders such as local population and tourism operators. Based on the various slogans identified, this paper argues that too many slogans and taglines are used and thus they may create confusion among <b>host</b> population, tourism <b>operators</b> as well as the tourists in terms of what are the actual core values of the island. The paper concludes with a suggestion that an empirical research is needed to confirm whether all these slogans or brands used are endorsed and supported by the internal stakeholders (e. g. <b>host</b> community, tourism <b>operators)</b> as well as in agreement with what as being perceived by the tourists...|$|R

Additionally, a single physical terminal could connect via multiple sessions to multiple hosts simultaneously. Future generations of terminal servers included both LAT and TELNET protocols, one of the earliest protocols created to run on a burgeoning TCP/IP based Internet. Additionally, the ability to create reverse direction pathways from users to non-traditional RS232 devices (i.e. UNIX <b>Host</b> TTYS1 <b>operator</b> ports) created an entirely new market for Terminal Servers, now known as console servers in the mid to late 1990s, year 2000 and beyond through today.|$|R
