Typical lesions of <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis</b> were produced following inoculation, either intravenously or by scarification, of broth cultures of 4 strains of a micrococcus isolated from field cases of the disease. The experimental inoculation of pigs with skin scrapings sterilized by filtration or antibiotic treated, yielded negative results. Cultures of CORYNEBACTERIUM PYOGENES and of STREPTOCOCCUS SP. also isolated from the affected pigs, likewise yielded negative results on experimental inoculation of pigs. The conclusion is drawn, that the micrococcus isolated from field cases and which produced the disease experimentally is the primary etiological agent of <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis</b> as seen in weaned pigs in this area.

Treatment of this disease is problematic because of the limited number of antimicrobial agents available for this purpose. Thirteen antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their activities against 100 S. hyicus strains isolated from pigs with <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis.</b> Novobiocin was the most active compound tested, with an MIC for 90 % of the strains tested (MIC 90) of 32. 0 micrograms/ml. Initial testing with sulfadiazine-trimethoprim yielded an MIC 90 of > 64. 0 micrograms/ml, but subsequent testing with thymidine phosphorylase-supplemented medium yielded an MIC 90 of 0. 06 microgram/ml. Both lincomycin and spectinomycin were relatively inactive against the S. hyicus strains tested, with MIC 90 s of > 64. 0 and > 128. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, the combination of the two compounds at ratios of 1 : 2 (lincomycin to spectinomycin) and 1 : 8 were more active, with MIC 90 s of 16. 0 and 4. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results indicate that novobiocin and sulfadiazine-trimethoprim were the most active compounds tested against the S. hyicus strains isolated from pigs with <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis.</b> Furthermore, the combination of lincomycin and spectinomycin was more active than the individual compounds against the strains tested...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus hyicus strains with {{different}} phage types, plasmid profiles, and antibiotic resistance patterns were isolated from piglets with <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis.</b> The strains could {{be divided into}} virulent strains, producing <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis,</b> and avirulent strains, producing no dermal changes when injected in experimental piglets. The results showed that both virulent and avirulent strains were present simultaneously on diseased piglets. This constitutes a diagnostic problem. Concentrated culture supernatants from nine virulent strains injected in the skin of healthy piglets produced a crusting reaction in all piglets. Acanthosis was observed in the histopathological examination of the crustaceous skin. Concentrated culture supernatants from nine avirulent strains produced no macroscopic or microscopic skin changes. Protein profiles from all virulent strains and seven out of nine avirulent strains showed {{a high degree of}} protein band homology. An approximately 30 kDa protein present in all concentrated culture supernatants capable of producing skin changes, could not be detected in samples that did not produce skin changes. No other protein showed a similar association. It is concluded that crusting reaction of piglet skin is a suitable indicator of virulence in S. hyicus in relation to <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis,</b> and that virulent strains produce a 30 kDa protein, absent in concentrated culture supernatants from avirulent strains.

40|$|Abstract Background Desmoglein 1 (DSG 1) is {{the target}} protein in the skin disease <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis</b> in pigs caused by virulent strains of Staphylococcus hyicus. The exfoliative toxins {{produced}} by S. hyicus digest the porcine desmoglein 1 (PIG) DSG 1 by a very specific reaction. This study investigated the location of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the porcine desmoglein 1 gene (PIG) DSG 1 in correlation to the cleavage site as well as if the genotype of the SNPs is correlated to susceptibility or resistance to the disease. Results DNA from 32 affected and 32 unaffected piglets with <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis</b> were diagnosed clinically as affected or unaffected. Two regions of the desmoglein 1 gene were sequenced and genotypes of the SNPs were established. Seven SNPs (823 T>C, 828 A>G, 829 A>G, 830 A>T, 831 A>T, 838 A>C and 1139 C>T) {{were found in the}} analysed sequences and the allele frequencies were determined for the SNPs resulting in amino acid change. Four of the seven polymorphisms were situated in the motif known to be important for toxin cleavage. The distribution of the genotypes between affected and unaffected animals was analysed.

Mucinous {{degenerative}} {{change was}} observed in the epithelial cells lining the renal pelvis, ureter, and urinary bladder of pigs with <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis,</b> coliform enteri-tis, hog cholera, and suppurative arthritis. Mucins were observed within transitional cells either as granular or homogenous material within vacuoles.

The cells and lakes of mucin were stained selectively by periodic acid-Schiff, alcian blue, and colloidal iron. On the basis of the reactivity patterns with these stains the transitional epithelial cells were considered capable of producing acidic and neutral mucins. The potential of the urinary tract epithelium for secretion of mucus has been observed in many species of animals. In chronic proliferative cystitis of cattle, the transitional epithelium may undergo metaplasia to mucus-secret-ing goblet-shaped cells arranged in glandular patterns [I]. In man, mucus-se-creting epithelial metaplasia has been observed in the renal pelvis, ureter, and urinary bladder [2, 5].

40|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of two molecular species of exfoliative toxin (ET) synthesized by Staphylococcus hyicus (SHET) under chromosomal and plasmid control is presented. Serological evidence that these molecular species of toxins are distinct from each other is given. The molecular weights of SHET from plasmidless strain P- 1 (SHETA) and from plasmid-carrying strains P- 10 and P- 23 (SHETB) were almost equal. Both of the serotypes of SHET exhibited exfoliation in 1 -day-old chickens. The plasmid-cured (P−) substrains (P- 23 C 1 and P- 23 C 2) of S. hyicus P- 23 did not cause exfoliation in 1 -day-old chickens, whereas P− substrains (P- 10 C 1 and P- 10 C 2) of strain P- 10 caused exfoliation, but they decreased their exfoliative activity. These findings suggest that SHETB was synthesized along with SHETA by strain P- 10, whereas the P- 23 strain synthesized SHETB alone. The plasmid-carrying strain (P- 23) as well as the plasmidless strain (P- 1) exhibited the typical clinical signs of <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis</b> in pigs.

Together {{with a number of}} avian viruses with similar molecular characteristics, the porcine circoviruses are classified in the genus Circovirus within the family Circoviridae. Although PCV- 1 persists in the pig population, the presence of PCV- 1 has not been associated with any recognised clinical signs or pathology. In contrast, PCV- 2 has been implicated as the mayor causative agent of Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS). It is characterized mainly by loose of weight, general wasting, and severe immunosuppressive effects with premature death of piglets. PCV- 2 effects are generated by inhibition of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc) so called natural interferon-Î± producing cells (NIPCs) unlinking the innate and acquired immune systems, and renderinga host susceptible to secondary or concomitant microbial infections. Therefore, PCV- 2 additionally is associated with other porcine diseases and syndromes, such as reproductive failure, respiratory disease complex, congenital tremor, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, nectrotizing tracheitis and <b>exudative</b> <b>epidermitis,</b> together with other viral and bacterial agents, including Parvovirus, PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus), Influenza, Aujeszky and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis and Pastereulla multocida.

The pathogenesis of EE, sow mastitis, and metritis involves the interaction between the host and virulent protein factors of S. hyicus, however, the proteins that interact with the host, especially the host immune system, are unclear. In the present study, immunoproteomics was used to screen the immunogenic proteins of S. hyicus strain ZC- 4. The cellular and secreted proteins of S. hyicus strain ZC- 4 were obtained, separated by 2 D gel electrophoresis, and further analyzed by western blot with S. hyicus strain ZC- 4 -infected swine serum. Finally, 28 specific immunogenic proteins including 15 cellular proteins and 13 secreted proteins, 26 of which were novel immunogenic proteins from S. hyicus, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To further verify their immunogenicity, two representative proteins (acetate kinase [cellular] and enolase [secreted]) were chosen for expression, and the resultant recombinant proteins could react with S. hyicus ZC- 4 -infected swine serum. In mice, both acetate kinase and enolase activated the immune response by increasing G-CSF and MCP- 5 expression, and acetate kinase further activated the immune response by increasing IL- 12 expression. Enolase can confer better protection against S. hycius than acetate kinase in mice. For the first time to our knowledge, our results provide detailed descriptions of the cellular and secreted proteins of S. hyicus strain ZC- 4.

There was no increase in the incidence of isolates from pigs 12 days after weaning when the lesions of necrotic ear syndrome first developed, nor was there any correlation between the carrier status for S. hyicus and the likelihood of developing lesions. ^ The lesions, covered by thin scabs or thick brown crusts, developed nonrandomly as localized dermatitis at areas of trauma due to biting at the base or tip of the ear. S. hyicus along with large numbers of (beta) -hemolytic streptococci were consistently recovered from the lesions in pigs from five different swine herds. Fifty percent of the lesions healed and the balance progressed to severe necrotic ulcers. Deep ulceration developed secondarily to local cellulitis, vasculitis, thrombosis and ischemia of the auricular tissue. Initiation of the lesions depended on biting to damage the skin, but the progression to deep ulcers depended not on cannibalism but probably on local bacterial infection of the site. Histologic examination revealed numerous bacteria over the surface of ulcers, and streptococci deep in subcuticular abscesses. ^ A localized encrusted lesion, similar to the early crusted lesions of necrotic ear syndrome produced by the inoculation of S. hyicus - Sompolinsky and (beta) -hemolytic streptococci onto a local area of trauma, did not become deeply ulcerated and necrotic.
