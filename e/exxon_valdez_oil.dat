5|$|The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> spill {{adversely}} affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod {{disappeared in the}} following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered {{part of a larger}} population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} has {{at times}} been damaged due to sabotage, human error, maintenance failures, and natural disasters. By law, Alyeska {{is required to}} report significant oil spills to regulatory authorities. The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> spill is the best-known accident involving Alaska oil, {{but it did not}} involve the pipeline itself. Following the spill, Alyeska created a rapid response force that is paid for by the oil companies, including ExxonMobil, which was found liable for the spill.|$|E
5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E

50|$|Crude oil {{contamination}} in marine ecosystems {{can lead to}} both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs entering these ecosystems. Petrogenic PAHs can enter waterways through oil seeps, major oil spills, creosote and fuel oil runoff from urban areas. Pyrogenic PAH sources consist of diesel soot tire rubber and coal dust. Although there are natural sources of PAHs such as volcanic activity and seepage of coal deposits, anthropogenic sources pose the most significant input of PAHs into the environment. These anthroprogenic sources include residential heating, asphalt production, coal gasification, and petroleum usage. Petrogenic PAH contamination is more common from crude oil spills such as <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez,</b> or <b>oil</b> seeps; however, with runoff pyrogenic PAHs can also be prevalent. Although major oil spills such as <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> can introduce {{a large amount of}} crude oil to a localized area in a short time span, daily runoff comprises most of the oil pollution to marine ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition can also be a source of PAHs into marine ecosystems. The deposition of PAHs from the atmosphere into a water body is largely influenced by the gas-particle partitioning of the PAH.|$|R
40|$|On March 23, 1989, the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> crude <b>oil</b> tanker {{began its}} journey to Long Beach, California, which would {{become one of}} the most monumental marine {{accidents}} in the history of the United States of America. Shortly after midnight, just three hours after its departure from the port of Valdez, the vessel ran aground. It had struck a rock formation on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. The cause of the accident still has some uncertainty to this date, as the ship’s captain was unsuccessfully accused of being under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, and the ship’s third mate failed to return the ship to its designated shipping lane following iceberg manoeuvring. This disaster had significant environmental and economic consequences, but fortunately escaped any human consequences (although there were four deaths associated with the clean-up efforts). An estimated 250, 000 to 750, 000 barrels of crude oil spilled into the Alaskan waters, a fifth of the entire vessel’s storage capacity. Subsequent clean-up efforts lacked the required preparation and experience for such a massive undertaking. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E
5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.|$|E
25|$|In March 1989 the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef {{northwest}} of Cordova causing {{one of the}} most devastating environmental disasters in North America. The <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> <b>oil</b> spill severely affected the area's salmon and herring populations leading to a recession of the local fishing-reliant economy as well as disrupting the general ecology of the area. After many years of litigation, 450 million dollars were awarded for compensatory and punitive damages.|$|E
40|$|Though {{humans have}} {{over a century}} of {{experience}} with catastrophic marine and terrestrial oil spills, response plans and cleanup techniques are still active areas of research and development. This work evaluated the oil degradation potential {{and changes in the}} microbial community following nutrient additions in polluted marine sediment and desert soil. Biostimulation experiments on Alaskan beach sediment still contaminated by the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> tanker <b>oil</b> spill demonstrated that ambient air and hydrogen peroxide both serve as suitable sources of oxygen to stimulate aerobic microbial degradation of the oil. The addition of oxygen to the oil-contaminated sediment stimulated the growth of Proteobacteria, which made up 77 - 92 % of the population in the presence of ambient oxygen and 76 - 88 % with hydrogen peroxide. These experiments also revealed that sediment samples collected from a non-contaminated portion of the beach also contained a large fraction of microbial species that are known oil degraders. A phytoremediation experiment using mesquite trees in motor-oil-contaminated desert soil indicated that the use of compost as a soil amendment enhanced oil degradation, while biochar hindered degradation activity...|$|R

40|$|The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has damaged marine {{ecosystems}} and jeopardized endangered and commercial species under U. S. jurisdiction (see the figure). Agencies that manage protected species—including the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service—are tasked with recovering these populations. But many populations have not been adequately assessed, so recovery cannot be measured. Achieving mandated recovery goals depends on understanding both population trends and the demographic processes that drive those trends. After the 1989 <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> Alaskan <b>oil</b> spill, evaluations of effects on wildlife were ambiguous, in part because limited data on abundance and demography precluded detection of change (1). Sadly, {{the situation in the}} GoM is similar more than 20 years later. As concluded in the National Commission report on the BP spill (2) released 11 January, “Scientists simply do not yet know how to predict the ecological consequences and effects on key species that might result from oil exposure…” We argue that scientists know how to make these assessments, but lack critical data to achieve this goal...|$|R

40|$|A comprehensive, {{quantitative}} {{risk assessment}} is presented of the toxicological risks from buried <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> subsurface <b>oil</b> residues (SSOR) to a subpopulation of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) at Northern Knight Island (NKI) in Prince William Sound, Alaska, {{as it has been}} asserted that this subpopulation of sea otters may be experiencing adverse effects from the SSOR. The central questions in this study are: could the risk to NKI sea otters from exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in SSOR, as characterized in 2001 – 2003, result in individual health effects, and, if so, could that exposure cause subpopulation-level effects? We follow the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) risk paradigm by: (a) identifying potential routes of exposure to PAHs from SSOR; (b) developing a quantitative simulation model of exposures using the best available scientific information; (c) developing scenarios based on calculated probabilities of sea otter exposures to SSOR; (d) simulating exposures for 500, 000 modeled sea otters and extracting the 99. 9 % quantile most highly exposed individuals; and (e) comparing projected exposures to chronic toxicity reference values. Results indicate that, even under conservative assumptions in the model, maximum-exposed sea otters would not receive a dose of PAHs sufficient to cause any health effects; consequently, no plausible toxicological risk exists from SSOR to the sea otter subpopulation at NKI...|$|R

40|$|Major {{oil spills}} from tankers often result in severe {{localized}} damage. After the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez</b> grounded on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling approximately eleven {{million gallons of}} oil, the federal government passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), establishing a federal scheme of oil spill prevention, liability, contingency planning, and compensation. Although comprehensive, OPA also specifically allows states to determine their own liability schemes, and to enact other types of legislation. Washington State was {{the first state to}} enact stricter oil pollution prevention regulations than those contained in OPA. These regulations were challenged by the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko) in the fall of 1996. The Western District federal court for Washington held the regulations constitutional. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit determined that a few of the challenged rules were unconstitutional because they were design and construction standards, not operational standards. Rhode Island enacted similar regulations, which became effective June 1, 1997, after an oil spill fouled its coastline in 1996. This Comment discusses regulations relating to preventing catastrophic oil spills from tankers as a result of collisions, groundings, or similar accidents. The primary objective of this Comment is to propose a method for states to enact design, construction, and manning requirements to help prevent oil spills that would survive a federal preemption challenge. The proposed method is for states to enact the requirements as an alternative to unlimited liability. By voluntarily adopting the option, a tanker 2 ̆ 7 s potential liability {{in the event of a}} spill would be reduce and/or capped. The liability limit would be instituted once the vessel was found to be in compliance with the enacted requirements. Part Il of this Comment outlines tanker regulation in the United States since the grounding of the <b>Exxon</b> <b>Valdez,</b> highlighting <b>oil</b> spill prevention provisions and the state law savings clause under OPA. Part III discusses the actions that Washington has taken to help prevent tanker incidents since OPA was enacted. This includes a discussion of Washington 2 ̆ 7 s regulations and the Intertanko case. Finally, the Comment presents the proposed liability scheme and why it should survive a preemption challenge...|$|R
