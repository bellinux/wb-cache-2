5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to play the character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm {{not looking at the}} audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E
5000|$|... "Jaw Surgery" [...] - A skit where Jamie [...] "X'es" [...] his marks {{by pretending}} to <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> jaw surgery, {{and had to}} wear a metal-wire contraption that keeps his mouth open. He played {{different}} characters in different skits, but they <b>have</b> all <b>just</b> <b>had</b> the same gag.|$|R

5|$|When an {{ambulance}} is retired, {{it may be}} donated or sold to another EMS provider. Alternately, it may be adapted into a storage and transport vehicle for crime scene identification equipment, a command post at community events, or support vehicle, such as a logistics unit. Others are refurbished and resold, or may <b>just</b> <b>have</b> their emergency equipment removed {{to be sold to}} private businesses or individuals, who then can use them as small recreational vehicles.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Hoggett, the {{practice}} of being ruled {{by more than one}} individual may have been a common occurrence in East Anglia as it was for the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Kent and Northumbria. Ecgric and Sigeberht may have simultaneously ruled the peoples known as the North-folk and South-folk, who lived in the parts of their kingdom that would later become the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. However, Carver notes that Ecgric may not have reigned jointly with Sigeberht, but could <b>just</b> <b>have</b> plausibly ruled as a sub-king or served as an administrator within a region under East Anglian hegemony, only rising as king of the East Angles after Sigeberht's abdication.|$|E
5|$|Author John Green, {{though an}} Indianapolis native, {{was pleased with}} the {{selection}} of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to find a couple of flat streets.|$|E

5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
25|$|Groups <b>just</b> <b>have</b> one binary operation. To fully {{explain the}} {{behaviour}} {{of the different}} types of numbers, structures with two operators need to be studied. The most important of these are rings, and fields.|$|E
25|$|At lines 2428-2429 {{we learn}} that the young Bēowulf was fostered {{and raised in the}} home of Hreðel {{starting}} when he was seven years old; Ecgþēow may have died by then, or the family may <b>just</b> <b>have</b> been following a custom.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{putting up}} with Gibbs's current {{inconsistent}} streak may <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to be the pay-off South Africa have to make if it means he can help guide the national side to greater glory in two years time.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitutional}} language areas {{determine the}} official languages in their municipalities, {{as well as}} the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters. Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both. Thus the Flemings <b>just</b> <b>have</b> one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.|$|E
25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Stan {{ran in the}} Republican primary to {{represent}} Oregon’s 1st congressional district, {{at a time when}} his brother Jim was running for re-election in Oregon’s 5th Congressional district. One of six Republicans in the primary, he finished third in the race with Bill Witt winning the party’s nomination. During his campaign, he teamed up with his brother to run a joint commercial featuring two talking hamburger buns with the tag line “We <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to get our Bunns to Washington”.|$|E
25|$|Waterlining is slacklining over water. This is {{an ideal}} way to learn new tricks, or to <b>just</b> <b>have</b> more fun. Common places to set up waterlines are over pools, lakes, rivers, creeks, between pier or {{railroad}} track pillars, and boat docks. The slackline {{can be set up}} high over the surface of the water, close to the surface or even underneath the surface. It is important, however, that the water be deep enough, free from obstacles, and that the area should not be travelled by boats.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the size of the}} human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to wait while the brain grows and matures. That {{is the result of the}} birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.|$|E

25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, and you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|The first series, Ben, a dentist, and Susan, {{the worst}} cook in the world, are {{certainly}} loving, caring parents; they <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a problem showing it. Ben {{seems to be}} confused {{as to how much}} time and money his kids demand from him. Susan has to juggle motherhood, a career, and a husband and hasn't enough time to manage everything, including improving her cooking skills. Nick is always working on his next hair-brained scheme to keep him amused. Janey, like any normal teenage daughter, feels that her parents are seriously embarrassing whilst Michael keeps his head in his books {{to get away from the}} noise.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring {{a healthy}} weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people will <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
