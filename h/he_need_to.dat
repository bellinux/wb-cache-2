5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated <b>he</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E

However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should <b>he</b> <b>need</b> <b>to.</b> Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] {{has been}} labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz {{entitled}} Homer Simpson Goes to Washington, said this episode [...] "espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, {{and ultimately the}} American Dream." [...] Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through [...] "skillful" [...] use of satire, demonstrates with this episode [...] "insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)." [...] In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode [...] "willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics." [...] He said it [...] "attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions." [...] When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims [...] "The system works!" [...] Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening [...] "assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does <b>he</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head?
