500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
6000|$|Says I, [...] "Old man, I'll {{be frank}} with you. This AIN'T just as near {{my idea of}} bliss as I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>when</b> I {{used to go to}} church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't {{amount to}} much in your eyes. It isn't worth as much to me as I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> I found King had your promise--I hit the trail and I didn't care where it led, so it didn't double on itself. I didn't want to see or hear {{anything}} of you again. What became of King? Why did you turn him loose?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess we've {{dropped on}} {{to a big}} one this time," [...] he said. [...] "She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heavier <b>when</b> we heave her clear of the river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cheerful company?" [...] ses old Sam. 'Ow do {{you think}} company's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cheerful <b>when</b> you're {{carrying}} on like that, Bill? Why don't you go away and leave us alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{wherever}} a cruel blow falls {{there seems}} to be a woman for it to fall on. And you see what a refinement of cruelty this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> it reaches them? They have got to know that their father met that awful death, and that he met it because he was a defaulter and was running away. I suppose the papers will be full of it." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{here was}} the explanation. We were in a honeymoon district, in June--the most popular month in the whole year for marriage. Every {{two out of three}} couples found {{wandering}} about the New Forest in June are honeymoon couples; the third are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> they travel anywhere it is to the Isle of Wight. We both had on new clothes. Our bags happened to be new. By some evil chance our very umbrellas were new. Our united ages were thirty-seven. The wonder would have been had we NOT been mistaken for a young married couple.|$|E
6000|$|... "At first I {{made sure}} that, {{when we put}} into a port, I should be able somehow to make my {{condition}} known; but I realised {{for the first time}} what it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>when</b> I saw us stand off the Lizard and lay her head for the south. Up to that time I had scarcely exchanged a word with him. I had said at once that unless I had my meals in my own cabin with Anna, I would eat nothing at all, and he said, quite courteously, I must confess, that I should in all respects do as I pleased, consistent with safety.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] Abe said, [...] "that we {{have hit}} upon the richest spot in Californy. Ef it's {{like this on}} the surface, what <b>is</b> it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like <b>when</b> we {{get down to the}} bed rock?" ...|$|R
50|$|Mike Farrell {{asked that}} his character's {{daughter}}'s name be Erin, after his real-life daughter (the character's name <b>was</b> originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Melissa). <b>When</b> B.J. spoke on the telephone on-camera, Erin or his then-wife Judy were on the other end.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready in ten minutes. What a cyclone there <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> to-morrow <b>when</b> this piece of paper gets to work!... It's a {{pleasant}} old palace, this is; I wonder if we shall ever again --but never mind about that." ...|$|R
60|$|The judge {{showed the}} strangers the new graveyard, and the jail, {{and where the}} richest man lived, and the Freemasons' hall, and the Methodist church, and the Presbyterian church, and where the Baptist church was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> they got some money to build it with, and showed them the town hall and the slaughterhouse, and got out the {{independent}} fire company in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire; then he let them inspect the muskets of the militia company, and poured out an exhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors, and seemed very well satisfied with the responses he got, for the twins admired his admiration, and paid him back the best they could, though {{they could have done}} better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous experiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off a considerable part of the novelty in it.|$|E
60|$|Grandfather Frog {{actually}} grinned as {{he thought}} how surprised Farmer Brown's boy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> he could find no trace of him. Suddenly the smile seemed to freeze on Grandfather Frog's face. That whistle was coming nearer! Farmer Brown's boy had left the Long Lane and was coming along the little path. The truth is, he was coming for a drink at the spring, but Grandfather Frog didn't think of this. He was sure {{that in some way}} Farmer Brown's boy had found out which way he had gone and was coming after him. He crouched down as flat as he could on the big hummock and held his breath. Farmer Brown's boy went straight past. Just a few steps beyond, he stopped and knelt down. Peeping through the grass, Grandfather Frog saw him dip up beautiful clear water in an old cup and drink. Then Grandfather Frog knew just where the spring was.|$|E
6000|$|A little {{knowledge}} {{of the laws of}} heat would teach women not to clothe themselves and their children after foolish and insufficient fashions, which in this climate sow the seeds of a dozen different diseases, and have to be atoned for by perpetual anxieties, and by perpetual doctors' bills; and as for a {{little knowledge}} of the laws of electricity, one thrift I am sure it would produce--thrift to us men, of having to answer continual inquiries as to what the weather is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>when</b> a slight {{knowledge of the}} barometer, or of the form of the clouds and the direction of the wind, would enable many a lady to judge for herself, and not, after inquiry on inquiry, disregard all warnings, go out on the first appearance of a strip of blue sky, and come home wet through, with what she calls [...] "only a chill," [...] but which really means a nail driven into her coffin--a probable shortening, though it may be a very small one, of her mortal life; because the food of the next twenty-four hours, which should have gone to keep the vital heat at its normal standard, will have to be wasted in raising it up to that standard, from which it has fallen by a chill.|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. That's it; but it's started, and he's {{bound to}} keep on because he knows there's something. A man isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{satisfied}} <b>when</b> there's something he suspects about his wife, Charlie wouldn't never. He's clever, and he's jealous; and he's coming here.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's a {{particular}} friend of mine," [...] said Cecily with dignity. [...] "We have her in everything, {{and it would}} hurt her feelings dreadfully <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left out of this. Peter is no relation either, but he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here <b>when</b> we open it, so why shouldn't Sara?" ...|$|R
25|$|Columbus timed {{the eclipse}} with his hourglass, and {{shortly before the}} totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened {{indigenous}} people that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgiven. <b>When</b> the moon started to reappear from {{the shadow of the}} Earth, he told them that his god had pardoned them.|$|R

During World War II he served as a medic in the US Army.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} a little present, Nasmyth," [...] he announced. [...] "Firing by fuse <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{uncertain}} <b>when</b> there's so much spray about, and I sent down for this electric fixing.

6000|$|... "Yes, she will. We {{must make}} her want you. At any rate they'll {{understand}} this; if you don't stay for me, I shall come home even if it's {{in the middle}} of term.

5000|$|She's the {{ultimate}} fangirl who lives for boyband H.O.T. (when her exasperated father asks what she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> she grows up, her totally heartfelt answer: [...] "I'm {{going to be}} Tony oppa's wife!"). Shi-won is last place in her class and has her head firmly in the clouds, but she's also forthright and sassy.|$|E
50|$|In naval gunnery, when {{long-range}} guns became available, {{an enemy}} ship would move some distance after the shells were fired. It became necessary {{to figure out}} where the enemy ship, the target, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> the shells arrived. The process of keeping track of where the ship was likely to be was called rangekeeping, because the distance to the target—the range—was a very important factor in aiming the guns accurately. As time passed, train (also called bearing), the direction to the target, also became part of rangekeeping, but tradition kept the term alive.|$|E
5000|$|Corey Taylor gave {{a preview}} of what to expect from the song: [...] It's quite aggressive, and {{actually}} the label asked me if I would go in and tame stuff down and I was like, 'No.' I'm not doing that. This is going out the way it is and I'm not gonna touch it up. I'm not gonna have people looking for a song that doesn't exist. This {{is the way it is}} on the album, that's the way it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> we put it out to radio.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{features}} a short speech sample from John Lennon taken {{from one of}} his last interviews in 1980. The speech sample says: [...] "As Churchill said, it's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes. What's it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, vanish? Is it not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there <b>when</b> I get back?".|$|R
5000|$|.....two name {{faces to}} join the group. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> news <b>when</b> they happen, and if I only had the griff on it, if only I had it signed and sealed, I'd tell you. But until then I'm afraid it's all sham.

5000|$|The russepresident is {{responsible}} for about everything with the russ and to give an interview to a local newspaper and hold a speech on Constitution Day. The party coordinator organizes parties with different themes (for instance [...] "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> you're fully educated?", [...] "bad taste" [...] and [...] "halloween"). The newspaper editor and the journalists make a russenewspaper. The contraceptive responsible gets some thousand condoms from the Red Cross to pass out to the russ (The Red Cross decided to give away condoms for free to russ because of the massive increase in Chlamydia, Herpes and Gonorrhea after May one year).|$|E
5000|$|Jossa's first {{appearance}} was on 27 September 2010. Jossa {{said that when}} she first got the part of Lauren, she [...] "worried unnecessarily". Talking to PA, Jossa said that working with Joyner and Wood was not as scary as she thought. She commented: [...] "There was less pressure than I thought there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> I first started I got really scared and worked up, thinking everyone's going to hate me. They've been there four years and then I'm coming in to be their daughter - {{it was a bit}} surreal. And then two weeks later I felt completely comfortable, everyone was cracking jokes and I thought, 'Oh... I built it up a bit!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Vampster was {{impressed}} 2010 by the album Sabbat Noir and Monarch's [...] "undeviating path to dissolve any music into noise" [...] and states that [...] "neither Switchblade nor Black Shape of Nexus, Corrupted, Black Boned Angel, Nadja or Moss deliver more vehement antimusic than Monarch". Beside the band's extremism the reviewer is recognizing something new too: [...] "This is what sludge is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>when</b> one keeps moving along way outside drone doom, {{to try something}} different. … The fact is neither drone nor doom can be more extreme without turning to pure noise. Monarch pay tribute to Black Sabbath also by making earth shaking music and in trying something new {{with a lot of}} courage and a portion of madness not to underrate …".|$|E
