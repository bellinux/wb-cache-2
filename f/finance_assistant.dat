40|$|The {{efficacy}} of expert systems often {{depends on the}} accuracy and completeness of the problem specification negotiated with the user. Therefore, efficient user interfaces are needed, in order to assist the user in identifying and supplying the required data. Our approach {{presented in this paper}} is based on the utilisation of conversational interfaces, giving users the possibility of interacting with the system by means of natural language. Through the use of flexible dialogue management plans and an advanced problem solving strategy based on case based reasoning and information retrieval, efficient user guidance during the interaction with an expert system can be achieved. Thus, the user can interactively develop a comprehensive and coherent specification of his problem, based on clarifications, explanations, and context-based factual information provided by the system. As an application framework we introduce the EU-funded Project VIP-Advisor whose objective is the development of a virtual insurance and <b>finance</b> <b>assistant</b> capable of natural language interaction...|$|E

40|$|Little {{success has}} been {{achieved}} in <b>financing</b> <b>assistant</b> programmes for contractors in developing countries. This paper focuses {{on the experience of}} the Bank for Housing and Construction (BHC) of Ghana. Factors accountable for underachievement of its programme include: contractor's lack of managerial and technical capability; inability to obtain contracts; persistent delayed payments by major clients; and the deliberate refusal to repay loans. Suggestions offered for improving the effectiveness of programmes, on the academic and practical front, relate well with developments in small and medium-size enterprise (SME) finance. A survey in Ghana found that there was a strong desire to establish a contractors' bank. There would be the need for the contractors association to reform before it could play a meaningful role in the proposed bank. The importance of effective governance in achieving success cannot be overemphasized, likewise the role of government and donors in encouraging the setting up of a conducive regulatory framework.
