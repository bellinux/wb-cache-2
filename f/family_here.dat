25|$|He married Maria Giuseppe del Monaco, {{and they}} had a child, Michael, born in Barletta in 1801. After that he was {{probably}} in Bologna and Trieste for a brief stay; by the summer of 1806, fresh from his studies of counterpoint, cello and guitar in Italy, he had moved to Vienna without his <b>family.</b> <b>Here</b> he began a relationship with the Viennese Anna Wiesenberger (1784–1817), with whom he had four daughters, Maria Willmuth (born 1808), Aloisia Willmuth (born 1810), Emilia Giuliani (born 1813) and Karolina Giuliani (born 1817).|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in the village of Santa Ana Chiautempan, Tlaxcala in 1858. He was a good student, but {{after the death of his}} father, he was obliged to quit school to work to {{maintain}} his mother and sister. Eventually he lived in Mexico City, where he was hired to do some carpentry work at the house of a wealthy <b>family.</b> <b>Here</b> met and fell in love with one of the young women there named Matilde. She was an orphan living with aunt and uncle at the house. He got her pregnant but never married her since he was poor.

25|$|For this reason, {{many from}} this {{municipality}} {{and others from}} the Sierra Gorda, have migrated out to cities in Mexico and to the United States in order to work. The municipality estimates that about 35% of its population has migrated abroad, equaling about 8 thousand people. Others suggest the numbers are even higher, with an estimate of four people in the United States for each <b>family</b> <b>here.</b> No one knows exactly how many {{from the state of}} Querétaro have gone to the U.S. to work or the amount which is sent back in remittances each year. However, it is estimated that the Sierra Gorda region receives between 50,000 and 100,000 USD per day or 18.2 million dollars each year. This is larger than the municipal budget of Pinal de Amoles. These remittances have come to overshadow earnings made locally from small shops, livestock and agriculture. In Pinal de Amoles and other areas of the Sierra Gorda, the dollar {{has become part of the}} economy, especially around Christmas when many come back to visit families for the holiday season. This has led to many businesses accepting the dollar as a medium of exchange in many businesses including restaurants and bars. Many families now use it as a regional currency. However, remittance money sent back can vary depending on economic and political factors. As of January 2011, the amount sent back to the Sierra Gorda fell about forty percent. Officials blame the security situation on the US-Mexican border, with many younger people in the US not visiting during the Christmas season.|$|E
500|$|Alexander H. Smith related a {{story of}} how unique {{circumstances}} {{led to the development}} of a local superstition about the species:... the members of a <b>family</b> <b>here</b> in Ann Arbor were poisoned, some fatally, as the result of eating caps of a species of Amanita. The next year Volvaria bombycina fruited on a maple tree at the home of these people, and the story was circulated that some of the spores of the poisonous fungus, which caused the deaths the year before, had escaped from the house, lodged in the tree, germinated, grew and were now producing fruiting bodies. Consequently the carpophores of the Volvaria were held in great awe by the neighbors, and soon came to be referred to as the [...] "ghost mushroom". No one, of course, would consider eating them.|$|E

[...] Robinson explained his decision to stay at Michigan: [...] "This is my family. [...] This is my home now. ... I couldn't let it go."
