Del Toro remarked that the [...] "legendary rebel" [...] was still pertinent because [...] "the things that he fought for in the late 1950s and mid 1960s are still relevant today", adding that [...] "he did not hide behind curtains ... he stood up for the forgotten ones".

500|$|As a senator, Palpatine is [...] "unassuming, yet ambitious".

Despite this, he has many allies in the government. Luceno writes, [...] "What Palpatine lacked in charisma, he made up for in candor, {{and it was that}} directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate. ... For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms, with a clear sense of right and wrong." [...] In Terry Brooks' , Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles. He tells Queen Amidala, [...] "I promise, Your Majesty, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> elected , I will restore democracy to the Republic.

500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E
