5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E

5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> researchers to reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> precise dating of the track, {{showing it}} was built in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E

5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|The cave temples, {{numbered}} 1 to 4 in {{the order}} of their creation, in the town of Badamithe capital city of the Chalukya kingdom (also known as Early Chalukyas)are dated from the late 6th century onwards. The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the dedication of the shrine by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579CE). The inscription, written in the old Kannada language, <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.|$|E
5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the Eurasian crag martin reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> breeding expansion into lowland areas, {{particularly for the}} two tropical species, and the rock martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E

5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who are unaware of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E
5|$|With {{the switch}} to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> easier serving and better defense on both wings with less shanks. However this has diminished his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot. Since his {{comeback}} in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited {{as the reason for}} his defeat of Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th Round.|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records suggest this site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of skilled workers in Jordan {{is among the}} highest in the region in sectors such as ICT and industry, due to a relatively modern educational system. This has attracted large foreign investments to Jordan and <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> the country to export its workforce to Persian Gulf countries. Flows of remittances to Jordan grew rapidly, particularly during the end of the 1970s and 1980s, and remains an important source of external funding. Remittances from Jordanian expatriates were $3.8 billion in 2015, a notable rise in the amount of transfers compared to 2014 where remittances reached over $3.66 billion listing Jordan as fourth largest recipient in the region.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel nests in burrows {{which are}} visited only at night, to {{the accompaniment of}} their {{haunting}} calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting during the day while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults have been subject to predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, <b>has</b> <b>enabled</b> the population to recover to 6580 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.|$|E
