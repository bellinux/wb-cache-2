50|$|In the 1840s the world's first dental {{school and}} {{national}} dental organization were established. Along {{with the first}} dental school came {{the establishment of the}} Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, often referred to as a DDS degree. In response to the rise in new dentists as well as <b>dentistry</b> <b>techniques,</b> the first dental practice act was established to regulate dentistry. In the United States, the First Dental Practice Act required dentists to pass each specific states medical board exam in order to practice dentistry in that particular state. However, because the dental act was rarely enforced, some dentists did not obey the act. From 1846-1855 new dental techniques were being invented {{such as the use of}} ester anesthesia for surgery, and the cohesive gold foil method which enabled gold to be applied to a cavity. The American Dental Association was established in 1859 after a meeting with 26 dentists. Around 1867, the first university associated dental school was established, Harvard Dental School. Lucy Hobbs Taylor was the first woman to earn a dental degree. In the 1880s, tube toothpaste was created which replaced the original forms of powder or liquid toothpaste. New dental boards, such as the National Association of Dental Examiners, were created to establish standards and uniformity among dentist. In 1887 the first dental laboratory was established; dental laborites are used to create dentures and crowns that are specific to each patient. In 1895 the dental X-ray was discovered by a German physicist, Wilhelm Rontgen.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Dental ScienceThroughout {{the centuries}} man {{has shown a}} desire to {{preserve}} his dentition. Despite {{on the one hand}} the influences of tribal rituals upon early tooth loos in primitive man and on the other effects of the dental caries and more recently the increase in traumatic injuries in civilized communities, the trend towards preservation continues. Teeth which were once doomed because of excessive loss of coronal tooth substance may now be restored due to advances in both materials technology and operative <b>dentistry</b> <b>techniques</b> particularly throughout the last two decades. Likewise those with endodontic involvement may in the majority of cases now be restored to biological compatibility with the supporting tissues. This has been achieved due to the scientific and technological advances which have taken place in the science of endontology in a like period. The role played by the endontist in conservative dental therapy has increased markedly in recent years. The majority of large population centres in the western world contain practitioners who have attained specialist skills in the science and who thus provide a specialist service to their colleagues. Throughout the same period, the interest shown by the dental profession at large is demonstrated by the growth of societies and study clubs devoted to the exclusive study of endontology. Parallel with this, dental schools throughout the world have included the study of endontics within their curriculae both at the undergraduate and at the graduate level and learned societies and dental associations continue to make provision for courses of lectures in endontics at dental meetings and congresses...|$|E

40|$|A hybrid denture is {{one that}} is {{fabricated}} over a metal framework and retained by screws threaded into the implant abutments. The anterior part of a mandibular hybrid denture is fixed on implants while the posterior part of the denture is extended and cantilevered from implants. This article presents the fabrication of a maxillary over-denture opposing mandibular implant retained hybrid prosthesis. A total of four implants were placed in the mandibular arch. Castable abutments were used to produce the optimal angulations. Framework was waxed, cast recovered, and the fit was refined until the framework seated passively on the master cast. The mandibular denture teeth were waxed to the hybrid framework, and a final wax try-in was performed to verify and correct maxillomandibular relations before processing. The prosthesis was inserted after verification of occlusion, retention, and stability. The rehabilitation of edentulous patients with hybrid dentures has been observed to achieve greater masticatory function and psychological satisfaction than with conventional over-dentures. Producing a passive-fitting substructure for a fixed removable screw retained hybrid prosthesis is arguably one of the most technically complex tasks in implant <b>dentistry.</b> The <b>technique</b> presented may not initially produce a perfectly passive framework, but use of disclosing media and adjusting the internal aspect of the casting can result in non-binding, fully seated prostheses...|$|R
40|$|The age {{estimation}} method {{as described by}} Demirjian is {{the most frequently used}} tool to estimate the sub-adult dental age in forensic <b>dentistry.</b> This <b>technique</b> has been shown to over or under estimate the chronological age of sub-adults when applied to specific population groups. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare a black South African population sample with the original French-Canadian model to determine if Demirjian’s method accurately reflects the true chronological age of this population group. A sample of panoramic radiographs from 279 boys and 325 girls between the ages of 6 and 16 was obtained from the School of Dentistry University of Pretoria, and from orthodontists in private practice in the Pretoria region. The panoramic radiographs were used to score the seven left mandibular teeth. The calculated maturity score was used to determine the Demirjian dental age. All panoramic radiographs were scored by one examiner. A subset of 20 panoramic radiographs was scored by a second examiner and reliability tested using a Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test. This research showed that black South African children have a more advanced dental age compared to French-Canadian children. Demirjian overestimated the age for boys by 0. 8 years and for girls by 0. 5 years. The dental age assessment provided by Demirjian is not suitable for black South African children. As a result, new standards of dental age assessment should be established for this population. CopyrightDissertation (MSc(Odont)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionVertical defects of the anterioral veolar ridge are {{challenging}} cases in implant <b>dentistry.</b> Various <b>techniques,</b> such as onlay bone grafting, segmental osteotomy (SO) oral veolar distraction osteogenesis (ADO), {{have been suggested}} to manage those situations. ADO has an advantage of being capable of enhancing both hard and soft tissue simultaneously. Presentation of caseOne of the possible complications of ADO is rotation ortilting the transport segment (TS). In this report, we present a 30 -year old woman who had a severe anterior vertical deficiency. ADO was started to manage the case, but advancement of the TS lagged {{on the left side}} and the segment rotated. A SO was planned and the lagged side was corrected. Two years after the surgery, hard and soft tissue gains were found to be preserved. DiscussionVertical alveolar bone deficiencies {{are challenging}} cases for dental implantology. Alveolar DO promotes soft tissue along with hard tissue, and the bone regeneration process and shows lower infection rates and greater stability over the long term. However, the technique has some disadvantages and can lead to complications, such as breaking of the distraction device, nerve injury or paresthesia, fracture of transport bone, hematoma, wound dehiscence, severe bleeding, and even jaw fractures. Deviation of the TS from the distraction path is another undesired situation. The rigidity of the device, the width of the mucosa, the volume of the transport and anchor segments, and the amount of augmentation can affect vector deviation. ConclusionWe suggest that SO can be used in similar cases in which TS could not be distracted on a straight vector line...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : In {{this era}} of {{preventive}} <b>dentistry,</b> many <b>techniques</b> are available for prevention of caries, such as plaque control, use of systemic and local fluorides and pit and fissure sealants. The rationale of pit and fissure sealants is that, when they are applied into the caries prone fissures, they penetrate and seal them from the oral environment. This study aims to correlate {{the relationship between the}} viscosity of the sealant, resin tag length and microleakage. Materials and Methods : 30 third molars were selected for study. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group E: Embrace wetbond, H: Helioseal, G: Guardian seal. Teeth were cleaned with pumice prophylaxis and pretreated with acid etching and bonding agent. The respective pit and fissure sealants were applied. Teeth were placed in 1 % methylene blue dye and sectioned mesio-distally into two halves. These were used to assess the microleakage using stereomicroscope and resin tag length using SEM. Viscosity was assessed using Brooke′s field viscometer. Results : Viscosity was lowest for Embrace wetbond and highest for Guardian seal. Microleakage scores were highest with Guardian seal and lowest with Embrace wetbond. Resin tag lengths were longer with Embrace wetbond as compared to other groups. There is a definite negative correlation between viscosity, resin tag length and microleakage. Lower the viscosity, the longer were the resin tags and the microleakage decreased. Embrace wetbond pit and fissure sealant had lowest viscosity, longest resin tag length and lowest microleakage scores. Conclusion : Embrace wetbond appears to be compatible with residual moisture and ideal for use in children, where isolation is a problem...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gingival {{recession}} involves both {{soft tissue}} and hard tissue loss. In this evolutionary era of <b>dentistry,</b> newer <b>techniques</b> have evolved for complete coverage of isolated recession defects. Since 2012, vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA) technique was used with various regenerative membranes to treat multiple recession defects (MRDs). Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane, {{a pool of}} growth factors but have any added advantage to recession coverage techniques is controversial. Thus, in this case series, we compare the effect of VISTA with or without PRF-membrane {{for the treatment of}} Classes I and III MRDs. Subjects and Methods: Four patients between of age 30 and 40 years (two patients having bilateral Class I and another two having bilateral Class III MRDs) were selected from the Department of Periodontics, ITS Dental College, Greater Noida and designated as Case I–IV simultaneously. Recession defects at antagonist sites in each patient were corrected by VISTA approach with or without PRF-membrane. Recorded clinical parameters included recession depth, recession width, pocket probing depth, and clinical attachment level (CAL) at baseline and 6 months postoperatively. Results: Patients having Class I recession defects showed almost complete root coverage with VISTA technique alone and reflected no added advantage of PRF-membrane. However, patients with Class III recession defects treated with VISTA + PRF-membrane showed more reduction in recession depth and gain in CAL as compared to sites treated with VISTA only. Conclusion: VISTA alone is a convenient technique for treatment of Class I MRDs. Addition of PRF-membrane for Class III recession defects give better outcome in term of reduction of recession depth and gain in CAL 6 month postoperatively...|$|R

Purpose: The aim of this study was to verify the reasons for placement and replacement of direct restorations in patients treated in the Dental Clinic of the Uberaba University - Brazil. Materials and Methods: This study evaluated 306 restorative procedures carried out on 60 patients. During the treatment planning, a form that contained information about the patient′s gender, tooth number, the classification of restorations, the reasons for placement and replacement of amalgam and tooth-colored restorations, the material that had to be removed and the new material used to fill the cavities was filled for each patient. Statistical analysis was carried out using Chi-square test (α = 0. 05). Results: The data showed that most of the patients were female (66. 7 %). Of all the restorations placed, 60. 45 % were 1 st -time placements, while 39. 55 % were replacements. For 1 st -time restorations, the main reason for placement was primary caries (76. 76 %), followed by non-carious cervical lesions (15. 14 %). The amalgam restorations were replaced more frequently (67. 77 %). The primary reason for replacements was the presence of secondary caries (for both previous amalgam (42. 68 %) and composite (66. 67 %) restorations (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Alveolar ridge {{prophylaxis}} {{immediately upon}} tooth extraction may reduce such sequelae for both, the treating dentist and the patient. Attempts to reduce alveolar bone resorption {{have included the}} placement of natural roots, root analogues, and immediate implants into the extraction socket, sometimes in combination with membrane or graft techniques. Various materials are used in modern dental and maxillofacial surgery for bone tissue substitution and reconstruction. All osteoplastic materials {{can be divided into}} four groups by origin: autogenic, allogenic, xenogenic and synthetic. The development of new medical technologies enables use of achievements in material science, biochemistry, molecular biology and genetic engineering while creating new combined synthetic materials for bone grafting. Alveolar ridge resorption has long been considered an unavoidable consequence of tooth extraction. Atrophy of the alveolar bone may cause significant esthetic and surgical problems in implantation, as well as at prosthetic and restorative <b>dentistry.</b> Guided bone-regeneration <b>techniques</b> and the use of bone-replacement materials have been shown to enhance socket healing and potentially modify the resorption process. In the current review of the literature, techniques for alveolar ridge preservation are discussed. This review describes the socket preservation, and the various techniques and materials used for extraction site grafting. Synthetic resorbable materials were intended as an inexpensive substitute for natural hydroxyapatite (HAP). Synthetic graft materials include various types of calcium phosphate ceramics: tribasic calcium phosphate; bioglass; HAP and its compositions with collagen, sulphated glycosaminoglycans such as keratan and chrondroitin sulphate as well as with sulphate and calcium phosphate. Now, many various forms of porous nanostructured calcium phosphate ceramics, bone cements, biohybrids and biocomposite compounds have been created on the basis of HAP. ...|$|R
