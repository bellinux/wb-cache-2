5|$|Chloe, to her distress, {{does not}} become {{pregnant}} immediately. Chris vainly tries to track down Nola, but meets her by chance some time later at the Tate Modern. He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, Chris asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying {{that she wants to}} raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> outside his office and he just barely escapes public detection.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} Brian decides {{to meet again}} with Arielle. She gives him a hotel key and in the evening at the hotel room they consummate their relationship. They begin to meet {{regularly}} at the same hotel room in the evenings. Valéry, who is aware of Brian's affair with Arielle, approaches <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and invites Brian to his house for dinner. At dinner, Brian meets Arielle and Valéry's children and is introduced to Valéry's lover, a 25-year-old editor named Jane (Olivia Thirlby). Arielle later meets Brian's parents, Sam (Frank Langella) and Arlene (Glenn Close). Upon learning that Arielle is a married mother of two, Sam tells Brian that he disapproves of the relationship, while Arlene accepts that they love each other despite the circumstances. When Brian is invited to a New Yorker ceremony to receive an award {{for one of his}} short stories, he is joined by Arielle, Valéry, Jane, and his parents. Jane tells Brian that her boss Galassi (Eric Stoltz), a publisher, has read his story and wants Brian to write a novel.|$|E
500|$|... "Sussudio" [...] {{is one of}} Collins' {{most famous}} songs and is {{referenced}} in many different media, including books, stand-up comedy acts and television shows. He has {{said that this is}} the song people most often sing to him when they spot <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> In the book and film adaptation of American Psycho, the main character (Patrick Bateman) briefly discusses it, amongst other work by Collins. The synthesizer riff was heavily criticised for sounding too much like Prince's 1982 song [...] "1999", a similarity that Collins does not deny, citing that he is a big fan of Prince's work.|$|E

500|$|Joshua Abraham Norton, an Englishman who {{emigrated to}} San Francisco, California in 1849, proclaimed himself [...] "Emperor of These United States" [...] in 1859, later adding the title [...] "Protector of Mexico". [...] Though never {{recognized}} by the U.S. or Mexican governments, he was accorded {{a certain degree of}} deference within San Francisco itself, including reserved balcony seats (for which he was never charged) at local theatres, and salutes by policemen who passed <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> [...] Specially printed currency authorized by Norton was accepted as legal tender within several businesses in the city. [...] When Norton died in 1880, he was given a lavish funeral attended by over 30,000 persons.|$|E
500|$|Due to its popularity, The Walking Dead has {{inspired}} dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels like Bad Lip Reading and TV {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and Mad TV. Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled [...] "La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum". The series' cast was shown the parody at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, and David Morrisseywho portrays the Governor reacted by saying he now understood {{why so many people}} would walk up to <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and blurt, [...] "Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!". Until seeing the video, he had wondered, [...] "what's wrong with these people?" [...] The Walking Dead has also been represented as a live comedy performance by English comedian Dan Willis at the Edinburgh Festival.|$|E
500|$|The final rehearsal, or {{the first}} {{for some of the}} participants, was {{combined}} with the concert soundcheck, at Madison Square Garden, late on 31 July. Both Dylan and Clapton finally appeared at the soundcheck that night. Even then, Clapton was {{in the early stages of}} heroin withdrawal – only a cameraman supplying him with some methadone would result in the English guitarist taking the stage the following day, after his young girlfriend had been unsuccessful in purchasing uncut heroin for <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> To Harrison's frustration, Dylan was having severe doubts about performing in such a big-event atmosphere and still would not commit to playing. [...] "Look, it's not my scene, either," [...] Harrison countered. [...] "At least you've played on your own in front of a crowd before. I've never done that." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 1972, {{after a few}} guest {{spots in}} Cambridge with ex-Pink Fairies member Twink on drums and Jack Monck on bass using the name The Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band (backing visiting blues {{musician}} Eddie [...] "Guitar" [...] Burns and also featuring Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith), the trio formed a short-lived band called Stars. Though they were initially well received at gigs in the Dandelion coffee bar and the town's Market Square, one of their gigs at the Corn Exchange in Cambridge with the MC5 proved to be disastrous. A few days after this final show, Twink recalled that Barrett stopped <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> showed him a scathing review of the gig they had played, and quit on the spot, despite having played at least one subsequent gig at the same venue supporting Nektar.|$|E
500|$|Bacon's {{relationships}} {{prior to}} Dyer {{had all been}} with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself, but each had been the dominating presence. Peter Lacy, his first lover, would often tear up the young artist's paintings, beat him up in drunken rages, and leave <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> half-conscious. Bacon was attracted to Dyer's vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon's self-confidence and his artistic success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man. Dyer was, like Bacon, a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance. Pale-faced and a chain-smoker, Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again. His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality; the art critic Michael Peppiatt described him as having {{the air of a}} man who could [...] "land a decisive punch". Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair, and by 1970, Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk.|$|E
500|$|Juster {{quit his}} job {{so that he could}} work on the book. His {{imagination}} fired by a boy who approached <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and with whom he discussed the nature of infinity, Juster wanted to finish the story about [...] "a boy who asked too many questions" [...] before returning to the book on cities. Juster shared his house in Brooklyn Heights with cartoonist Jules Feiffer whose bedroom was immediately below, and who could hear him pacing in the night. Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend's insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a book about a boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride. Sheftel got Jason Epstein, an innovative editor at Random House with a deep appreciation for children's literature, to agree to review the manuscript. Some at Random House considered the book's vocabulary too difficult: at the time, educators advised against children's literature containing words the target audience did not already know, fearing the unfamiliar would discourage young learners. Based on seven chapters of manuscript, plus a three-page outline {{of the rest of the}} story, Epstein bought the book.|$|E
5000|$|The oddly {{shaped and}} expensively (if not tastelessly) dressed schoolmaster, slowly {{walking with a}} cane and always smoking, became a target of tabloids and cartoonists. Boys taunted <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> {{shouting}} [...] "Atzpe! Atzpe!" [...] (incorrectly pronouncing Slovenian Ažbe in German). Ažbe's own German was not perfect either; he, particularly, abused the word nähmlich ("namely", [...] "that is...") and was called [...] "Professor Nähmlich". He normally spoke German in Munich but used Slovenian language in a Slavic company.|$|R
60|$|Her {{life with}} him, so {{soon as the}} first novelty of her had worn off, had been unspeakable. The band that she wore round her neck was to hide where, {{in a fit of}} savagery, because she had refused to earn money for <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> he had tried to cut her throat. Now that she had got back to England she {{intended}} to leave him. If he followed and killed her she did not care.|$|R

2500|$|O'Neill's {{emergence}} as a cultural figure was not restricted to commercials. Four years before his retirement, he had a cameo role in the February 17, 1983, episode of Cheers entitled [...] "No Contest", which featured him ducking into the bar to escape a woman who pestered <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> about his political ideals. The show, which was ranked 60th in the Nielsen ratings at that time, jumped 20 places the following week. He appeared in an [...] episode of the NBC sitcom Silver Spoons, which featured him delivering a mock press conference praising recurring character Freddy Lippincottleman's {{efforts on behalf of}} the homeless. O'Neill also made a brief appearance in the 1993 film Dave as himself, assessing the work of the fictional American President in the movie. He also did narration for a segment of the Ken Burns series Baseball in which O'Neill, a lifelong Red Sox fan, read The Boston Globe from the day the Red Sox won the 1918 World Series.|$|E

When Judge Dredd promoted him to head of SJS at 301, Garcia became Buell's deputy. She was probably the closest Buell had to a friend {{both before and after}} his appointment to the SJS. Naturally she became deputy head of SJS for <b>the</b> city <b>on</b> his next promotion.|$|R

2500|$|He {{continues}} his mission {{around the city}} in search of Marlo, limping and supporting his weight on a makeshift crutch improvised from a [...] broom. He terrorizes and robs many of Marlo's corners and shoots or kills several members of Stanfield's crew including Savino Bratton. Instead of keeping the drugs or money for himself, he destroys them each time to show that his motive is vengeance, not profit. [...] At the scene of every action, Omar calls out loudly for Marlo to meet <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b>|$|R
