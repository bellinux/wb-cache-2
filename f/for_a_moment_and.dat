5|$|Moving back to 1919, {{the elderly}} Raoul visits Christine's gravesite and places {{the music box}} near her tombstone. He stands in silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> then turns to leave, but stops upon noticing a fresh red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem {{lying on the ground}} with Christine's {{engagement}} ring attached to it; implying that the Phantom still lives and still loves Christine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro and the {{children}} start marching and playing their instruments through downtown Los Angeles. The individuals walking in Los Angeles stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> look towards the sky, which is cut off screen. As close-up shots of Amuro finish {{by the end of}} the bridge section of the song, the camera pans towards rainbow-coloured clouds, which puts all the citizens in surprise and glee. The final chorus has Amuro {{and the children}} dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E
25|$|One {{police officer}} then {{drove down the}} road past Seascape and past the {{disabled}} car of Linda White. He looked at it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> continued down to the Fox and Hound. After he informed his partner, they proceeded back to Seascape. At about 2:00p.m., they were back at Seascape and could see the BMW on fire. At some point, they were fired upon, and eventually had to hide in a ditch {{at the side of}} the road. Bryant fired at them whenever they tried to escape, and they were not able to move from that position for many hours.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, either June 17 or 18, {{the band}} of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips {{decided to go to}} his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> once inside he heard the sound of musket fire outside. Phillips, mortally wounded, fell to the ground, struck by two musket balls. The band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1847 crisis, invalids {{were placed}} in {{hospitals}} while the healthy carried out their quarantine periods in sheds. However, in 1847 the island was quickly overwhelmed. Tents were set up to house the influx of people, but many new arrivals were left {{lying on the ground}} without shelter. Robert Whyte records seeing 'hundreds... literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land as they could'. The Anglican Bishop of Montreal, Bishop Mountain, recalled seeing people lying opposite the church screaming for water, while others lay inside the tents without bedding. One child he saw was covered in vermin; another who had 'been walking with some others, sat down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> died'. Many children were orphaned.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{comes home}} briefly. He tells {{his wife that}} he has been {{entrusted}} with holding a secret pre-conference meeting at his home with a foreign diplomat who is arriving that night and he leaves to meet them. The room is empty <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> Costello re-enters through the French windows. Like Jeremy before, he starts to go through the contents of the desk with the secret drawer. Behind him, the door of the hidden recess opens and an unseen hand clubs him down. He falls to the ground behind a sofa. After Clarissa shows her husband off, she re-enters the room and soon finds the body of Costello. Almost instantly Pippa comes through the hidden recess and starts babbling hysterically that she is responsible. Clarissa tries to calm her down while wondering what she will do...|$|E

25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E
25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she thought she saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a belief}} that General Cornwallis's sword, {{surrendered}} by Charles O'Hara after the battle, is to this day {{on display at the}} White House. However, U.S. National Park Service historian Jerome Green, in his 2005 history of the siege, The Guns of Independence, concurs with the 1881 centennial account by Johnston, noting simply that when Brigadier General O'Hara presented the sword to Major General Lincoln, [...] "he held it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> immediately returned it to O'Hara." ...|$|E

500|$|At school, {{three days}} before the science fair, Lisa leaves her giant tomato under Bart's care <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> he takes the {{opportunity}} to hurl it at Skinner's butt. When Lisa sees what Bart has done with her project, she is annoyed. She asks Marge for help, who suggests she run a hamster through a maze. Lisa takes the idea to heart, but instead of just testing the intelligence of a mammal, she pits the hamster against [...] Bart to find out who is smarter. After two simple tests, the hamster leads two to zero.|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} is notable for its views, its location, and its cuisine, especially its hamburgers. Zagat lists Park Grill {{as one of}} the [...] "choice outdoor spots in town."

[...] In the 2006/07 and 2008/09 editions, Zagats respondents ranked it among the best of Chicago in the [...] "Outdoors" [...] and [...] "Views" [...] categories and lauded its fireplace.|$|E
500|$|... "Turn Up the Radio" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American recording artist Madonna for her twelfth studio album, MDNA (2012).

The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album on June 29, 2012. The single was also released as a digital EP, and included a remix featuring the group Far East Movement. A dance song with French house composition, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] is an energetic song where Madonna asks the listener and herself to stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> escape the realities of life.|$|E

500|$|A Billboard {{reviewer}} praised [...] "What Now" [...] {{and called}} the song an [...] "emotional highlight on an album filled with moments of resonance in its second half." [...] Giovanny Caquias of Culture Blues wrote that the song feels like the first [...] "candid" [...] and [...] "insightful" [...] track on Unapologetic. He continued, [...] "Rihanna gets a little introspective on What Now, and doesn’t resort to being overtly sexual or defiantly callous (more on that later), which gave me the feeling that she stripped away her armor <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> actually allowed herself to be 'real'." [...] Daily News Jim Farber wrote that the song shows a heft.|$|E
500|$|NHRA ranked him 14th {{on their}} Top 50 drivers in 2001. He was {{inducted}} in the NHRA Drag Racing Hall of Fame in 1978, and the Texas Motor Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2000, he was inducted in Don Garlits' International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Hill {{was inducted into}} the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2002. After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they called and told me I was being inducted along with some of the people I admired most growing up. It gives you reason to pause <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> reflect that maybe some good was accomplished along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Suddenly {{she sat up}} in her bed {{and looked}} {{from one to the}} other of us with wide, frightened eyes," [...] wrote Eagar. [...] "She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E

500|$|As the Marines {{formed into}} a horseshoe-shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura's {{battalion}} {{began a series}} of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below {{the east side of the}} ridge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops hoisted a [...] "regimental" [...] gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which [...] "could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese," [...] however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the Paramarines swept forward, killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson's command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William J. McKennan, [...] "The Japanese attack was almost constant, like a rain that subsides <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> then pours the harder... When one wave was mowed down – and I mean mowed down – another followed it into death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Termination: If {{you don't}} want your subject {{to know what}} you are doing, you simply {{distract}} their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate.
