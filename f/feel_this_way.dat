Jug {{responds}} that it is normal for a patient to <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> about his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E

2500|$|Madetoja {{continued}} to <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> throughout his life. A decade later, {{he sought to}} defend Sibelius against the (growing) conventional wisdom {{that he was a}} poor teacher around whom no appreciable school of thought had formed (unlike, for example, Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School). In Aulos, a volume published on the occasion of Sibelius's sixtieth birthday in 1925, Madetoja argued for a more nuanced, less [...] "superficial" [...] definition of the word 'teacher' and recounted with fondness his personal experiences as one of Sibelius's pupils.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} assumed that the years Maugham spent {{studying}} medicine were a creative dead end, but Maugham did not <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> about this time.

40|$|Many authors, in {{this issue}} of the OSBR and elsewhere, {{highlight}} the relative lack of women entrepreneurs and suggest ways that we can overcome the challenges women face so that we can increase the numbers. However, I wish to offer another perspective.

He correctly understood that only through new relationships could his life feel more meaningful.|$|R
2500|$|Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, [...] "There is {{a moment}} in each {{installment}} of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed to make me <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way?</b> In {{the hands of a}} master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

Bennington and Shinoda wrote {{the lyrics to}} Hybrid Theory based on some early material. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as [...] "everyday emotions you talk about and think about." [...] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, [...] "It's easy to fall into that thing– 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself.

2500|$|In April 1987, Lightfoot filed {{a lawsuit}} against {{composer}} Michael Masser, claiming that Masser's melody for the song [...] "The Greatest Love of All"—recorded by George Benson (1977) and Whitney Houston (1985)—stole 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". The transitional section that begins [...] "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" [...] of the Masser song has the same melody as [...] "I never thought I could <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" [...] of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated {{that he did not want}} people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.|$|E
50|$|Phillip {{is in the}} {{beginning}} and throughout the early parts of the novel skeptical of blacks, which seems partially provoked by his mother, who is described as homesick for Virginia and unused to Curaçao. Phillip mentions that his mother {{did not like the}} blacks who worked on the bay, asking him and his friend Henrik not to go there and telling him that the blacks live differently than Phillip. Phillip doesn't understand why she <b>feels</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> especially since Henrik finds it particularly unusual, but nevertheless, initially, it shows that he seems to have the same sentiments when dealing with Timothy.|$|R

2500|$|A {{statement}} in a 2005 authorized biography about the Queen (entitled Margrethe) {{focused on her}} views of Islam: [...] "We are being challenged by Islam these years. Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, {{run the risk of}} having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction." ...|$|E
2500|$|The central {{message of}} the book is that gay men must accept {{responsibility}} for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS (PWA's) and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, [...] "I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount. [...] By not putting back, you are saying that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all our friends and lovers have amounted to nothing. [...] I can't believe that in your heart of hearts you <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> [...] I can't believe you want to die. [...] Do you?" [...] The first publication provides a portrait of Kramer as activist, and the 1994 edition contains commentary written by him that reflects on his earlier pieces and provides insight into Larry Kramer as writer.|$|E
2500|$|On his 13th birthday, Osbourne {{got drunk}} {{for the first}} time on whisky; by the time he was 14, he was {{drinking}} regularly and had started smoking marijuana. He started partying heavily, and made headlines on 21 April 2003 when he was admitted to a child psychiatric ward for an addiction to OxyContin. Osbourne's drug addiction escalated after his mother was diagnosed with cancer; he was as well battling with his own depression. His self-destructive behaviour came to a head when he attempted suicide by taking a cocktail of prescription pills and cutting his hands with shards of glass after hearing his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend pick up her phone when he called her. He woke up 12 hours later. Osbourne continued with his drug use until he realised that he [...] "never wants to <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> ever again" [...] and admitted himself into an adolescent psychiatric ward. He spent 10 days detoxing and was moved to an adolescent rehabilitation centre in Malibu, where he enrolled in a recovery programme.|$|E

As Professor Shane helps Bonnie, Damon shows Elena how to feed properly. At first, Elena lets her emotions {{get in the way of}} her feeding but later at the Halloween party, she finds that preying on wrong-doers lessens her guilt. Elena, intoxicated with the human blood, dances with Damon as they both drink. However, when she sees Bonnie looking on in horror, Elena snaps out of the haze and feels guilty. They then go home to Mystic Falls where she apologizes to Damon for lashing out at him after the party, and admits that deep down she believes Damon's way of living as vampire is the right way. Elena admits that as a young girl all she ever wanted was to be a baseball superstar. Before Elena can continue, Damon assumes she is saying she doesn't want to be like him even though she <b>feels</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> but before Elena can respond Stefan shows up and Damon leaves.|$|R

However, Isaac was not bothered by Imogen's age, causing Mason to confess to Imogen {{that he wanted to be}} with her. Imogen was [...] "deeply flattered" [...] by Mason's declaration, but was wary about reuniting with him. Kaplan commented [...] "Imogen's incredibly happy that he <b>feels</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> but she's also scared because she feels Kate will always be in the background." [...] Mason tried to win Imogen over by appearing more intellectual, which Kaplan said was fun to film. However, Imogen was not impressed and believed Mason was only doing it, so she would break up with Isaac. Kaplan told an Inside Soap reporter that there would be a rough road ahead for Imogen and Mason when a [...] "major crisis" [...] impacts on their families. Mason and Imogen began a secret romance and Kaplan said that there was [...] "something really fun" [...] about their relationship, adding that the fact it was forbidden was enticing.|$|R

They tie them up, then (apparently having untied them off-screen) lock them in cages. Dolph and Jimbo leave, and the girls escape by distracting Kearney with stories about Equalia. Dolph and Jimbo try to destroy the girls' manuscripts, but Kearney now believes in the idea of Equalia and attacks them -- in his mind he becomes a dragon and overcomes them, but in reality Dolph and Jimbo are beating him up while he smiles dreamily and obliviously. Lisa and Juliet escape. Later, Lisa tells Juliet that she wants to continue living in the real world and forget about Equalia. Juliet feels disappointed that Lisa <b>feels</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> and decides to abandon the friendship, claiming that [...] "the real world is for people who can't imagine anything better" [...] (causing Lisa to conclude that Juliet is crazy).|$|R

60|$|Some men, I suppose, {{terminate}} {{their education}} {{when they leave}} their college. Not so Dean Drone. I have often heard him say that if he couldn't take a book in the Greek out on the lawn in a spare half hour, he would feel lost. It's a certain activity {{of the brain that}} must be stilled somehow. The Dean, too, seemed to have a native feeling for the Greek language. I have often heard people who might sit with him on the lawn, ask him to translate some of it. But he always refused. One couldn't translate it, he said. It lost so much in the translation that it was better not to try. It was far wiser not to attempt it. If you undertook to translate it, there was something gone, something missing immediately. I believe that many classical scholars <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> and like to read the Greek just as it is, without the hazard of trying to put it into so poor a medium as English. So that when Dean Drone said that he simply couldn't translate it, I believe he was perfectly sincere.|$|E

Were not influential friends necessary for the proper kind of career? and where were Krebs's? In spite of the history of Daniel Webster and a long line of American tradition, I felt an incongruity in my classmate's aspiration. And as he stood there, gaunt and undoubtedly hungry, his eyes kindling, I must vaguely have classed him with the revolutionaries of all the ages; must have felt in him, instinctively, a menace to the stability of that Order with which I had thrown my fortunes. And yet there were comparatively poor men in the Law School itself who had not made me <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> <b>way!</b> He had impressed me against my will, taken me by surprise, commiseration had been mingled with other feelings that sprang out of the memory of the night I had called on him, when he had been sick.

Am I {{the only one who}} <b>feels</b> <b>this</b> <b>way?</b> Does everyone worry about his or her mental health from time to time? Is it normal to be anxious about the future? The class covered most of my questions and concerns. It helped convince me that psychologists were making important contributions and that psychology could be a meaningful career. Still, there was one important area that we never touched. I wanted to know what would possess someone to streak. It was the 1970 s, and one of our generation's forms of rebellion involved removing your clothes and running through crowds. I wanted to know why people did this. Raised at the seashore, I also wanted to know why some kids would surf when a shark warning was posted. I wanted to know why crazy drivers drove the way they did.

Physically, I push two or more materials together {{so that they can}} find their own form, their own edge. I pour the plaster into different kinds of flexible emptinesses like envelopes or discarded gift wrap so that the two materials can exercise their own material agency and vitality, the materials working with themselves and the space to decide their own inevitable shapes. I allow the pieces their own logic. I want to level the space, the objects, and the viewer so that none of the three plays foreground or background to the others. Activities, architecture, furniture, and bodies all become active, equal players in a spontaneous game of call and response. By reprioritizing physical specificity of an object in its space, time becomes equally specific (i. e. <b>this</b> plaster <b>feels</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> to me right now). This temporal specificity creates the sense of potential movement across many individual moments. The work circulates and breathes, the objects moving around the viewers as much as the reverse. The objects’ shiftiness defends them from crystallization and purity. This is why I intuitively reach for materials that circulate or are modular (envelopes, gifts, blocks). A sense of the equal possibility of movement between the viewer and the pieces knits our relationship to the material world closer together. It creates a felt sense of interconnectedness or interbeing...|$|R
