40|$|High {{wheel-rail contact}} stress {{is related to}} rail damage {{mechanisms}} such as gross plastic flow. Such high contact stresses are often generated by freight vehicles which have comparatively high axleloads. On railways in Great Britain (GB) a limit {{is placed on the}} ratio of static wheel load (Q) to wheel diameter (D) as a proxy to control contact stress related damage. However, there is increasing interest in the use of smaller diameter wheels on freight vehicles, in order to prolong wheelset life (smaller scrap diameter) and increase capacity within the GB’s constrained structure gauge. GB Railway Group Standards [1] limit Q/D to 0. 13 kN/mm. However it is known that a number of freight wagons already operate above this limit, either due to <b>derogations</b> <b>granted</b> against the standard, or as a result of being introduced prior to the standard’s universal application (‘Grandfather Rights’). At least one vehicle type is known to operate with a Q/D ratio of up to 0. 165 kN/mm. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the contact stress state of the GB network. This formed part of a larger study [2] undertaken with a view to allowing a reduction in wheel diameters for freight vehicles. The research was conducted as part of the industry’s R&D programme managed by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) ...|$|R

This {{followed}} {{the emergence of a}} threat to turf-cutting when the European Union's Habitats Directive was transposed into Irish law in 1997, and gave protection to raised bogs.The Irish government declared a ten-year derogation, which delayed the full protection of Irish raised bogs. (The <b>derogation</b> was <b>granted</b> to help domestic turf-cutters (as opposed to industrial-scale turf-cutting). [...] When the derogation expired, it was reported that a ban on turf-cutting would apply to more than thirty Special Areas of Conservation with effect from 2009. (Initial reports referred to 32 SACS being affected, later reports refer to a figure of thirty-one).|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the nitrate directive, member states have the possibility to apply for derogation, i. e. increasing fertilization standards under certain conditions. Several EU regions have made use of this possibility but all in a different way. In 2009, 6 different derogation policies were worked out. This paper focuses on the differences between the applied policies and makes an assessment of the impact of these differences on the application rate of derogation, the manure surplus and the costs to allocate the manure. Based on the MP-MAS model described by Van der Straeten et al. (2010) the different scenarios are applied on a single case area (Flanders) and the economic effects have been simulated. Results show large differences between the policy alternatives, leading to the conclusion that member states not only have to focus on the permission to allow derogation or not but also at the details of the <b>derogation</b> policy. <b>Granting</b> <b>derogation</b> at parcel level instead of farm level increases the potential effect of derogation, the height of the increase in fertilization standards under derogation determines the application rate of derogation: a higher increase leads to a higher application rate.

Regarding the term “deterioration” the Advocate General Jääskinen recommended a strict interpretation of the WFD with reference to a substance or quality component, without affecting a mandatory classification change [188].|$|R
