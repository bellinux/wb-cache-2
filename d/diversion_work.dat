5000|$|Freudenburg {{published}} a number influential ideas, but his central focus {{in recent years}} was on {{what he called the}} double diversion. Although in his latter years he taught in the program established in part by Garrett Hardin, and he often stressed his high regard for Hardin's work, the predictions that derive from Freudenburg's double <b>diversion</b> <b>work</b> are contrary to those associated with Hardin's [...] "tragedy of the commons." [...] Rather than being due mainly to the actions of individual consumers, Freudenburg argued, much or most of all environmental harm is actually due to a small number of organized producers. Contrary to the notion that environmental protection is bad for the economy and jobs, the worst sources of environmental harm are commonly due to a surprisingly small fraction of all economic activity—and to an even smaller fraction of the jobs. In the first peer-reviewed article in which this perspective was spelled out, for example, Freudenburg found that the majority of all toxic emissions in the U.S. economy came from industries that were responsible for only about 5% of the gross national product—and just 1.4% of the nation's jobs.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{structure}} is designed based on hydraulic theories or guidelines. To ensure performance, physical model tests {{are often used}} at high discharges.

The official diversion rating curve was built only based on physical model tests at high discharges (837 - 1620 m 3 /s). The results of physical model tests in this study suggested the official diversion rating curve should be modified considering all tests. The modifi-cations showed the official diversion rating curve was over-estimated. A complete series of physi-cal model tests and considering field situations, in this study, indicated expanded physical model tests and constantly field measurements were therefore necessary for hydraulic structure, which provided information to modify used hydrological relationship to fit real situations...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this report is a {{capacity}} analysis of two long-term urban freeway Work Zones. Work Zone # 1 tapered four mainline lanes to two, using two separate tapers; Work Zone # 2 tapered two mainline lanes to one. Work Zone throughput was analyzed throughout the day over multiple days and traffic operations conditions were analyzed up to a distance of five miles upstream of the Work Zone entrance. Historical data from pavement-embedded detectors were used to analyze traffic conditions. The database consisted of five-minute volume, speed and occupancy data collected from 78 detectors {{for a total of}} 50 days. Congestion during each analyzed Work Zone existed for more than fourteen hours each day; Work Zone impacts adversely affected freeway operations over distances of 3. 7 to 4. 2 miles. Speed and occupancy conditions further upstream were, however, not affected, or even improved due to significant trip <b>diversion.</b> <b>Work</b> Zone capacity was defined based on the maximum traffic flows observed over a one-hour period; throughput values were also compiled over longer periods of time when traffic was within 90 % of the maximum observed one-hour flows, as well as over the multi-hour mid-day period. The Highway Capacity Manual freeway capacity definition based on the maximum observed 15 -min period was not used, since it would have no practical application in estimating Work Zone throughput when congested conditions prevail {{for the majority of the}} hours of the day. Certain noteworthy changes took place for the duration of the analyzed Work Zones: per-lane throughput dropped; morning peak periods started earlier, evening peak periods ended later and lasted longer; mid-day volumes dropped accompanied by the highest occupancies of the day. Trip diversion was evident in lower volumes entering the analyzed freeway corridor, higher volumes using off-ramps and lower volumes using onramps upstream of the Work Zones. The majority of diverted traffic comprised smaller vehicles (vehicles up to 21 feet in length); combination truck volumes increased and their use of the median lane increased, contrary to smaller vehicles that shifted toward a heavier use of the shoulder lane...|$|E
