50|$|A certain minimum supply {{pressure}} {{is needed to}} drive the air through the system, but it is desired to use as low a {{supply pressure}} as possible, because the energy the engine uses to compress the bleed air is not available for propulsion, and fuel consumption suffers. For this reason, air is commonly drawn from one of two (or in some cases such as the Boeing 777, three) bleed ports at different compressor stage locations. When the engine is at low pressure (low thrust or high altitude), the air is drawn from the highest pressure bleed port. As pressure is increased (more thrust or lower altitude) and reaches a predetermined crossover point, the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>shut-off</b> valve (HPSOV) closes and air is selected from a lower pressure port to minimize the fuel performance loss. The reverse happens as engine pressure decreases.|$|E

40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil {{reservoirs}} {{is always}} associated with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep reservoirs with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> are more prone to such leftover <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs to ensure higher ultimate oil recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs, the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. The obtained results showed that optimization of well placement, well spacing, and commencement time for any EOR strategy such as miscible CO 2 flooding is very critical in the course of making a Field Development Plan (FDP) for an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. The results, discussions, and conclusions were finally used by the author to shed light on potential further work on each of the aforementioned challenges in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs such as Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico. </p...|$|R
