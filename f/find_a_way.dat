5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water.

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore had to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of separating kilograms {{of it from the}} more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright and co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin.

5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder.

In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
