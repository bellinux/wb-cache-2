5|$|In 1981, Giurgiu and Călărași {{were split}} from Ialomița {{and the former}} county of Ilfov, while in 1997, <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> which had been a {{dependency}} of the municipality of Bucharest for nearly two decades, was reinstated. The county borders set in 1968 are still largely in place today, but the functions of different authorities have changed due to administrative reforms in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on his own, {{and came to the}} independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, taken up by the <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, the trial was held without a jury.|$|E
5|$|Vasile Kogălniceanu, the {{youngest}} son, was noted for {{his involvement in}} agrarian and left-wing politics during the early 20th century. A founder of Partida Țărănească (which served as an inspiration for the Peasants' Party after 1918), he was a collaborator of Vintilă Rosetti in campaigning for the universal suffrage and legislating Sunday rest. A manifesto to the peasants, issued by him just before the Peasants' Revolt of 1907, was interpreted by the authorities as a call to rebellion, and led to Kogălniceanu's imprisonment for a duration of five months. A member of the Chamber of Deputies for <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> {{he served as a}} rapporteur for the Alexandru Averescu executive during the 1921 debates regarding an extensive land reform.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccording to statistics, almost 50 % of the {{patients}} with stroke have difficulties in performing tasks of daily living, hence the importance of functional rehabilitation. This paper aims at providing clinical {{evidence to support the}} improvement of balance in hemiparetic stroke patients through an assisted functional rehabilitation program. The 4 weeks experiment was performed in Bucharest, in the Department of Physical Rehabilitation of <b>Ilfov</b> Emergency <b>County</b> Hospital, on a group of 5 subjects diagnosed with ischemic stroke. The results confirmed an improvement in the postural stability of the hemiparetic patients through the use of our functional rehabilitation strategies...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Otopeni {{town was}} part of Dambovitsa <b>county</b> <b>Ilfov</b> province, {{consisting}} of two villages, Otopeni Lower and Otopeni Upper, with 851 inhabitants in total. The commune operated a school with 29 students and two churches (one in each village). The village chambers was then part of town Bucoveni, with 125 inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|The {{capital of}} the region was Bucharest, and at first, its {{territory}} comprised an area similar to the nowadays <b>Ilfov</b> and Giurgiu <b>counties.</b> In 1952 it assimilated the dissolved Ialomița (without rayons Fetești, to Constanța region, and Urziceni, to Ploiești region; both taken in 1960) and Teleorman regions, reaching an area slightly smaller than nowadays Ialomița, Călărași, Ilfov, Giurgiu and Teleorman counties.|$|R
25|$|The city's population, {{according}} to the 2002 census, was 1,926,334 inhabitants, or 8.9% {{of the total population}} of Romania. A significant number of people commute to the city every day, mostly from the surrounding <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> but official statistics regarding their numbers do not exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} five other railway {{stations}} run by CFR, {{of which the}} most important are Basarab (adjacent to North Station), Obor, Băneasa, and Progresul. These {{are in the process}} of being integrated into a commuter railway serving Bucharest and the surrounding <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County.</b> Seven main lines radiate out of Bucharest.|$|E
25|$|The Municipality of Bucharest, {{along with}} the {{surrounding}} <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> {{is part of the}} București – Ilfov development region project, which is equivalent to NUTS-II regions in the European Union and is used both by the EU and the Romanian government for statistical analysis, and to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the EU. The Bucharest-Ilfov development region is not, however, an administrative entity yet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} growth rate is -0.127% (2007 estimate).In common with many European countries, Romania {{has experienced a}} decline in population in recent years. The population fell by 1,129,000 or 4.95% in the decade 1992-2002. In three counties, Caraș-Severin, Hunedoara and Teleorman, the population fell by more than 10% over the same period. Only two <b>counties,</b> <b>Ilfov</b> and Iași saw their population increase.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ilfov</b> (...) is the <b>county</b> that {{surrounds}} Bucharest, {{the capital of}} Romania. It used to be largely rural, but, {{after the fall of}} communism, many of the county's villages and communes developed into high-income commuter towns, which act like suburbs or satellites of Bucharest. The gentrification of the county is continuing, with many towns in Ilfov, such as Otopeni, having some of the highest GDP per capita levels in the country.|$|R
50|$|In <b>Ilfov</b> and Dâmbovița <b>counties,</b> {{respectively}} in Bucharest, occurred cloudburst, {{that caused}} spontaneous floods. The sewers didn't cope to {{large quantities of}} water, thus several streets were flooded. In many areas, hail made havoc. Several households were flooded in the commune of Pantelimon. In Dâmbovița County, more cars were damaged, after board {{on the roof of}} a block was torn by the wind. Withal, in the commune of Răzvad (Dâmbovița County), heavy rains transformed ditches and streets in real rivers. Water entered the cellars of houses, household annexes, courtyards and gardens, and locals' cultures were compromised.|$|R
25|$|Ghenadie Petrescu {{was born}} in the Wallachian capital of Bucharest, in 1836. His parents were of lowly origins, and his native home was in Hagiului mahala. The future priest {{received}} his elementary education at a parish school, that of Domnița Bălașa Church. According to some sources, he took orders at Căldărușani Monastery, <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> in 1854. Others mention that this happened only in 1858, at Cernica Monastery.|$|E
25|$|Born in Copaciu (at {{the time}} part of <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> {{presently}} in Giurgiu County), Cristescu {{trained as a}} blanket-maker and became {{the owner of a}} blanket-making shop. Active in socialist circles as early as 1898, he soon became a leading member of the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (up to 1899, when the Party disbanded). In 1900, he joined the leadership of the only surviving group of the Party, its Bucharest socialist circle, România Muncitoare (led by Christian Rakovsky).|$|E
25|$|He held several {{governmental}} {{positions in}} the Iuliu Maniu, Gheorghe Mironescu, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod PNȚ cabinets: he was Minister for Industry and Trade (1928–1929; June–October 1930; August–October 1932), Finance Minister (1929–1930; 1932–1933), and Minister for Agriculture and Royal Domains in 1931. He also represented Romania at the League of Nations conferences on economy (in {{the context of the}} Great Depression), and was secretary of the PNȚ in 1926, as well as its leader for <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born in Câmpulung, {{his parents}} were the serdar Dimitrie Aricescu and his wife Elena (née Chiliașu). His early {{education}} took place at home with private tutors and at the Greek and Romanian schools in his native town. It continued at Saint Sava College the capital Bucharest from 1837 to 1844. After graduating, he worked for several months as an engineer's assistant, followed in 1847 by a low-ranking clerk's position at the Treasury. Later, he was editor and administrator of the newspapers Românul, Buciumul and Pressa {{and director of the}} State Archives, the State Domains and the State Press (1869-1870; 1871-1876). He was a school inspector in <b>Ilfov</b> and Vlașca <b>counties,</b> as well as in Bucharest.|$|R
25|$|Pressures increased, {{with the}} Tribunal of <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> refusing {{to allow the}} group's registration, and with several {{employees}} of universities, such as Mihai Beniuc and Teodor Bugnariu, receiving semi-official criticism for their Amicii membership. The Siguranța began routine searches at the organization headquarters, and eventually arrested Constantinescu-Iași on November 25. King Carol II also reacted against clandestine PCR activities, and drafted a Decree banning 31 political associations suspected of sedition, including Amicii URSS, Comitetul Național Antirăzboinic, Comitetul Național Antifascist, and Liga Muncii.|$|E
25|$|Rosetti had {{a lengthy}} {{career as a}} defense lawyer, an {{experience}} that informed certain of his literary output, including memoirs such as Din sala pașilor pierduți ("From the Hall of Wasted Pacing", 1922). As both Călinescu and Eftimiu note, {{he was one of}} several Romanian orators inspired by the style and social-justice ideology of François Coppée. A dean of the Bar in <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> he was especially involved in pleading for left-wing activists prosecuted by the state. In 1909, he and Mille failed to obtain an acquittal for I. C. Frimu, Gheorghe Cristescu and Panait Istrati, who had been charged with sedition.|$|E
25|$|Anton Bacalbașa {{ran for a}} seat in the Assembly of Deputies (<b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> 3rd College), {{during the}} {{election}} of October 1888, picking up just 6 votes. By then, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and his pupils had caught negative attention from the governing Conservative Party, and especially from the Conservatives' political-literary faction, Junimea. In 1889, by means of the socialist press, Bacalbașa popularized the rumor that a Conservative-Junimist cabinet was working on expelling Gherea from the country. Gherea himself was alarmed by this, and requested an audience with Junimea leader and Education Minister Titu Maiorescu. Maiorescu reassured Gherea that his followers had no intention of sabotaging the socialist clubs in this disputable manner.|$|E
25|$|Grigore Filipescu {{wanted the}} throne for himself, but was {{ignored by the}} Russians and {{had to settle for}} the {{position}} of chief justice. Vulpache, meanwhile, was a student in Paris, where he immersed himself in liberal-nationalist politics, alongside colleagues Ion Ghica and Nicolae Crețulescu. He also began his administrative career during the early Regulamentul years: in 1835 or 1842, he served as <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> judge. He was a protege of Kiselyov's, who obtained for him the office of Aga (or prefect) of the Bucharest police. From 1838, he was also Bucharest's Mayor, with the title of Vornic, and from 1842 led the Commune Council.|$|E
25|$|Alexandra Pallady, {{also known}} under the pet name Didina, {{was born in}} Ciocănești, a village {{currently}} in Dâmbovița County (but, in 1876, still part of <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County).</b> Her birth date {{is known to have}} been September 20, 1876, but other sources credit it as 1877 or 1881. She was by birth a member of the boyar upper-class: her father, Lieutenant Colonel Theodor Pallady (1847/1853–1916), an aristocrat from the eastern region (and former state) of Moldavia, had earned distinction in the Romanian Land Forces; her mother, also named Alexandrina (1845/1848–1881), was a Kretzulescu boyaress from Wallachia, and the heiress of a large estate. Through Pallady's mother, Alexandrina descended from another boyar house, the Ghicas, who owned the manor in Ciocănești.|$|E
25|$|The injured {{were taken}} to 12 {{hospitals}} in Bucharest and <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> with the most at Floreasca Hospital (57), Burn Hospital (29), University Hospital (25), and Military Hospital (15). The band's bassist and vocalist {{were taken to}} Floreasca Hospital. Arafat acknowledged that due to {{the large number of}} victims in some hospitals there were no beds available, and the injured were redirected to other hospitals. Ventilation devices also had to be moved from hospitals where they were not being used, to those that needed more. Many residents of Bucharest reportedly flocked to blood donation centres in an effort to help the injured. Previously, health officials had launched an appeal to residents to donate blood. By the morning of 31 October, almost 600 people had donated blood at the Bucharest Transfusion Centre.|$|E
500|$|According to 2011 {{census data}} from the National Institute of Statistics, the average {{population}} of Romania's 41 counties is about 445,000, with Iași County as the most populous (772,000) and Covasna County (210,000) the least. The average county's land area is , with Timiș County (...) the largest and <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> (...) the smallest. The municipality of Bucharest, which has the same administrative level {{as that of a}} county, is both more populous and much smaller than any county, with 1,883,425 people and [...]|$|E
500|$|The regions {{coming under}} Romania's {{administration}} {{at the end}} of the war still maintained their ad hoc administrative structures, including the Transylvanian Directory Council, set up and dominated by the PNR; Averescu ordered these dissolved in April, facing protest from local notabilities. At the same time, he ordered all troops to be demobilized. He unified currency around the Romanian leu, and imposed a land reform in the form in which it was to be carried out by the new Brătianu executive. In fact, the latter measure had been imposed by the outgoing PNL cabinet through the order of Ion G. Duca, in a manner which Argetoianu described as [...] "destructive". As an initial step, Averescu's government appointed the noted activist Vasile Kogălniceanu, a deputy for <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> as rapporteur; Kogălniceanu used this position to give an account of the agrarian situation in Romania, stressing the role played by his ancestor, Constantin, in abolishing Moldavian serfdom, as well as that of his father, Mihail Kogălniceanu, in eliminating corvées throughout Romania.|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, {{the regions}} {{surrounding}} Bucharest were largely rural, but after 1989, suburbs {{started to be}} built around Bucharest, in the surrounding <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County.</b> Further urban consolidation {{is expected to take}} place in the late 2010s, when the [...] "Bucharest Metropolitan Area" [...] plan will become operational, incorporating additional communes and cities from the Ilfov and other neighbouring counties.|$|E
2500|$|Although an {{artillery}} officer stationed in Chitila, Rosetti was mostly active during World War I as a patriotic orator and propagandist, later {{returning to his}} work at the <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> bar association. During the interwar, he maintained contact with both the socialists and the [...] "cremationists", but grew more conservative and passeistic. This attitude consolidated his success as the author of memoirs. Largely forgotten in his old age, he withdrew to a garret.|$|E
2500|$|During 1899, Bacalbașa {{followed}} Fleva's {{group as}} it merged into the Conservative Party. His presence alongside Maiorescu was recorded with displeasure by the Junimist Ioan Slavici, {{as one of}} the reasons why Conservative politics had become ineffectual. A Conservative cabinet was called to power, with Fleva as the Agriculture Minister, and Bacalbașa ran in the general election of 1899, earning an <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> seat in the Assembly of Deputies. Toni still pursued his literary interests: together with [...] "Constantin Ivan" [...] (the common pseudonym of his two brothers), he wrote the 3-act political revue Pardon!.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2000 Romanian {{legislative}} election, Becali was {{a candidate}} of the [...] "League of Italian Communities in Romania" [...] for the seat in the Chamber of Deputies reserved for the Italian minority. He received 16,266 votes (0.15%) countrywide, of which 7,677 in <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County.</b> Nevertheless, he lost to Ileana Stana-Ionescu, who got only 2,943 votes in one constituency. Becali contested the results, but according to Romanian election law, for national minorities, {{it is not the}} total number of votes that matters; the individual who gains the largest percentage in one constituency wins the seat reserved for that national minority.|$|E
2500|$|Cătărău's {{involvement}} with the cause {{was a matter of}} concern, and the Siguranța Statului secret police opened a special file on his activities. Officially, he paid allegiance to the Romanian nationalist youth. As later noted by the Arad newspaper Românul: [...] "At first he passed himself off as a Bessarabian student and issued lively propaganda, in student circles, regarding the sufferings of Bessarabian Romanians. It was therefore easy for him to attract everyone's sympathy. He turned himself into a nationalist and was always present at nationalist rallies." [...] Cătărău infiltrated the Democratic Nationalist Party (PND) of Nicolae Iorga and A. C. Cuza. He participated in the PND congress for <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> declaring that [...] "us Bassarabian Romanians can only trust the nationalist-democratic party".|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} {{to take an}} <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County</b> seat in 1879, alongside his associate Ghica, in what was a surprise [...] "White"-party victory. In 1880, {{he was among the}} founding members of the enlarged Conservative Party, and an editor of the party organ, Timpul—directly supervising its publisher, Mihai Eminescu. In December 1880, as Lascăr Catargiu became party chairman, Știrbei joined his steering committee, alongside Manu, Florescu, Menelas Ghermani, Alexandru Lahovary, Titu Maiorescu, Grigore Păucescu, Theodor Rosetti, and Grigore Triandafil. In act of reconciliation in 1881, Știrbei presented his homages to the National Liberal Prime Minister, Ion Brătianu, who had survived an assassination attempt by Ion Pietraru; later that year, he voted in favor of establishing the Kingdom of Romania, with Carol as King of the Romanians.|$|E
2500|$|Căile Ferate Române (CFR), Romania's {{national}} railway operator, {{is one of}} {{the largest}} users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets (as the light train variant). CFR, which is currently undergoing modernisation, has bought 120 diesel Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train, including its [...] "Inter Regio", and [...] "Regio" [...] inter-city services, but mainly on its [...] "Inter Regio" [...] trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were considered to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mainly on its medium- and short-distance routes. For example, it is planning to use them as part of a proposed commuter link in Bucharest and <b>Ilfov</b> <b>county.</b> For more information on routes, see Căile Ferate Române.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1931, Filipescu and the LVȚ were {{backing the}} Maniu government, being {{opposed to the}} {{dissolution}} of Parliament—as demanded by the other opposition parties. In return, Filipescu asked and obtained for himself the prefecture of <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County.</b> This office was widely seen as beyond his prestige and competence, but {{he explained that he}} cold contribute to regional prosperity. Also winning a Senate seat in the election of June, in which the LVȚ ran as an ally of Iorga's Democratic Nationalists, Filipescu gave a speech on [...] "common sense in politics". He presented his group as Romania's only truthful party, and the only one which addressed the worldwide perils engulfing Romania. In 2005, philologist Elvira Sorohan rediscovered the speech as a [...] "lesson in rhetorical elegance" [...] and Europeanism. Again turning his attention to the West, Filipescu repeatedly asked Prime Minister Iorga to make him Ambassador to Switzerland, and also sought high offices for LVȚ figures. Such moves were blocked by Carol, Titulescu, {{and other members of the}} establishment.|$|E
2500|$|In the meantime, {{the fall}} of Bucharest had left Romania divided: King Ferdinand, his government, and the army {{proceeded}} to Western Moldavia, where they continued resistance; in the Wallachian south, Conservative Lupu Kostaki and his allies tolerated, or collaborated with, the German occupation. Mariu was one of Kostaki's associates, and, in January 1918, was appointed secretary of the Wallachian Bishopric, an Orthodox institution. His Catholicism having been revealed to the public, he was forced two resign a few days into his office. A few weeks after, Marghiloman was called upon to form a cabinet and negotiate a peace with the Central Powers (which was signed in May 1918). Mariu believed that Marghiloman was a godsend for Romania: [...] "he managed to defend the dynasty and protect the army from being disarmed". He ran in the 1918 election, taking a seat in Senate for <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> and resuming his work for the unification of churches. His major effort was in supporting the Romanians of Northern Dobruja, which Romania had effectively ceded to Greater Bulgaria. Mariu Theodorian suggested that Orthodox Romanians, forcefully integrated into Bulgarian Orthodoxy, protect themselves by mass-converting to Catholicism.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{its claim}} to have {{originated}} in Roman Dacia, the Năsturel clan was first attested as belonging to boyardom in the late 15th century. A period document by [...] "Vlad Vodă", brother of Radu the Great, confirms that, by 1501, the Năsturels were long established as the owners of Herăști (traditionally in <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> now in Giurgiu) and other Wallachian villages. The same document suggests that Vrăjoghie, the family patriarch, was [...] "of My Highness' own house", namely the House of Basarab. A 19th-century author, Dimitrie Papazoglu, also argued that the family had a deep connection to the village, and later capital city, of Bucharest, suggesting that they were builders on an ancient church in Dobroteasa mahala. He also proposed that Herăști took its name from a family patriarch, [...] "Count" [...] Herea Năsturel. The genealogical link with the ruling princes was enhanced ca. 1600, when Udriște's father, the Postelnic and Logothete Radu Năsturel, married Despina, a cousin or niece of Michael the Brave. According to researcher Constantin Gane, Despina, known as Cala in some sources, {{may have been the}} daughter of boyar Radu Calomfirescu.|$|E
2500|$|The {{core group}} of Urmuzian disciples, {{organized}} as a secret society, comprised Ciprian (nicknamed [...] "Macferlan" [...] by Urmuz), Alexandru [...] "Bălălău" [...] Bujoreanu and Costică [...] "Pentagon" [...] Grigorescu, together known as the pahuci. Allegedly, the obscure word originated from the Hebrew for [...] "yawns". Their activity centered on daring pranks: Urmuz {{and the other three}} young men once made an impromptu visit to the isolated Căldărușani Monastery, in <b>Ilfov</b> <b>County,</b> where the deposed and disgraced Metropolitan Ghenadie was living in banishment. Passing themselves off as newspaper editors, they demanded (and received) honored guest treatment, tested the monks' patience, and were later introduced to a well-disposed Ghenadie. Ciprian also recalls that Urmuz's philosophical musings or deadpan surreal humor were a direct inspiration for other pranks and experiments. He describes how Ciriviș acted out sadness for the plight of a screechy sledge (declaring [...] "my heart is at one with all things in existence"), but then duped onlookers into believing that the squeaks came from a woman somehow trapped under the vehicle. Reportedly, Urmuz also approached his seniors training at seminaries or other traditionalist institutions, earned their attention by claiming to share the nationalist agenda, and then began reciting them nonsense lyrics such as an evolving draft of his mock-fable [...] "The Chroniclers".|$|E
