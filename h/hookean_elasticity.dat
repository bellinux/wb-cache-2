40|$|We study an {{elasticity}} {{model for}} compressed protein monolayers or particle rafts at a liquid interface. Based on the microscopic view of hard-core particles with soft shells, a bead-spring model is formulated and analyzed {{in terms of}} continuum elasticity theory. The theory can be applied, for example, to hydrophobin-coated air-water interfaces or, more generally, to liquid interfaces coated with an adsorbed monolayer of interacting hard-core particles. We derive constitutive relations for such particle rafts and describe the buckling of compressed planar liquid interfaces {{as well as their}} apparent Poisson ratio. We also use the constitutive relations to obtain shape equations for pendant or buoyant capsules attached to a capillary, and to compute deflated shapes of such capsules. A comparison with capsules obeying the usual <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> (without hard cores) reveals that the hard cores trigger capsule wrinkling. Furthermore, it is shown that a shape analysis of deflated capsules with hard-core/soft-shell elasticity gives apparent elastic moduli which can be much higher than the original values if <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> is assumed...|$|E
40|$|The {{anisotropic}} {{failure criterion}} of the elliptic paraboloid failure surface is generally stated and appropriately formulated {{according to two}} postulates concerning safe loading paths. First the criterion is established for the generic anisotropic solid by assuming {{that it does not}} fail under hydrostatic compression and in the sequel a new hypothesis is conjectured according to which safe loading is the stress tensor whose associated strain tensor, in the context of <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity,</b> is spherical...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} C/C++ {{software}} for the shape analysis of deflated elastic capsules in a pendant capsule geometry, {{which is based on}} an elastic description of the capsule material as a quasi two-dimensional elastic membrane using shell theory. Pendant capsule elastometry provides a new in-situ and non-contact method for interfacial rheology of elastic capsules. Given an elastic model of the capsule membrane, pendant capsule elastometry determines optimal elastic moduli by fitting numerically generated axisymmetric shapes optimally to an experimental image. For each digitized image of a deflated capsule elastic moduli can be determined, if another image of its undeformed reference shape is provided. Within this paper, we focus on nonlinear <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> because of its low computational cost its wide applicability, but also discuss and implement alternative constitutive laws. For <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity,</b> Young's surface modulus (or, alternatively, area compression modulus) and Poisson's ratio are determined; for Mooney-Rivlin elasticity, the Rivlin modulus and a dimensionless shape parameter are determined; for neo-Hookean elasticity, only the Rivlin modulus is determined, using a fixed dimensionless shape parameter. Comparing results for different models we find that nonlinear <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> is adequate for most capsules. If series of images are available, these moduli can be evaluated {{as a function of the}} capsule volume to analyze hysteresis or aging effects depending on the deformation history. An additional wrinkling wavelength measurement allows the user to determine the bending modulus, from which the layer thickness can be derived. We verify the method by analyzing several materials, compare the results to available rheological measurements, and review several applications. We make the software available under the GPL license at github. com/jhegemann/opencapsule. Comment: The source code of our pendant capsule elastometry software is freely available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|We {{utilized}} synchrotron-based in-situ diffraction and dominant {{shear deformation}} to identify, dissect, and quantify the relevant deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline Pd_ 90 Au_ 10 in the limiting case of grain sizes {{at or below}} 10 nm. We could identify lattice and grain boundary elasticity, shear shuffling operating in the core region of grain boundaries, stress driven grain boundary migration, and dislocation shear along lattice planes to contribute, however, with significantly different and nontrivial stress-dependent shares to overall deformation. Regarding lattice elasticity, we find that <b>Hookean</b> linear <b>elasticity</b> prevailed up to the maximal stress value of ≈ 1. 6 GPa. Shear shuffling that propagates strain at/along grain boundaries increases progressively with increasing load to carry about {{two thirds of the}} overall strain in the regime of macroplasticity. Stress driven grain boundary migration requires overcoming a threshold stress slightly below the yield stress of ≈ 1. 4 GPa and contributes a share of ≈ 10...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA direct, natural {{extension}} of Hooke’s law to finite strain {{was achieved by}} R. Hill in 1978, employing the notion of work-conjugate measures of stress and strain. With Seth-Hill (Doyle-Ericksen) class of finite strain measures, this extension actually defines a broad class of compressible hyperelastic materials at finite strain, each of which retains the simple linear structure of Hooke’s law as stress–strain relationship. Several known simple elasticity models at finite strain are included as its particular examples. With a novel idea of utilizing a suitable parametric variable, here we present a unified study of the free-end torsion problem (Poynting effects) of thin-walled cylindrical tubes made of the foregoing Hill’s class of Hookean type hyperelastic materials. We show {{that it is possible}} to derive a unified exact solution to the nonlinear coupling equations relating the torque (the shear stress) and the controlling deformation quantities including, in particular, the axial length change. Discussions and comparisons concerning various <b>Hookean</b> type <b>elasticity</b> models are made based on the exact solution obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{bundle of}} many fibers with stochastically {{distributed}} breaking thresholds is {{considered as a}} model of composite materials. The fibers are assumed to share the load equally, and to obey <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> up to the breaking point. The bundle is slightly overloaded, which leads to complete failure. We study the properties of emission bursts in which an amount of energy $E$ is released. The analysis shows that the size of the energy bursts has a minimum when the system is half-way from the collapse point. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|As a {{model of}} {{composite}} materials, we choose a bundle of fibers with stochastically distributed breaking thresholds for the individual fibers. the fibers are assumed to share the load equally and to obey <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{right up to the}} breaking point. We study the evolution of the fiber breaking rate at a constant load in excess of the critical load. The analysis shows that the breaking rate reaches a minimum when the system is half-way from its complete collapse. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
40|$|Generally the {{measurement}} of internal damping in done with the inverse torsion pendulum by observing the global damping of the vibrations of the specimen. Recently many workers have proposed the method of calculation of local internal damping from the curve of measured global damping vs deformation. Here a correction is proposed for the calculation of internal damping in the plastic domain where the <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> fails. This method developed {{in the case of}} cylindrical specimen only requires the calculation of variation of the period with the strain amplitude of a torsion pendulum...|$|E
40|$|As a {{model of}} {{composite}} materials, a bundle of many fibers with stochastically distributed breaking thresholds for the individual fibers is considered. The bundle is loaded until complete failure to capture the failure scenario of composite materials under external load. The fibers are assumed to share the load equally, and to obey <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> {{right up to the}} breaking point. We determine the distribution of bursts in which an amount of energy $E$ is released. The energy distribution follows asymptotically a universal power law $E^{- 5 / 2 }$, for any statistical distribution of fiber strengths. A similar power law dependence is found in some experimental acoustic emission studies of loaded composite materials. Comment: 5 pages, 4 fig...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{prove the}} global {{existence}} of small smooth {{solutions to the}} three-dimensional incompressible Oldroyd-B model without damping on the stress tensor. The main difficulty {{is the lack of}} full dissipation in stress tensor. To overcome it, we construct some time-weighted energies based on the special coupled structure of system. Such type energies show the partial dissipation of stress tensor and the strongly full dissipation of velocity. In the view of treating "nonlinear term" as a "linear term", we also apply this result to 3 D incompressible viscoelastic system with <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> and then prove the global existence of small solutions without the physical assumption (div-curl structure) as previous works...|$|E
40|$|We derive {{solutions}} of the Kirchhoff equations for a knot tied on an infinitely long {{elastic rod}} subjected to combined tension and twist. We {{consider the case}} of simple (trefoil) and double (cinquefoil) knots; other knot topologies can be investigated similarly. The rod model is based on <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> but is geometrically non-linear. The problem is formulated as a non-linear self-contact problem with unknown contact regions. It is solved by means of matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of a loose knot. Without any a priori assumption, we derive the topology of the contact set, which consists of an interval of contact flanked by two isolated points of contacts. We study the influence of the applied twist on the equilibrium. Comment: 63 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
40|$|We present several exact {{solutions}} of the eigenfrequency {{problem for}} torsional shear vibrations in homogeneous and non-homogeneous {{models of the}} neutron star crust governed by canonical equation of solid mechanics with a restoring force of <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity.</b> Particular attention is given to regime of large lengthscale nodeless axisymmetric differentially rotational oscillations which are treated in spherical polar coordinates reflecting real geometry of the neutron star crust. Highlighted is the distinction between analytic forms and numerical estimates of the frequency, computed {{as a function of}} multipole degree of nodeless torsional oscillations and fractional depth of the crust, caused by different boundary conditions imposed on the toroidal field of material displacements. The relevance of considered models to quasiperiodic oscillations, recently detected during the flare of SGR 1806 - 20 and SGR 1900 + 14, is discussed.

40|$|Abstract-—Oriented {{sheets of}} two {{commercial}} homopolystyrenes differing in molecular weight, rheological and {{glass transition temperature}} properties have been prepared by sheet extrusion and drawing. The properties of the resulting sheets have been studied at seven different laboratories in Europe. The degree of orientation, irrespective of how it is achieved, is {{defined in terms of}} the birefringence which is proportional to the maximum shrinkage stress through the stress optical coefficient, and to a sonic modulus function. The nominal draw ratio and the length reversion ratio are not unequivocal estimates of the degree of orientation. The orientation stress can be divided into two parts, the first is associated with <b>Hookean</b> <b>elasticity</b> and the other with rubber-like elasticity. It is the deformation due to this latter part that gives rise largely to the properties of the oriented solid polymers. From the value of the stress optical coefficient and the relation between maximum shrinkage stress and length reversion ratio estimates {{of the size of the}} random link and of the effect of temperature of orientation and strain rate on the degree of chain entanglement are obtained. Tensile properties including rupture stress, rupture strain and rupture energy have been determined over a wide range of strain rates for the various degrees of orientation. Increasing orientation generally improved rupture stress as also did strain rate but as orientation increased and rupture took place by yielding the rupture stress tended to fall...|$|E
