30|$|Wood {{formation}} (xylogenesis) in vascular {{plants is}} a complex biological process that includes cell division from secondary vascular cambium, cell elongation and differentiation, secondary cell wall deposition, programmed cell death and heartwood formation (Plomion et al., 2001). Wood consists of living and dead cells forming symplasmic and apoplasmic networks in trees. The apoplasmic system contains tracheids, vessels, and <b>dead</b> <b>fibres.</b> The symplasmic system integrates the living parenchyma cells. These living parenchyma cells in the symplasmic system perform multiple roles in sugar transport and storage, embolism repair, defence against pathogens, and secondary modification of xylem cells (Nakaba et al., 2012).|$|R
60|$|About {{this time}} we find him engaged, with other men of enterprise, in a project to drain the great Dismal Swamp, and render it capable of cultivation. This vast morass was about thirty miles long, and ten miles wide, and its {{interior}} but little known. With his usual zeal and hardihood he explored it on horseback and on foot. In many parts it was covered with dark and gloomy woods of cedar, cypress, and hemlock, or deciduous trees, the branches of which were hung with long drooping moss. Other parts were almost inaccessible, from the density of brakes and thickets, entangled with vines, briers, and creeping plants, and intersected by creeks and standing pools. Occasionally the soil, composed of <b>dead</b> vegetable <b>fibre,</b> was over his horse's fetlocks, and sometimes he had to dismount and make his way on foot over a quaking bog that shook beneath his tread.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{inhibiting}} isoprenaline-induced intracellular calcium accumulation {{on the degree}} of damage produced in the rat myocardium by this amine has been investigated by simultaneously dosing rats with the calcium antagonistic drug D 600. The degree of myocardial necrosis produced in animals given isoprenaline alone and those given D 600 was measured by the use of a standard point counting method to show absence of formazan from <b>dead</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> in sections treated to demonstrate succinic dehydrogenase. The use of the calcium antagonistic drug D 600 considerably reduced the degree of myocardial damage produced by a standard dose of isoprenaline bitartrate. This was associated with a decrease in the isoprenaline-induced cellular calcium uptake. The results are discussed in relation to the possible protection conferred by lowering of the calcium influx at the cell membrane and the maintenance of the cells' high-energy phosphates at a level which permits "normal" cell function...|$|R
50|$|After a {{myocardial}} infarction (heart attack), no histopathology is seen the first ~30 minutes. The only possible sign the first 4 hours is waviness of fibres at border. Later, however, a coagulation necrosis is initiated, with edema and hemorrhage. After 12 hours, {{there can be}} seen karyopyknosis and hypereosinophilia of myocytes with contraction band necrosis in margins, as well as beginning of neutrophil infiltration. At 1 - 3 days there is continued coagulation necrosis with loss of nuclei and striations and an increased infiltration of neutrophils to interstitium. Until {{the end of the}} first week after infarction there is beginning of disintegration of <b>dead</b> muscle <b>fibres,</b> necrosis of neutrophils and beginning of macrophage removal of dead cells at border, which increases the succeeding days. After a week there is also beginning of granulation tissue formation at margins, which matures during the following month, and gets increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity until the myocardial scarring is fully mature at approximately 2 months after infarction.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{inhibiting}} isoprenaline-induced lipolysis {{on the degree}} of damage produced in the rat myocardium by this amine has been investigated by pre-dosing rats with the anti-lipolytic agent 5 -fluoro-nicotinic acid. The degree of myocardial necrosis produced in animals given isoprenaline alone and those pre-dosed with the anti-lipolytic agent was measured by the use of an automated flying spot microscope to show absence of formazan from <b>dead</b> muscle <b>fibres</b> in sections treated to demonstrate succinic dehydrogenase. The use of the anti-lipolitic considerably reduced the degree of myocardial damage produced by a standard dose of isoprenaline bitartrate. This was associated with an inhibition of the post-isoprenaline rise in plasma free fatty acid levels. The results are discussed in relation to the possible protective roles of the lowering of plasma free fatty acid levels and inhibition of the adenyl cyclase system at the plasma membrane of the myocardial cell produced directly by the anti-lipolytic...|$|R

Nearly eighty inches of yearly rain {{and more than}} eighty degrees of perpetual heat make swift work with vegetable fibre, which, in our cold and sluggard clime, would curdle into leaf-mould, perhaps into peat. Far to the north, in poor old Ireland, and far to the south, in Patagonia, begin the zones of peat, where <b>dead</b> vegetable <b>fibre,</b> its treasures of light and heat locked up, lies all but useless age after age.

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} {{carried out}} in a counter current flow module, in which latent heat is recovered by heating the incoming cold seawater with the condensing product water flow, is a promising technology for low cost seawater desalination. The membranes used in this module are hydrophobic (polypropylene, polyethylene) and highly permeable fibre membranes. For modelling purposes the Knudsen diffusion and viscous flow membrane characteristics (K 0 and B 0 respectively) of five fibre membranes are determined. This paper presents a new, specially developed method for the determination of K 0 and B 0 values of highly permeable fibre membranes with single gas permeation experiments through a short <b>dead</b> end <b>fibre.</b> In {{order to be able}} to make use of a reliable method to determine the values of K 0 and B 0, it is essential that the pressure inside the permeable part of the membrane is constant. To determine the conditions at which the pressure drop in the permeable part of the membrane fibre is negligible, this part is reduced in length until the values of K 0 and B 0 become constant. For all membranes the gases He, N 2 and CO 2 were used. The gases N 2 and CO 2 lead to consistent values of K 0 and B 0. Helium gives less accurate results due to its low molecular weight. The three polypropylene membranes have a similar structure and have therefore about the same values for K 0 and B 0. The same was found for the two polyethylene fibres...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimate}} > 11 {{million people}} are infected by Trypanosoma cruzi in Latin America. Chagas disease control programmes {{have been successful in}} the Southern Cone countries, and similar initiatives are underway in the Andean countries. In Ecuador prevalence is estimated as ~ 130000 people, with 2. 5 - 3. 8 million at risk; annual associated costs may reach > 20 million US dollars. We studied ecological, genetic, and evolutionary aspects of Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, an important disease vector in western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Sylvatic and synanthropic populations are sympatric in central Ecuador; only domestic-peridomestic colonies occur in the temperate Andean valleys of southern Ecuador and northern Peru. Both morphological-chromatic features and ecological-behavioural preferences seem to define a cline [sylvatic-large (north) - synanthropic-small (south) ]. The ecology of domestic and sylvatic populations was studied using logistic regression. Phytelephas aequatorialis palms are the primary natural ecotope of R ecuadoriensis; sylvatic bugs tend to favour male palms with large amounts of decomposing organic material and located in cropland/pasture fields. Poor households with mud walls, tiled roofs and large numbers of chickens {{were more likely to be}} infested. Isometry-free morphometric analysis consistently achieved > 90 % correct discrimination of sylvatic vs. synanthropic populations, supporting the use of metric variables in surveillance of reinfestations; size-free analyses revealed substantial divergence of Peruvian bugs from La Libertad. Mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphisms (cytochrome b gene, 663 basepairs) were analysed; ~ 4 % sequence divergence scored between Ecuadorian and Peruvian populations suggested they are independent phylogroups. Haplotype diversity and relationships indicate central coastal Ecuador as the centre of dispersal of this species, with isolated domestic populations in dry Andean valleys. The phylogeny of this species was explored using morphometric and molecular approaches. The monophyly of the `Pacific Rhodnius lineage' (pallescens, colombiensis and ecuadoriensis) was confirmed, with the parapatric pallescens and colombiensis being very closely related; R. pictipes is the closest relative to this lineage among Amazonian species, with the robustus group forming a distinct, major Glade. Control of R ecuadoriensis can contemplate local eradication in dry Andean valleys (southern Ecuador and northern Peru); special attention should be paid to peridomestic populations, including improvement of poultry management (burning-replacing nests every 15 - 30 days). Long-term interruption of disease transmission would benefit from educational interventions increasing awareness about Chagas disease and from housing improvements targeting mud walls and timber-and-tile roofs. In central-northern western Ecuador peridomestic palm trees may be the origin of reinfestations; environmental management (removing <b>dead</b> fronds and <b>fibres</b> from peridomestic palms), and continuous community- based surveillance are recommended. A comprehensive control programme over 15 years would probably result in interruption of disease transmission, and could bring savings of about 20 US$ per each dollar invested.

40|$|Plants {{possess the}} rare {{capability}} {{to shape the}} own architecture according to biotic and abiotic stimuli received from the environment. Spatially defined groups of cells, called meristems, contribute to the division and differentiation processes continuously occurring inside the organism. Meristems can be classified as primary meristems, if they are specified during embryogenesis, or secondary meristems, if they form from undifferentiated, quiescent cells outside the primary meristems. Primary meristems, like the Root Apical Meristem (RAM) and the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM), coordinate the apical growth of the plant in opposite directions, while secondary meristems shape the radial architecture, regulating the thickness and branching of the primary root and shoot. Cambium is a secondary meristem which produces the vascular tissues xylem and phloem. Xylem transports water and minerals from the root to the photosynthetic tissues; it comprises lignified dead conducting cells called tracheary elements, living parenchyma cells, and lignified <b>dead</b> cells, called <b>fibres,</b> which confer mechanical support and strength. Phloem distributes glucose, RNA, viruses, and proteins from the photosynthetic sources to the sink cells; it consists of empty living sieve elements, supporting companion cells, and parenchyma cells. In order to investigate the regulation of primary and secondary growth, we developed a new chemically inducible system to control the timing and location of the induction of an effector or gene of interest. This enables us to avoid deleterious effects such as seed lethality or sterility when studying {{the role of a}} gene in a particular cell type. For example, the meristem cambium is difficult to access through normal techniques, since mutations affecting cambial cell divisions often inhibit the primary growth, too. We developed the inducible system by combining the Multi-Site Gateway cloning technology with the already extant XVE inducible system. This system was used to perform part of the research presented in the thesis. Phytohormones are involved in virtually every aspect of plant life, from development to stress response. They are small molecules which act cellautonomously or non-cell-autonomously to mediate the majority of developmental and environmental responses and, consequently, the activity of the meristems throughout the plant life cycle. Auxin and cytokinins, which were among the first phytohormones discovered, regulate almost every aspect of plant life, such as the division and differentiation processes occurring continuously in the RAM and SAM. The two phytohormones have long been known to interact, and recent studies have uncovered significant crosstalk on the level of biosynthesis, transport, signalling and degradation. We investigated the dynamic role of auxin in maintaining the balance between division, elongation, differentiation in the RAM of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results confirm that an optimal level of auxin response is required for division and elongation, while differentiation mechanisms require just a minimal concentration of auxin to proceed normally. We discovered that auxin and cytokinin responses interact synergistically to specify the stem cells and to regulate the timing of divisions in the cambium of Arabidopsis thaliana. The auxin and cytokinin signalling pathways both have a positive role in triggering secondary growth, but the hierarchy of the crosstalk between them is still unclear. Finally, auxin transported via the AUX 1 /LAX auxin influx carriers regulates the differentiation of vessel elements in the later stages of root cambium development. In summary, we confirm that auxin and cytokinins behave as master regulators of meristematic activities throughout the root, as the signalling pathways associated with both phytohormones heavily influence primary and secondary growth...|$|R
