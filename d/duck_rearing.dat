40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of various animals, such as: ducks, chickens and pigs in households increases the potential risks of zoonosis from animal to human.

Methods : A seroepidemiological study of the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was conducted by collecting sera and detecting the antibody against JEV in ducks, chickens and pigs in Bali. As pig is the amplifying animal of JEV, comparison JEV antibody between <b>ducks</b> <b>reared</b> in households with pig nearby and with no pig were also determined the presence of antibody against JEV was examined by using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).   The serum samples with over cut off value (COV) of optical density were considered as those containing Ab against JEV.

In major <b>duck</b> <b>rearing</b> countries, homologous H 5 N 1 vaccines are being used in ducks, so sero-surveillance using H 5 - or N 1 -specific antibody testing cannot identify infected flocks.

Winter passed by, and the next spring the Pintail seemed to have become a convert to her blandishments, for they nested and produced seven or eight young ones.” ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the effect of noni fruit powder (Morinda citrifolia. L.) addition in feed on production performance of hybrid ducks such as feed consumption, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. Ninety six 14 -days old hybrid ducks were used in this research. The hybrid <b>duck</b> was <b>reared</b> until 54 -days old. The research method was experimental using Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with four treatments and six replications, each replication consisted of four hybrid ducks. The treatments consisted of P 0 (Basal feed), P 1 (Basal feed + 1...|$|R
