40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in development economics. The first essay is concerned with competition between two processing mills in the sugarcane market of Pakistan. I develop a two-stage duopsony game where, in the first period, mills fragmentize the market by investing in the procurement logistics and infrastructure to create captive segments in the market. In the second stage, mills take the segmentation given and compete in prices. The model endogenously determines the market fragmentation. In equilibrium, complete segmentation of the market emerges, mills buy cane from mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>segments</b> of the market. Finally, I show that a binding price floor {{has no effect on}} the market segmentation. The second essay is concerned with coordination amongst processing mills. I analyse why sugar mills in Pakistan pay cane farmers by weight instead of sucrose content? I develop a two-stage pricing game. In the first stage, mills choose the price regime: pay by weight or sucrose content. In the second stage, for a given price regime, mills compete in prices. The model suggests that evaporation of moisture increases the effective transportation cost for farmers and hence reduces the competition between mills. Numerical solution to the game generates a coordination game. The fact that mills pay by weight, payoff dominant equilibrium, indicates a collusive behaviour among mills. However, I could not rule out the possibility of historical inertia when parameter values represent the historical conditions of the market. Finally, I suggest a price floor as an equilibrium switching policy. The final essay of this dissertation is concerned with cooperation between rural households. I study informal risk sharing contracts when players’ behaviour is motivated not only by their material payoff but also by intrinsic motivations. My results suggest that emotions such as envy, altruism, and intentions work in different directions. Envy and altruism not only reduce the critical discount factor that can self-sustain risk sharing but also make the sharing mechanism more equitable by reducing the number of equilibria in the repeated game. Finally, I study intention based preferences in an infinity repeated psychological game. The main result of the final chapter shows that intrinsic reciprocity based on expectations and intentions can reduce the level of informal insurance by increasing the critical discount factor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{reconstruction}} of periodic acoustical signals with time domain periodic averaging requires a reliable {{estimate of the}} fundamental frequency (fl) of the signal. The reconstruction task is particularly difficult when the signal is “hidden ” in additive noise and the signal-to-noise ratio is poor. This is usually the case in most passive SONAR problems when early detection and characterization of targets is required. Statistically reliable estimates of the fundamental frequency of a noisy periodic signal can be computed in the frequency domain using Bartlett’s smoothing procedure. In this procedure, a long, noisy signal is segmented into M mutually <b>exclusive</b> time <b>segments</b> and a power spectral estimate for each segment is computed. Spectral estimates are ensemble-averaged to enhance the signal power and reduce the residual spectral variance of the additive noise. In Bartlett’s smoothing procedure the spectral line detection efficiency improves with M when M> 50. The Bartlett’s smoothing procedure merely provides a range of values for the fundamental frequency within a range of four times the standard deviation of the embedded periodic signal. In the reconstruction phase, the recorded noisy signal i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{proposes a}} novel {{heuristic}} technique for integrated hardware-software partitioning, hardware design space exploration and scheduling. The technique maps an application specified as a task graph on a heterogeneous architecture with an objective {{to minimize the}} latency of the task graph subject to the area constraint on the hardware coprocessor. The technique uses an iterative approach where the partitioner decides the processor mapping and HW design points of some tasks. The scheduler then simultaneously decides the processor mapping, HW design point and schedule time of the remaining tasks. There exists a tight coupling between the two design stages allowing them to produce superior quality designs in fewer iterations. The technique accounts for the time overheads due to inter-processor / intra-processor communication and shared memory access conflicts. It can therefore be used for both communication intensive and computation intensive applications. The technique also considers dynamic reconfiguration capability of the hardware coprocessor. The technique performs tradeoff analysis and maps hardware tasks to mutually <b>exclusive</b> temporal <b>segments</b> if this results in lower latency. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated by {{a case study of}} the JPEG image compression algorithm, comparison with an optimal ILP based approach and experimentation with synthetic graphs...|$|R

In spite of this, most of the owners failed to fully comprehend the specific need of this type of housing scheme, increasing the risk of it being a problematic undertaking. Unlike other types of pre-designed "mass housing" schemes, the detached housing scheme may be built specifically to cater the needs and demands of its owner. Therefore, owner participation during critical development stages is vital to guarantee the success of the development as a whole. In addition, due to its unique design the house would have to individually comply with the requirements and regulations of relevant authorities. Failure by the owner to recognise this will result in delays, penalties, disputes and ultimately cost overruns. These circumstances highlight the need for a research to guide the owner through participation during the critical development stages of a detached house. Therefore, this research aims to develop a guideline to improve owner participation for a successful detached house development in Malaysia. To achieve the aim, questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews were employed to collect the detached house owners' and consultants' & contractors' responses through their experiences in developing detached houses in Malaysia. Stratified and random sampling were utilised to gather information from both parties to represent Malaysian detached house participants. The questionnaire responses were analysed through the application of quantitative analysis such as descriptive analysis, factor analysis and structural equation modelling which were substantiated through qualitative analysis procedure such as content analysis. This research had identified that in order to produce a successful outcome detached house owners are required to participate during critical stages of the development. In the planning stage, the owner needs to provide proper specific input to the consultant regarding his/her expectations of the cost for the entire development, its detailed specification and general idea of the internal and external design of the detached house and its compound. In the contracting stage, the owner must make the appropriate choice of selecting the right contractor for the job. This decision may be taken after recommendations from the consultants or from the owner's personal contacts or experiences but it is not recommended for the owner to select a contractor primarily {{on the basis of the}} lowest bid. In the completion stage, the owner may need to attend a number of important site meetings to ensure that the progress of the works is according to what had been planned and the completion date is achievable. By having the owners undertake an active role during critical stages of the development, not only the quality and delivery of the development improved but also there is an increase in satisfaction to the owners themselves...|$|R

An implementation of the proposed method had been integrated into an automated design flow using commercial synthesis and simulation tools which was used {{on a wide range of}} benchmark designs. Reductions up to 57 % in average power, and up to 44 % and 34 % in peak power dissipation during shift and capture cycles, respectively, were obtained when using two scan segments.
