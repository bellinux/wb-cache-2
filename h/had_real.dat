In March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain.

The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that <b>had</b> <b>real</b> decision-making power.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals <b>had</b> <b>real</b> jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals – members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E

50|$|If X is {{a locally}} compact Hausdorff space, then RR(C0(X)) = dim(X), where dim is the Lebesgue {{covering}} dimension of X. As a result, real rank {{is considered a}} noncommutative generalization of dimension, but real rank can be rather different when compared to dimension. For example, most noncommutative tori <b>have</b> <b>real</b> rank zero, despite being a noncommutative version of the two-dimensional torus. For locally compact Hausdorff spaces, being zero-dimensional is equivalent to being totally disconnected. The analogous relationship fails for C*-algebras; while AF-algebras <b>have</b> <b>real</b> rank zero, the converse is false. Formulas that hold for dimension may not generalize for real rank. For example, Brown and Pedersen conjectured that RR(A &otimes; B) ≤ RR(A) + RR(B), since {{it is true that}} dim(X &times; Y) ≤ dim(X) + dim(Y). They proved a special case that if A is AF and B <b>has</b> <b>real</b> rank zero, then A &otimes; B <b>has</b> <b>real</b> rank zero. But in general their conjecture is false, there are C*-algebras A and B with real rank zero such that A &otimes; B <b>has</b> <b>real</b> rank greater than zero.|$|R

However, resistance continued at Oran and Casablanca.
