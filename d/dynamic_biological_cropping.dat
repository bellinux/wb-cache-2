40|$|Until {{recently}} {{the description of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>biological</b> processes was done using static models even if those biological processes such as lactation or growth provided us with longitudinal data. A classical example {{was the use of}} lactational milk yields even if individual test-days describing the underlying lactation curves were available. Similarly for growth, weights were corrected phenotypically to fit into categories like weaning or yearling weights. Several recent developments stimulated the research on alternative methods describing the evolution of the mean and the variances of continuos <b>dynamic</b> <b>biological</b> processes. These developments were especially the extension of repeatability models towards random regressions and the development of the (co) variance function approach, but the development of better computers allowing the storage and the processing of a huge quantity of data. Despite this the analysis of certain types of longitudinal data as test-day yields in large populations and/or international settings is still a major challenge. But a very important aspect of the analysis of longitudinal data is often forgotten: they give us other information than the one classically extracted from genetic evaluation systems. In fact, the detailed modeling of <b>dynamic</b> <b>biological</b> processes provides opportunities for the development of advanced management tools. This may have a large influence on the way genetic evaluation systems may evolve in the future, making them integrated systems for the management and selection of animals...|$|R

A <b>dynamic</b> graph represents dynamic properties as well as structural properties of biological networks. Microarray data can reflect <b>dynamic</b> properties of <b>biological</b> processes. Biological networks, which contain various molecules and relationships between molecules, show structural properties representing various relationships between entities.

40|$|It is system {{dynamics}} that determines {{the function of}} cells, tissues and organisms. To develop mathematical models and estimate their parameters are an essential issue for studying <b>dynamic</b> behaviors of <b>biological</b> systems which include metabolic networks, genetic regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways, under perturbation of external stimuli. In general, <b>biological</b> <b>dynamic</b> systems are partially observed. Therefore, a natural way to model <b>dynamic</b> <b>biological</b> systems is to employ nonlinear state-space equations. Although statistical methods for parameter estimation of linear models in <b>biological</b> <b>dynamic</b> systems have been developed intensively in the recent years, the estimation of both states and parameters of nonlinear dynamic systems remains a challenging task.

40|$|We {{propose a}} dynamic {{graph-based}} relational learning approach using graph-rewriting rules to analyze how biological networks change over time.

Most current graph-based data mining approaches overlook <b>dynamic</b> features of <b>biological</b> networks, because they are focused on only static graphs. First, we generate a dynamic graph, which is a sequence of graphs representing biological networks changing over time. Then, our approach discovers graph rewriting rules, which show how to replace subgraphs, between two sequential graphs. These rewriting rules describe the structural difference between two graphs, and describe how the graphs in the dynamic graph change over time.
