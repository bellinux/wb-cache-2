25|$|Fraud can be {{committed}} either by an <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> or by a provider. Member fraud consists of claims {{on behalf of}} ineligible members and/or dependents, alterations on enrollment forms, concealing pre-existing conditions, failure to report other coverage, prescription drug fraud, and failure to disclose claims that were {{a result of a}} work-related injury.|$|E
25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E
25|$|People {{with disabilities}} {{who do not}} have a work history and who receive Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, are {{enrolled}} in Medicaid as a mechanism to provide them with health insurance. Persons with a disability, including blindness or physical disability, deafness, or mental illness can apply for SSI. However, in order to be enrolled, applicants must prove that they are disabled {{to the point of being}} unable to work. In recent years, a substantial liberalization occurred in the field of individual disability income insurance, which provides benefits when an <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> is unable to work because of illness or injury (HIAA, p. 13).|$|E

This study examines the choice of healthcare providers under the National Health Insurance Scheme in Ghana, using nine hundred and eighty eight (988) <b>insured</b> <b>persons.</b> Stratified random sampling technique was employed in selecting respondents, while the multinomial logistic regression was employed. facility were found to discourage the use of orthodox healthcare among <b>insured</b> <b>persons.</b> The study recommend that social and economic infrastructure such as roads, telecommunication, and health improved in some cases to make orthodox healthcare providers more accessible and affordable, at the same time, it reduce the demand for unorthodox healthcare among the <b>insured</b> <b>persons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Social {{security}} contributions {{financed by}} the <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> other than the contribution payers are excluded from the scope of applicability of payment reliefs. As a consequence difficulties in payment of arrears arise. Projects of legislative amendments tend to limit {{the scope of the}} exclusion in favour of the contribution payers obliged to pay the assets to the social security institution. It seems that the limitation of the exclusion in favour of the <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> would be more appropriate in cases when the <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> are obliged to finance the contributions paid later than required by law...|$|R
40|$|The Bachelor's work {{is called}} "Experience of the {{application}} of the Act on Health Insurance". The work describes targets and principles, concept and structure of the new Act on Health Insurance. A separate part deals with health insurance benefits, obligations of employers, <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> and social security authorities. For comparison the work presents the health insurance system before the new enforceable health insurance legal regulations came into force, i. e. before 31 st December 2008. The aim of the work is to describe experience {{of the application}} of the new Act on Health Insurance, its pros and cons from the perspective of <b>insured</b> <b>persons,</b> employers and employees of social security authorities; {{to find out if the}} reduction of expenses for health insurance benefits was achieved and the <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> are better motivated to reduce their sickness leave. To find out given problems I choose a qualitative research, inquiry method, semi-standardized discussion technique and document analysis method, secondary data analysis technique. Discussions were held with 12 respondents from <b>insured</b> <b>persons,</b> employers and employees of social security authorities. The research shows that after the new Act on Health Insurance took effect the expenses for health insurance benefits have decreased and the <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> have been motivated to decrease their temporary sickness leave. A majority of the respondents is convinced of the increased administrative burden of the new system. Within the performed research were acquired opinions of <b>insured</b> <b>persons,</b> employers and employees of social security authorities which can serve as a topic of a potential discussion about an amendment of the Act on Health Insurance...|$|R
25|$|A {{key feature}} of the Dutch system is that {{premiums}} may not be related to health status or age. Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through risk equalization and a common risk pool. Funding for all short-term health care is 50% from employers, 45% from the <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about €100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and in 2012 €150 or US$196,) with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and deductible a year €220 (U.S. $288).|$|E
25|$|A law {{to improve}} the system of {{sickness}} benefits provided that those insured would receive compensation when obliged {{to stay at home}} to care for a sick child and thereby incurring a loss of income. An <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> could request unpaid leave of absence on such occasions. The same law established the right to a home help, to be paid for by the health service, where the parents are in hospital or undergoing treatment, provided that the household included a child under 8 or a handicapped child required special care. The SPD-FDP coalition’s time in office also saw a considerable expansion in the number of childcare places for three- to six-year-old children, with the number of facilities rising from 17,493 in 1970 to 23,938 in 1980, and the number of places from 1,160,700 to 1,392,500 during that same period. Subsidies for day care rose between 1970 and 1980, but fell between 1980 and 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Soft fraud, {{which is}} far more common than hard fraud, is {{sometimes}} {{also referred to as}} opportunistic fraud. [...] This type of fraud consists of policyholders exaggerating otherwise-legitimate claims. [...] For example, when involved in an automotive collision an <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> might claim more damage than actually occurred. Soft fraud can also occur when, while obtaining a new health insurance policy, an individual misreports previous or existing conditions in order to obtain a lower premium on his or her insurance policy.|$|E

50|$|Employees {{between the}} ages of 18 to 59 are covered under the workplace-based pension scheme and {{contribute}} 4.5% of their gross monthly earnings. The national pension covers employees who work in firms that employ five or more employees, fishermen, farmers, and the self-employed in both rural and urban areas. Employers are also covered under the workplace-based pension scheme and help cover their employees obligated 9% contribution by providing the remaining 4.5%. Anyone who is not employed, of the age of 60 or above, and excluded by article 6 of the National Pension Act but of the ages between 18 and 59, is covered under the individually <b>insured</b> pension scheme. <b>Persons</b> covered by the individually insured pension scheme are in charge of paying the entire 9% contribution themselves. Voluntarily <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> are not subjected to mandatory coverage but can choose to be. This category comprises retirees who voluntarily choose to have additional benefits, individuals under the age of 27 without income, and individuals whose spouses are covered under a public welfare system, whether military, governmental, or private school teacher pensions. Like the Individually <b>insured</b> <b>persons,</b> they too are in charge of covering the full amount of the contribution. Voluntarily and continuously <b>insured</b> <b>persons</b> consists of individuals 60 years of age who want to fulfill the minimum insured period of 20 years to qualify for old age pension benefits.

2500|$|A 2003 {{study in}} Health Affairs {{estimated}} that uninsured {{people in the}} U.S. received approximately $35billion in uncompensated care in 2001. The study noted that this amount per capita was half what the average <b>insured</b> <b>person</b> received. The study found that various levels of government finance most uncompensated care, spending about $30.6billion on payments and programs to serve the uninsured and covering as much as 80–85% of uncompensated care costs through grants and other direct payments, tax appropriations, and Medicare and Medicaid payment add-ons. Most of this money comes from the federal government, followed by state and local tax appropriations for hospitals. Another study by the same authors {{in the same year}} estimated the additional annual cost of covering the uninsured (in 2001dollars) at $34billion (for public coverage) and $69billion (for private coverage). These estimates represent an increase in total health care spending of 3–6% and would raise health care's share of GDP by less than one percentage point, the study concluded. Another study published in the same journal in 2004 estimated that the value of health forgone each year because of uninsurance was $65–$130billion and concluded that this figure constituted [...] "a lower-bound estimate of economic losses resulting from the present level of uninsurance nationally." ...|$|E
