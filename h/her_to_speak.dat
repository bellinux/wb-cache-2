500|$|Angelou {{uses the}} vernacular of African Americans, irony, understatement, and humor {{to make her}} {{statements}} about race and racism in America.

I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work."

500|$|In 2009 Peggy ran as an {{independent}} candidate in the local council elections against Archie's wishes.

A response from Peggy was then recorded, thanking Campbell for his input.

Johnson commented on his appearance: [...] "It was, of course, a tremendous honour to step inside that most venerable of London landmarks, The Queen Vic, and share a scene with another of the capital's icons, the fabulous Barbara Windsor."

500|$|Over {{the next}} two years Barrett was a key figure in keeping the {{newspaper}} in print despite the Home Secretary's efforts to suppress it. In April 1913 the offices of The Suffragette were raided by the police and the staff were arrested on charges of conspiring to damage property. Barrett was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment at Holloway. She immediately went on hunger strike, was transferred to Canterbury Prison, and after five days she was released under the [...] "Cat and Mouse Act". She moved into [...] "Mouse Castle", 2 Campden Hill Square, home of the Brackenbury family who were sympathetic suffragists. After three weeks at the house, Barrett emerged and was re-arrested. She went back on hunger strike and after four days was again released to [...] "Mouse Castle". This time she was smuggled out of the house in disguise to allow <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at meetings, before being re-arrested for a second time. For the third time Barrett was released after a hunger strike, but this time she successfully eluded the authorities and fled to a nursing home in Edinburgh where she remained until December 1913. On leaving Scotland she returned in secret to London; she hid at Lincoln's Inn House where she lived in a bedsit. Barrett continued to edit The Suffragette, but she travelled to Paris to discuss the future of the newspaper with Christabel Pankhurst after its offices were raided in May 1914. The result of their meeting was the relocation of The Suffragette to Edinburgh where the printers were at less risk of arrest. Barrett moved to Edinburgh and assumed the pseudonym [...] "Miss Ashworth". Barrett continued to publish the paper until its final edition on the week after the First World War was declared. During the war Barrett was a vocal supporter of British military action, as were the majority of the suffragette movement.

2500|$|A week later, to {{alleviate}} this problem, Wolpaw returned with sample dialogue {{made with a}} text-to-speech program, which {{was intended to be}} used as a series of messages relayed to the player in the relaxation vault, the first area of the game. The team liked the voice, describing it as [...] "funny" [...] and [...] "sinister", so Wolpaw decided to add this voice to other test chambers, all the while trying to think of story elements. The developers noticed that play testers were more motivated by the voice because they became attached to it. As a result, the team decided to make GLaDOS the narrative voice of Portal. While designing GLaDOS, one of the rules that the writers had was that they would not make her seem like a computer, for example having her say, [...] "Oh my nuts and bolts." [...] While GLaDOS is physically a computer and speaks with a computerized voice, they intended <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the player-character like a regular person.|$|E
