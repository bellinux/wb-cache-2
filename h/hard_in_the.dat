5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs {{such as the}} mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

5|$|Amidst {{his years}} of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by {{training}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dojo for five years, attaining the rank of 2nd dan black belt in Kyokushin in 1978. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a formidable challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization) {{when he was only}} a green belt. He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a heavyweight tournament in Australia in 1982. In 1982, Lundgren graduated with a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney. During his time in Sydney, he earned a living as a bouncer in a nightclub in the renowned King's Cross area.|$|E
5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the front}} foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second {{catching}} opportunity went {{in the same direction}} before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E
5|$|The clay-rich Willamette Valley {{soils are}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dry season, and the gopher's protuberant incisors are well adapted to these conditions. Adequate soil {{drainage}} and suitable plant food are essential {{components of the}} gopher's ideal habitat. Not typically found in wetland areas (where its tunnels would flood), the species is found in seral communities of grasses and shrubs. They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley, including fields of alfalfa, wheat and oats. The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features.|$|E

5|$|Their semi-final was {{a rematch}} of the 1966 Football League Cup Final, with West Ham United the {{opposition}} over two legs. Albion took a commanding {{lead in the}} first leg with a 4–0 victory, a goal from Dennis Clarke and a hat-trick from Jeff Astle. West Ham captain Bobby Moore urged his team to push Albion <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second leg, even in the closing stages of the match when they still had all four goals from the first leg to catch up with. Goals from Geoff Hurst and Johnny Byrne for West Ham were cancelled out by goals from Stanley Jones and Clarke by the 60th minute. The match finished with 2–2, thus Albion progressed due to a 6–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal again went on {{the attack}} as the second half began, with another corner won {{following}} a header by Buchan. Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. It was then Cardiff's turn to attack. Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan took it down the wing for Cardiff, who passed it to Davies, but his shot was just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the game to Arsenal's tempo, with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's James Nelson had him covered. City's attacking continued, and a chance was had by Hardy which appeared to shake Lewis in goal as the keeper didn't gather the ball cleanly.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Zealand, Lynch {{did well}} in the premier women's road stage race in 1991 and 1992, and won bronze in the 1991 New Zealand National Road Race Championships, yet was not picked for the 1992 Olympic road cycling team. Her biographer speculates that the {{selectors}} were possibly influenced in their decision by Lynch's failure to get Harris into a medal position at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. She competed <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1992 Tour Cycliste Féminin – the Tour de France for women. The ten-stage race was the most challenging event on the women's road racing calendar that year, and many big names entered. New Zealand had six competitors. Lynch {{set the tone for}} the team by coming fourth in the prologue in Paris. Jacqui Nelson and Lynch were the only New Zealanders remaining in the final stage, and Lynch came sixth ascending into Alpe d'Huez. Her biographer suggests that she made her point that her omission from the 1992 Olympic team had been a mistake.|$|E

5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{continued}} loss {{of political}} strength as poor economic times continued, Macdonald planned {{to hold an}} election {{by the end of}} 1886, but had not yet issued the writ when an Ontario provincial election was called by Macdonald's former student, Liberal Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat. The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll. Despite considerable campaigning by the Prime Minister, Mowat's Liberals were returned in Ontario, and increased their majority. Macdonald finally dissolved Parliament on 15 January 1887 for an election on 22 February. During the campaign, Macdonald suffered another blow when the Quebec provincial Liberals were able to form a government (four months after the October 1886 Quebec election), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City. Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter election, with Tupper (the new High Commissioner to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative hopes in Nova Scotia. The Liberal leader, Edward Blake, ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The Tories even took a narrow majority of Quebec's seats despite resentment over Riel's hanging. Macdonald became MP for Kingston once again. Even the younger ministers, such as future Prime Minister John Thompson, who sometimes differed with Macdonald on policy, admitted the Prime Minister was an essential electoral asset for the Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Saturday evening's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final qualifying session {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in dry weather conditions. Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions, and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1:45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session. He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem, which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso's engine upon discovering the issue. Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel, who recorded a lap 0.067seconds off Alonso's pace, and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher and brushed the wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane. Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track's final sector while running in teammate Button's tow. Button secured fourth and pushed <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final session which meant he had slight damage to his rear tyres on his first run, and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run. Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit. Barrichello qualified in sixth. The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher. Rosberg believed that he should have performed better in qualifying than in the practice session, as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance. The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica, in the faster Renault, who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|E
