5|$|Despite such hostility {{between the}} brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg {{and others in}} the {{military}} saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalised army. Röhm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. Limited by the Treaty of Versailles to one hundred thousand soldiers, army leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934.

5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, <b>demanding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Athenians submit to Sparta's demands.

The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.|$|E

Ravalomanana, claiming to have won {{a majority in the}} first round, refused to participate in a run-off, instead <b>demanding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> High Constitutional Court review the votes. Ratsiraka's supporters then blockaded the capital, which Ravalomanana's supporters controlled. Ravalomanana declared himself president on 22 February 2002. After a recount, on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court pronounced Ravalomanana the winner of an absolute majority {{in the first round of}} the election, and he was sworn in on 6 May.

5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further <b>demanding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> League condemn Italy's and Germany's {{decision}} to recognise the Nationalists.

The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
