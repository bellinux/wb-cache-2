40|$|BPVs are double {{stranded}} DNA {{viruses that}} can infect several species {{other than the}} natural host, cattle, including equids.

Whilst a causal relationship between BPV- 1 / 2 and equine sarcoids is now well established, how the disease is transmitted is not known. In this study we show BPV- 1 DNA can be detected in flies trapped in the proximity of sarcoid-affected animals. Sequence analysis of the BPV- 1 LCR from flies indicates that flies harbour BPV- 1 LCR sequence variants 11 and IV which are commonly detected in equine sarcoids.

40|$|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a skin <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumour</b> that is locally aggressive, with a {{tendency}} for local recurrence, but rarely metastasizes. A unique collaboration of multi-disciplinary experts from the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on DFSP diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by pathology. Analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific chromosomal translocations and fusion gene transcripts is useful to confirm a difficult DFSP diagnosis. Treatment is mainly surgical, with the aim to achieve complete resection of the tumour. In {{order to reduce the}} recurrence rate, the treatment of choice of DFSP seems to be Mohs' micrographic surgery (MMS) and related variants. In hospitals where only standard histopathological procedures are available, standard excision with lateral safety margin of 3 cm is advisable. Imatinib (Glivec®) is approved in Europe for the treatment of inoperable primary tumours, locally inoperable recurrent disease, and metastatic DFSP. Imatinib has also been given to patients with extensive, difficult-to-operate tumours for preoperative reduction of tumour size, but the usefulness of this attitude should be confirmed by clinical trials. Therapeutic decisions for patients with fibrosarcomatous DFSP should be primarily made by an interdisciplinary oncology team ('tumour board') ...|$|E

40|$|Bovine {{papillomavirus}} (BPV) {{is perhaps}} the most extensively studied animal papillomavirus. In cattle BPVs induce benign tumours of cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, called papillomas or warts. Cattle papillomas are benign tumours and generally regress without eliciting any serious clinical problems in the host, but occasionally persist and provide the focus for malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma, {{as in the case of}} cancer of the urinary bladder and cancer of the upper alimentary canal. BPV is the only papillomavirus that jumps species: the virus also infects equids, and gives rise to <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumours</b> called sarcoids. Sarcoids very rarely regress, more often they persist and can be locally aggressive. These tumours are the most common dermatological tumour of equids worldwide. The purpose of this review is to discuss the biology of BPV, the biology of bovine tumours and equine sarcoids, and present the current understanding of BPV in tumour pathogenesis in its natural host, cattle, and in its heterologous host, equids. Finally, the use of anti-BPV vaccines as a therapy for equine sarcoids will be discussed. Only limited information on the clinical or pathological aspects of either bovine or equine tumours will be provided as this subject has been extensively addressed previously...|$|R
40|$|Bovine papillomaviruses (BPV) are DNA oncogenic viruses {{inducing}} hyperplastic benign lesions of both cutaneous and mucosal epithelia in cattle. Ten (BPV 1 - 10) different viral genotypes {{have been}} characterised so far. BPV 1 - 10 are all strictly species-specific but BPV 1 / 2 may also infect equids inducing <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumours.</b> These benign lesions generally regress {{but may also}} occasionally persist, leading to {{a high risk of}} evolving into cancer, particularly in the presence of environmental carcinogenic co-factors. Among these, bracken fern is the most extensively studied. The synergism between immunosuppressants and carcinogenic principles from bracken fern and the virus has been experimentally demonstrated for both urinary bladder and alimentary canal cancer in cows whose diets were based on this plant. BPV associated tumours have veterinary and agricultural relevance in their own right, although they have also been studied as a relevant model of Human papillomavirus (HPV). Recent insights into BPV biology have paved the way to new fields of speculation on the role of these viruses in neoplastic transformation of cells other than epithelial ones.

40|$|Overexpression and {{activation}} of TPM 3 -ALK tyrosine kinase fusion protein is a causal oncogenic {{event in the}} development of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma and Inflammatory Myofibroblastic ALK-positive tumours. Thus, the development of ALK specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a current therapeutic challenge. Animal models are essential to assess, in vivo, the efficiency of ALK-oncogene inhibitors and to identify new and/or additional therapeutic targets in the ALK tumorigenesis pathway. Using the tetracycline system to allow conditional and concomitant TPM 3 -ALK and luciferase expression, we have developed a unique transplant model for bioluminescent TPM 3 -ALK-induced <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumours</b> in athymic nude mice. The reversible TPM 3 -ALK expression allowed us to demonstrate that this oncogene is essential for the tumour growth and its maintenance. In addition, we showed that this model could be used to precisely assess tumour growth inhibition upon ALK chemical inactivation. As proof of principle, we used the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A to inhibit ALK oncoprotein activity. As expected, herbimycin A treatment reduced tumour growth as assessed both by tumour volume measurement and bioluminescent imaging. We conclude that this transplant model for TPM 3 -ALK-induced tumours represents a valuable tool not only to accurately and rapidly evaluate in vivo ALK-targeted therapies but also to gain insight into the mechanism of ALK-positive tumour development...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Soft tissue tumours (STT) {{are defined}} {{traditionally}} as mesenchymal proliferations {{that occur in}} the extra-. skeletal nonepithelial tissues of the body excluding viscera, meninges and lymphoreticular system. These tumours occur in children where they may result in severe debilitating disease. This study was therefore aimed at determining the age, gender and site distribution of soft tissue tumours in the young. Materials and Methods: The records of all pathology consultations during the 20 year period from (1990 - 2010), from the Department of Morbid Anatomy/Histopathology, University of Benin Teaching Hospital from birth to 20 years, were utilized for this study. The lesions were standardized in accordance with the world health organization (WHO) classification. Permission for this study was obtained from the UBTH ethics committee (protocol number ADM/E 22 /A/VOL. VII/ 142). Results: A total of 139 lesions were recorded, 72 males and 67 females with a male/female ratio of 1. 1 : 1. Benign tumours constituted 113 (81 %) while malignant tumours accounted for 26 (19 %). This study demonstrated that, nerve sheath tumours and vascular tumours accounted for 25 % of STT in children followed by adipocytic tumours 22 %, skeletal muscle tumours 17 %, fibrohistiocytic <b>tumours</b> 7 %, <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumours</b> 5 %, and perivascular tumours 1 % respectively. Majority of these tumours were located in the head and lower extremities with fewer in the upper extremities and trunk. These lesions were predominant in females of the older age group (10 - 20 years) unlike in their male counterparts. Conclusion: This study has shown that benign soft tissue tumours are more prevalent than the malignant varieties in juveniles...|$|R

40|$|Equine sarcoids are benign <b>fibroblastic</b> skin <b>tumours</b> {{that are}} {{recognized}} throughout the world. Infection with bovine papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 has been implicated {{as a major}} factor in disease development; however, the cellular mechanisms underlying fibroblast transformation remain poorly defined. The present study further characterizes aspects of the association with BPV in 15 equine sarcoids. BPV DNA was demonstrated in 12 / 15 tumours collected from different areas of Italy. Nine of these 12 tumours expressed the BPV oncoproteins E 5 and E 7, but these oncoproteins were not expressed by normal equine cells. The BPV E 5 protein is known to bind to the platelet-derived growth factor-b receptor (PDGF-bR) and this molecule was expressed by 11 of the 12 sarcoids in which E 5 was demonstrated. These findings add further weight to the theory that BPV and the PDGF-bR may have a role in the pathogenesis of this disease...|$|R
40|$|Large {{randomised}} {{trials are}} mandatory when {{one wants to}} examine the effects of different aspects (such as the treatment modality) of a pathological condition on the overall outcome. This is especially true when studying a disease in which there is a multifactorial influence on progression and outcome such as osteosarcoma. Data on 570 patients with biopsy-proven primary central osteosarcoma of an extremity included in two consecutive studies of the European Osteosarcoma Intergroup (EOI) were analysed in order to evaluate if the histological subtype of the biopsy specimen correlated with the subtype of osteosarcoma represented in the resected specimen, if there was a relationship between the histological subtype and overall survival and if there was a relationship between the histological subtype and histological response to chemotherapy. High-grade osteosarcoma, as defined by established criteria, was subtyped as either conventional, chondroblastic, teleangiectatic, small cell, fibroblastic, osteoclast rich, anaplastic and sclerotic/osteoblastic well differentiated. A panel of experienced pathologists with a special interest in bone pathology was appointed to review the histological diagnosis and to assess the tumour response to chemotherapy on the resected specimen of each patient entered into the trials. Subtyping on the biopsy specimen proved to be highly representative for the subtype of the whole tumour. In 102 patients for which subtyping was performed on the biopsy and the resected specimens, there were only two discrepancies. Of the 568 patients for whom subtype was available, 404 (71 %) were of the conventional type, 54 (10 %) were chondroblastic, 53 (9 %) had <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumours</b> and the remainder consisted of rare subtypes. A good response to preoperative chemotherapy was defined as 90 % or more necrosis. The proportion of patients responding well to chemotherapy differed significantly between subtypes (Chi-square test statistics= 11. 44, P= 0. 01 on 3 degrees of freedom (d. f.)). In comparison with the conventional subtype, there was a higher proportion of good responders in the fibroblastic group and a lower proportion of good responders in the chondroblastic group. Good responders had a significantly better survival than patients who responded poorly to the pro-operative chemotherapy (logrank statistic= 25. 20, P< 0. 01 on 1 df). Survival did not differ significantly according to subtype (logrank statistic= 2. 72, P= 0. 44 on 3 df), although there was a suggestion that patients with chondroblastic tumours experienced a better long-term survival. This large set of prospectively-collected data provides important information on the relationship between pathological subtype, histological response and survival. Histological response has a known prognostic effect on survival, and we have shown that the rates of response differ by subtype. There is some evidence from this study that the specific histological subtypes, i. e. the chondroblastic subtype, experience better survival. However, despite this large multi-institutional study, we have insufficient numbers of non-conventional tumours to examine this unambiguously for these subsets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|There are {{no reports}} in the {{literature}} describing any tumours, and specifically sarcoids, in zebras. The equine sarcoid, a locally aggressive, <b>fibroblastic</b> skin <b>tumour,</b> {{is the most common}} dermatological neoplasm reported in horses. The Cape mountain zebra (CMZ) has been described {{as one of the most}} vulnerable mammals in South Africa with current populations existing in isolated units. All South African CMZ are descendants from no more than 30 individual animals originating from 3 populations, namely the Mountain Zebra National Park, and Kammanassie and Gamka Mountain Nature Reserves near Cradock. The possibility therefore exists that the existing populations arose from a very small gene pool and that they are considerably inbred. A reduction in major histocompatibility complex diversity due to genetic bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding probably contributed to uniform population sensitivity and the subsequent development of sarcoid in two CMZ populations, namely in the Bontebok National Park and Gariep Nature Reserve. The entire population of CMZ in the Bontebok National Park was observed and sampled during 2002 to document the prevalence and body distribution of sarcoids. During the same year, a comparative study was carried out on an outbred population of Burchell's zebra in the Kruger National Park. The prevalence in CMZ in the Bontebok National Park was 53 %, while the Burchell's zebra in Kruger National Park had a prevalence of 1. 9 %. The most common sites for sarcoid in CMZ were the ventral abdomen and limbs. Prevalence of sarcoids in horses recorded in the literature varies between 0. 5 %and 2 %. The Gariep Nature Reserve recently reported a prevalence of almost 25 % in CMZ in the reserve...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Nine of the 15 {{neonatal}} CBA mice injected intramuscularly with a Moloney concentrate containing FBJ virus developed tumours: likewise 5 of 7 CBA neonates injected intraperitoneally with a cell-free filtrate {{derived from}} a transplanted tumour of the former group. Of soft tissue origin, these FBJ sarcomata have a characteristic histological appearance and are of low grade malignancy. Although occasional islets of cartilage osteoid and bone were noted, these were regarded as indicative of evolutionary metaplasia in the collagenous matrix of pleomorphic <b>fibroblastic</b> sarcoma. No <b>tumour</b> was acceptable as osteosarcoma of conventional type and osseous origin. There were, however, additionally 2 minute spindle cell sarcomata arising in femoral periosteum and non-neoplastic periosteal proliferation was observed. The differences of these FBJ fibroblastic sarcomata from murine osteosarcoma-either spontaneous or induced by Sr 90 -are emphasized. Furthermore, their deviation from the structural pattern and behaviour of human osteosarcoma is discussed. TUMOURS of osseous origin may be experimentally induced in laboratory animals by various methods, including external irradiation, the administration of bone-seeking radionuclides, intramedullary deposition of chemical carcinogens and subperiosteal sheathing with plastic film (Owen, 1969). More recently their association with common viruses was reported by Markowa and Marek (1967) and also with oncogenic viruses by Finkel et al. (1966), by Soehner and Dmochowski (1969) and Soehner et al. (1970). Although rare, spontaneous osteosarcoma in mice has been reported by several authors (Dunn and Andervont...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of laminin, fibronectin, and interstitial collagen type III {{have been investigated}} {{in a series of}} 60 soft tissue tumours by immunochemistry. Positive laminin staining was seen in sites predicted by the distribution of ultrastructurally visible basal lamina. Pericellular laminin was present in all benign tumours of Schwann cell and smooth muscle origin examined, in the two malignant Schwannomas examined, and in six of 13 leiomyosarcomas. It was also evident around nests of cells in an alveolar soft part sarcoma and around malignant endothelial cells in an angiosarcoma. In <b>fibroblastic</b> and fibrohistiocytic <b>tumours</b> it was found only in blood vessel walls. The results of laminin staining led to revision of the original histopathological diagnosis in seven of the 60 cases studied. Fibronectin was abundant in the stroma of most neoplasms, both benign and malignant. It was also found in a distribution parallel to that of laminin. In some tumours this was clearly distinguishable from the distribution of interstitial collagen. Intracellular fibronectin was shown consistently only in mast cell granules. Its demonstration in synovial cells, fibroblasts, and histiocytes was more variable. Interstitial collagen type II had the most irregular distribution of the three proteins. It was as plentiful in tumours of smooth muscle origin as in <b>tumours</b> of <b>fibroblastic</b> origin, but was scanty in fibrous histiocytomas. Its distribution appeared similar to that of laminin and fibronectin in leiomyomas, but differed from these two proteins in Schwann cell tumours and other neoplasms. In one leiomyosarcoma fibronectin, laminin, and type III collagen appeared to be lost concomitantly from tumour cell peripheries...|$|R
40|$|The equine sarcoid is {{the most}} {{commonly}} detected skin tumour in equidae worldwide and {{has been reported in}} horses, donkeys, mules and zebra. Sarcoids can be defined as locally aggressive, <b>fibroblastic,</b> benign <b>tumours</b> of the equine skin and although they do not metastasise, they exhibit variable clinical presentations ranging from small alopecic areas to rapidly growing, ulcerated fleshy masses. Clinical behaviour may also vary, from aggressive infiltrative growth to spontaneous regression. Diverse treatment modalities have been reported, and these have been used separately, or have been combined, with variable efficacy. No single therapeutic approach {{has been found to be}} universally successful. Although rarely life-threatening, equine sarcoids can have important welfare and economic implications. There is a large body of evidence now supporting the hypothesis that bovine papilloma virus (BPV) is the aetiological agent of equine sarcoids and our understanding of the general pathophysiology of the disease continues to progress; however, several fundamental aspects of the disease remain unclear. In the first chapter, the clinical aspects of the disease are discussed and evidence to support a viral aetiology is presented, along with background information regarding papilloma virus infections in the natural host. An epidemiological overview of the disease that considers the most current theories and understanding of equine sarcoids is also given. Chapter II describes the materials and methods used in the course of carrying out the investigations detailed in Chapters III, IV and V. The aim of Chapter III was to investigate the potential role of flies as vectors in transmission of equine sarcoids between infected and susceptible animals. We found that BPV- 1 DNA can be detected in flies trapped from areas where animals with BPV- 1 infected sarcoids are housed. This study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that flies may therefore be significant in disease transmission. Such evidence will be of benefit in formulating management control strategies for fly control measures that will reduce the incidence and spread of equine sarcoids. The work described in Chapter IV was carried out to investigate the hypothesis that the development of the sarcoid tumour arises primarily through inhibition of apoptotic pathways by viral gene products. Assessment of DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in BPV transformed equine fibroblasts revealed that sarcoid derived cells and BPV- 1 transfected fibroblasts are less resistant to apoptosis than normal, BPV-negative control equine fibroblasts, but are more likely to recover from DNA damage and continue to grow and divide. Further research was directed towards identifying the viral genes responsible for conferring resistance to apoptosis through siRNA knock-down and monitoring expression of endogenous cellular proteins known to be involved in apoptotic pathways. Using an siRNA targeted to a particular viral protein, we were able to reduce the ability of the BPV transformed cells to survive after DNA damage. Potentially, this information can now be used to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The final chapter describes the results of a study in to the expression of the p 53 protein in sarcoids in vivo and in BPV transformed cells in vitro in tissue culture. In vivo, analysis of 51 equine sarcoid lesions showed that 48 % of tumours are associated with nuclear p 53 protein expression and that high levels of p 53 were associated with clinically aggressive <b>tumour</b> types (<b>fibroblastic).</b> Interestingly, we observed high levels of cytoplasmic p 53 staining with no nuclear staining in one tumour in vivo. In vitro, p 53 mRNA levels were assessed in BPV transformed and BPV negative fibroblasts. The half-life of the p 53 protein, the cellular location and functionality were also investigated in vitro. The results showed that BPV transformed equine fibroblast cells also exhibit increased nuclear p 53 protein expression and one cell line (EqS 04 b) showed a cytoplasmic staining pattern similar to that observed in vitro. However, the abnormal level and location of the p 53 does not appear to affect the transactivational functionality of p 53 since p 21 expression was induced by exposing the cells to UVB irradiation.
