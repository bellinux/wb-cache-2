5|$|The Murray cod is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, <b>freshwater</b> <b>turtles,</b> water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E
5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and <b>freshwater</b> <b>turtles.</b> Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E

25|$|Despite these sanctions, the {{greatest}} threat to black marsh turtles, along with other Southeast Asian <b>freshwater</b> <b>turtles,</b> is the rising demand for turtles for the international meat trade, particularly for the Chinese food markets.

25|$|In 2003, a 10-year {{program for}} the {{conservation}} of <b>freshwater</b> <b>turtles</b> and tortoises was initiated by the bank in collaboration with government forest departments from concerned states across India. In May 2004, the bank successfully bred one of the world's most critically endangered turtles, the Indian painted roof turtle, Batagur kachuga, {{for the first time ever}} in captivity. The species is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and is listed under the Action Plan Rating I of the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. The bank is home to another near endemic Batagur turtle, Batagur baska. Incidentally, recent evidence suggests that this species is extinct in the wild and only 13 individuals remain in captivity, including 4 adult females of which 2 are at the CrocBank. The bank sends 50% of its stock of the red-crowned roof turtle to the Uttar Pradesh forest department to introduce into the wild. In 2004, concerned parties created the Gharial Multi-Task Force (renamed to Gharial Conservation Alliance in 2008) to create a specialist organization dedicated to saving gharials from extinction.|$|E

Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), ibises and brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), as well as limpkins (Aramus guarauna) and snail kites that eat apple snail, which in turn feed on the sawgrass.

2500|$|Owing to past exploitation, the {{ecosystems}} of {{the lake}} have been placed under stress. Marshes, for example, are turning to open water, and cypress swamps are being killed by salt water intrusion. However, Brown Pelicans and Bald Eagles, once scarce, are now a common sight along the shores. A team of experts assembled by The Nature Conservancy assessed the situation in 2004. They identified seven target habitat types that were in particular need of conservation management: bottomland hardwood forest, cypress swamp, relict ridge woodland, fresh/intermediate marsh, brackish/salt marsh, lake open water, and littoral submersed aquatic vegetation. [...] The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from lack of fresh water input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as Chinese tallow while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as elephant's-ear. The team also identified four key animal species that could indicate {{the degree to which}} the system declines or improves. [...] These were rangia clam (representing lake bottom habitat), gulf sturgeon and paddlefish (representing fish communities) and the alligator snapping turtle (one of the largest <b>freshwater</b> <b>turtles</b> in the world, but in decline owing to over- harvesting). The future {{of the lake}} depends, in part, on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin, and controlling urban sprawl on the North shore. [...] Selected species, like the paddlefish and alligator snapping turtle, would benefit from reduced harvesting. The lake could change considerably without such conservation planning. [...] A few examples of future change might include more cypress swamps converting to anthropogenic marsh or open water, Chinese tallow displacing native forests, and, with a warming climate, mangrove trees replacing brackish marsh.|$|E
