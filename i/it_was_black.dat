5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>black</b> and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E
25|$|In fact, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Black</b> {{who was the}} {{original}} target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954 scouting trip to Richmond. Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills. Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks ("You mean you want him?!") {{and the fact that}} Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby. Before leaving Richmond, he informed Macon that such subterfuge was pointless since the Pirates, well {{on their way to a}} fourth consecutive last-place finish, would thereby secure first pick in the winter draft.|$|E
25|$|In another Greek story {{involving}} Scorpio without Orion, Phaeton (the mortal male {{offspring of}} Helios) {{went to his}} father, who had earlier sworn by the River Styx to give Phaeton anything he should ask for. Phaeton wanted to drive his father's Sun Chariot for a day. Although Helios tried to dissuade his son, Phaeton was adamant. However, when the day arrived, Phaeton panicked and {{lost control of the}} white horses that drew the chariot. First, the Earth grew chill as Phaeton flew too high and encountered the celestial scorpion, its deadly sting raised to strike. Alarmed, he dipped the chariot too close, causing the vegetation to burn. By accident, Phaeton turned most of Africa into desert and darkened the skin of the Ethiopian nation until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>black.</b> Eventually, Zeus was forced to intervene by striking the runaway chariot and Phaeton with a lightning bolt {{to put an end to}} its rampage and Phaeton plunged into the River Eridanos.|$|E

25|$|The {{third period}} of Black {{nationalism}} arose during the post-Reconstruction era, particularly among various African-American clergy circles. Separated circles were already established and accepted because African-Americans had long endured {{the oppression of}} slavery and Jim Crowism in the United States since its inception. The clerical phenomenon led {{to the birth of}} a modern Black nationalism that stressed the need to separate from non-blacks and to build separated communities to promote racial pride and to collectivize resources. The new ideology became the philosophy of groups like the Moorish Science Temple and the Nation of Islam. By 1930, Wallace Fard Muhammad had founded the Nation of Islam. His method to spread information about the Nation of Islam used unconventional tactics to recruit individuals in Detroit, Michigan. Later on, Elijah Muhammad would lead the Nation of Islam becoming mentors of people like Malcolm X. Although the 1960s brought a period of heightened religious, cultural and political nationalism, still <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Black</b> nationalism that would lead the promotion of Afrocentrism.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>black</b> because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E
25|$|Stone was {{in command}} at the fort during two war-related incidents. In the days {{immediately}} preceding June 18, 1832, Apple River Fort's stables were broken into and horses were stolen during the night. This incident {{was one of}} several around that time which led Illinois militia officer James W. Stephenson to clash with British Band warriors at Waddams Grove on June 18. On June 24, the Battle of Apple River Fort commenced at the fort. Approximately 150200 Sauk and Fox warriors under the command of Black Hawk attacked the fort, which was defended by about 25 militia. The militia was shorthanded during the battle, as most of the fort's detachment were not present. Inside the fort, the people of the nearby settlement had taken refuge. One woman, Elizabeth Armstrong, was singled out for her bravery after the battle. She rallied the fort's women to assist during the battle by making musketballs and reloading weapons. Fierce fighting ensued for at least 45 minutes with both sides exchanging heavy gunfire. Believing the fort to be more heavily defended than <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>Black</b> Hawk and his band eventually retreated. Casualties were few, given the intensity of the battle. Militia member George Herclerode was shot in the neck or head early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Florida's {{school system}} was in disarray {{at the end}} of the Civil War; in 1866 a Northerner named A. E. Kinne noted there were fewer schools for white {{children}} than freedmen's schools for black children. In 1860, there were no official schools for black children and slaves were prohibited from any education. At the same time, there were 97 public schools for white children and 40 private academies for them, some of which appeared to get public funding. [...] In May 1865, the total Florida population was 154,000, and an estimated 47% of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>black,</b> almost all of whom were former slaves.

2500|$|Following the {{description}} in Williamson's script of a [...] "ghost mask", Craven and designers had {{originally intended to}} use a white-motif, creating a white cloak and hood for the killer's costume.

The cloak itself had to be custom-made for the film as the [...] "Father Death" [...] outfit identified in Scream as that of the killers did not really exist, as the Fun World mask was sold only as a stand-alone item. The cloak entered into retail markets only following the release of Scream. Each cloak was estimated to cost $700 to hand-produce by a seamstress and was made of a heavy, thick, black material with reflective threads woven throughout, creating a subtle glimmer. [...] The cloak was created to help conceal the identity of the killers by covering most of their visible body, as it was believed that otherwise audiences would be able to guess which character was involved by their clothing and body-shape.|$|E

2500|$|The men {{proceeded}} {{to take down}} the Chinese flag atop the police station to put up another flag, with conflicting reports about the new flag's design. The government says the flag was black with white Arabic lettering: the Black Standard {{commonly known as the}} [...] "black flag of jihad". Residents interviewed by the Financial Times say it was the [...] "blue half-moon flag" [...] used by Xinjiang independence advocates, while a resident quoted in the South China Morning Post said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>black</b> with a crescent. Nuerbage police station chief Abulaiti Maitiniyazi (Ablet Metniyaz) was a witness to the attack. He recalled shouting to the men in Uyghur for a peaceful settlement, but receiving molotov cocktails and rocks in return. One Han paramilitary officer belonging to people's armed police force was killed by a molotov cocktail when his squad was entering ground level by force. According to Maitiniyazi, it was when the attackers were hacking at the civilian hostages' face, nose and ears with knives with intent to kill that police shot 14 of the assailants to death and captured the other four for questioning, ending the attack within 90 minutes of the initial break-in. Six of the eight hostages were rescued alive, while two Han women hostages were hacked to death during the operation, and four Uyghurs were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.|$|E
