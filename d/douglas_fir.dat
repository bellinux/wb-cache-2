5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E

50|$|<b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> are medium-size to {{extremely}} large evergreen trees, 20 - 100 m tall (although only coast <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> reach {{such great}} height). The leaves are flat, soft, linear, 2 - 4 cm long, generally resembling {{those of the}} firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which {{can be useful in}} recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start high off the ground. <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.|$|R

He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated soy protein could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir.</b> Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is common}} east of the Rocky Mountains, but rare in the Pacific Northwest. In California, where it is widely distributed, the fungus is found {{in a variety of}} plant communities, {{including}} aspen, coastal oak woodland, <b>Douglas</b> <b>Fir,</b> Klamath mixed conifer, montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, montane riparian, Redwood, Sierran mixed conifer, valley oak woodland, valley-foothill riparian, and White Fir.

5|$|Mycena cinerella is a {{saprobic}} fungus, and derives nutrients by decomposing {{leaf litter}} and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic {{matter in the}} soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under pine and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> typically {{in the late summer}} and autumn. In the United States, it has been collected from Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California. In Europe, it has also been collected from the Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{is within}} the Northern/Canadian Rockies ecoregion, which {{supports}} an abundance of wildlife {{in part because of}} its varied geology and natural history. The area contains a wide range of vegetation, from densely wooded coniferous forests to rolling grassy hills and meadows. Ponderosa pine and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> are common in the drier and lower elevation areas throughout the region. The ponderosa pine is the official tree of the City of Spokane, which is where specimens were first collected by botanist David Douglas in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius vinaceorufescens grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under pine between August and October. The species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii). It is a fairly common and widely distributed species in North America. The mushroom {{has been found in}} boreal forests and high-elevation forests of the Southern Appalachians, associated with the tree genera Picea, Abies, and Pinus. In California, it has been noted to commonly co-occur with L.fragilis, L.rubrilacteus, Russula emetica, and R.cremoricolor.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} created out of {{lodgepole}} pines, bristlecone pines, and <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs.</b> The {{base of the}} mountain is located at 10050 ft and the summit is at about 10650 ft.|$|R
5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata). A.ferreum is, however, only common on neotropic yellowwoods (Podocarpus).|$|R
50|$|Flora at Alderwood {{includes}} big <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs,</b> Pacific dogwoods, bigleaf maples, {{and other}} trees. Smaller plants, especially lush in spring, include trillium, yellow violets, and bleeding hearts, ferns and mosses. Among the fauna observed here are kingfishers and cutthroat trout.|$|R
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E
5|$|Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{is found}} in Africa (Tunisia), Australia, Asia (including the eastern Himalayas of India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, China, the Far East of Russia, and Turkey) and Europe (including the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain). It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala. Widely distributed in North America, it is most common in the southeast and along the Pacific Coast. The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa, limited in distribution to Lewis County, Washington, associates with <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Variety compactospora is known from Sardinia, Italy, {{where it has been}} found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), tree heath (Erica arborea), and holm oak (Quercus ilex).|$|E

5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
40|$|Protection {{of young}} <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> and other {{conifers}} from attacks {{by the large}} pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. (Col. Curculionidae), consisted of repeated insecticide treatments by dipping or spraying with organochlorine or pyrethroid insecticides. The use of a controlled-release formulation as Marshal/SuSCon containing the systemic carbamate insecticide carbosulfan in nurseries or on reforestation sites as a single treatment at planting time ensures a good level of protection. Using gas chromatography as a standard analytical method, carbofuran, a byproduct of carbosulfan, was detected and admitted to be the effective product. Its penetration in young plants is quick, {{and high levels of}} this product are observed 24 months after treatment. Comparisons between nursery and field trials show good protection of young <b>Douglas</b> <b>firs</b> over the critical period of establishment of the plantation with this formulation...|$|R
25|$|Many EcM fungal fruiting {{bodies are}} well known. These include the {{economically}} important and edible truffle (Tuber) and the deadly death caps and destroying angels (Amanita).

5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri, {{commonly}} known as Zeller's Bolete, is an edible species of mushroom in the family Boletaceae. First described scientifically by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several genera, including Boletus, Boletellus, and Xerocomus. Found solely in western North America from British Columbia south to Mexico, the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black caps with uneven surfaces, the yellow pores {{on the underside of}} the caps, and the red-streaked yellow stems. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> forests or on their margins. The development of the fruit bodies is gymnocarpic, meaning that the hymenium appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus, {{commonly}} known as the bloody milk cap, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. First described from France in 1811, the species was given its current name by Elias Fries in 1838 when he transferred it to Lactarius. Found in Asia, Mediterranean Africa, and Europe, fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow scattered or in groups on the ground under conifers, especially <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir.</b> When bruised or cut, the fruit bodies ooze a blood-red to purple latex that slowly turns greenish upon exposure to air. The caps are orangish to reddish-brown, and become funnel-shaped with age. The gills are pinkish to purplish. Different forms have been described from Italy, but these are not universally accepted as distinct. L.sanguifluus mushrooms are edible, and sold in rural markets of Europe and Asia. Fruit bodies grown in polluted soil, including roadsides subject to heavy traffic, can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals. Several sterols and pigment have been isolated and identified from the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Morchella frustrata fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or {{in small}} groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests {{that it might be}} also widely distributed in western North America, but so far has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.|$|E

Root/soil respiration was measured daily. The results showed a significant decrease of the 14 CO 2 root/soil respiration during the first 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to either ozone or sulfur dioxide. The ultimate level of 14 CO 2 root/soil respiration did not differ significantly, which suggests a recovery of the exposed trees during the first weeks after exposure...|$|R
