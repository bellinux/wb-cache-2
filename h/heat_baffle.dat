The bulk level (gas-liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel. Valves on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation.

25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube <b>heat</b> exchangers. <b>Baffles</b> must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis novel configurations and operating strategies in the mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) crystalliser are investigated, aided by integrated process analytical technologies (PAT) and crystallisation informatics system (CryPRINS) tools. The MSMPR is an idealised crystalliser model that assumes: steady-state operation; well mixed suspension with no product classification, such that all volume elements contain a mixture of particles (small and large) and crystal size distribution (CSD) that is independent of location in the crystalliser and is identical of the product withdrawn; and uniform supersaturation thought, leading to constant nucleation and growth rates. Single-stage MSMPR designs with continuous recycle/recirculation and modified heat exchanger were investigated and found to minimise fouling, encrustation and transfer line blockages. In particular, a modified MSMPR with <b>baffled</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger was found to significantly reduce the temperature between incoming feed hot feed solution and the cooled crystalliser, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} fouling, encrustation and blockages. In addition, the concept of the periodic mixed suspension mixed product removal (PMSMPR) crystallisation process is demonstrated for the first time viz single- and multi-stage cascaded operations. This method of operation involves the periodic transfer of slurry (addition and withdrawal) at high flow rates from either a single stirred vessel or between a number of stirred vessels arranged in series. The PMSMPR is therefore characterised by periodic withdrawals of product slurry. Similar to the MSMPR, the product withdrawn from a PMSMPR has exactly the same composition as the vessel at the time of removal. The rapid withdrawal of slurry at high flow rates in PMSMPR operation leads to the prevention of particle sedimentation and blockage of transfer lines. The transfer of slurry (to/from) the PMSMPR is followed by a holding (or pause) period when no addition or withdrawal of slurry takes place. The holding period extends the mean residence time of the PMSMPR relative to a typical MSMPR, thereby increasing the yield and productivity of crystallisation as more time is allowed for consumption of available supersaturation viz crystal growth and nucleation. A state of controlled operation (SCO) in the periodic flow process, defined as a state of the system that maintains itself despite regular, but controlled disruptions was characterised using the PAT tools and CryPRINS within an intelligent decision support (IDS) framework. The crystallisation of paracetamol (PCM) from isopropyl alcohol (IPA) using different configurations of a single-stage continuous MSMPR crystalliser that incorporated continuous recycle and recirculation loop, and a novel design with <b>baffled</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger was investigated. Crystallisations of PCM-IPA carried out in the MSMPR without heat exchanger suffered from severe fouling, encrustation and blockage problems due to the high level of supersaturation (S = 1. 39) in the crystalliser, which was required for the initial burst of nucleation to generate enough particles for later growth, as well as the large temperature difference between the incoming feed (45 oC) and the crystalliser (10 oC). Using the modified MSMPR design with <b>baffled</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger, the challenges of fouling, encrustation and blockage were significantly reduced due to the rapid lowering of the feed stream temperature prior to entering the crystalliser. In addition, the closed loop system led to conservation of material, which is a great benefit since large amounts of materials would otherwise be required if the MSMPR was operated with continuous product removal. This design is great for research purposes, in particular, to investigate process design and optimisation. Continuous crystallisation of PCM in the presence of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) additive was investigated in the modified MSMPR design with heat exchanger. HPMC was found to improve the crystallisation performance, leading to complete avoidance of fouling, encrustation and blockages at a concentration of 0. 05 wt...|$|R

Shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} in their various construction modifications {{are probably the}} most widespread and commonly used basic heat exchanger configuration in the process industries. There are many modifications of the basic configuration which can be used to solve special problems. Baffles serve two functions: Most importantly, they support the tubes in the proper position during assembly and operation and prevent vibration of the tubes caused by flow-induced eddies, and secondly, they guide the shell-side flow {{back and forth across the}} tube field, increasing the velocity and the heat transfer coefficient. The objective of this paper is to find the baffle spacing at fixed baffle cut that will give us the optimal values for the overall heat transfer coefficient. To do this Microsoft Excel 2003 package was employed. The results obtained from previous studies showed that to obtain optimal values for the overall heat transfer coefficient for the shell and tube <b>heat</b> exchangers a <b>baffle</b> cut of 20 to 25 percent of the diameter is common and the maximum spacing depends on how much support the tubes need.

The <b>heat</b> exchanger is <b>baffled</b> internally and the baffles have three purposes: a transport of the solids, enlargement of the heat transfer area and agitation of the particulate bed {{in order to achieve}} good mixing.

The available data for heat transfer to air in straight ducts of rectangular and circular cross section have been correlated in plots of Stanton number versus Reynolds number {{to provide a}} background {{for the study of}} the data for finned cylinders. Equations are recommended for both the streamlined and turbulent regions, and data are presented for the transition region between turbulent and laminar flow. Use of hexagonal ends on round tubes causes the characteristics of laminar flow to extend to high Reynolds numbers. Average coefficients for the entire finned cylinder have been calculated from the average temperature at the base of the fins and an equation which was derived to allow for the effectiveness of the fins. The available results for each finned cylinder are correlated herein in terms of graphs of Stanton number versus Reynolds number. In general, for a given Reynolds number, the Stanton number increases with increases in both spacing and width of the fins, and is apparently independent of cylinder diameter and temperature difference. For a given coefficient of <b>heat</b> transfer improved <b>baffles</b> and rough or wavy surfaces give a substantial reduction in pumping power per unit of heat transfer surface and a somewhat smaller decrease in pressure drop.

40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} {{are important}} heat & mass exchange apparatus in oil refining, chemical engineering, environmental protection, electric power generation, etc. Among {{different types of}} heat exchangers, shell-&-tube heat exchangers (STHXs) have been commonly used in industries. About 35 – 40 % of heat exchangers are of the STHXs, & this is primarily due to the robust construction geometry as well as easy maintenance & possible upgrades of STHXs. Segmental baffles are most commonly used in conventional STHXs to support tubes & change fluid flow direction. But, conventional heat exchangers with segmental baffles in shell-side have some shortcomings resulting in the relatively low conversion of pressure drop into a useful heat transfer. The Helixchanger- a heat exchanger with shell side helical flow eliminates principle shortcomings caused by shell side zigzag flow induced by conventional baffle arrangements. Both hydrodynamic studies & testing of heat transfer & the pressure drop on research facilities & industrial equipment showed much better performance of helically <b>baffled</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger when compared with conventional ones. The new design reduces dead zones within the shell space. These results in relatively high (Heat transfer co-efficient/Pressure drop) & low shell side fouling. Thus, the helixchanger exhibits much more effective way of converting pressure drop into a useful heat transfer than conventional heat transfer. This project is basically gives the performance of shell & tube heat exchangers with helical baffles.

40|$|Bubble column reactors, with {{or without}} solid particles, {{have a number of}} {{applications}} in the chemical, petrochemical, biochemical and environmental industries. A number of these industrial applications require internals such as <b>baffles,</b> <b>heat</b> transfer surfaces and special distributors to meet demands. Proper selection and design of these internals can lead to the improved performance and efficiency of a bubble column reactor. Several experiments are carried out in a bubble column equipped with a concentric tube bundle (CT) and an internal combination consisting of a concentric tube bundle and concentric baffle (or static mixer) (CTB) respectively. Neutrally buoyant particles are used to determine the effect of the CT and CTB internals on the local flow structures in the equipped column respectively. More upward, near-linear particle movements are observed with the CTB internal over the CT internal. Several non-linear particle movements are also observed. Overall bulk liquid circulation flow patterns are proposed for the intermediate to high gas velocity range based on the observed local flow structures for both internals. Comparisons are made between the gas holdups obtained during internal equipment and that of a comparable hollow bubble column from the literature. Both internals increase the gas holdup of a hollow bubble column. However, the increases with the CT internal are higher by more than 25 % of that obtained with the CTB internal on average. The effect of the internals on average bubble size is investigated for the small bubble class. Smaller average diameters are obtained when the CT internal is used. The interfacial area {{in the presence of the}} two internals is determined respectively. Higher interfacial areas are obtained with the CT internal. The average difference in interfacial area is 54. 0 m 2 /m 3. The effect of the internals on mixing time is determined through dye and aqueous salt tracer studies. In both instances, higher mixing times are obtained with the CTB internal. Liquid backmixing is quantified through the axial dispersion coefficients obtained from the salt tracer studies. The axial dispersion coefficients obtained with the CT internal are higher than that of the CTB internal by about 15 % on average...|$|R
