500|$|After {{the success}} of Dallas, Jacobs' {{presented}} his initial idea again and created Knots Landing, with some alterations of his original script. In an interview, Jacobs explained: [...] " [...] Well, that's pretty good, but you know-and then <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> pages that we'd left for them {{a few years ago}} on Knots Landing, or a year before on Knots, and he said, 'Is there any way we can make this a spin-off?' [...] I just took one of the couples and made it, you know, Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix, but when you have four couples and you change one, you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around. However, once I wrote the script, remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it." [...] Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd, but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin-off, and Ted Shackelford assumed the role. Initially, it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val's daughter, but the network decided to keep her on Dallas {{in order to keep the}} two shows separate. She did, however, make a guest appearance in the first season.|$|E
2500|$|Haye was due {{to fight}} Manuel Charr at Manchester Arena on 29 June 2013. However, the fight was called off because Haye had {{suffered}} an injury. Haye later arranged a fight with Tyson Fury at the same venue on 28 September 2013. However, {{a week before the}} fight, David Haye sustained a cut to the head which required several stitches, so yet again the fight was postponed. It was originally rescheduled for 8 February 2014. However Haye dropped out of the fight on 17 November 2013 after shoulder surgery. Fury meanwhile, believed that Haye was making excuses because he didn't want the fight, with Fury himself saying [...] "I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this is exactly what I expected. Everyone knows I was very suspicious when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> first time and this confirms to me that he's always been afraid of me and never wanted this fight." [...] Aside from training camp expenses, Haye also cost Fury his positions in the world rankings including an IBF final eliminator bout which would have made him mandatory for a shot at the world title. Although doctors advised Haye to retire from boxing, he never officially announced his retirement.|$|E

The chorus leave the labyrinth as the Minotaur dies. A Ker enters to feed on his body.|$|R

6000|$|Many {{strange things}} did Ian behold in that island, {{more than he}} had thought for.
