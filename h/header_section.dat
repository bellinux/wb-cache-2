25|$|The <b>header</b> <b>section</b> {{contains}} the following fields: Identification, Flags, Number of questions, Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. The identification field {{can be used}} to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the request was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit sub-field indicates status. The question section {{contains the}} domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The answer section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{traditional}} format for email <b>header</b> <b>section</b> allows non-ASCII characters {{to be included}} in the value portion of some of the header fields using MIME-encoded words (e.g. in display names or in a Subject header field), MIME-encoding must not be used to encode other information in a header, such as an email address, or header fields like Message-ID or Received. Moreover, the MIME-encoding requires extra processing of the header to convert the data to and from its MIME-encoded word representation, and harms readability of a <b>header</b> <b>section.</b> Including Unicode characters in a <b>header</b> <b>section</b> using UTF-8 encoding eliminates these limitations and also the need to transmit additional encoding and character set information, as UTF-8 encoding will be assumed implicitly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} dBASE database {{was started}} by Wayne Ratliff in 1978 and was known as Project Vulcan. At the time the file that held the data was a simple table that could have data added, modified, deleted and printed using ASCII characters set. As the product became more popular, the underlying file type [...]dbf was expanded and additional files were added to increase {{the capabilities of the}} database system. Keep in mind that dBASE is an IDE (integrated development environment), a database system, a compiler, and a database application builder. However, underneath all that is the [...]dbf file, which is the actual data storage mechanism.

2500|$|Xu's {{choice of}} {{sections}} appears {{in large part}} to have been driven by the desire to create an unbroken, systematic sequence among the headers themselves, such that each had a natural, intuitive relationship (e.g., structural, semantic or phonetic) with the ones before and after, {{as well as by the}} desire to reflect cosmology. In the process, he included many <b>section</b> <b>headers</b> that are not considered ones today, such as 炎 (yán [...] "flame") and 熊 (xióng [...] "bear"), which modern dictionaries list under the 火 or 灬 (huǒ [...] "fire") heading. He also included as <b>section</b> <b>headers</b> all the sexagenary cycle characters, that is, the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. As a result, unlike modern dictionaries which attempt to maximize the number of characters under each <b>section</b> <b>header,</b> 34 Shuowen headers have no characters under them, while 159 have only one each. From a modern lexicographical perspective, Xu's system of 540 headings can seem [...] "enigmatic" [...] and [...] "illogical". For instance, he included the singular <b>section</b> <b>header</b> 409 惢 (ruǐ [...] "doubt"), with only one rare character (ruǐ 繠 [...] "stamen"), instead of listing it under the common header 408 心 (xīn [...] "heart; mind").|$|R

The terminology contained 99. 9 % of the clinical sections; LOINC matched 77 % of <b>section</b> <b>header</b> concepts and 20 % of <b>section</b> <b>header</b> strings in those documents.

40|$|Presentation modeling, which {{captures the}} layout of an HTML page, is a very {{important}} aspect of modeling Web Applications (WAs). However, presentation modeling is often neglected during forward engineering of Web Applications; therefore, most of these applications are poorly modeled or not modeled at all. This paper discusses the design, implementation, and evaluation of a reverse engineering tool that extracts and builds appropriate UML presentation model of existing Web Applications. The tool consists of three steps. First, we identify and extract visual blocks and presentation elements of an HTML page such as navigation bars, <b>header</b> <b>sections,</b> text input, etc. In this step, we adopt the VIPS algorithm, which divides an HTML into semantically coherent blocks. Second, the identified presentation elements in step one are mapped to the most appropriate UML presentation model elements. Third, the resulting presentation model is made available in Magicdraw for manipulation. Our approach is applied and evaluated in the Goalzz home page. </span...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new server {{system for a}} wireless LAN DMX to enhance diverse LED lighting effects. In order to enhance the capability to send DMX packets to {{the large number of}} DMX client devices, a new WDMX server system is proposed based on a NDIS miniport driver. Through the NDIS miniport driver rather than raw TCP/IP socket, the throughput of the server is increased because <b>header</b> <b>sections</b> of TCP/IP stack are removed. Even, the format of Ethernet frame is modified to use a new type of addressing scheme which can address the devices by universe ID and DMX ID value. The implemented server software program which also use thread technology and a flexible data structure can support up to 10, 500 DMX channels with the refresh rate of 40 msec. Experiment shows the results and performances about the WDMX server system. Last but not least, the WDMX server system shows possibilities which can be supported as many as we want to play in entertainment area...|$|R
