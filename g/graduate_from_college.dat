One of these was a creative writing course, which started Libby on a 20-year mission to complete a novel ...

2500|$|California has {{the largest}} {{population}} of foster care youth in the nation, with 55,218 children in the system as of 2012. This is over {{twice as many as}} the 20,529 foster children in New York, the state with the second largest population of foster youth, had by the end of 2012. Over 30 percent of California foster youth reside in Los Angeles County, amounting to 18,523 children. Children can be removed from their homes and placed into the foster care system for a variety of reasons, but, in California, 81.2 percent of children were removed because of neglect. Even after being placed in the foster care system, however, these children might not find the kind of care or stability they need. Girls in foster care have been shown to have marginally higher rates of teenage pregnancy than the general population of California. Children in foster care also have to face disproportionately high rates of mental illnesses as some studies have shown that as much as 47.9 percent of foster care youth showed signs of serious emotional or behavioral issues. After [...] "aging out" [...] of the system at age 18, research has shown that previous foster youth still face difficult instability in their lives. As much as 30 percent of previous foster children are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Only about 50 percent graduate from high school and less than 10 percent <b>graduate</b> <b>from</b> <b>college.</b> A study focused on foster care alumni in Los Angeles County showed that about 65 percent leave foster care without a place to live and 25 percent are incarcerated by age 20. Despite these difficulties, California is working toward easing the transition for foster youth through programs and legislation like the California Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2010, which expanded upon similar federal legislation and increased the age limit for receiving foster care benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor. Since [...] "barely half" [...] of students entering college as first-year students ever <b>graduate</b> <b>from</b> <b>college</b> later in their lives, getting the right fit is important for parents and students to avoid wasting money.
