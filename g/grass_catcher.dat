5000|$|Howard Phelps {{received}} patent number 2,265,545 on his mowing machine, {{which featured}} a {{rotary cutting blade}} directly driven by an industrial quality electric motor in 1941. [...] This very prototype still exists and is {{on display at the}} Pioneer Village Museum in Minden, NE. The Sensation Lawn Mower Company was started by Howard and his wife Rosemary Rodman Phelps. Phelps designed a gasoline powered mower in 1944. Later during the 1950s a generation of snow blowers were developed under the name of Snow Blow. Phelps held patents on over 20 innovations in the lawn industry including the first for a rotary mower <b>grass</b> <b>catcher</b> U.S. patent number 2,855,744 in 1960.|$|E

40|$|Over an 8 -year period 31 {{children}} in the Winnipeg area were admitted to hospital with lawnmower injuries. The accidents were always preventable and were caused by patient or parent carelessness. The wounds were severe, often resulting in amputation of a portion of an extremity. Infection was common; prophylaxis with a broad-spectrum antibiotic and human antitetanus globulin is recommended. Radiography, d√©bridement of the wound with thorough exploration under general anesthesia, and defatting and reapplication of degloved skin should be done initially, then the wound should be reinspected and redressed at 2 to 3 days, and finally closed or skin grafted at 6 to 8 days. Children must be educated {{about the dangers of}} lawnmowers and prevented from riding on tractor mowers. The <b>grass</b> <b>catcher</b> should be used and the path cleared of missiles. Hand controls should be mounted on the mower's handle and the blade should be kept sharp so that the machine's speed can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|In autumn 2002, an {{outbreak}} of probable psittacosis occurred among residents of the Blue Mountains district, Australia. We conducted a case-control study to determine independent risk factors for psittacosis by comparing exposures between hospitalized patients and other residents selected randomly from the telephone directory. Of the 59 case-patients with laboratory results supportive of psittacosis, 48 participated in a case-control study with 310 controls. Independent risk factors were residence in the upper Blue Mountains (odds ratio [OR] 15. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 5. 6 - 41. 7), age of 50 - 64 years (OR 3. 9, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 10. 5), direct contact with wild birds (OR 7. 4, 95 % CI 2. 5 - 22), and mowing lawns without a <b>grass</b> <b>catcher</b> (OR 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 8. 0). Protective equipment is recommended for residents in areas frequented by free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing...|$|E
