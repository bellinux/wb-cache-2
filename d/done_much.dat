5|$|Although Jordan has <b>done</b> <b>much</b> to {{increase}} {{the status of the}} game, some of his impact on the game's popularity in America appears to be fleeting. Television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league, and Finals ratings have not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.|$|E
5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has <b>done</b> <b>much</b> {{to perpetuate the}} image of the force as a revolutionary European army. The degree of admiration and acceptance varies, but the overall tendency to accentuate the positive lives on, or has indeed grown stronger.|$|E
5|$|Studies of discs {{around other}} stars have also <b>done</b> <b>much</b> to {{establish}} a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.|$|E

The British {{expected}} the Loyalists to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> of the fighting, but they <b>did</b> <b>much</b> less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> of their fighting.|$|R

5|$|Following Kubrick's {{death in}} 1999, Spielberg took the various drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and {{composed}} a new screenplay {{based on an}} earlier 90-page story treatment by Ian Watson written under Kubrick's supervision and according to Kubrick's specifications. In association with what remained of Kubrick's production unit, he directed the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). which was produced by Kubrick's longtime producer (and brother-in-law) Jan Harlan. Sets, costumes, and art direction {{were based on the}} works of conceptual artist Chris Baker, who had also <b>done</b> <b>much</b> of his work under Kubrick's supervision.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s Charles Spencer has <b>done</b> <b>much</b> to {{increase}} the revenue earned by the estate to keep it running. The annual Althorp Literary Festival was founded in 2003. The heir apparent is Charles' son Louis Frederick John Spencer (born 1994). Charles has expressed concerns {{about the future of}} the estate and whether Louis might be forced to sell it. In 2005 Charles endorsed a furniture collection of replicas from the house, known as the Althorp Living History Collection.|$|E
5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, bluegrass and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have <b>done</b> <b>much</b> {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} Charles Churchill & Co amid a series of board disagreements in 1934. He took control of The Churchill Machine Tool Co and, with Maginness as managing director, in December of that year embarked on a scheme to expand production and replace obsolete machinery, some of it over 20 years old, {{in an attempt to}} achieve an average output figure of £40,000 per month. However, there were difficulties in decision-making and wariness as the clouds of war loomed, most notably because of the company's contracts to supply a needy Soviet Union with machine tools, which had <b>done</b> <b>much</b> to assist it out of the depths of depression.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, aged 16, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Ponticelli {{was assigned to the}} 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had <b>done</b> <b>much</b> for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Bede was a Northumbrian, {{and this}} tinged {{his work with}} a local bias. The sources {{to which he had}} access gave him less {{information}} about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had <b>done</b> <b>much</b> to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.|$|E

5|$|Edward Alston first {{described}} Oryzomys couesi in 1877, using three specimens from Mexico and Guatemala. He named the animal Hesperomys couesi, {{placing it in}} the now-defunct genus Hesperomys, and noted similarities to the marsh rice rat (then called Hesperomys palustris) and two species now placed in Tylomys. The specific name, couesi, honors American naturalist Elliott Coues, who had <b>done</b> <b>much</b> work on North American rodents. In 1893, Oldfield Thomas wrote that the species, by then placed in the genus Oryzomys as Oryzomys couesi, had caused much confusion about its identity, because the three specimens (one from Cobán, Guatemala, and two from Mexico) used by Alston in fact belonged {{to two or three}} different species. He restricted the name couesi to the animal from Guatemala, and introduced the new name Oryzomys fulgens for one of the Mexican animals. Several other related species were described from the early 1890s onwards and in 1901 Clinton Hart Merriam united many of those into a palustris-mexicanus group of species, which also included the marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|This however {{was not to}} be the end of General Nansouty's {{action at}} the great Battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had <b>done</b> <b>much</b> to ease the {{pressure}} on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General Jacques MacDonald in an attack against the Austrian right-centre. MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare. Four squadrons of Nansouty's carabiniers-à-cheval were sent to support the flank of this attack, with the rest of his division further back. Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from Walther's Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessières, out of action, Walther opted not to move, while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away.|$|E

The debate he started at that time over liquidity traps and what policies best address them continues in the economics literature.|$|E
