A RED 670 relay was tested, {{which is part of}} the <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>set</b> protection in Żarnowiec Pumped Storage Plant. The power swing blocking feature’s performance was analysed on the basis of the results of object tests made with an Omicron digital tester. Also presented are simulation results that illustrate the PSD feature’s response to power swings caused by a disturbance in the power system. It is also shown how a distance protection may react to the same fault, depending on its settings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} hybrid {{genetic algorithms}} {{to optimize the}} structure of the main parts of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>sets</b> based on the finite element method. Firstly, the optimal model of the main parts of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>sets</b> is established including an objective function and some constraint conditions. Afterwards, the stochastic direction method (SDM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) method are applied to solve the optimal model. Comparing the computational results of the two methods, some features of the methods are pointed out. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the above two methods, a new method, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), is presented, and is used to optimize {{the structure of the}} main parts of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>sets.</b> The computational results show the new method can obtain a global solution with a high search speed compared to the other two methods...|$|R

40|$|Currently, the <b>hydroelectric</b> {{generating}} <b>sets</b> {{of small}} HPPs with Pelton turbines employ as their generating units conventional synchronous generators with electromagnetic excitation. To {{deal with the}} torque pulsatile behaviour, they generally install a supplementary flywheel on the system shaft that levels the pulsations. The Pelton turbine power output is adjusted by the needle changing water flow in the nozzle, whose advancement modifies the nozzle area and eventually – the flow. They limit the needle full stroke time to 20 – 40 sec. since quick shutting the nozzle for swift water flow reduction may result in pressure surges. For quick power adjustment so-called deflectors are employed, whose task is retraction of water jets from the Pelton turbine buckets. Thus, the mechanical method of power output regulation requires agreement between the needle stroke inside the turbine nozzles and the deflector. The paper offers employing frequency-controlled synchronous machines with permanent magnets qua generating units for the <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>sets</b> of small HPPs with Pelton turbines. The developed computer model reveals that this provides {{a higher level of}} adjustability towards rapid-changing loads in the grid. Furthermore, this will replace the power output mechanical control involving the valuable deflector drive and the turbine nozzle needles with electrical revolution rate and power output regulation by a frequency converter located in the generator stator circuit. Via frequency start, the controllable synchronous machine ensures stable operation of the <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>set</b> with negligibly small amount of water (energy carrier). Finally, in complete absence of water, the frequency-relay start facilitates shifting the generator operation to the synchronous capacitor mode, which the system operating parameter fluctograms obtained through computer modeling prove.  </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{mathematical model}} for hydroturbine governing system (HTGS) has been proposed. All essential components of HTGS, that is, conduit system, turbine, generator, and hydraulic servo system, are {{considered in the}} model. Using the proposed model, the existence and stability of Hopf bifurcation of an example HTGS are investigated. In addition, chaotic characteristics of the system with different system parameters are studied extensively and presented {{in the form of}} bifurcation diagrams, time waveforms, phase space trajectories, Lyapunov exponent, chaotic attractors, and Poincare maps. Good correlation can be found between the model predictions and theoretical analysis. The simulation results provide a reasonable explanation for the sustained oscillation phenomenon commonly seen in operation of <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>set...</b>|$|R
40|$|With the Northeast {{identified}} as India’s ‘future powerhouse’ {{and at least}} 168 large <b>hydroelectric</b> projects <b>set</b> to majorly alter the riverscape, large dams are emerging as a major issue of conflict in the region. Although the current scale of dam-related developments far outstrips anything {{which took place in}} the past, the region has been no stranger to dam-related conflicts. For example, the Kaptai dam, built in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the 1960 s, submerged the traditional homelands of the Hajong and Chakma indigenous communities, and forced them to migrate into parts of Northeast India. Over the years, this has led to serious conflicts between the refugees and local communities in Arunachal Pradesh"...|$|R

40|$|The {{variations}} of the supporting condition, which change the stiffness of tilting pad thrust bearing, may alter the dynamic behavior of the rotor system. The effects of supporting condition of thrust pad on the lateral vibration of a <b>hydroelectric</b> generating <b>set</b> are investigated in this paper. The action of a thrust bearing is described as moments acting on the thrust collar, and the tilting stiffness coefficients of thrust bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights of the thrust pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence of thrust bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences of thrust pad heights have evident influence on the load distribution of the thrust pads; while the effects on the tilting stiffness of the thrust bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|R
