5|$|On 23 September, the Court of Appeal {{issued its}} decision, {{ruling that the}} appeal was <b>inadmissible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of illegal}} {{wiretapping}} had been seized {{from the home}} of James Butler Elkins by Portland, Oregon police officers on an unrelated search warrant, and he was subsequently convicted in federal court. Elkins appealed, arguing that evidence found by the officers should have been <b>inadmissible</b> under the exclusionary rule, which forbids the introduction of most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations in criminal court.|$|E
5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was <b>inadmissible,</b> and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in <b>Inadmissible</b> Evidence, both {{claim that it}} was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial judge}} also {{concluded}} that Thomas had been properly informed {{of his right}} to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers {{to participate in the}} interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately he decided that Thomas had participated voluntarily in the interview, and that in the circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of the interview <b>inadmissible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was <b>inadmissible,</b> since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. Their case, however, was declared <b>inadmissible,</b> with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot be challenged. The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's retroactive victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, narrowed {{the gap in the}} Championship from six points to just two.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was <b>inadmissible.</b> Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the United States {{because of her}} {{criminal}} record. According to a letter from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning, she is <b>inadmissible</b> due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada. Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were <b>inadmissible</b> was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|One bank {{employee}} {{testified that}} Shakur {{was one of}} the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain. The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use photo manipulation; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos <b>inadmissible.</b> In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record. Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage. The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.|$|E
5|$|NC1 was {{the first}} to be sentenced, on 28 February 1990, after {{pleading}} guilty to having sex with someone under the age of consent. He was given six months' custody in a detention centre, the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence. Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge NC1 with rape, as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely {{due to a lack of}} evidence; Leigh's complaints about the incident as reported by witnesses were hearsay and therefore <b>inadmissible</b> in court. On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours' community service. In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual, and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody. A number of sources state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way the evidence was presented to the court.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse <b>inadmissible</b> to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning <b>inadmissible.</b> Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's discretionary powers under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an objective test would amount to judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to <b>inadmissible</b> evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inadmissible</b> oppositions and oppositions {{which are}} deemed {{not to have}} been filed are not substantively {{examined}} (no examination on the merits). An opposition can only be rejected as <b>inadmissible</b> if the opposition has been first deemed to have been filed, and, if it is deemed to have been filed, the opposition exists, even if later the opposition is rejected as <b>inadmissible.</b> If an opposition is deemed {{not to have been}} filed, an already paid opposition fee is refunded. In contrast, if an opposition is rejected as <b>inadmissible,</b> an already paid opposition fee is not refunded.|$|E
25|$|It turns out, however, {{that the}} positive-part {{estimator}} is also <b>inadmissible.</b> This follows from a general result which requires admissible estimators to be smooth.|$|E
25|$|One major {{misconception}} {{about the}} hearsay {{rule is that}} hearsay is never admissible in court. While the general rule is that such evidence is <b>inadmissible,</b> there are many exceptions.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} Dr. Leavitt's {{interpretation}} of the medical data was acceptable evidence in an agency hearing, even if {{it would have been}} <b>inadmissible</b> under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure.|$|E
25|$|Miranda v. Arizona (1966) was a {{landmark}} case involving confessions. Ernesto Miranda {{had signed a}} statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was <b>inadmissible</b> because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.|$|E
25|$|Worried that Cagle and McCoy's confessions {{might be}} ruled <b>inadmissible</b> and afraid that a jury would be {{sympathetic}} towards men who murdered a Communist, U.S. attorney J. Julius Levy accepted pleas of second degree murder from McCoy and Cagle. They received life sentences.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{fundamental}} incompatibilities, e.g. while grace {{is part of}} the very fabric of Christian theology, in Theravada Buddhism no deity can interfere with karma, and hence the notion of any type of grace is <b>inadmissible</b> within these teachings. Mahayana Buddhism however, differs on this issue.|$|E
25|$|The 10 law {{enforcement}} officers involved have since been acquitted after the judge ruled the video <b>inadmissible</b> in court as it was obtained illegally. As the footage was the main piece of evidentiary support for the crime, without it a conviction was not achieved.|$|E
25|$|Whether the {{complaint}} is {{an abuse of}} the process. If the claim is inappropriate or {{considered to be a}} waste of the Committee's time (such as frivolous claims or claims that have already been rejected by the Committee or another international mechanism) then it will be considered <b>inadmissible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Letting (x0:x1:x2:x3) be {{the point}} coordinates, four {{possible}} points on a line each have coordinates x'i= p'ij, for j= 0…3. Some of these possible points may be <b>inadmissible</b> because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one Plücker coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011 {{the crown}} dropped the charges for 13 of the 17 {{defendants}} after the Supreme Court ruled certain evidence <b>inadmissible.</b> Overturning the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions, a 3–2 verdict {{by the court}} found that the cameras installed by the police to record the defendants engaging in military-style training were unlawful.|$|E
25|$|Hearsay is {{generally}} admissible in civil proceedings. This {{is one area}} in which English law differs dramatically from American law; under the Federal Rules of Evidence, used in U.S. federal courts and followed practically verbatim in almost all states, hearsay is <b>inadmissible</b> in both criminal and civil trials barring a recognised exception.|$|E
25|$|On 18 November 1998, Hayer {{was shot}} dead while getting {{out of his car}} in the garage of his home in Surrey. Hayer had survived an earlier attempt on his life in 1988, but was paralysed and used a wheelchair. As a {{consequence}} of his murder, the affidavit was <b>inadmissible</b> as evidence.|$|E
25|$|Parliamentarians of Greek and Latvian Parliaments, Garifalia Kanelli and Sergejs Potapkins respectively, {{visited the}} Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh after the clashes. According to Potapkins, it is <b>inadmissible,</b> when the {{peaceful}} population {{suffers from the}} military aggression. The re-establishment of peace is a prior problem, the escalations of the conflict don’t promote the establishment and maintenance of peace.|$|E
25|$|Like Owen Roberts in Sorrells, he {{expressed}} concern that a predisposition test would needlessly deter defendants who might otherwise have a case based {{on the behavior of}} the government agents involved from doing so, since it would allow the prosecution to bring up prior bad acts that would be prejudicial to the jury and otherwise <b>inadmissible.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{made no attempt}} to defend the methods employed by federal agents, and, in fact, conceded that if wiretapping could be deemed a search or seizure, such wiretapping as took place in this case would be unreasonable search and seizure and thus <b>inadmissible</b> in court. However, it claimed that the protections of the amendment do not extend to telephone conversations.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the several-week-long investigation, Williams taunted police {{officers}} staking out his parents' home with insults and jokes. During {{a press conference}} that Williams held outside his home to proclaim his innocence, he volunteered that he had failed the polygraph tests — a fact {{that would have been}} <b>inadmissible</b> in court. He was arrested on June 21, 1981, for the murders of Cater and 29-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne.|$|E
25|$|Names and {{surnames}} in Latvian-issued {{documents are}} formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases Kuhareca v. Latvia and Mencena v. Latvia (both declared <b>inadmissible</b> in 2004), since the Latvian Constitutional Court had found them constitutional in 2001. An analogous application was submitted to UN HRC in 2007 and {{won by the}} applicant on grounds of privacy (Raihman v. Latvia).|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} all charges had been filed against each defendant, Vernon Butts {{committed}} suicide, rendering his recorded testimony {{in these three}} cases <b>inadmissible</b> as evidence. The charges against Bonin in relation to Shelton, Wirostek and the John Doe were therefore dropped in accordance with Penal Code section 995 in early 1981. Nonetheless, sufficient physical evidence was still present {{in the case of}} Darin Kendrick—a murder for which Bonin was subsequently convicted.|$|E
25|$|A common remedy to the Bill of Rights Act 1990 is {{that the}} {{evidence}} obtained through breaching a right is <b>inadmissible</b> in court. This initially developed in the courts as a presumption of exclusion but was subsequently lessened to a balancing exercise where various factors are weighed up to determine the admissibility of evidence tainted by a breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1990. This remedy is now reflected in section 30 of the Evidence Act 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the events - if the event or events {{occurred}} before the State concerned became {{a party to the}} First Optional Protocol then the complaint is <b>inadmissible</b> ratione temporis. The Committee has a list of exceptions to this general rule in regards to the ICCPR if the effects of the event continue when the State does accede to the First Optional Protocol. These include when the person is still serving a prison sentence following an unfair trial, for example.|$|E
