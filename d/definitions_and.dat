40|$|Abstract — The European ECSS {{series of}} {{standards}} for the aerospace industry includes data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database requirements as one of sixteen types of non functional requirement (NFR) for embedded and real time software. A number of data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database related concepts are dispersed throughout the ECSS standards to describe at varying levels of details {{the various types of}} candidate data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database requirements at the system, software, and hardware levels. This paper organizes these dispersed data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database concepts into a generic standards-based reference model of system data <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> database requirements...|$|R

5|$|Depending on {{religious}} <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> varying population data, the United States currently has {{the second largest}} Jewish community in the world (after Israel).

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E

5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E
5|$|Section 105 {{authorized}} the secretary to prohibit the melting, export, or treating of any coin, {{if necessary to}} protect the nation's coinage, and prescribed a penalty of {{up to five years}} in prison for violation of such an order—section 106 declared that coins seized under section 105 would be forfeited to the United States, with the secretary given powers paralleling those under the Internal Revenue Code to enforce such forfeitures. Section 107 allowed the secretary to issue regulations to put into force the Coinage Act of 1965, while section 108 contained <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> similar technical matters.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them.

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} <b>Definitions</b> <b>and</b> Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted literary canon). They define literary scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the literary arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that literary scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E
