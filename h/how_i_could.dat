500|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Los Angeles, Cartwright won {{the lead}} role in the {{television}} movie Marian Rose White. Janet Maslin, a critic for The New York Times, described Cartwright as [...] "a chubby, lumbering, slightly cross-eyed actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film's impact". Cartwright replied by sending Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed, and included a photograph. Later, Cartwright auditioned {{for the role of}} Ethel, a girl who becomes trapped in a cartoon world in the third segment of [...] She met with director Joe Dante and later described him as [...] "a total cartoon buff, and once he took a look at my resume and noticed Daws Butler's name on it, we were off and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation. After about twenty minutes, he said, 'considering your background, I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cast anyone but you in this part! It was her first role in a feature film. The segment was based on The Twilight Zone television series episode [...] "It's a Good Life", which was later parodied in The Simpsons episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] (1992).|$|E

2500|$|The lead {{scientist}} for Project Monarch. Watanabe was initially skeptical {{about a new}} Hollywood Godzilla film but changed his mind after a meeting with Edwards, stating, [...] "If you are telling the Godzilla story, you cannot separate it from the nuclear element, {{and the first thing}} I asked was whether {{there was going to be}} the nuclear element, as that now, in Japan, is a really sensitive problem. I was worried about <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use that and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make that okay, but Gareth understood those feelings." [...] Watanabe's character is named after the director of various Godzilla films, Ishiro Honda, and after the scientist who killed Godzilla in the 1954 original film, Dr. Daisuke Serizawa.|$|E

2500|$|Rugby writers Peter Meares and Maxwell Howell gave {{an account}} of Australia's first 1991 World Cup pool match in Wallaby Legends, [...] "The Pumas made a game of {{it for the first}} twenty minutes, rarely {{allowing}} the Wallabies any possession. Whatever scraps came Australia's way were booted downfield by Michael Lynagh... Campese hadn't touched the ball. The body language said it all. He stood, hands on hips, legs crossed, leaning against a goalpost." [...] Campese later recalled that [...] "...I took a breather at one stage by leaning against a goalpost. I remember being asked <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do such a thing during an important game. It was no big deal. Argentina had already had a few scrums on our line, and they were intent on getting a pushover try." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sobers went on {{his first}} {{overseas}} tour {{in the early months}} of 1956 when, aged 19, {{he was part of the}} West Indian tour of New Zealand. The series was not successful personally for Sobers, who struggled on the foreign batting wickets. West Indies pitches had little or no grass to speak of, while in New Zealand the pitches were green. [...] "I took one look and asked myself <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> possibly bat on that? How could I make runs? I was out before I even walked to the crease," [...] Sobers later wrote. Playing in all four Tests, he totalled 81 runs and two wickets. As a batsman, Sobers needed time to develop at Test level and, in nine Tests as a teenager, he scored only one half century, and averaged 29.33 with the bat.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1947, {{she went}} to live at the Abbey Art Centre, an artists' {{community}} located in New Barnet, Hertfordshire, near London. King was a fairly early resident there. Quite a number of Australian artists lived at the Abbey at various times. These included Robert Klippel, James Gleeson,Phillip Martin, , Noel Counihan and Bernard Smith, who became an art historian. Grahame King, whom King later married, arrived later in 1947. King's early works at the Abbey were figurative, but not realistic. But {{it was during this}} period that King [...] "made an arbitrary decision to move away from representational work". [...] "I could not see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do any more with the figure, so I decided to move into what I call non-representational work. I don't like to call it abstraction as my work was not abstract in concept. I was groping for my own way." [...] She had two exhibitions in London, then spent six months in Paris, which she enjoyed. In September 1949, {{she went to}} New York.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, the Soviets loaded Puyi and {{the rest}} of Manchukuo and Japanese prisoners onto a train that took them to China with Puyi {{convinced}} he would be executed when he arrived. At the border, there were two lines of soldiers, one Soviet and the other Chinese, and as Puyi walked past, he remembered how the faces of the other prisoners were [...] "deathly pale". Puyi was surprised at the kindness of his Chinese guards, who told him this {{was the beginning of a}} new life for him. In attempt to ingratiate himself, Puyi for the first time in his life used ni (你), the informal word for you instead of nin (您), the formal word for you to address people. When the train stopped at Changchun to pick up food, Puyi was convinced that was he was going to be shot at his former capital, and he was much relieved when the train resumed its journey to Fushun. Except for a period during the Korean War, when he was moved to Harbin, Puyi spent ten years in the Fushun War Criminals Management Centre in Liaoning province until he was declared reformed. The prisoners at Fushun were senior Japanese, Manchukuo and Kuomintang officials and officers. Puyi was the weakest and most hapless of the prisoners, and was often bullied by the other prisoners, who liked to humiliate an emperor, and he might not have survived his imprisonment except for the fact that the warden Jin Yuan went out of his way to protect him. Jin had grown up under Manchukuo and as a schoolboy in the 1930s had kowtowed to portraits of Puyi and waved the Manchukuo flag in the streets when Puyi made visits to Harbin. As Jin had grown up in Manchukuo, he was fluent in Japanese, which was why he was selected to be the warden of Fushun. Jin was assigned the job in 1950 and told Behr in a 1986 interview that: [...] "I didn't welcome the idea at all. I tried to get another posting. I wanted nothing to do with those who had been responsible for my older brother's death and my family's suffering during the Manchukuo years. I wondered <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever bear to be in their company". However, Jin further told Behr that he [...] "came to like Puyi quite a bit" [...] as he got to know him, and protected him from the other prisoners. In 1951, Puyi learned for the first time that Wanrong had died in 1946.|$|E
