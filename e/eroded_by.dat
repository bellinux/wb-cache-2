5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl {{in the side of the}} mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> plucking. The basin became deeper (especially at the base of the headwall) as it continued to be <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> abrasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} a steel frame clad in Gozitan limestone. The stone slabs are carved {{in such a way}} that they seem to have been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> nature.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of {{the last}} Ice Age, the glaciers left behind a uniform plain with valleys <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E

50|$|As the Model T aged in {{comparison}} to its competition, the market share held by Ford began to <b>erode</b> <b>by</b> the mid-1920s. At the end of 1927, the Model A was introduced as its replacement.|$|R
5|$|This {{area of the}} Andes {{was subject}} to {{glaciation}} in the past, which has left traces especially in adjacent valleys. These valleys are U-shaped or have {{the form of a}} trench, shapes associated with glacial action. The older volcanics of Laguna del Maule have been disproportionately <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> glacial action. Slopes around Laguna del Maule are covered by colluvium including talus slopes.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E
5|$|Rùm {{is mainly}} igneous in origin, and its {{mountains}} have been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> Pleistocene glaciation. It {{is now an}} important study site for research in ecology, especially of red deer, and {{is the site of}} a successful reintroduction programme for the white-tailed sea eagle. Its economy is entirely dependent on Scottish Natural Heritage, a public body that now manages the island, and there have been calls for a greater diversity of housing provision. A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry links the island with the mainland town of Mallaig.|$|E
50|$|The Pinanshan {{conglomerate}} {{is found}} on Pinanshan Hill {{and along the}} Pinantachi stream north of Taitung (台東). The constituents are 5-15 cm cobbles <b>erodes</b> <b>by</b> freshwater from the Central Range. It formed somewhere from middle to late Pleistocene, and indicates the plate collision had taken place.|$|R
5000|$|Volcanic ash, as a hard substance, damages {{gas turbine}} compressors. It <b>erodes</b> <b>by</b> {{impacting}} compressor blades and vanes and removing material—and abrades by three body {{interactions between the}} rotating blade, ash particle, and compressor annulus. Changing {{the shapes of the}} blades and vanes and increasing gaps between blades and annuli both help reduce engine fuel efficiency and operability.|$|R

5|$|The castle {{is built}} to an Edwardian {{concentric}} design, with a {{keep in the}} south-eastern corner, protected by an inner and outer bailey with stone curtain walls extending out to the north-west. The castle is built using stones from the local beach bonded with a liquid mortar, with the finer stonework, such as the doorways and windows, made from red ashlar sandstone imported from the mainland. Much of the surrounding island has been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the sea {{and some of the}} castle has been lost, with fallen stone fragments still visible on the beach below.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commerce}} did {{not require}} them, pennies bearing the likeness of Elizabeth II were minted in 1953 in sets sold to the public, using an obverse design by Mary Gillick. One 1954 penny was struck, for internal Mint purposes. By 1961, new pennies were needed again for circulation, and were produced in large numbers. The officials who planned decimalisation in the 1960s did not favour keeping the large bronze penny, whose value had been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> inflation. The last for circulation were dated 1967—a final proof set was dated 1970. The old penny quickly went out of use after Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, and was demonetised on 31 August of that year.|$|E
5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just {{a small fraction of}} the star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{cataract}} {{had to be}} portaged, {{the area}} {{became one of the}} natural resting and trade points along the Mississippi between Dakota and Anishinaabe peoples. The Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) term was recorded as [...] "kakabikah" [...] (gakaabikaa, [...] "split rock" [...] or more descriptively, gichi-gakaabikaa, [...] "the great severed rock" [...] which referenced the jagged chunks of limestone constantly <b>eroding</b> <b>by</b> the falls).|$|R

5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that {{going to war with}} Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E
5|$|Four {{overlapping}} ecological regions {{have been}} identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that erosion in a tunnel valley is primarily {{the result of}} water flow. They <b>erode</b> <b>by</b> meltwater, which it has been argued, episodically drains in repeated jökulhlaups from subglacially stored lakes and reservoirs; examples of such motion have been observed in Antarctica. Although {{there is evidence of}} ice erosion such as linear striations in the bedrock, these are observed only in the widest valleys, and are believed to have played a secondary role.|$|R

5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

50|$|Mellon {{retired from}} the Army in July 1986 and joined {{one of the largest}} Architectural, Engineering and Constructions firms in the nation, CRSS (Caudill Rowlett Scott Sirrine). As he managed one of several design offices for CRSS, he saw the process that his team {{developed}} in Huntsville, to manage the production of price books for Job Order Contracting, begin to <b>erode.</b> <b>By</b> 1990, the Army lost the ability to generate a Job Order Contracting unit price book. Installations began to look to private companies for alternative solutions to their need for a unit price book.|$|R

5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on a small hill, which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor joists and stair treads. There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} occasional {{outbreaks of}} acute diseases (such as plague in 1994). The gains {{on the national}} health were <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> structural adjustment in the 1990s, {{the impact of the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since the year 2000. In 2006, Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies in the world according to UN figure – 44 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990, but this has since recovered to 53 and 54 respectively. The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Infant mortality rose from 6% in the late 1990s to 12.3% by 2004. By 2014 HIV/AIDS prevalence had been reduced to 15% compared to 40% in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been <b>eroded</b> <b>by</b> cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
