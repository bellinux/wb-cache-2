The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
