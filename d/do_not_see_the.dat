25|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> case as {{setting a}} precedent because the unique {{circumstances surrounding the}} Trail smelter have been articulated and discussed multiple times, therefore the arguments that arise for transboundary international law are divorced from the context they are derived from; this distorts the decisions made in cases like the Trail Arbitration. For the arbitration, the decisions {{that appear to be}} the focus of literature on transboundary international law precedents are sub-articles 2 and 4 from Article 3 of the International Joint Commission's (IJC) recommendations.|$|E
25|$|While {{ecotourism}} agencies {{claim to}} help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha {{feel that they are}} being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive commercialization and commodification of their culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to lie is noted early and nearly universally in human development. Social psychology and developmental psychology {{are concerned with}} the theory of mind, which people employ to simulate another's reaction to their story and determine if a lie will be believable. The most commonly cited milestone, what is known as Machiavellian intelligence, is at the age of about four and a half years, when children begin to be able to lie convincingly. Before this, they seem simply unable to comprehend why others <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> same view of events that they do– and seem to assume {{that there is only one}} point of view, which is their own.|$|E

Kitsis commented, [...] "We couldn’t think of anyone better to trap two {{children}} in a house and try to eat them." [...] Caulfield had previously worked with series writer Jane Espenson and producer Liz Tigelaar on Buffy and Life Unexpected. Morrison remarked that while viewers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Blind Witch in Maine, [...] "Everyone who is in fairytale land definitely has a Storybrooke counterpart.

500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, is a tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E
500|$|The {{novels and}} other fictional works {{set in the}} Hainish {{universe}} recount the efforts to re-establish a galactic civilization. Explorers from Hain {{as well as other}} planets use interstellar ships taking years to travel between planetary systems, although the journey is shortened for the travelers due to relativistic time dilation, as well as through instantaneous interstellar communication using the ansible, introduced in The Dispossessed. At least two [...] "thought experiments" [...] are used in each novel; the background idea of a common origin for all the humanoid species, and a second idea unique to each novel. In The Word for World is Forest, the second thought experiment is the colonization of a pacifist culture on the planet Athshe by a military-controlled logging team from Earth, known in the novel as [...] "Terra"; additionally, the inhabitants of Athshe recognize the people from Terra as human, but the Terrans <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Athsheans, who are small and covered in green fur, as human. The Athsheans refer to the Terrans as [...] "yumens", while the Terrans tend to use the derogatory term [...] "creechie".|$|E

500|$|Lee {{insisted that}} he was not opposed to Malay special rights or Article 153, saying: [...] "if the {{immigrant}} communities ... <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> problems, if they can't feel {{what it is like to}} be a poor Malay, and don't feel for him, then I can say very soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil." [...] Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges. Senu Abdul Rahman, a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: [...] "What we want is opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." [...] Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: [...] "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" [...] Lee answered: [...] "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here as of right. And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future." [...] Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as [...] "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the bangsa asing (aliens) or orang tumpangan (lodgers) such as Lee. This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun insisting [...] "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E
2500|$|Protestants, {{including}} Quiverfull adherents, also disagree {{over whether}} the Biblical statement [...] "be fruitful and multiply" [...] in Genesis 1:28 and 9:7 is a command or simply a blessing God spoke over its recipients.

[...] Rear Admiral Graves repeated the signal, but in a place invisible to most other ships while keeping Nelson's 'close action' signal at his masthead. Of Nelson's captains, only Riou, who could not see Nelson's flagship , followed Parker's signal. Riou withdrew his force, which was then attacking the Tre Kroner fortress, exposing himself to heavy fire that killed him.|$|E
