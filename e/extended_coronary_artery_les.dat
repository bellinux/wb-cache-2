The long term predictive value of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> calcifications detected by multi‐layer spiral computed tomography for major cardiovascular events was evaluated in non‐diabetic Caucasian patients on maintenance hemodialysis free of clinical cardiovascular disease. Two‐hundred and five patients on maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled into this observational, prospective cohort study. Patients underwent a single cardiac multi‐layer spiral computed tomography. Calcium load was quantified and patients grouped {{according to the}} Agatston score: group 1 (Agatston score: 0), group 2 (Agatston score 1 ‐ 400), group 3 (Agatston score 401 ‐ 1000) and group 4 (Agatston score > 1000). Follow‐up was longer than seven years. Primary endpoint was death from a major cardiovascular event. Actuarial survival was calculated separately in the four groups with Kaplan‐Meier method. Patients who died from causes other than cardiovascular disease and transplanted patients were censored. The “log rank” test was employed to compare survival curves. One‐hundred two patients (49. 7 %) died for a major cardiovascular event during the follow‐up period.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundExtended right <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> are not {{uncommon}} in coronary surgery. They can be revascularized optionally either by conventional single or complete multiple bypassing. However, there are still no objective data showing the superiority or appropriateness {{of one of these}} methods over the other. MethodsExtended right <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> were identified by preoperative angiographic scoring and randomized to multiple-bypassing (group A; n = 32) or single-bypassing (group B; n = 32) groups. Four parameters that show the completeness of right coronary territory revascularization were evaluated and compared between the 2 groups. ResultsAlthough overall perioperative ischemic events seemed to increase in the single-bypass group (P =. 0059), half of them were reversible, and there were no statistical differences between the definitive perioperative ischemic event rates, namely, infarction rates, and the remaining 3 parameters of the groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 50 %) was the most significant predictor of these perioperative ischemic events. Hence, the subgroups of patients with left ventricular dysfunction were also evaluated (subgroup A, n = 13; subgroup B, n = 12). Overall perioperative ischemic event (P =. 001), definitive perioperative ischemic event (infarction; P =. 0324), and consequent right ventricular dysfunction (P =. 0324) rates were significantly higher in the single-bypass subgroup. Postoperative reperfusion status and graft patency rates of the right coronary territory did not change with the different revascularization methods. ConclusionsComplete revascularization of <b>extended</b> right <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> did not seem advantageous over its conventional operation in patients with normal ventricular function; however, in patients with poor ventricular function (ejection fraction < 50 %), it prevented perioperative ischemic events in the right coronary territory and the consequent functional impairment that appeared with conventional operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} blood {{dynamics}} requires {{the inclusion of}} several levels of description, ranging from the nanoscopic level in proximity of the endothelium to fully resolved flow patterns in large scale circulatory system. All these levels play simultaneous and crucial roles {{in the context of}} plaque formation and atherosclerosis. In fact, the non-Newtonian nature of blood, the corpuscular nature of blood and the effects of micro-rheology close to the vessel walls play significant roles in the uptake of lipidic material by the endothelium. In our work we focus on the multi-scale modeling of blood mechanics and endothelial structure in order to gain substantial understanding on the plaque formation process. In order to attain this goal, we have devised a computational strategy to simultaneously include three physical components, the glylcocalyx, the red blood cells and the blood plasma. Our modeling of the glycocalyx reproduces the ordered layer of fibers that covers the endothelium. In this way, the porous medium and its intrinsic flexibility are reproduced at high accuracy. Red blood cells are modelled as suspended bodies that have the capacity to sustain solid-like tumbling as much as tank-treading motion. This dual behavior allows for the subtle interplay of hydrodynamic forces that induce lateral migration, with the ensuing Fahraeus-Lindqvist and skimming effects. Finally, our handling of the plasma is done via the Lattice Boltzmann method, a numerical approach that presents numerical advantages in including suspended bodies and overall stability of the multi-scale methodology. Our computational framework has the merit of being particularly light-weight, allowing to simulate large scale arterial systems (~ 1 billion voxels) by using commodity hardware. In this respect, we make large use of parallel graphical processing units (GPU) to study coronary systems with computational resources performing at 10 - 100 TFlops. We have next undertaken a systematic study of <b>extended</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> with clinical data collected with 320 -rows CT angiography for the detailed reconstruction of multi-branched coronary systems. It is well-known that plaque formation is highly correlated to regions of low endothelial shear stress, often localized in correspondence of bifurcations and in presence of strong centrifugal effects. We have applied both single-scale and multi-scale simulations to identify the hot spots of the circulatory system. Our simulations show the role of the corpuscular nature of red blood cells in altering the shear pattern and reveal the rich phenomenology induced by the multi-level description of blood...|$|R

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesizsed that insulin dependence/exogenous insulin administration may affect thrombotic/inflammatory status and endothelial function in patients with T 2 DM and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (CAD). METHODS: Fifty-five patients with T 2 DM + CAD (26 insulin-treated (INS) and 29 under oral biguanide + sulphonylurea (TABL)) were recruited. Endothelial function was assessed by gauge-strain plethysmography, and serum levels of inflammatory and thrombotic markers were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) between the study groups, while EDD was correlated with fasting glucose levels in both INS (r = - 0. 776, p = 0. 0001) and TABL (r = - 0. 702, p = 0. 0001). Patients in INS group had higher levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP- 1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM- 1), compared to TABL. However, TNF-alpha was negatively correlated with protein C (PrtC) only in INS (r = - 0. 726, p = 0. 01) but not in TABL group (r = - 0. 066, p = 0. 738). Similarly, sVCAM- 1 was correlated with PrtC only among INS patients (r = - 0. 451, p = 0. 046) but not in TABL (r = 0. 069, p = 0. 727). In multivariate analysis, insulin dependence was a predictor of IL- 6, TNF-alpha, MCP- 1 and sVCAM- 1 levels independently from the patients' demographic characteristics, the angiographic extend of CAD or the duration of diabetes.

40|$|Rates of end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) among {{indigenous}} people in Australia and New Zealand are considerably higher than the non-indigenous population. This trend, apparent for several years, is described here {{using data from the}} Australia & New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. The average age at start of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is approximately 10 years less than non-indigenous people. Among those starting RRT, rates of "diabetic nephropathy" are higher among indigenous patients, reflecting higher rates of diabetes. The increased burden of illness <b>extends</b> to <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and chronic lung disease, which are present at rates 1. 5 to 2 times non-indigenous rates. Once dialysis treatment has commenced, indigenous people {{are less likely to be}} placed on the active cadaveric transplant waiting list, and less likely to receive a graft. Overall mortality outcomes are poorer for indigenous patients overall, and for each RRT modality. These outcomes are not simply due to increased frequency of co-morbid illness: for indigenous people receiving dialysis treatment the mortality rate adjusted for age and gender is around 11 / 2 times the non-indigenous rate. These data are consistent with studies showing increased rates of markers of early renal disease (in particular albuminuria) among both Australian and New Zealand indigenous groups, and reflect a broader health profile marked by high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease.

40|$|BackgroundPatients on {{dialysis}} sustain {{at least}} a threefold higher in-hospital mortality rate and markedly higher long-term mortality following <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass graft surgery than the general population. Smaller {{studies have suggested that}} dialysis patients have superior outcomes with off-pump compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery. MethodsFrom the United States Renal Data System database, 13, 085 patients on dialysis having first <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery between 2001 and 2006 were identified. Of these, 2335 (17. 8 %) had off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival of patients having off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass and patients having on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess effects of off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass on mortality with adjustment for baseline patient characteristics. ResultsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery (hazard ratio 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 0. 99, P = . 02). The observed survival benefit was most notable in the first year after surgery (70. 3 % vs 68. 7 %) and was lost 2 years after surgery (55. 4 % vs 55. 2 %). No difference was noted in the in-hospital mortality rate with off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery versus on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery (9. 7 % vs 11. 0 %, P =. 06). Cardiac mortality during the follow-up period was similar (23. 6 % vs 23. 8 %; adjusted hazard ratio 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 1. 04, P =. 26). Use of internal thoracic grafts was independently associated with improved survival after <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery (hazard ratio, 0. 92; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 87 – 0. 98, P =. 0057). ConclusionsPatients on dialysis sustain high in-hospital and 2 -year mortality rates after <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery. Off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass is associated with modestly increased survival compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass, a benefit most marked early after off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass...|$|R
