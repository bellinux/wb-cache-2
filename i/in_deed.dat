5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or <b>in</b> <b>deed.</b> Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the labor}} movement, {{there is some}} {{resistance}} to organizing, though more <b>in</b> <b>deed</b> than in word. Organizing {{can be seen as}} a drain on scarce resources with insignificant returns and with results tenuous. Most unions in the U.S. adopt a service model and eschew organizing. In transient industries such as construction, an increase in the supply of labor from newly organized shops may cause the supply of jobs to dwindle below what an increased membership can absorb.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, the Carnegie Corporation named President Love one of {{the best}} college Presidents in the country. President Love changed the {{structure}} of the college, developing its divisions into professional schools, which would allow them to be accredited. The schools were developed into colleges, which increased the possibility of SDSC of becoming a university.

500|$|David Robinson, {{writing in}} The Times {{observed}} that Licence to Kill [...] "will probably neither disappoint nor surprise the great, faithful audience", but bemoaned {{the fact that}} [...] "over the years the plots have become less ambitious". Robinson thought that Dalton's Bond [...] "has more class" [...] than the previous Bonds and was [...] "a warmer personality". Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times pointed out that [...] "any vestiges of the gentleman spy... by Ian Fleming" [...] have now gone, and in its place is a Bond that is [...] "remarkably close both <b>in</b> <b>deed</b> and action to the eponymous hero of the Batman film" [...] that was released {{at the same time}} as Licence to Kill.|$|E
500|$|Dalton's Bond was {{a serious}} one: dark, cold, emotional, stern, ruthless, showing little humour, and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence. Dalton's {{interpretation}} of the character came from his [...] "desire to see a darker Bond", one that was [...] "less of a womaniser, tougher {{and closer to the}} darker character Ian Fleming wrote about". James Chapman also considered Dalton to be closer to Fleming's Bond than the previous actors, writing that Dalton was [...] "clearly less comfortable... with the witty asides and one-liners... so he becomes something closer to the Bond of the books, who rarely develops a sense of humour". When reviewing Licence to Kill, Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times disagreed, declaring that [...] "any vestiges of the gentleman spy... by Ian Fleming" [...] have now gone; {{he went on to say}} that [...] "this character is remarkably close both <b>in</b> <b>deed</b> and action to the eponymous hero of the new Batman film".|$|E

2500|$|Bede {{describes}} Chad at {{this point}} as [...] "a diligent performer <b>in</b> <b>deed</b> {{of what he had}} learnt in the Scriptures should be done." [...] Bede also tells us that Chad was teaching the values of Aidan and Cedd. His life was one of constant travel. Bede says that Chad visited continually the towns, countryside, cottages, villages and houses to preach the Gospel. Clearly, the model he followed was one of the bishop as prophet or missionary. Basic Christian rites of passage, baptism and confirmation, were almost always performed by a bishop, and for decades to come they were generally carried out in mass ceremonies, probably with little systematic instruction or counselling.|$|E

2500|$|... "Will I?", a song {{which takes}} place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was {{inspired}} by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends <b>in</b> <b>Deed,</b> an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene and}} song [...] "Life Support" [...] were {{also based on}} Friends <b>in</b> <b>Deed,</b> {{as well as on}} Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the [...] "forget regret" [...] refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV {{positive}} friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this [...] "credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?" [...] Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, [...] "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" [...] Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, [...] "Then why choose fear?" [...] Gordon says, [...] "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|McVeigh {{later said}} he {{considered}} [...] "a campaign of individual assassination," [...] with [...] "eligible" [...] targets including Attorney-General Janet Reno, Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Federal District Court, {{who handled the}} Branch Davidian trial, and Lon Horiuchi, {{a member of the}} FBI hostage-rescue team who shot and killed Vicki Weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992. He said he wanted Reno to accept [...] "full responsibility <b>in</b> <b>deed,</b> not just words." [...] Such an assassination seemed too difficult, and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers, it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers. According to McVeigh's authorized biography, he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building. After the bombing, he was ambivalent about his act; as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper, he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead.|$|E
2500|$|Said {{distinguishes between}} the Islamic Jihad in {{the phase of}} {{building}} the(state), and Jihad after that.

2500|$|It {{will be your}} {{glory to}} restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence, the {{writings}} of excellent authors, which have hitherto escaped the researches of the learned... Oh! what a valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight?... But Quintilian is so consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when, after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid him welcome... Quintilian, an author whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting only Cicero's dissertation De Republica. The Italian poet Petrarch addressed one of his letters to the dead to Quintilian, and for many he “provided the inspiration for a new humanistic philosophy of education” [...] This enthusiasm for Quintilian spread with humanism itself, reaching northern Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. Martin Luther, the German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer, [...] "claimed that he preferred Quintilian to almost all authors, 'in that he educates {{and at the same}} time demonstrates eloquence, that is, he teaches in word and <b>in</b> <b>deed</b> most happily'" [...] The influence of Quintilian's works is also seen in Luther's contemporary Erasmus of Rotterdam. He above all shaped the implicit depth of humanism and had studied at Steyn.|$|E
