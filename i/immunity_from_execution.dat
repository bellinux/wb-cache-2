40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> {{of state}} property in execution proceedings of arbitral awards. In this study, I aim {{to consider the}} extent of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> in these execution proceedings. This includes considerations of current rules in public international law on <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> {{and the application of}} these rules on national execution proceedings of arbitral awards. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> protects state property from execution measures. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> is based on equality of states and the upholding of friendly relations between states. States have in the 20 th century started to participate in commercial transactions and dealings with individuals. This has led to the revision of the traditionally absolute notion of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution.</b> <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> has been limited in certain instances. The view on the extent of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> is not always coherent in the international community. There is no universal international convention in force that regulates the matter. National courts interpret the rules on <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution,</b> which means that there can be quite incoherent and unexpected decisions in this area of public international law. The certainty of execution is of crucial importance in relation to arbitral proceedings. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> is a factor that compromises this certainty. As arbitration is time-consuming and costly, uncertainty relating to the execution of arbitral awards can mean that individuals refrain from arbitrating against states. This, again, can impact trade and investment involving states. The Sedelmayer saga is an excellent illustration of the implications that <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> can have on execution of mixed arbitral awards. Sedelmayer is an investor whose investment was expropriated by the Russian Federation. An arbitral award was subsequently rendered against Russia. Sedelmayer has sought execution against Russian property in both Germany and Sweden over the last 13 years, without fully succeeding to satisfy the award. He also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the ground of the German proceedings. In this thesis, I will critically consider the implications that <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> can have on execution of arbitral awards. Regard will be taken to sources of public international law, especially treaties and customary international law. I will also examine domestic legislation and case law in order to accurately consider national perceptions and tendencies of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution.</b> I will especially use the Sedelmayer saga as an illustrating and exemplifying series of case law...|$|E

40|$|Embassy bank {{accounts}} {{are among the}} properties of statesmost widely presentin foreign states. Accordingly, they constitute an ideal target for attachment by creditors. International instruments have largely upheld state <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> regarding {{bank accounts}}, however. Likewise, state practice largely – and apparently increasingly – supports state immunity from measures of attachment, by applying a presumption that funds in embassy bank accounts are used for governmental non-commercial purposes. This approach is overly deferential to the state. Instead, {{it is argued that}} domestic courts should require that the state, at least partially, discharge the burden of proof regarding the nature (commercial/sovereign) of the funds in the bank account. A failure to discharge this burden should result in a rejection of immunity. Only such an approach adequately balances the interests of states and creditors, and does sufficient justice to the creditor’s right of access to a court. In addition, it is argued that such a balance is also brought about by construing literally general waivers of immunity from attachment, as not requiring an additional specific waiver regarding embassy bank accounts...|$|E
40|$|Evidence and Burden of Proof in Foreign Sovereign Immunity Litigation: A Procedural Guide for International Lawyers and Government Counsel’ (3 rd Revised Edition, 2017) is {{the first}} {{specialized}} and practically useful analysis of the evidence problems and {{the burden of proof}} in matters of foreign sovereign immunity litigation, both regarding jurisdictional immunities and <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution.</b> The monograph is a comparative law analysis that spans six of the seven existing national statutes on foreign sovereign immunity, starting with the United States’ Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 1976, to the Canadian State Immunity Act, 1982. The study concludes in demonstrating two distinct rules of the burden of proof, for each kind of immunity; the rules are widely uniform, and were corroborated by case law and scholarly opinion in all of the examined jurisdictions. They can be said to form today rules of international law. The monograph is of high practical value for litigation lawyers and government counsel struggling with evidence problems regarding foreign sovereign immunity. It can be taken as a reference guide for solving the evidence problems in those trials, and as such is a precious asset in any international law library. The only titles that in scope, depth and size can be compared with the present study are already quite out of date, and they have, if ever, only randomly dealt with the specific procedural problems of evidence and the burden of proof in international sovereign immunity litigation...|$|E

40|$|Published: 22 January 2016 In {{spite of}} commendable efforts towards {{addressing}} the issue of reparation for victims of Nazi crimes during the Second World War, Judgment No. 238, which was handed down by the Italian Constitutional Court, reveals inherent limitations within its approach. The reasoning set out by this judgment is based entirely on the constitutional right of access to justice prevailing over the rule of jurisdictional immunity of the state, as interpreted by the International Court of Justice in the 2012 decision in Germany v. Italy. The historical failure to provide reparation to a whole class of victims of Nazi crimes as they were deemed to fall outside all reparation schemes agreed at the international level, demonstrates that domestic judicial remedies cannot fill this historical and legal ‘black hole’. In the end, the residual <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> will most likely prevent the attachment of a foreign state’s funds necessary for adequate compensation of the victims or their successors. This article argues, on the one hand, that {{the road to a}} solution of this historical injustice lies in a negotiated settlement between Italy and Germany. On the other hand, the Italian government and parliament should fulfil their part in providing interim compensation to the victims pending such an international settlement. The Italian Republic owes a heavy debt to such victims for their contribution to the moral and political emancipation of the country from its alliance with Nazi Germany and building a new state founded on the 1947 Constitution...|$|E
40|$|Waiver of State Immunity from Measures of Constraint and Access to Justice in Some Recent Judgments of the French Cour de Cassation. The French Supreme Court {{in three}} recent {{judgments}} of 28 March 2013 has interpreted restrictively {{the rules of}} general international law concerning waiver of State immunity from measures of constraint. Assuming that those rules were to be considered as mirrored by {{the provisions of the}} United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property adopted on 2 December 2004, which is not yet in force, and providing a particularly narrow reading of the relevant rules which is not supported by a consistent State practice, the Cour de cassation considered a general waiver of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution,</b> as contained in contracts for the issue of Argentine bonds subscribed by private investors, as inapplicable in respect of property of a foreign State to be used for governmental purposes, absent a specific mention of such property within the waiver clause. In extending to any category of State property to be used for governmental purposes a rule which is generally observed only in respect of specific categories of property, such as property pertaining to diplomatic or consular missions and military assets, the French Supreme Court unduly extended the scope of State immunity from measures of constraint, thereby facing the risk of having France being held liable for a violation of the right of access to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6, par. 1, European Convention of Human Rights. Pursuant to the consistent case law of the European Court of Human Rights, such a right, which extends to post-judgment enforcement measures and up to a certain extent can be considered likely to extend to pre-judgment measures of constraint as well, may suffer limitations which, as concerns State immunity, are to be considered as proportionate only insofar as they reflect the existing rules of customary international law...|$|E
40|$|The establishment, under {{international}} law, {{of the proper}} interpretive approach to broadly phrased waivers of sovereign <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>execution</b> is an unsettled issue, which was not addressed in legal theory or practice until recently. However, this issue became practically relevant {{in the wake of}} certain hedge funds’ strategy to seek the collection of defaulted sovereign debt in any available jurisdiction. Most important in this respect are the recent judgments of the French Court of Cassation in NML v. Argentine Republic, where the Court held, in fact, that, under customary international law, waivers of execution immunity may not extend to a particular category of state assets, unless expressly referred to. The present article examines the accuracy of the Court’s proposition in light of the major parameters for the determination of the relevant standards of interpretation: the 2004 UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property as well as the pre-existing state practice, i. e. the settled case law regarding the interpretation of general immunity waivers in light of the diplomatic and consular law principle “ne impediatur legatio”, and the submission of execution immunity waivers to certain restrictions under domestic statutes. The authors take the view that the interpretive criteria of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties are applicable by analogy to immunity waivers inserted in government bonds, leading to the adoption of a rather narrow approach. It is further suggested that, under the well-established principle that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof with respect to any exception to execution immunity, the “asset specificity” requirement may reasonably be seen as the allocation of the risk of ambiguity of immunity waivers to the judgment creditor. Finally, the authors argue that the restrictive interpretation of general immunity waivers may serve as a functional substitute for lacking clear-cut international law rules on state insolvency, insofar as no international law rule protecting good faith restructuring procedures from the speculative tactics of vulture funds is yet in force...|$|E
