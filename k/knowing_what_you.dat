2500|$|During an {{interview}} of The Album Network, Jared Leto {{explained that the}} song is [...] "less about reinventing yourself and more about finding out who you really are, your true self. That's a pretty important thing. That feeling of {{if you could just}} go back, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> know now." [...] Leto said: [...] "In a general sense, it is about a desire for renewal. But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song. I think {{that is one of the}} exciting things about music, the interpretation, from individual to individual and how it can change so much." ...|$|E

6000|$|And so he did. [...] "You {{had better}} {{go over to}} Ballyglass {{yourself}} to- morrow," [...] said he, [...] "and collect your own things. There's no <b>knowing</b> else <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may have to borrow of Larry." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'This {{will not}} do, Charlotte! I can have nothing taken {{into my house}} without being paid for. I insist on <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> could mean?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do. I {{trust your}} {{principle}} and kindness implicitly, but I think the very innocence {{of your heart}} prevents you from <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{beginning}} {{to be a little}} deaf," [...] she went on. [...] "To deceive you about that, I have sometimes answered you without really <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said." ...|$|E
6000|$|They had now {{reached the}} yard-gate, and Seth said, [...] "I won't go in, Dinah, so farewell." [...] He paused and hesitated {{after she had}} given him her hand, and then said, [...] "There's no <b>knowing</b> but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may see things {{different}} after a while. There may be a new leading." ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{researchers}} {{would agree}} that, to know <b>what</b> you're doing, <b>you</b> {{need to know}} how your model of <b>knowing</b> affects <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are do-ing. Your model, however, may not be the same as your colleague's. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} the Educational Researcher over the past year has contained a good deal of impassioned argument at the paradigmatic level (Eisner, 1983...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, cheer up!' said Sir Henry in French, smacking him smartly on the back. 'There's no <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> may happen, <b>you</b> know. To {{judge from}} your dinner today, I should {{say you were}} in a fair way to recovery.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I made Gadley consent. The Rector has it in writing, {{and it will}} {{do quite}} as well if I die. O, Jenny, woman, think of my never <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had gone through!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. H. She can't! Is there {{anything}} that I wouldn't do for you--or haven't done? And to think that I should take this trouble over you, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are! Do you despise me for it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come back, Theodora. I {{must know}} that {{you are not going to}} carry further this ill-usage of a most {{excellent}} man, more sincerely attached to you than you deserve. I insist on <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> intend to say to him.' ...|$|E
40|$|Making the {{transition}} from a college student on campus to a professional in the workplace can be a frightening experience. My objective is to break down this massive problem to a manageable set of guidelines to aid the student in this period of preparation and re-adjustment. A great deal of anxiety and frustration can be avoided simply by <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> obstacles <b>you</b> are approaching and how to deal with them, resulting in a smooth transition into the workforce...|$|R

That, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> I do, <b>you</b> {{dare not}} tempt me further,' said Nicholas, 'and by this better right; that those I serve, {{and with whom}} you would have done me base wrong and injury, are her nearest and her dearest friends. In their name I bear her hence. Give way!' ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the film's director, {{the mass}} {{displacement}} of Palestinians in 1948 remains a taboo in Israeli society. In {{an interview with}} Frank Barat she said [...] "The strongest element of Israeli DNA is <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> questions <b>you</b> cannot ask". Controversy arose at the festival at which On the Side of the Road premiered when Israeli Parliamentarian Ayelet Shaked argued that state subsidy of cultural events referring {{to the events of}} 1948 as the [...] "Nakba" [...] is in violation of the 2011 Nakba Law.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is true that}} I {{pulled him}} out of the sea, aided and abetted by Bucephalus, but whether all that you have heard of me is true I cannot tell, not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have heard. Who told you of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have {{no means}} of <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said to Mr. Hazelton, but if you told him all your business, that is no concern of ours. You insisted on his going away with you, and we haven't seen him since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I cannot say that. I {{have not}} seen Mrs. Robarts, and {{do not know what}} may be her opinion. To speak my mind {{honestly}} about Mark, I do not think he does cordially approve. He is afraid of you, and would be desirous of <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} management {{theory was}} introduced by Frederick Winslow Taylor to encourage production efficiency and productivity. Taylor argues that inefficiencies could be controlled through managing production as a science. Taylor defines scientific management as [...] "concerned with <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want men to do and then see in that {{they do it in}} the best and cheapest way." [...] According to Taylor, scientific management affects both workers and employers, and stresses the control of the labour force by management.|$|R
3000|$|... [Therefore] we are {{no longer}} sure what {{businesses}} we are in. There was a time when being in banking or electronics or manufacturing had a specific meaning. Now, bankers must understand algorithmic trading, techies lend money, pharma companies invest and manufacturers design computerized devices just to do their work. We often have little idea where the next opportunity or threat may come from. And not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> business <b>you</b> are in, from year to year or less, makes it harder to figure out exactly what competitive advantage, exactly, we hope to sustain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Peterkin!" [...] said Jack; [...] "you're {{exciting}} Ralph {{with your}} nonsense.--I'll {{explain it to}} you. You recollect that, after the ship struck, we three sprang over the bow into the sea? Well, I noticed that the oar struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow which nearly stunned you, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without <b>knowing</b> apparently <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were about. In doing so, you pushed the telescope-- which you clung to {{as if it had}} been your life--against Peterkin's mouth--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Women {{have their}} fancies," [...] {{answered}} Brant, slowly; [...] "perhaps {{he has taken}} hers; {{she would not be}} the first who walked that plank. Or, perhaps, she is vexed with you for not speaking out ere this; for, man, not <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are, how can she read your mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I willingly consent," [...] the rajah said; [...] "it is, indeed, {{but a small}} thing. So long as I live, I {{shall be}} ready to enter into any treaty with you; and doubtless my successor, whoever he may be, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done for us and our state, will also agree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And yet, {{the upshot}} of it all is that I shall do (D.V.) what the Bishop tells me is right. I hope he won't press on the matter, but I am content now to leave it with him, <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have said, and being so thankful to leave it with you and him.' ...|$|E

But {{you can see this}} surgeon without his <b>knowing</b> who or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are. It will be sufficient for him to know that you are an unfortunate sailor who had fallen {{into the hands of the}} savages." ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{an article}} for the Times Online, Hugo Rifkind participated in a seminar by Neil Strauss. Rifkind {{describes}} initially struggling with seduction techniques, eventually learning to attract women's interest, and then feeling guilty. Rifkind writes, [...] "After a little more practice, my 'game' is improving dramatically. I can open with fluency, and there's an injection of confidence which comes from <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to say}} next." [...] When he attracts a woman's attention, [...] "she is—quite honestly—looking at me like I'm the most fascinating person she's ever met. As a human being and, perhaps more crucially, as somebody with a girlfriend, I feel like absolute scum." ...|$|R
60|$|Other {{women have}} had talents, {{others have been}} good; but no woman that ever I knew possessed {{goodness}} and talent in union with such an intuitive perception of feelings, and such a faculty of instantaneous adaptation to them. The most troublesome thing in this world is to be condemned to the society {{of a person who}} can never understand any thing you say unless you say the whole of it, making your commas and periods as you go along; and the most desirable thing in the world is to live with a person who saves you all the trouble of talking, by <b>knowing</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean before you begin to speak.|$|R

There {{can be no}} room for congratulation, as the lady has not {{accepted}} the offer I have made her." [...] The Marchioness laughed incredulously,--with a little affected laugh in which the incredulity was sincere.--"I {{can only tell you}} that it is so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{let your}} son be {{run away with}} by this, or advise your client to incur the terrible expense of a new trial, without <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are about. I tell you fairly that I do dread such a trial on this poor lady's account. Reflect what it would be, Mr. Round, to any lady of your own family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} do," [...] whispered Frank to Emma; [...] "they {{are most of}} them affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> may all be {{thinking}} of, and only requires something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then Queen Guinevere came to {{the window}} and looked out, and several came and looked out also. At first none of them wist who it was that rode in that cart. But when the cart had come a little nearer to where they were, the Queen knew who he was, for she beheld the device upon the shield, even from afar, and she knew that the knight was Sir Launcelot. Then the Queen turned to the damsel and said to her: [...] "You laugh without <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> it is <b>you</b> laugh at. Yonder gentleman is no subject for a jest, for he is without any doubt the worthiest knight of any who ever wore golden spurs." ...|$|R
