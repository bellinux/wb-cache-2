5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the college. Again, Middleton could not do that, and began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU {{in the summer of}} 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, he {{was taken by the}} Seibu Lions with the first pick of the 1998 draft, {{although}} both the Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks of the North American Major Leagues also recruited him. At first, Matsuzaka stated that he wanted to play for the Yokohama BayStars, and, if he could not, he would then <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a company and after which choose the team of his choice through the reverse-draft (gyaku-shimei) system. That changed however, when the manager of the Lions, Osamu Higashio, an accomplished pitcher in his own right, met with Matsuzaka for dinner. At the dinner, Higashio gave Matsuzaka his winning ball for career win number 200. Matsuzaka accepted it and allowed himself to be drafted by the Lions.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1915–16, the Interior Department was {{organizing}} {{itself to}} deal with the growing number of national parks and ultimately, Congress created the National Park Service on August 25, 1916. Prior to the establishment of the National Park Service, in July 1916 the War Department agreed to withdraw troops from Yellowstone as of October 1, 1916, which {{was the end of the}} park visitation season. [...] At the same time, the War Department agreed to discharge a select number of the current volunteer cavalry contingent on September 29, 1916, so they could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the National Park Service as Park Rangers.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 Harding <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Teddy Wilson big band, {{and then}} in the early 1940s <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Coleman Hawkins band, and then Cab Calloway. He became a {{freelance}} arranger and worked with Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, and Count Basie, among others.|$|R

50|$|Wright was a {{newspaper}} reporter {{in his hometown of}} Bellefontaine, Ohio, before going to Hollywood in 1917 where he wrote film scripts for Selig Studios for many years.

Later he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Universal Studios as head of the scenario department.|$|R
500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Lex {{during the second}} season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha {{went to work for}} Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was going to run for Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character something more to do, and she wanted to do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{started on}} September 14 {{with each of}} the 50 men {{pleading}} [...] "not guilty". Coakley began his prosecution by calling officers from Port Chicago and Mare Island as witnesses. Commander Joseph R. Tobin of Ryder Street Naval Barracks said that he personally ordered six or seven of the men to load munitions on August 9 but was unable to verify if any others were so ordered. He said that the men he had spoken with were willing to follow any order except to load munitions; that each man expressed fear of another explosion. Tobin verified that the men were not aggressive or disrespectful. Lieutenant Ernest Delucchi, Commander of Division Four at Port Chicago, testified that he personally ordered only four of the 50 defendants to load munitions. Delucchi described overhearing men of Division Eight say to his men, [...] "Don't <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the white motherfuckers" [...] but, under cross-examination, was unable to identify who said it. Veltmann objected to this hearsay but was overruled after Coakley explained it was evidence toward conspiracy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, instead of {{attending}} university as he wished, Clyde Packer heeded his father's directive [...] "You <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> me ... You'll learn far {{more in the}} school of hard knocks". He joined Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) as a journalist and sub-editor of its flagship, The Daily Telegraph. For sixmonths he worked at the Daily Mail in London. In 1954 ACP launched a magazine, Weekend, with Donald Horne as editor and Packer on staff. By 1956 Packer was a director at ACP, Frank purchased the rights to Sydney TV station TCN-9 – the first Australian station to begin regular broadcasting. By 1957 Weekend employed Lillian Roxon as a journalist and later a sub-editor. When Queensland authorities wanted to ban the magazine Packer and Horne successfully fought the injunction in court.|$|E

60|$|The Huddersfield men {{naturally}} {{kept their}} own council. They had hastily buried their dead comrade on the moor, and although {{several of them}} were so severely knocked about that {{they were unable to}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> some time, no rumor of the affair got about outside the circle of the conspirators.

60|$|Dave {{told all}} that he knew, and the man listened eagerly.

He could get no trace of his little boy, and finally had gone West again. At first he had carried himself straight, but presently he had gotten in with the wrong set and had drank and gambled, and left Mr. Endicott to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Mr. Merwell.|$|E

I tell her that pick-and-shovel man get fifteen dollars a day in the mines. She says, 'That is four hundred and fifty dollars a month.' And I say, 'Sitka Charley is no pick-and-shovel man.' Then she says, 'I understand, Charley. I will give you seven hundred and fifty dollars each month.' It is a good price, and I <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> her.

We travel up Klondike, up Bonanza and Eldorado, over to Indian River, to Sulphur Creek, to Dominion, back across divide to Gold Bottom and to Too Much Gold, and back to Dawson.
