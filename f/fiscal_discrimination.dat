40|$|In {{this paper}} it is analysed, how, under price discrimination, {{the tax burden}} is shared between the {{distinct}} consumer groups. Unit and ad valorem taxes are compared, revealing an impossibility of <b>fiscal</b> <b>discrimination</b> with regard to price changes. Contrary to conventional tax incidence analysis, it is shown that quantities traded do matter. Relative market shares are decisive for the distribution of tax burdens thereby opening up an opportunity for <b>fiscal</b> <b>discrimination</b> in choosing tax types. This discriminatory potential is limited and not caused by price discrimination per se but rather due to monopolistic supply. Tax incidence, unit tax, ad valorem tax, price discrimination...|$|E

On some indicators, including per capita cigarette consumption, the USA strikingly lagged much of the rest of the world. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>discrimination</b> against cigarettes, amplified by the monopoly pricing, strategic choices, and organizational overload of the American Tobacco trust, are among the retarding factors. ...|$|E
40|$|We use a {{new theory}} of price {{determination}} – developed by Woodford, Simms and others – to characterize central bank independence and price stability. If fiscal policy guarantees that the price level is determined independently of government’s present value budget constraint, {{we can say that}} the central bank is operating in a monetary dominant regime; it has the ‘functional independence’ necessary to control the price level independently of the dictates of fiscal solvency (if it so chooses), and it can be held accountable for price stability (if that is its mandate). If fiscal policy does not allow this, we say the central bank is operating in a fiscal dominant regime. Numerical exercises suggest that price stability may be beyond the control of the central bank in such a regime. We show that strict enforcement of the Maastricht Treaty’s deficit criterion would ensure a monetary dominant regime.

50|$|In November 2002, the Haitian Parliament {{passed an}} {{investment}} law prohibiting <b>fiscal</b> and legal <b>discrimination</b> against foreign investors. The 2002 law explicitly recognizes {{the crucial role}} of foreign direct investment in spurring economic growth, and aims to facilitate, liberalize, and stimulate private investment in Haiti. Foreign investment protection is also provided by the Haitian Constitution of 1987, which permits expropriation of private property for public use or land reform with payment in advance. American firms enjoy free transfer of interest, dividends, profits, and other revenues stemming from their investments, and are guaranteed just compensation paid in advance of expropriation, as well as compensation in case of damages or losses caused by war, revolution, or insurrection. The U.S. and Haiti have a bilateral agreement on investment guarantees that permits the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation to offer programs in Haiti. The two governments also signed a bilateral investment treaty in December 1983, {{but it was not}} ratified.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} gender-responsive government budgeting, promoted {{in recent years by}} women''s nongovernmental organizations, academia, and multilateral organizations, and the extent of its implementation by national governments in both advanced and developing countries. Owing to recently developed analytical and technical tools, government budget management systems in some countries can help promote gender equality-to the extent of government involvement in gender-sensitive sectors and programs-at any level of available funding. However, to be fully effective, obstacles such as gender-biased culture, the lack of appropriate budget classifications, and the lack of gender analysis expertise and gender-disaggregated data in most countries need to be addressed.

40|$|For decades, {{state funding}} of public {{historically}} black colleges and universities (HBCU) has been shown to be de facto discriminatory relative to the funding of their predominately white counterparts. Although the dual system has been legally dismantled, the disparate funding has remained in place in a number of ways. For example, recent research shows that in 1995 approximately 17 % of the fewer state funding dollars allocated to historically black institutions (HBI) relative to predominately white institutions (PWI) could be attributed to <b>fiscal</b> <b>discrimination.</b> After more than a decade, the present research uses 2006 finance data to provide tests as to the extent of progress in moving HBI toward greater funding equality...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea is to}} {{discover}} the economic science potential to „prescribe ” an optimal taxation, both in taxation system (progressive vs. flat tax) and in taxation burden. I am going to demonstrate the myths of many popular ideas from the economic theory and public opinion: on the one side, that flat tax {{is the best way}} against <b>fiscal</b> <b>discrimination</b> and welfare redistribution in society, and on the other side, that flat tax is the modern source of economic prosperity. As any other social product, taxation must be considered, first of all, from ethical point of view. In Murray Rothbard’s terms, „Our conclusions are twofold: (1) that economics cannot assume any principle of just taxation, and that no one has successfully established any such principles; and (2) that the neutral tax, which seems to many a valid ideal, turns out to be conceptually impossible to achieve. Economists must therefore abandon their futile quest for the just, or the neutral, tax”. Key Words: Flat Tax, Optimal Taxation, Public Choice Theory Is the fiscal burden a scientifically one? The idea is {{to discover}} the economic science potential to „prescribe ” an optimal taxation, both in taxation system (progressive vs. flat tax) and in taxation burden.
