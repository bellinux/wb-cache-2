5000|$|The {{government}} held U.S. Steel to {{its responsibilities}} as a land tenant. The land {{occupied by the}} former plant {{and the surrounding area}} was polluted after almost 70 years of heavy industry. So polluted, that the Pollution Control Agency placed the site on the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list in 1984, requiring a plan and actions for <b>hazard</b> <b>containment</b> and environmental remediation. That year, buildings were inspected and harmful materials removed. In 1988, US Steel contracted for the razing and demolition of the once massive complex; the last of the buildings was brought down in 1997. Today the land of the former steel and cement plants sit primarily vacant, a brownfield available for development. The cement plant has been deemed as [...] "cleaned" [...] by U.S. Steel and the city of Duluth. The former steel plant site still has areas affected with pollution, which are areas of concern for area residents and prospective new tenants of the property. The MPCA, EPA and U.S. Steel continue to monitor and treat the 640 acre site and surrounding areas.|$|E
40|$|While {{considering}} all existing hazards for humans due to (a) natural disastrous events, (b) failures of human hazard attention or (c) intentional harmful behaviors of humans, we {{address the problem}} of building hazard aware spaces (HAS) to alert innocent people. We have researched and developed components of a prototype HAS system for detecting fire using wireless “smart ” micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor networks, such as the MICA sensors manufactured by Crossbow Inc., and spectral cameras, for instance, thermal infrared (IR), visible spectrum and multi-spectral cameras. Within this context, the paper overviews technical challenges and prototyped scientific solutions to (1) robotic sensor deployment using remote control, (2) synchronization of sensors and cameras, (3) localization of sensors and objects, (4) calibration of measurements from sensors and spectral cameras, (5) proactive camera control, (6) hazard detection, (7) human alert, (8) hazard confirmation and understanding, and (9) <b>hazard</b> <b>containment.</b> The work presents innovative signal processing applications of sensor network technology, and includes also theoretical and practical limitations that have to be understood while working with novel technologies. 1...|$|E
40|$|At Fire Station 4, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) {{receives}} a data message alert from sensors in a chemical storage warehouse indicating abnormal heat levels and possible agent release. A hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response team is {{dispatched to the}} warehouse. While en route, on-board data receivers are continuously updated with readings from the building sensors, allowing the responders to plan their approach for building entry and <b>hazard</b> <b>containment.</b> Once on scene, HAZMAT technicians wearing full protective gear and equipped with individual sensors/ meters enter the building “hot ” zone. The technicians have limited, if any, visibility in the toxic haze and cannot see their instrument’s portable sensor readings. Fortunately, {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN) data messaging is being used to relay their sensor readings through a cellular gateway back to receivers on a fire apparatus in the “cold ” zone. Subject matter experts (SMEs) monitor the sensor readings and alert the technicians when conditions exceed safe levels, prompting technicians to exit the “hot ” zone. Readings can be pushed as needed to other locations so authorized personnel can monitor conditions for plume prediction, initiate area evacuations, pre-stage arriving units, and take other measures as warranted. This scenario is becoming standard operating procedure for LAFD and other regional emergency response agencies as part of the full implementation of the Lo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{development}} of reentrant groove technology to hydrogen heat pipes. Parametric analyses are presented which optimize the theoretical design while considering the limitations of state-of-the-art extrusion technology. Acceptable production-type runs of extruded lengths (over 300 m) could only be achieved {{at the expense of}} a wider nominal groove opening than specified (0. 33 mm vs. 0. 20 mm). However, dimensional variations of other critical dimensions were within 0. 05 mm, which exceeded expectations. The 6063 -T 6 aluminum extrusion is 14. 6 mm OD with a wall thickness of 1. 66 mm and contains 20 axial grooves which surround a central 9. 3 -mm-diam vapor core. Each axial groove is 0. 775 -mm-diam with a 0. 33 mm opening. An excess vapor reservoir is provided at the evaporator to minimize the pressure <b>containment</b> <b>hazard</b> during ambient storage. Details of the instrumentation and helium-cooled test installation are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Re-entrant groove {{technology}} {{was extended to}} hydrogen heat pipes. Parametric analyses are presented which optimize the theoretical design while considering the limitations of state-of-the-art extrusion technology. The 6063 -T 6 aluminum extrusion is 14. 6 mm OD with a wall thickness of 1. 66 mm and contains 20 axial grooves which surround a central 9. 3 mm diameter vapor core. Each axial groove is 0. 775 mm diameter with a 0. 33 mm opening. An excess vapor reservoir is provided at the evaporator to minimize the pressure <b>containment</b> <b>hazard</b> during ambient storage. Modifications to the basic re-entrant groove profile resulted in improved overall performance. While the maximum heat transport capacity decreased slightly to 103 w-m the static wicking height increased markedly to 4. 5 cm. The heat pipe became operational between 20 and 30 K after a cooldown from 77 K without any difficulty. Steady state performance data taken over a 19 to 23 K temperature range indicated: (1) maximum heat transport capacity of 5. 4 w-m; (2) static wicking height of 1. 42 cm; and (3) overall heat pipe conductance of 1. 7 watts/deg C...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{shutdown}} of the SILOE reactor in 1997, the OSIRIS reactor has ensured the needs regarding technological irradiation at CEA {{including those of}} its industrial partners and customers. The Jules Horowitz Reactor will replace it and will offer a quite larger experimental field. It has the ambition to provide the necessary nuclear data and to maintain a fission research capability in Europe after 2010. The Jules Horowitz Reactor will represent a significant step in terms of performances and experimental capabilities. This paper will present the main design option resulting from the preliminary studies. The choice of the specific power around 600 KW/l for the reference core configuration is a key decision to ensure the required flux level. Consequently many choices {{have to be made}} regarding the materials used in the core and the fuel element design. These involve many specific qualifications including codes validation. The main safety options are based on: A safety approach based upon the defence-in-depth principle. A strategy of generic approaches to assess experimental risks in the facility. Internal events analysis taking into account risks linked to reactor and experiments (eg., radioactive source-term). Systematic consideration of external hazards (eg., earthquake, airplane crash) and internal <b>hazards.</b> Design of <b>containment</b> to manage and mitigate a severe reactor accident (consideration of “BORAX ” accident, according to french safety practice for MTRs, beyond design basis reactivity insertion accident, involving core melting and core destruction phenomena). ...|$|R
40|$|Restriction enzyme, {{molecular}} cloning and DNA annealing techniques {{have been used}} to study mRNA and DNA coding for the embryonic feather keratins of the chicken and the DNA genomes of coliphages 186 and P 2. The coliphage DNAs were used to develop the techniques for application to the keratin system which awaited the availability of appropriate bio - <b>hazard</b> <b>containment</b> facilities before being undertaken. The following results were obtained. 1. Restriction endonuclease cleavage of chick DNA with BamHI, BgïII, EcoRI, or HindIII, fractionation on agarose gels, immobilization on nitrocellulose filters and annealing to DNA complementary to purified 12 S mRNA isolated from the developing embryonic feather and coding for embryonic feather keratins, yielded a complex pattern of major and minor bands. These patterns consisted of 4 - 6 major bands and many minor bands. No simple repeat length could be deduced from these patterns, suggesting that keratin - coding DNA is heterogeneous in coding sequences, non - coding sequences or both. 2. Keratin gene expression was shown to be independent of DNA rearrangement, as the complex pattern of restriction fragments was identical in DNA isolated from germ - line tissue (sperm) the differentiated feather tissue and somatic tissue not synthesizing keratins (erythrocytes). Keratin gene expression must therefore involve the activation of pre - existing control regions in the DNA. 3. The purified 12 S mRNA coding for feather keratin was transcribed into double - stranded DNA and individual species isolated by {{molecular cloning}} in E. coli. Sequence variation between species was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. 4. Preliminary analysis of the cloned species revealed the existence of two distinct groups of species comprising 12 S mRNA : Group I (the more abundant group) and Group II (the less abundant). The fact that filter - bound DNA of individual Group I species bound more 12 s cDNA than equal amounts of Group II species DNA and that pure Group I species and total 12 S mRNA sequences (coding for keratins in cell - free translation systems) annealed to exactly the same complex set of EcoRI, HindIII, or BgïII restricted chick DNA fragments, compels the conclusion that Group I species represent true keratin coding sequences. Group II species annealed to restricted chick DNA fragments which were totally different to those annealing, to either Group I species or total 12 S mRNA sequences. Different Group II species appeared to anneal to certain common fragments, suggesting that this less abundant group was comprised of a family of sequence related species and were not simply contaminating mRNA species coding for ' housekeeping ' functions. Their exact nature is at present, however, uncertain. 5. Group I species, the presumptive keratin - coding species, are members of a family of homologous species present in the chick genome. This is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} two Group I species which have been examined so far, shown to be non - identical by restriction analysis, and total 12 S mRNA sequences from which they were derived, annealed to the same set of between 20 and 30 BglII, HindIII or EcoRI restricted chick DNA fragments under annealing and washing conditions of low stringency, (high salt). Under stringent (low salt) washing conditions, however, all except between 1 and 3 of the duplexes formed by these fragments and the Group I species were differentially lost from the filter, indicating that the majority of duplexes were mis - matched and therefore that these multiple copies were homologous and not identical. In addition the two non - identical Group I species annealed to EcoRI generated chick DNA fragments of different sizes under the stringent (low salt) washing conditions, demonstrating that differences must exist in the sequence of adjacent non - coding and / or intervening sequences (should they exist) for these two species. 6. Although the two Group I species discussed above annealed to different EcoRI generated chick DNA fragments under the stringent (low salt) washing conditions, they both annealed under these conditions to a HindIII generated chick DNA fragment of size 3. 0 kb. Assuming that this is a single fragment and not two fragments co - electrophoresing by chance, sequences identical to or with very close homology to both of these species lie on the same fragment and are therefore linked in the genome. The exact nature of this linkage and of the extent of gene clustering, should it exist, was not determined. 7. Restriction cleavage maps of coliphages 186 and P 2 were determined for the enzymes BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, SaïI, XbaI, and XhoI. These maps were used to analyse four insertion or deletion mutants affecting the major control region of 186. 186 ins 2 and 186 ins 3 were shown to be insertions of an IS 3 element in the cI. gene and int gene respectively. 186 dell and 186 del 2 were shown to carry the same deletion affecting the cI gene, but 186 del 2 carried a cryptic insert in the repressor binding site (operator).

40|$|International Space Station (ISS) {{is crucial}} to its {{continuous}} operation. Off-nominal situations can arise from virtually any aspect of ISS operations. One situation of particular concern is the inadvertent release of a chemical into the ISS atmosphere. In sufficient quantities, a chemical release can render the ISS uninhabitable regardless of the chemical s toxicity {{as a result of}} its effect on the hardware used to maintain the environment. This is certainly true with system chemicals which are integral components to the function and purpose of the system. Safeguards, such as design for minimum risk, multiple <b>containment,</b> <b>hazard</b> assessments, rigorous safety reviews, and others, are in place to minimize the probability of a chemical release to the ISS environment thereby allowing the benefits of system chemicals to outweigh the risks associated with them. The thermal control system is an example of such a system. Heat generated within the ISS is transferred from the internal thermal control system (ITCS) to the external thermal control system (ETCS) via two, single-barrier interface heat exchangers (IFHX). The ITCS and ETCS are closed-loop systems which utilize water and anhydrous ammonia, respectively, as heat-transfer fluids. There is approximately 1200 lbs. (208 gallons) of anhydrous ammonia in the ETCS circulating through the two heat exchangers, transferring heat from the ITCS water lines. At the amounts present in the ETCS, anhydrous ammonia is one system chemical that can easily overwhelm the station atmosphere scrubbing capabilities and render the ISS uninhabitable in the event of a catastrophic rupture. Although safeguards have certainly minimized the risk of an ammonia release into the Station atmosphere, credible release scenarios and controls to manage these scenarios are examined...|$|R
