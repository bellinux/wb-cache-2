5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing <b>driveshaft.</b> However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner. Reutimann made contact with Johnson, forcing him to collide with the wall and damage his car's suspension on lap two. The first caution of the race was subsequently given. None of the leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution, and Johnson drove to his garage to change his front and rear suspension. Jeff Gordon maintained his lead on the lap eight restart. Kurt Busch passed Jeff Gordon on the low side of the track for the lead position four laps later. After starting twenty-ninth, Robby Gordon had moved up thirteen positions to sixteenth by lap 34. One lap later, Johnson's car was fitted with a new <b>driveshaft.</b>|$|E
5|$|The BT49's racing career {{got off to}} an {{unsettled}} {{start when}} Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, abruptly quit the sport after 10 laps of the first practice session at the penultimate race of the 1979 season, the Canadian Grand Prix. The car soon showed promise: Piquet ran third in the race on the high speed Circuit Île Notre-Dame before retiring with a broken gearbox. Lauda's replacement, Argentine novice Ricardo Zunino, was seventh of the nine who completed the race. At the season finale in wet conditions at the Watkins Glen International circuit, Zunino spun off although Piquet set the fastest lap before a <b>driveshaft</b> failed, putting his {{car out of the}} race.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{retired from}} the race when he slowed and later pulled {{to the side of}} the track with fluid leaking from his engine on lap 14. His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen to move into the first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Räikkonen slowed on track with an <b>driveshaft</b> failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an misfiring engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis. Barrichello attempted to get past Coulthard for fourth position on lap 19, but Coulthard moved onto a defensive line to keep the position. Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain his first position after his one and only pit stop. Barrichello was able to overtake Coulthard at the Agip corner on the same lap.|$|E
5|$|In the afterlife, {{in which}} Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, Faraday has a {{different}} background. Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music, and never trained in physics. After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope (Sonya Walger), Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered. He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red-haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved. Daniel states after the encounter, he {{made a series of}} notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics, a topic he knows nothing about. Daniel shows his notes, and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path. Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half-sister and where Desmond can find her. Later, Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert, but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife. Daniel then takes the stage with <b>DriveShaft</b> to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd. It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife. Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife, since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past, and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the track}} dried up despite a light rain shower before the second {{practice}} session and drivers recorded more lap times {{to make up for}} the lack of running in the first session. Some drivers also went off the circuit. Alonso set the fastest lap of the day with a time of 1:16.265; Massa finished with the third-fastest time. The two Red Bull drivers were second and fourth (with Vettel ahead of Webber). All of the top four quickest drivers set their fastest lap times on the super-soft dry compound tyre. Rosberg was fifth-fastest (despite damaging his front wing after he collided with a kerb bollard), ahead of his Mercedes teammate Michael Schumacher in sixth. Hamilton, Kubica, Barrichello and Hülkenberg followed in the top ten. A heavy rain shower hit the circuit on Saturday morning which stopped before the final practice session started. Drivers were initially forced to use intermediate tyres before switching later to dry-weather conditions and the teams worked on car set-up for qualifying. Vettel set the fastest lap, a 1:15.503; Webber finished with the third-fastest time. They were separated by the Ferrari drivers in second and fourth (with Alonso ahead of Massa). Rosberg duplicated his second-session result in fifth, with Hamilton in sixth. Schumacher, Barrichello, Kubica and Hülkenberg completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Sutil was unable to record a lap time when his Force India's <b>driveshaft</b> broke though he managed to return to his garage and lost 45 minutes of running.|$|E
50|$|Trimmers {{that have}} nylon or metal blades usually require {{straight}} <b>driveshafts</b> {{to handle the}} higher torque required to turn the heavier disk, {{and because of the}} shock loads that are passed back from the blade to the drive shaft and its gearbox(es).

5|$|Di Grassi {{took over}} the lead with d'Ambrosio second; both drivers were half a lap ahead of the battling drivers, who had more {{available}} electrical energy. Félix da Costa and his teammate Frijns joined the leading group of drivers after being under the minimum pit stop time by three seconds. The safety was deployed for the third (and final) time when Duval stopped on track after leaving the chicane with a battery issue, prematurely ending his race. This allowed the field to close up to di Grassi and d'Ambrosio. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead at the restart. Vergne immediately pushed hard and attempted to pass López for third but the two drivers made contact at the turn three chicane. He attempted the same manoeuvre one lap later but López cut the chicane to avoid hitting Vergne and the latter demanded on his radio that López cede the position. Both Andretti cars were investigated because their pit stop times were faster the minimum permitted time of one minute because the team believed it was 57 seconds. López drew near to d'Ambrosio and Vergne remained close behind López. The battle allowed di Grassi {{to pull away from}} the field. Félix da Costa slowed and stopped his car on the 33rd lap with a broken <b>driveshaft,</b> causing him to retire. His teammate Frijns was issued with a drive-through penalty for being below the minimum pit stop time. Two laps later, López pushed hard and steered onto the outside line in an attempt to pass d'Ambrosio but spun under braking for the first corner, sliding off into the turn's run-off area. Buemi activated FanBoost and lined up an overtake on Rosenqvist (who locked his front tyres) but spun under braking for turn one, and narrowly avoided striking López's stranded car. Both drivers fell down the order. The electrical power in Engel's car depleted slowly after exiting turns five and six, ending his race. Buemi recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 40, completing a circuit at one minute and 3.102 seconds. This earned him one championship point. D'Ambrosio continued to hold back Vergne and the remaining seven cars behind him had more electrical energy available. D'Ambrosio locked his tyres under braking for the first corner, allowing Vergne to pass him for second place. Vergne then started to draw closer to di Grassi.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher was {{the fastest}} driver not {{to advance to}} the final session, {{qualifying}} eleventh; his best time of 1:15.026 was nearly two seconds slower than Alonso's fastest time in the second session. He had been one tenth of a second quicker than his teammate Rosberg in the first session; Rosberg's lap caused Schumacher to be eliminated from qualifying and the latter stated he had brake problems. Kamui Kobayashi qualified in 12th after he encountered slower cars which forced him to reduce his speed, and his tyre temperatures dropped which resulted in a loss of grip. He was followed by Petrov in the 13th position. Sutil was afflicted with a lack of grip in his Force India which caused him to slide sideways. However Sutil was penalised five positions because this team changed his gearbox following his <b>driveshaft</b> failure in the final practice session. As a result, de la Rosa inherited 14th, and was ahead of the Toro Rosso drivers (Jaime Alguersuari in front of Buemi). Jarno Trulli was the quickest driver who was unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and was followed by his Lotus teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Timo Glock was penalised five positions on the grid twice because his team changed his gearbox and fitted a seventh-gear ratio that went undeclared on Friday. Senna took over the 20th place. Liuzzi exited turn 15 to complete his second timed lap, ran over a wet patch of astroturf causing him to lose control of the back-end of his Force India, sending him across the track to make heavy contact with the front of his car. He veered back towards the track and some grass and narrowly avoided collecting Glock. Sakon Yamamoto had a shifting issue on his fastest lap time and took 23rd. Lucas di Grassi had a gearbox problem in his car that was unable to be rectified and completed the field. He was later given a five-place grid penalty for the gearbox change but it had no effect on his starting position.|$|E
25|$|To make {{best use}} of the limited space for the <b>driveshaft</b> and {{internal}} gearbox, the <b>driveshaft</b> runs at high speed, thus allowing it to be of small diameter. This reduces the disruption to the airflow {{and the size of}} the hollow fairing that encloses it.|$|E
50|$|Some later {{automobile}} rear swing axles have {{universal joints}} connecting the <b>driveshafts</b> to the differential, which {{is attached to}} the chassis. They do not have universal joints at the wheels: the wheels are always perpendicular to the <b>driveshafts.</b> Swing axle suspensions traditionally used leaf springs and shock absorbers. It was also used in early aircraft (1910 or before), such as the Sopwith and Fokker, usually with rubber bungee and no damping.|$|R

25|$|If {{it is not}} {{possible}} to arrange a single straight path for the <b>driveshaft,</b> it may be arranged in two sections and linked by an intermediate gearbox. This is most commonly required for high-bypass turbofans with large diameter fans.|$|E
25|$|Many early {{implementations}} for automobiles {{located the}} brakes on the inboard side of the <b>driveshaft,</b> near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the unsprung weight and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{internal}} gearbox {{is complicated by the}} heat and small space available in which to connect the <b>driveshaft.</b> It is usually placed between the compressor outlet and the combustor. In turboprops or designs with centrifugal compressors, it may be placed ahead of the compressor.|$|E
50|$|As {{relatively}} small four-wheeled vehicles, these used a simplified {{layout of the}} H-drive. A single wide casing housed the differential and transfer box, with four articulated <b>driveshafts</b> running to bevel gear boxes inboard of each wheel. The use of bevel boxes, rather than DAF's worm gears, required the final drive reduction {{to be placed in}} the hubs, using an epicyclic reduction in each hub. This had the advantage of reducing torque in the <b>driveshafts,</b> allowing their unsprung weight to be made lighter.|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 {{no longer}} had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again {{in the style of the}} Chapman strut, using the <b>driveshafts</b> themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the <b>driveshafts</b> as an upper control arm.|$|R

25|$|A single {{overhead}} camshaft for each cylinder bank operated two valves per cylinder, {{in an almost}} identical manner to the inline six-cylinder German Mercedes D.III and BMW III engines. Each camshaft was driven by a vertical <b>driveshaft</b> that was placed {{at the back of}} each cylinder bank, again identical to the Mercedes and BMW straight-six powerplants. Delco Electronics provided the ignition system and Zenith the carburetor. Dry weight was 844lb (383kg).|$|E
25|$|Fred Dixon and Tony Rolt {{considered}} {{the possibility of using}} 4WD in circuit racing, and with Harry Ferguson keen to promote the transmission systems of his Ferguson tractor firm work began on the P99 in 1960. With a 50–50 torque distribution front to rear the car, Claude Hill's design was built to have an even weight distribution over both axles, which along with the position of the gearbox necessitated a front-engined design despite Cooper's and Lotus's overwhelming recent success with mid-engined cars. Just as the project was nearing completion it was dealt something of a body blow by the governing body's decision {{to reduce the size of}} F1 engines by 40% for , making the extra weight of the 4WD transmission a much bigger penalty. Nevertheless the team persevered and fitted a standard 1.5-litre Climax 4-cylinder engine, mounted at a slant to make room for the front <b>driveshaft.</b> In addition the driving position was moved slightly off-centre to accommodate the gearbox and rear <b>driveshaft</b> to the driver's left hand side.|$|E
