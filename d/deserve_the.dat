5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and that he did not <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> humiliations he endured.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with Ice-T, the concierge, and Coolio, the bellboy, {{in a hotel}} lobby. Ice-T is getting onto Coolio about how he does not put forth enough effort in his work and does not <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> job. The song begins to play after this scene ends, and the plot follows Coolio who, while on the job, sees acts of strip poker, lesbian affairs, and several sexual scenarios. The bellboy {{eventually}} is invited {{into one of the}} rooms and the music comes to an end. The video ends with a scene of Ice-T continuing to complain about the bellboy's work ethics.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, {{the judge}} {{sentence}}d Cisneros and Garza {{to life in}} prison after the jury decided that neither of them posed a threat to society, and thus did not <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> death penalty. This sentence included the possibility for parole after they complete 35 mandatory years behind bars. The head juror said the tapes were the strongest evidence against them, along with Martínez' testimony. Fischer's parents said they were pleased with the decision, and that justice was finally served, but said their son's absence would leave a void {{for the rest of their}} lives. The prosecution intended to have Cisneros sentenced to death arguing that her actions were premeditated. Garza's closing words centered around him being told by Martínez that Cisneros wanted Fischer hurt, and that he would not have knowingly participated in a murder. Both defense attorneys said they would appeal the verdict. Cisneros's attorney in particular said the judge's denial of a separate trial for his client was the reason for his early appeal. The defense said that trials where two defendants implicate each other are often severed, The judge refused to sever them because Cisneros's statement did not mention Garza. The defense also said they would appeal the verdict because they believed that the voice recordings were tampered with and unauthenticated. A judge formalized the jury's decision and sentenced Cisneros and Garza {{to life in prison}} on April 18.|$|E

Because of shoulder stiffness, Kim was left off the ALCS roster.|$|E
25|$|The old anti-suffragist {{argument}} that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> right to vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation {{of tens of}} thousands of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.|$|E
25|$|For decades, the Rosenbergs' sons Michael and Robert Meeropol {{and many}} other {{defenders}} maintained that Julius and Ethel were innocent of spying on their country and victims of Cold War paranoia. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, much information concerning them was declassified, including a trove of decoded Soviet cables, code-named VENONA, which detailed Julius's role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets and Ethel's role as an accessory. Their sons' current position is that Julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge, though not of atomic spying, while Ethel was only generally aware of his activities. The children believe that their father did not <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> death penalty and that their mother was wrongly convicted. They continue to campaign for Ethel to be posthumously and legally exonerated.|$|E

25|$|Zina is a Hudud crime, {{stated in}} {{multiple}} sahih hadiths to <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> stoning (Rajm) punishment. In others stoning is prescribed {{as punishment for}} illegal sex between man and woman, In some sunnah, the method of stoning, by first digging a pit and partly burying the person's lower half in it, is described. Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people is sentenced with flogging a 100 times. Adultery can be punished by up to one hundred lashes, though this is not binding in nature and the final decision will always {{be in the hands}} of a judge appointed by the state or community. However, no mention of stoning or capital punishment for adultery is found in the Quran and only mentioning lashing as punishment for adultery. Nevertheless, most scholars maintain that there is sufficient evidence from hadiths to derive a ruling.|$|E
25|$|Bonifacio {{was also}} subject to rumors {{that he had}} stolen Katipunan funds, his sister was the {{mistress}} of a priest, {{and he was an}} agent provocateur paid by friars to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was a Mason, a mere Manila employee, allegedly an atheist, and uneducated. According to these letters, Bonifacio did not <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> title of Supremo since only God was supreme. This last allegation was made despite the fact that Supremo was meant to be used in conjunction with Presidente, i.e. Presidente Supremo (Supreme President) to distinguish the president of the Katipunan Supreme Council from council presidents of subordinate Katipunan chapters like the Magdalo and Magdiwang. Bonifacio suspected the rumor-mongering to be the work of the Magdalo leader Daniel Tirona. He confronted Tirona, whose airy reply provoked Bonifacio to such anger that he drew a gun and would have shot Tirona if others had not intervened.|$|E
25|$|For the Giro d'Italia, Voigt rode {{in support}} of Basso. Following Team CSC's team time trial win on stage 5, Voigt found himself second, {{trailing}} race leader Serhiy Honchar by six seconds. During the first mountains, Voigt helped Basso take the overall lead, while he slid down the board and finished 37th. On mountainous stage 19, Voigt and Julich were in a 20-man break, but as Team CSC was leading the peloton to defend Basso's first place, Voigt and Julich did not work. Up the last climb, Voigt was alone with Spanish rider Juan Manuel Gárate, but as Voigt did not think he had done enough to <b>deserve</b> <b>the</b> victory, he let Garate take the win. Voigt finally got his first win {{of the season in}} the Ster Elektrotoer race in June. There he won stage 4 and helped teammate Kurt Asle Arvesen to the overall win, two weeks before the Tour de France.|$|E
