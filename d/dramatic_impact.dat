5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E

50|$|Globalization {{refers to}} the {{integration}} of economies in terms of trade, information, and jobs. Innovations in supply chain management enabled goods to be sourced in Asia and shipped to the United States less expensively than in the past.

5|$|Decisions {{made during}} the next two days had a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on the {{experience}} of Air Group 18 at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. TG 38.1 was detached and sent to Ulithi for replenishment and rearmament after two weeks of continuous operations against Okinawa and the Ryukyus Islands. USS Bunker Hill and Hancock were also detached from TG 38.2 at this time, leaving Intrepid the sole Essex-class aircraft carrier in its group. When Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force was sighted entering the Sibuyan Sea on October 24, the only task group readily available to strike was the shorthanded TG 38.2.|$|E
5|$|On Gates' advice, Rockefeller {{became one}} of the first great benefactors of medical science. In 1901, he founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. It changed its name to Rockefeller University in 1965, after {{expanding}} its mission to include graduate education. It claims a connection to 23 Nobel laureates. He founded the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in 1909, an organization that eventually eradicated the hookworm disease, which had long plagued rural areas of the American South. His General Education Board made a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> by funding the recommendations of the Flexner Report of 1910. The study had been undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment {{altered the}} process for electing United States Senators and changed the way {{vacancies}} would be filled. Under the original constitutional provision, state legislatures filled vacancies when a Senator left office {{before the end of}} the term; the Seventeenth Amendment provides that state legislatures can grant governors the right to make temporary appointments, which last until a special election is provided to fill the seat. The power to call such an election can also be granted to the governor. It also had an immediate and <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|World War II had a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on Texas, {{as federal}} money poured in to build {{military}} bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; {{and hundreds of}} thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture. Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858 Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Calcutta and began {{travelling}} throughout Northern India {{to document the}} aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.|$|E

25|$|The {{groups in}} Germany {{were not as}} {{strongly}} anti-art as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive manifestos and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.|$|E
25|$|Guitry's plays {{range from}} {{historical}} dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have musical scores, by composers including André Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them, finding {{the lack of}} spoken dialogue fatal to <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact.</b> From the 1930s {{to the end of}} his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway had a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on Sandvika. First of all is spurred the {{centralization}} of many commercial activities in Sandvika, with the subsequent increase to population. Secondly the line cut through the town. This creased a social divide, with workers and craftsmen settling north of the station, and the bourgeois settling on the south side, along the fjord. The railway also brought some tourism with people on day trips from Oslo.|$|E
50|$|The {{rapid changes}} in family {{structure}} {{that began to}} occur in the 1960s and throughout {{the latter half of the}} 20th century had <b>dramatic</b> <b>impacts</b> on the financial realities of many women and children. During World War II and the decades succeeding it, many more women entered the workforce, divorce rates increased rapidly, and birth rates decreased. These shifts were both reactions to and reflections of massive shifts in the American economic, social, and cultural landscapes.|$|R
40|$|Jasmonates (JAs) are a {{class of}} plant hormones that play {{essential}} roles in response to tissue wounding. They act on gene expression to slow down growth and to redirect metabolism towards producing defense molecules and repairing damage. These responses are systemic and have <b>dramatic</b> <b>impacts</b> on yields, making JAs a very active research area. JAs interact with many other plant hormones and therefore also have essential functions throughout development, notably during plant reproduction, leaf senescence {{and in response to}} many biotic and abiotic stresses...|$|R

25|$|A second {{extinction}} pulse, the Hangenberg event {{closed the}} Devonian period {{and had a}} <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on vertebrate faunas. Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event, as did most members of other groups including lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats, leaving {{only a handful of}} survivors. This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and anoxia in the seas.|$|E

Learning theories that help explain the effects are then discussed, especially as they may help others redesign their teaching methodologies. Non-theoretic learning strategies for students and seven research-based principles for more effective teaching are also presented to help explain the results achieved...|$|R
30|$|While the {{development}} of urban rail transit has changed the distribution of populations and employment space, it has also had <b>dramatic</b> <b>impacts</b> on the job–housing spatial relationship in Beijing. In terms of job–housing balance (JHB) index, it shows the job–housing mismatch pattern while the JHB index is higher in the city center area with more job opportunities, and JHB index is lower in the suburban area with more residential functions. It usually finds in the USA cities that job–housing spatial relationship has great impact on commuting behavior on metropolitan area [26]; some scholar even taken it as sin to long-distance commuting.|$|R
40|$|As reported, most DC {{pension scheme}} {{participants}} simply follow proposed defaults, {{even though they}} have the freedom to choose. Consequently, default designs have <b>dramatic</b> <b>impacts</b> on individuals’retirement saving outcomes. Given the fact that the default design matters, this paper evaluates contribution default designs to help DC plan participants to save and invest wisely. The proposed defaults can be characterized by simple age-dependent contribution and investment rules, which may provide large welfare gain above the current fixed default design. Furthermore, we …nd that the optimal contribution choice plays a more important role in improving welfare than optimal portfolio choice...|$|R
25|$|In {{the final}} match {{of the series}} at The Oval, England went in first on a pitch ideal for batting and made a record total of 7/903, with their opening batsman Len Hutton making 364 to break Bradman's Ashes record score. England won by the {{overwhelming}} margin of an innings and 579 runs. Fleetwood-Smith conceded a world record of 298 runs in his 87 overs, for the wicket of Wally Hammond. By contrast, O'Reilly's 85 overs cost him 178 runs. This had a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on his average. Before the match it was 31.02; after, it was 37.38.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} at Mysen had a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on Eidsberg. With {{the railway}} Mysen received {{a post office}} and telegraph. The central areas had previously been at Folkenborg, where the municipal hall and Eidsberg Sparebank was located, and the area around Eidsberg Church. Many companies and shops moved to Mysen, and both the municipal hall and the bank moved there in 1900. The largest cargo customer with the railway was the forest industry. Also farmers benefited, as the railway {{made it possible to}} export milk to the capital. The railway caused the first dairy in Eidsberg to opened in 1883, next to Mysen Station.|$|E
25|$|Since 1938, {{many states}} have adopted rules similar to the FRCP. However, some states, like California, have civil {{procedure}} systems, which deviate significantly from the federal rules; the California Codes provide for four separate types of class actions. As a result, there are two separate treatises devoted solely to the complex topic of California class actions. Some states, such as Virginia, do not provide for any class actions, while others, such as New York, limit the types of claims that may be brought as class actions. In 2013, several class action lawsuits have been filed under both the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar Michigan state laws against some of Michigan's largest medical providers and collection agencies which may have a <b>dramatic</b> <b>impact</b> on the collection of unpaid medical bills and the collection industry as a whole.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Flood waves {{resulting}} from dam break and spillway gate malfunction may have <b>dramatic</b> <b>impacts.</b> Two related cases are the overtopping of a dam by flood waves and a sudden water release down a stepped cascade.

New experimental observations are presented. The results highlight a faster wave propagation than predicted by classical theories. The reduced warning time for downstream populations {{is a major concern}} and new correlations are proposed to estimate the flood wave arrival...|$|R
40|$|Available {{estimates}} of the land use changes and greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels fer significantly across economic models. This paper focuses on the impacts of price-induced yield assumptions on U. S. corn ethanol results. These assumptions have <b>dramatic</b> <b>impacts</b> within the FAPRI modeling framework, but limited ones within the GTAP-BIO model. I show that these sensitivity to yield assumption results are not comparable because the ex ante land and production elasticities assumed in these two models are not comparable. The analysis reveals that the current focus solely {{on the value of}} the price-induced yield elasticity can be misleading...|$|R
