5|$|The battle {{exhausted}} the JNA {{and proved}} {{a turning point}} in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities</b> remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity.|$|E

Several institutions, including the university and the Macedonian academy, were also relocated on the north bank in order to reduce borders between the <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities.</b> Indeed, the north bank is mostly inhabited by Muslim Albanians, Turks and Roma, whereas Christian ethnic Macedonians predominantly reside on the south bank.|$|E

5|$|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was {{composed}} of six constituent republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1991, Croatia, and Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina—a republic with a mixed population consisting of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats—followed suit in March 1992 in a highly controversial referendum, creating tension in the <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities.</b> Bosnian Serb militias, whose strategic goal was to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Serbia, encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, rocket launchers, and aircraft bombs. From 2May 1992 {{until the end of}} the war in 1996, the city was blockaded. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbering roughly 40,000 inside the besieged city, was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege. Meanwhile, throughout the country, thousands of predominantly Bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of ethnic cleansing. In Sarajevo, women and children attempting to buy food were frequently terrorized by Bosnian Serb sniper fire.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} {{began their}} wartime operations {{by focusing on}} the activities of immigrants and carrying out border security, but quickly widened their operations. Unlike during the Boer War, the mounted police at first were forbidden to volunteer for military duty abroad, {{and the size of the}} force was instead temporarily increased to 1,200 men. The force investigated rumours of conspiracies associated with the Central Powers, but, since most mounted police did not have links within the relevant <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities,</b> they instead used secret agents and informants to gather intelligence, supported by a few undercover officers. Meanwhile, tensions grew between temperance campaigners and soldiers over the implementation of the liquor laws. The police barracks in Calgary were attacked in October 1916 by a crowd of over two hundred soldiers and civilians, who were trying to release six soldiers arrested for alcohol offences. The building was destroyed, one police officer was shot and several more injured.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities.</b> The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{performance}} {{was an important}} part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called sansei. During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called nisei faced internment in the United States and in Canada {{on the basis of their}} race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities.</b> Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the Civil Rights Movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, {{performance was}} meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the <b>ethnic</b> <b>communities</b> they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E

It was hypothesized that social connectedness in ethnic and mainstream society is a stronger predictor of well-being to immigrants who highly value/desire it than to those who do not. The results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided partial support for the hypotheses. For immigrants who highly valued con-nectedness in the <b>ethnic</b> <b>community,</b> positive affect increased with greater connected-ness in the <b>ethnic</b> <b>community,</b> whereas, for immigrants who did not value it, connect-edness in the <b>ethnic</b> <b>community</b> was not associated with positive affect.

40|$|Our {{studies of}} Vietnamese youth in an ethnic enclave in New Orleans during the mid- 1990 ’s showed {{a growing trend}} of “bifurcation, ” a {{situation}} in which youth were diverging in two distinct directions—valedictorian (or achiever) versus delinquent. As predicted by the segmented assimilation theory, we found that Vietnamese youth with close connections to their <b>ethnic</b> <b>community</b> through their families were likely to concentrate on upward social mobility through education and {{that they were able to}} do so because of the support, control, and direction that they received from their <b>ethnic</b> <b>community.</b> In contrast, those with weak connections to their families and the <b>ethnic</b> <b>community,</b> or whose families were detached from the <b>ethnic</b> <b>community,</b> were likely to develop Vietnamese variations of an oppositional youth subculture and thus became delinquent “outsiders. ” Our survey data, face-to-face interviews, and field observations all provided substantial empirical support for this bifurcation argument.
