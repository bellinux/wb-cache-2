5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, though neither manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|Pickett's first combat command {{was during}} the Peninsula Campaign, leading a brigade that was nicknamed the Gamecocks (the brigade would {{eventually}} be led by Richard B. Garnett in Pickett's Charge). Pickett led his brigade ably in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines, earning commendations from his superiors. At Gaines's Mill on June 27 he was shot off his horse while leading his brigade in its first assault. Pickett continued {{to move forward with}} his men for a while, leading his horse on foot. A second assault by Pickett's brigade, led by Colonel Eppa Hunton, along with the brigade led by Cadmus M. Wilcox, broke the Union line. Pickett feared that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> mortal blow to his shoulder, but the wound was initially assessed by others as minor. The shoulder wound turned out to be severe enough that, while not fatal, Pickett was out of action for the next three months, and his arm would remain stiff for at least a year.|$|E

5|$|Tomorrow Never Dies was {{the first}} of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson's version is {{expanded}} from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver's background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson's series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner's continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny when he said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> course in Asian languages. Tomorrow Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by Tomorrow Never Dies, specifically Bond's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson {{said in an interview that}} he felt Tomorrow Never Dies was the best of the three novelisations he wrote.|$|E
25|$|Australian star player Shane Warne {{was sent}} home from the cup in {{embarrassing}} circumstances, only the day before their opening game, after a positive drug test in a lead-up competition in Australia revealed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> banned diuretic.

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> keen {{interest}} in the theatre, {{and it has been}} asserted that many of David Garrick's best productions and revivals owed much to his assistance. He was the author, although the fact was long concealed, of High Life below Stairs, a two-act farce presented at Drury Lane on 31 October 1759; also of False Concord (Covent Garden, 20 March 1764) and The Tutor (Drury Lane, 4 February 1765).|$|E
25|$|He grew up at 35 Meryla Street, Burwood. He did {{his primary}} {{schooling}} from Burwood Public School (1927- 1933), and secondary schooling at Sydney's Fort Street Boys' High School (1934-1937). He studied art, full-time, at East Sydney Technical College (now {{known as the}} National Art School), from 1937–1938; and, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> position with one of Sydney's largest advertising agencies, Lintas (Lever International Advertising), he transferred to part-time studies, studying at night from 1939 to 1941 (when he enlisted in the army).|$|E
25|$|Wright {{made her}} last {{trip in the}} spring of 1865, in command of Capt. Thomas Stump, with Capt.

Captain Stump reported his explorations as having been of no practical value; but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> steamer farther {{into the heart of the}} regions lying to the east than any craft had ever gone before.|$|E

25|$|In 1851, the Opéra-National was revived, and on 1 May Edmond Seveste was {{appointed}} director. By {{the end of}} July <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> lease on the Théâtre Historique (72 Boulevard du Temple). Built by the dramatist Alexandre Dumas, the theatre had opened on 20 February 1847, closed on 20 December 1850, and remained unused. The entrance to the theatre was a long, narrow vestibule, squeezed between two other buildings, with a facade only eight meters wide. The auditorium, located in the back, was unusually wide (20 meters) and only 16 meters deep. It had an audience capacity of 1500–1700 and was thought to have excellent acoustics for opera.|$|E
25|$|Colts coach Tony Dungy did {{not perform}} his usual head {{coaching}} duties in the next regular season game for the Colts, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> brief vacation to mourn {{the loss of his}} son. Assistant Head Coach / Quarterbacks Coach Jim Caldwell took over for Dungy in a Week 16 showdown with the Seattle Seahawks, in which the Colts lost, 13–28. Dungy did return to the next game, which happened to be the last game of the regular season. The Colts won that game, 17–13 over the Arizona Cardinals. The Colts dedicated the last two games of the season to James Dungy, with Tony Dungy returning to the sideline in their Divisional Playoff game against Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|He has {{a dubious}} {{distinction}} {{of playing the}} most number of test matches before taking his first catch. On 31 October 2016, in his 20th test match, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> spectacular catch to dismiss Darren Bravo. He also holds {{the distinction of being}} the only player to have bowled in a five wicket (1 caught, 2 bowled, 2 run-outs) maiden over in T20 cricket, doing so against Australia in 2010. This was the only time in cricketing history that 5 wickets had fallen in an over of any international format and that happened in the final over of a T20 World Cup clash. It was considered as the team effort with a catch, bowled and two runouts.|$|E

25|$|Rivière quickly {{passed the}} blame for his fall and his broken back on the team {{mechanic}}, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> heavy dose of the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret. Rivière later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record, and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.|$|E
25|$|Ezekiel House left Owego in {{the spring}} of 1854 as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> {{contract}} to build a county court house in the suburbs of Rockford, Illinois. Henry and his brother went to Rockford in the fall and started in business with their father. In 1857 Henry took a position with his father who was superintending the raising and reconstructing of the old city hall in Chicago. While working on a building in New York, Henry had the misfortune of having the extension muscle of his right hand severed by a chisel which dropped from a scaffold. This incapacitated his doing any carpentry work for several months. During this enforced idleness, he designed and patented an automatic gate.|$|E
25|$|The mediaeval {{church had}} three altars, with an apse {{in the south}} instead of the normal eastern orientation. This unusual feature has {{triggered}} many discussions among experts, and it is suspected that the church was adapted from a previously secular building. The church was surrounded by shops and a nearby building housed the Stadtguardia, a forerunner of the modern police. The old church burned down in 1661 and was given only makeshift repairs. The decision {{to build a new}} church was taken up {{with the arrival of the}} Fraternity of the Holy Trinity of which the emperor Leopold I was a member. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> vow to rebuild this church when Vienna was ravaged by the plague in 1679-1680.|$|E

25|$|John William Woolf (November 27, 1869 – February 22, 1950) was an American-born Canadian {{politician}} {{who served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories and the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Born in Utah to polygamous parents, he moved with them to Cardston, Alberta as a young man. There he became a prominent rancher, and was elected in the 1902 Northwest Territories election. When Alberta was created in 1905, he became a member of its first legislative assembly. He resigned that office in 1912 to return to the United States; his son believed that this was because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> second wife and feared prosecution under Canadian polygamy laws. Back in Utah, he pursued a number of business ventures with his son. He died in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Asher {{entered the}} wine {{industry}} in 1950, {{at the age}} of 18, when he took a part-time job assisting a wine retailer in Shepherd Market, between Curzon Street and Piccadilly in Mayfair, Central London. Within a year <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> full-time position with a small wine distributor, and by 1952 he was engaged by Blumenthal & Co, a major wine importer. Sponsored by Blumenthal, he attended tastings and lectures held by the Wine Trade Club at the Worshipful Company of Vintners in London, and in 1953 a scholarship allowed him to spend time working and studying in Jerez, the Spanish region that produces Sherry. Further such scholarships {{over the next two years}} despatched Asher to Burgundy in eastern France, then the Rheingau wine region in West Germany.|$|E
25|$|Berkeley {{raised his}} flag aboard his old ship, HMS Swiftsure, {{and joined the}} fleet {{assembling}} for the 1665 campaign.

Reports of his actions during the battle were confused and contradictory, some accounts suggesting that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> squadron of six ships and pursued nine Dutch vessels, others stating that he had abandoned the fight {{after the death of his}} brother, Charles. Poet Andrew Marvell added a critical verse suggesting the latter view was correct in his 1666 poem 'The Second Advice to a Painter': Berkeley had heard it soon, and thought not goodTo venture more of royal Harding's blood …With his whole squadron straight away he bore,And, like good boy, promised to fight no more.|$|E
