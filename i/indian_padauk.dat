50|$|Two {{theories}} {{exist for}} that obvious change in production: quick-grown wood (therefore not giving {{the time for}} the wood to age naturally and achieve the full density that padauk would naturally acquire over time) or a change in the wood species (African padauk for the first models, <b>Indian</b> <b>padauk</b> for the later ones). Another reason for the difference in color is the oxidation of the reddish pigments in padouk wood by UV light over time. All padauk darkens with age from a red/orange to a deep purplish brown, and the time between runs likely contributes to the differentiation in color.|$|E

5000|$|Chapman Sticks {{have been}} made from many materials. The first were made from hardwoods, most from ironwood, but some from ebony and other exotic woods, through the early 1980s. The next group was made from an injection-molded {{polycarbonate}} resin through 1989. These were followed by one-piece hardwood structures with an adjustable truss rod, {{and for a time}} from 2001 to mid-to-late 2000s (although not currently available) the [...] "Stick XG" [...] (Extended Graphite) made of structural graphite, continuous strand carbon fiber sub-manufactured by Moses, Inc. of Eugene, OR (builder of electric guitar, electric bass, acoustic guitar original, replacement necks and replacement parts for modern electric as well as [...] "classical" [...] stringed instruments from graphite). Today, they are made from laminated hardwoods (including <b>padauk,</b> <b>Indian</b> rosewood, tarara, maple, wenge and mahogany), and laminated bamboo, as well as graphite.|$|R
