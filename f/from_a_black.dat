5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Carr Hill has an {{approximate}} population of 3,200– 53% {{of the population}} are female, slightly above the national average, whilst 47% are male. Only 1.4% of the population are <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> or other minority ethnic group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. Relatively few pensioners live in the suburb, 12.2% as compared to 15.9% nationally and 17.3% in the borough.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Felling has a {{population}} of 7,299—51.5% of the population are female, slightly above the national average, while 48.5% are male. Only 2.3% of the population were <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> or other minority ethnic group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. The average life expectancy is 71 years for men in Felling and 75 years for women. These compare unfavourably to borough averages of 76 and 81 years respectively.|$|E

5|$|Observations of {{gravitational}} waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. They {{are expected to}} yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes {{in the very early}} universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole merger.|$|E

5|$|A bite <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> mamba causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular {{symptoms that}} may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, {{which may be}} accompanied by a triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the United States Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP) {{conducted}} the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) on September 19, 2009, using exhaust particles <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility {{to create an}} artificial noctilucent cloud. The cloud was to be observed {{over a period of}} weeks or months by ground instruments and the Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) instrument on the NRL/STP STPSat-1 spacecraft. The rocket's exhaust plume was observed and reported to news organizations in the United States from New Jersey to Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Low Fell has a {{population}} of 8,643. 51% of the population are female, slightly below the national average, whilst 49% are male. Only 1% of the population are <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> or other Minority Ethnic Group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. Of the BME group in the settlement, 40% are from the Asian or AsianBritish ethnic group. Low Fell has a very low proportion of lone parent households at some 4% of all households in the settlement. This is the lowest figure in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead and compares very favourably with a Borough average of 11.5% and a national average of 9.5%. Some 26% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life indicators to indicate deprivation, does not include any part of Low Fell in any of the areas marked as deprived.|$|E

5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{battalion}} headquarters was established, the battalion's first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Cannon, began choosing his officers, {{who then}} set about {{the task of}} forming their own companies and platoons, as the unit structure was built up around four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– with a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons including signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administration and mortars. The battalion's companies were formed largely along territorial lines, with 'A' Company being drawn mainly from the Mildura and north-eastern regions of Victoria, while 'B' Company was drawn from Geelong, the Western District, Prahran, Brighton and the Mornington Peninsula. 'C' Company consisted largely of men from Ballarat and Melbourne's inner suburbs, and men of Scottish ancestry, while those of Irish ancestry formed 'D' Company. Once the battalion's complement of men had arrived at Puckapunyal and formation was complete, basic training began in May 1940. On 18 August, the battalion was presented its regimental colours in a ceremony {{by members of the}} 14th Battalion, who had served during World War I. This was done in order to establish links with the units of the First Australian Imperial Force, and later, in early October, the 2/14th Battalion changed its Unit Colour Patch <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> over blue diamond to the yellow and blue rectangle of its earlier counterpart. Shortly after this, although still only partially trained, the battalion received orders to deploy overseas, and on 18 October the men embarked upon the Aquitania in Sydney, New South Wales, bound for the Middle East.|$|E
