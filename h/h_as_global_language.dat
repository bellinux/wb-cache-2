In general, it covers materials related to the history of English Language, the impacts of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> to some fields, and the future of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> It is worth nothing that this course should be given in higher level such as in the seventh or in the eight semester. In addition, before they take this courses, they should take another course related to English as aglobal language, e,g.

40|$|The article {{addresses}} current {{debates on}} English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> and technology-driven learning processes. As Jan Blommaerts notes in Sociolinguistics of Globalization (2010), English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> exists <b>as</b> {{the interplay between}} englobalization and deglobalization, in which resources from complex local repertoires are being mobilized and deployed in meaning-making. English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> only occurs in real life {{in the form of}} dialects, varieties and interlanguages and utilizing authentic material implies dealing with such complexities. The paper will consider several learning activities in order to claim that while the critical literature on English language learning has often neglected the potential of <b>global</b> English <b>language</b> varieties, the teacher’s inclusion of <b>global</b> English <b>language</b> varieties in the ESL and EFL classroom may be considered as a strategy for meaningful learning and may also motivate students by contributing to the psychological and social security of ESL and EFL students...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems underlying the English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> vs. local languages debate is that they often adhere to the dichotomous ‘global vs. local’ vision of transnational communication, treating them as incommensurable discourses and often reviving the spectre of cultural authenticity. Yet <b>global</b> movies, such <b>as</b> Baz Luhrmann’s Australia, use the potential of transmedia and transcultural strategies to reach a global audience. T he production of such movies exploits the growing realization within the media industries that what is variously called «transmedia, multiplatform, or enhanced storytelling» represents the future of entertainment and its economic growth (Jenkins 2003; 2006). On the other side, in order to enter {{the daily lives of}} its global audience, the film production decided to exploit the power of another social good: Australian culture. T hus, as the critical applied linguistics scholar, Alistair Pennycook, notes, the literature on English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> has often failed to investigate whether English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> may be defined as a «translocal» language, a language of fluidity that moves across, while becoming embedded in, the materiality of localities and social relations. T he analysis of interlingual translations of post-colonial English language varieties, but also of their intralingual translation into global English, will provide some significant «insights» on how the materiality of globalization shapes translocal social knowledge, creates translocal audiences and contributes {{to the creation of a}} supervernacular language. Following this line of thought, the aim of the article is to claim a central space for Audiovisual Translation studies in the study of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I address the {{question}} of the influence of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> upon education, particularly e-education. In doing so I look at the fragility of language as a cultural construct, the historical background to the dominance of Eurowestern knowledge models and the questions of e-curriculum development as one of aggregation or disintegration. Utilising postcolonial theory, I also survey the effects upon indigenous languages of the emergence of the dominant British Empire over the last five centuries with particular reference to Chinua Achebe.

40|$|This article {{examines}} current business communication education in higher education, particularly {{in regard to}} English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> The discussion is situated {{at the intersection of}} business communication, intercultural communication, and internationalization of higher education, and the article draws on research from all three fields. The article questions why not enough use is being made of existing cultural diversity in university classrooms, and it suggests a variety of pedagogical strategies which will enable teachers to build on the cultural and linguistic strengths of their students to develop intercultural communication competence. These new directions for intercultural business communication will equip business graduates to operate successfully in a globalized world. This paper examines current business communication education at higher education, particularly in regard to the use of “English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> ” (Crystal, 1997).

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{distinguish}} between the following two hypotheses: (A) The Internet will remain disproportionately in English and will, over time, cause more people to learn English as second language and thus solidify the role of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> This outcome will prevail even though there are more native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English speakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the native languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power) and will not promote English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> English's "early lead" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are not native English speakers frequently access the large number of English language web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing web sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their sites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical question, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not English use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English speakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data set on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada provides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the two official languages. Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to Internet use for French-speaking Quebecois. These preliminary results are consistent with the scenario in which the Internet will promote English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> Comment: 29 th TPRC Conference, 200...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} aspects of {{analyzing}} and teaching English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> Apart {{from a few}} remarks on phonetics, lexis and morphosyntax, its specific focus are pragmalinguistic issues. After a brief state-of-the-art, analyses of both natural and experimentally elicited language data from oral and written contexts are presented. The analyses rest on both qualitative approaches (VOICE and You Tube clips) and quantitative approaches (one type of DPTs, two types of MJTs and one type of semantic differential). The studies show that quantitative analyses with experimental methods often falsify hypotheses that have suggested themselves from prior qualitative research ("let-it pass principle " among natives and non-natives) and from normative language guides ("learner-book illusion", "complex-is-polite principle", "middle slots relevance"). The article then shows how the linguistic findings from such experimental designs {{can and should be}} rendered into principles and components for Teaching English <b>as</b> a <b>Global</b> <b>Language,</b> which would require constant work-in-progress models. Concrete examples are given from Basic Global English (BGE), which aims to prepare for global citizenship by incorporating transculturally effective strategies at the elementary level...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reconsider the concept of the native speaker of English in light of the {{heightened}} status of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language.</b> The broadening and acceptance of criteria regarding who is a native speaker is historically discussed and placed in a modern context. In particular, perceptions towards the English native speaker and the relationship between language and culture were explored through a semi-structured oral interview administered to 56 respondents. Questions in the interview explored perceptions towards non-native speaker’s use of English, cultural influence on language, and intercultural communication, among other topics. Interview results show that the respondents are aware that the spread of English across the world has reshaped the notion of the native speaker and the ownership of English. Respondents also recognize the inseparable relationship between language and culture. It is suggested that instead of the term “native speaker of English ” the term “glocalized or global English speaker ” better reflects the somewhat ambiguous nature of English speakers.

40|$|Abstract: It {{is argued}} that English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> has some {{advantages}} to people around the world. One of the advantages is that English language {{is used as a}} tool of communication, empowerment and unification of people in the global community. In other words, English plays a very important role to unite all the people around the globe regardless their nationalities, cultural backgrounds, or races. However, for some scholars, English is seen as a potential threat to linguistic diversity in the world (Florey, 2010; Graddol, 1997; Tsuda, 2008; Phillipson, 2008). These scholars strongly believed that the dominant and powerful of English use in the global community has destroyed and killed most of the languages in the world. Some of the languages, as Florey claimed, become death languages. These scholars thus believed that English is responsible for the loss and death of thousands of minority native languages around the world. Instead of debating and taking side,  it {{is argued that}} non-native speakers will use their own English teaching materials with their own context culturally, English will share the role <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> with other languages e. g. Arabic, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia, Mandarin, and there will be more new and various of English (es) forms around the world.     Keywords: a <b>global</b> <b>language,</b> English, communication, linguistic diversity, transformation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the impact of the}} hegemony of English, as a common lingua franca, referred to <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language,</b> on the indigenous languages spoken in Nigeria. Since English, through the British political imperialism and because of the economic supremacy of English dominated countries, has assumed the position of a <b>global</b> <b>language,</b> the impact is felt directly on the smaller indigenous languages in the areas or societies. The situation in Nigeria {{is a case in point}} and calls for attention. One of the problems identified in globalisation is the issue of the protection of minority languages or languages which do not have international base. In Nigeria, the use of the indigenous languages is of little significance having been dominated and their functions taken over by English, even when the language policy of the country is at variance with this. The hegemony of English <b>as</b> a <b>global</b> <b>language</b> calls attention to the protection of the indigenous languages spoken therein. This study which uses a descriptive approach is based on the view expressed in the literature that in a linguistically plural world, the linguistic rights of every language should be respected. The paper concludes by advocating respect and full development of all languages as well as striking a balance between meeting the intercommunication needs of different groups of people and maintaining linguistic diversity by preserving the indigenous languages spoken in Nigeria...|$|R
