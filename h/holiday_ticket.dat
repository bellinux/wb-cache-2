However, the High Holy Days are usually peak attendance days for synagogues and temples, often filling or over-filling synagogues. For this reason many synagogues issue tickets for attendance and may charge for them: practice varies on whether paid-up synagogue members must also buy these or whether it is included in the subscription. [...] Synagogues never pass a collection plate during services as some churches do, as Jews are forbidden to touch money on the Sabbath or other holidays such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Among synagogues in the United States, donations are often sought during the Kol Nidre service, called the [...] "Kol Nidre Appeal," [...] often via a pledge card, where the amount of the donation is represented by a paper tab which can be bent down in the amount of donation desired. Rabbis and other temple representatives say that <b>holiday</b> <b>ticket</b> sales represent a significant source of revenue.|$|E
50|$|The Settlement is a camp-site {{reserved}} {{exclusively for}} festival-goers with Settlers Pass tickets. In 2009 the Green Man introduced a <b>holiday</b> <b>ticket</b> offer that gave festival-goers {{the option to}} start their festival experience early and camp in the week leading up to Green Man. This allows people attending Green Man to explore the surrounding areas of the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons and was designed {{to have a positive}} impact of local tourism. The campsite itself has a wide range of family-friendly activities, workshops and entertainment on offer as well as nightly performances by local artists. Each year the musical programme is curated by a different Welsh artist or act. For 2016, Toby Hay will curate the musical offering.|$|E

50|$|Fares for {{the entire}} state of Lower Saxony (e.g. the Niedersachsen-Ticket) also apply to the North Rhine-Westphalian {{sections}} (Bückeburg-Melle and Osnabrück-Rheine). However, these tickets cannot be used for connections via Herford (for trains towards NRW the fare limit is Löhne or Kirchlengern). The NRW-Tarif (fare) applies between Rheine and Minden for all locations except Melle, while NRW <b>holiday</b> <b>tickets</b> apply to the whole route. The Osnabrück-Bünde section does not belong to the zones of any local fare system and so ordinary Deutsche Bahn fares apply. GVH fares apply for season tickets from Bückeburg.|$|R
5000|$|All tickets to/from Manhattan (Grand Central Terminal and Harlem-125th Street) are {{distinguished}} {{as being}} peak or off-peak. Peak fares, substantially higher than off-peak, apply to trains that arrive in Grand Central between 5 AM and 10 AM and leave between 5:30 AM and 9 AM and 4 PM and 8 PM. Trains arriving at Grand Central during the PM peak {{are not subject}} to peak fares. Off-peak fares are charged all other times including weekends and <b>holidays.</b> <b>Tickets</b> for travel outside Manhattan are called [...] "intermediate" [...] tickets and the peak/off-peak rules do not apply.|$|R

50|$|A travel agency's main {{function}} is {{to act as an}} agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. Consequently, unlike other retail businesses, they do not keep a stock in hand, unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms and/or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or a group event. A package <b>holiday</b> or a <b>ticket</b> is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests that purchase. The <b>holiday</b> or <b>ticket</b> is supplied to the agency at a discount. The profit is therefore the difference between the advertised price which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it is supplied to the agent. This is known as the commission. In many countries, all individuals or companies that sell tickets are required to be licensed as a travel agent.|$|R
50|$|Commuter trains {{come into}} Stamford from all points between New London {{to the east}} and New York (Grand Central Terminal) to the south. Many express ({{non-stop}}) trains leave Stamford each morning and evening for Grand Central. The average non-stop commute is forty-seven minutes. Stamford has seen a significant increase in ridership. Much of this increase is a result of reverse commuting, individuals commuting from New York City to Stamford for work. Trains operate from the Stamford station between 4:43 AM (first departure to Grand Central) until 12:55 AM (last departure to Grand Central). On the weekends the first departure for Grand Central occurs at 5:03 AM. Fares during rush hour (on peak) are higher than during non-rush hour (off peak). On peak fares are charged between 4:43 AM - 9:10 AM for trains originating to Grand Central. Trains in transit to Stamford are charged on peak fares from 5:35 AM - 8:37 AM and from 4:02 PM - 7:40 PM. On peak fares do not apply on weekends and/or <b>holidays.</b> <b>Tickets</b> can be bought on board, yet the surcharge can make the price steep.|$|R
