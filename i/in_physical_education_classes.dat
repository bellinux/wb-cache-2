25|$|The {{education}} of boys began {{in their own}} home up until the age of seven when they had to attend school. There, they had several teachers who taught them to read and write, as well as subjects such as mathematics and music. Boys also had to take part <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> where they were prepared for future military service with activities such as wrestling, racing, jumping and gymnastics. At eighteen they served in the army and were instructed on how to bear arms. Physical education was very intense and many of the boys ended up becoming true athletes. In addition to these compulsory lessons, the students had the chance to discuss and learn from the great philosophers, grammarians and orators of the time. Some poor people had to stay at home and help their parents. However Aristophanes and Socrates, though they were poor, became famous and successful.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the effect of {{experience}} <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> on the degree of fan about <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> and participation <b>in</b> sport. In order to determine these assignments, questionnaire was administered to two hundred and fifth-six male and female college students. First, the scale of experience <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> for each term (elementary school, junior high school and high school). As a result of factor analysis, three main factors were extracted respectively; “Pleasure”, “Activity frustration”, “Interpersonal frustration”. These scales include 25 - 27 items and α-coefficients were enough high to support the high reliability of each factor. Second, the results of analyses of variance on the degree of fan about <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> the scale of experience <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> for each term revealed that the subjects who answered Like showed higher in “Pleasure”, the subjects who answered Dislike showed higher in “Activity frustration” and “Interpersonal frustration”.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a valid and reliable scaling tool to scale attitudes of parents towards participation of their children <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class.</b> Positive attitudes of parents towards participation of their children <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> is of significant importance in providing children with the habit of doing sports and passing on the sports culture to new generations. Therefore, in consideration with the fact that it is particularly necessary to determine the factors affecting attitudes, a study was carried out to develop and make available “a Parents Attitude Scale concerning Participation of Their Children <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Class.</b> ” 186 parents, namely 107 mothers and 79 fathers, whose children attend 6 th, 7 th and 8 th grades, participated into the study. In the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in order to check validity of scale; it was determined that the scale is a 4 -factor scale and the number of items was fixed to 21. Item load values are between 0. 691 - 0. 804 for Factor I, 0. 543 - 0. 768 for Factor II, 0. 557 - 0. 806 for Factor III and 0. 586 - 0. 801 for Factor IV. In order to test reliability of the scale, Cronbach Alpha reliability and two-halves test correlation (Spearman Brown) coefficients were checked and the said values were found as 0, 90 and 0, 76 respectively. As a conclusion; it was determined in the outcome of the study of validity and reliability that the scale prepared for scaling attitudes of parents towards participation of their children <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> is a practicable scaling tool...|$|R

Results showed that gender did not reach significance in sports enjoyment and learning satisfaction. Different grade levels reached significance in sport enjoyment but not in learning satisfaction. Population variable did not reach significance in the prediction of learning satisfaction. However, competition process, sports ability, and social support of sports enjoyment reached significance in the prediction of learning satisfaction. <b>Physical</b> <b>education</b> teachers can adjust teaching strategies to enhance the sports enjoyment and learning satisfaction of students. We suggest future researchers to add physical fitness, parental support, exercise time, and other variables to explore in more detail...|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} work of French et al. (1996 b), whose {{research}} contained many important and crucial badminton parameters of game play, limited research has been conducted in terms of badminton game play, practitioner or teacher’s beliefs and perceptions concerning non-linear pedagogy, including for example an approach that partners TGfU with a constraints led approach, compared to a linear pedagogical skill led approach. Stolz and Pill (2014) pointed out this schism when they reported that many different opinions existed amongst teachers-as-practitioners when compared to the claims made by academics. Even though the TGfU model has become a prominent and prevalent feature within research, its impact within the practices of teaching games <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> has yet to be fully explored, especially in relation to implementing tactical game teaching, which seems to be a very challenging proposition (Pearson et al. 2005; Rink et al. 1996). Consequently according to Pearson et al. (2005) linear pedagogy, or skill-led, or the technical models of teaching still dominate teaching games <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class.</b>|$|R

High school students (N = 636) enrolled <b>in</b> compulsory <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> completed questionnaires assessing each of these variables. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated the questionnaire items were adequate indicators of the five constructs. Structural equation modeling with diagonally weighted least squares estimation supported the hypothesized model. The results suggest that continued use {{of knowledge and skills}} learned <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> might hinge on teachers making <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> appealing to students and communicating how class content connects with students’ personal interests...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to make clear the {{structure}} of teacher behaviors <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> junior high schools and to examine the effect of the subject matter on those behaviors. The subjects were 29 <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> instructed by 29 teachers in junior high schools. The teacher behaviors in those classes were observed by the systematic observation instrumentation. Main findings were as follows. 1) Major teacher behaviors <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> <b>in</b> junior high schools were management, instruction, monitoring, interaction. Though Siedentop, D reported 3 behaviors excluding interaction as the major behaviors, we could recognize that interaction behavior took the same rate as other behaviors. 2) There were significant differences between junior high school teacher's behavior and elementaly school teacher's behavior. Especially, the amount of time spent for management and corrective feedback of junior high school teacher's behavior were more than elementaly school teacher's behavior. But the amount of time spent for question, acceptance and positive feedback of junior high school teacher's behavior were lower than elementary school teacher's behavior. 3) The result of teacher's behavior was affected by subject matters.
