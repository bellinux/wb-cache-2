5|$|Taylor {{considers}} 4...Nxe5 inferior, recommending {{instead a}} rarely played idea of Richard Réti, 4...h5! (Taylor's <b>exclamation</b> <b>point).</b> Then 5.Nf3 would allow 5...Bc5, while Taylor suggests meeting 5.Be2 with 5...Nc6! and 5.f4 with 5...Bc5 with quick development compensating {{for the lost}} pawn. He considers the main line to be 4...h5 5.h3 Nxe5 6.Be3 Bb4+, with good play for Black.|$|E
5|$|Boxes play a {{prominent}} role in Crash Bandicoot: Warped and can be broken with all of Crash's techniques. Boxes contain helpful items or can augment Crash's mobility. Check Point boxes allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life. TNT Boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact. All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green-colored box with an <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> (!) on it is touched; contact with this box is necessary in obtaining the level's Gem, as Nitro Boxes count towards the total number of boxes broken in the level.|$|E
25|$|In unified {{international}} braille, {{the braille}} pattern dots-235 {{is used to}} represent an <b>exclamation</b> <b>point,</b> other punctuation, and otherwise assigned as needed.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the players}} start making good choices {{when faced with}} {{difficult}} decisions, however, a few moves may receive <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> from annotators. Typical moves receiving <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> are strong opening novelties, well-timed breakthroughs, sound sacrifices, and moves that avoid falling into traps.|$|R
50|$|Elaine's {{exchange}} with Lippman {{regarding the use}} of <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> is a reference to an earlier episode in which Elaine and Lippman had a related dispute while working at Pendant Publishing. In the earlier dispute, Lippman was against the use of <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> and Elaine was for it.|$|R
50|$|Repeated symbols {{used for}} ranking date to Mariana Starke's 1820 guidebook, which used <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> to {{indicate}} {{works of art}} of special value:...I have endeavoured... to furnish Travellers with correct lists of the objects best worth notice...; {{at the same time}} marking, with one or more <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> (according to their merit), those works which are deemed peculiarly excellent.Murray's Handbooks for Travellers and then the Baedeker Guides (starting in 1844) borrowed this system, using stars instead of <b>exclamation</b> <b>points,</b> first for points of interest, and later for hotels.|$|R
25|$|Comic book writer Elliot S! Maggin once accidentally {{signed his}} name with an exclamation {{due to the}} habit of using them when writing comic scripts; it became his {{professional}} name from then on. Similarly, comic artist Scott Shaw! has used the <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> after his name throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|Some comic books, {{especially}} superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> {{instead of}} the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or {{they do not know}} what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.|$|E
25|$|Many of the fonts {{listed here}} came in several sub-varieties. For example, {{in the early}} years of the Selectric, typists were used to using the lower-case L for the numeral 1, as many {{previous}} typewriters lacked a dedicated numeral 1 key. The Selectric had a dedicated key for 1/!, but this was also marked , as many of the early elements had square brackets in these positions. Using such an element required the typist to continue the old convention. Later elements tended to have the dedicated numeral 1 and <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> characters instead. Some moved the square brackets to the positions formerly occupied by the 1/4 and 1/2 fractions, while others lost them completely. Some put a degree symbol in place of the <b>exclamation</b> <b>point.</b> IBM would furthermore customize any element for a fee, so literally endless variations were possible. Such customized elements were identified by a gray plastic flip-up clip instead of a black one.|$|E
50|$|A few {{writers have}} used {{three or more}} <b>exclamation</b> <b>points</b> ("!!!") for an {{exceptionally}} brilliant move. For example, in Rotlewi-Rubinstein 1907, Hans Kmoch awarded Rubinstein's 22...Rxc3 three <b>exclamation</b> <b>points.</b> Likewise, an exceptionally bad blunder may be awarded three or more question marks ("???"). The general consensus among chess writers is that these symbols are unnecessary.|$|R

25|$|Georgia {{clinched}} the SEC Championship on November 15 by taking out Auburn on the road, 31–21. Walker {{did most of}} the work by rushing 27 times for 84 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown. Two weeks later, Walker ended the regular season with an <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> by scoring on touchdown runs of 1, 23, and 65 yards as Georgia defeated in-state rival Georgia Tech, 38–20. Walker rushed 25 times for 205 yards against the Ramblin' Wreck.|$|E
25|$|DA! and Lorna Donley were {{featured}} in You Weren’t There, a 2007 {{film about the}} Chicago punk scene from 1977-1984. In 2010, Factory 25 Records released <b>Exclamation</b> <b>Point,</b> a vinyl LP compiling the band's previously released and unreleased material. DA! played two Chicago shows in 2010 to support the LP, the first show with Furem on drums, the second with new drummer Jason Batchko. Their reunion concert at the Abbey Pub was documented in Robert Beshara's DA! Concert Film (2012), which was screened at the Chicago International Movies and Music Festival.|$|E
25|$|High {{school friends}} Greg Watkins and Chuck Creekmur founded the website in 1998. Watkins and Creekmur {{grew up in}} Newark, Delaware. In 1997, Watkins {{registered}} the allhiphop.com domain to promote the artists on Oblique Recordings, a small record label he operated. The website provided music downloads to promote the label's artists. After reaching 30,000 downloads a month, Watkins struck deals with eMusic and other retailers to sell downloads. His friend Creekmur, a freelance journalist, had launched a website, tantrum-online.com, in New York City. After merging the companies, they adapted Trantrum's <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> logo for AllHipHop. By 2003, the business generated enough revenue for Watkins to quit his job {{and work on the}} website full-time. Creekmur did the same next year. In 2007, the revenue exceeded US$4 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{team found}} further {{success in the}} Tour's last two days. Martin made it two time trial wins in Grenoble for the season, taking a strong win in stage 20. Other than Tour {{champion}} Cadel Evans, who finished just seven seconds off Martin's pace, no other rider finished within a minute of his time. This left only the Champs-Élysées stage still to race. In the 2010 Tour de France, Cavendish became the first rider ever to win on the Champs for a {{second year in a}} row, so a third win would further extend that record. He started his sprint later than in past years, due to a headwind coming off the Place de la Concorde, but he was able to surpass Greipel and Boasson Hagen to take his fifth stage win of the Tour, putting an <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> on his successful green jersey campaign. Velits finished as the team's best-placed rider, taking 19th place overall.|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised [...] "Li'l Sebastian", and called {{it one of the}} best episodes of the season. He said Li'l Sebastian's funeral brought out the best in the characters, and that the episode [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of any show this season", and compared the Li'l Sebastian funeral to the funeral scenes in the Mary Tyler Moore Show episode [...] "Chuckles Bites the Dust". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called the episode a [...] "triumphant <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> at the end of Parks and Recreations third season", and described every moment as [...] "uproariously funny". Meslow particularly praised the twists and major character developments of the final 10 minutes, and said it demonstrates how much the show and characters have changed since the series debuted.|$|E
500|$|Crash Nitro Kart is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom race in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, brake, hop or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Nitro Kart. [...] "Item Crates" [...] are marked with a question mark (?) and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. [...] "Multiplier Crates" [...] are marked with an [...] "X" [...] and are usually found in hard-to-reach spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. [...] "Wumpa Crates" [...] are unmarked and carry [...] "Wumpa Fruit" [...] that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. [...] "Activation Crates" [...] are marked with an <b>exclamation</b> <b>point</b> (!) and don't give the player anything when they are driven through; instead, they activate either a trap that can slow down the other racers or a boost pad.|$|E

[...] With singles [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Rhythm Nation", [...] "Escapade", [...] "Alright", [...] "Come Back to Me", [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)", it became the only album in history to produce number one hits in three separate calendar years, as well as the only album to achieve seven top five singles on the Hot 100. Famous for its choreography and warehouse setting, the [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] video {{is considered one of the}} most iconic and popular in history, with Jackson's military ensemble also making her a fashion icon. The video for [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] is notable for being the first instance of Jackson's transition into sexual imagery and midriff-baring style, becoming her trademark. Rhythm Nation 1814 became the highest selling album of 1990, winning a record fifteen Billboard Awards. The long-form [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] music video won a Grammy Award.|$|E
