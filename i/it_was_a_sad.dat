5|$|For the XI Corps, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{reminder}} of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they clogged {{the streets of}} the town; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the Garlach family {{for the rest of the}} three-day battle. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, did not know where the cemetery was.|$|E

The court awarded O'Brien €150,000. The case was a landmark one as {{it was the first time}} a journalist had attempted to use the honest opinion defence. The newspaper's solicitor said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> day for freedom of expression in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldinho and Barcelona {{teammate}} Lionel Messi each captained a team {{of international}} stars in an anti-racism exhibition match in Venezuela on 28 June, which ended in a 7–7 draw. Ronaldinho finished {{with a pair of}} goals and two assists in what would be his last match as a Barcelona player. In preparation for the 2010 Joan Gamper Trophy, Ronaldinho sent an open letter to the fans and players of Barcelona, stating that his best years had been the five he spent in the Catalan club. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> moment for him and he later {{said in an interview that}} he regretted leaving without playing long enough with Messi.|$|E

25|$|The SCG {{has been}} both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst {{incidents}} to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole's international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped {{on the bottom of}} a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> end to an illustrious career.|$|E

[...] Feeling powerless to stop the latter in the Republican-controlled Congress, he said in 2007 that he had suffered from nightmares: [...] "It was my lowest point ever in my 37 years in Congress ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> period where you saw lives being lost [...] and you couldn't do anything about it." ...|$|E

500|$|The rowing {{correspondent}} for The Times suggested that [...] "for Oxford <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> day, and for Cooper a tragedy", while for Cambridge it was [...] "a splendid victory".

[...] It was the third time since the war that Oxford had lost the event {{as a result of a}} crew member collapsing mid-race.

500|$|Slovak and Kiedis became {{addicted}} to heroin {{early in their}} careers, and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family. [...] The band was generally more worried about Kiedis's addiction, which was much more open and noticeable to the other members, while Slovak according to Kiedis was [...] "much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise." [...] During the tour in support of Freaky Styley, Slovak's health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate. [...] Kiedis commented on the situation: [...] "I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force {{that allows you to}} at least defend yourself. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> moment." [...] A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovak's health contacted his brother, James, who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin.|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E

2500|$|Major Martin Lindsay, second-in-command of 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders, wrote: 'We had a {{party for}} Bob Secretan and his officers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{occasion}} for they [...] were giving up their Sherman tanks to be converted into an amphibious regiment. We had had this squadron supporting us on most of our operations since Normandy, and could not have wished for a better. They looked on themselves as being almost Gordon Highlanders'. (By contrast, 1st Gordons was supported in its next operation by a troop of Churchill tanks from 107 RAC, whose performance Lindsay described as 'The windiest and wettest imaginable').|$|E
2500|$|Yankees Manager Joe McCarthy, {{struggling}} {{to control his}} emotions, then spoke of Lou Gehrig, {{with whom he had}} a close, almost father-and-sonlike bond. After describing Gehrig as [...] "the finest example of a ballplayer, sportsman, and citizen that baseball has ever known", McCarthy could stand it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, the manager said, [...] "Lou, what else can I say except that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{day in the life of}} everybody who knew you when you came into my hotel room that day in Detroit and told me you were quitting as a ballplayer because you felt yourself a hindrance to the team. My God, man, you were never that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor Davis {{was born}} on March 20, 1987 at Western Springs, Illinois. Her passion for {{videogames}} began {{when she was a}} child, especially since her older brother often involved her in his gaming sessions. Davis started playing violin at the age of 8, while in elementary school, after being inspired by a young girl's performance of [...] "Silent Night" [...] on the violin at a school assembly. Davis was heavily bullied in middle school; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> and lonely time for her. This lasted until she started attending high school, where she met her future husband, Jarred, who shared and supported her passions and interests, which helped Davis regain her self-confidence. They married in 2011, after being best friends for 14 years. While in high school, Davis began playing video games music, and introduced this genre (especially tracks taken from Final Fantasy series) into the school's ambient. Later, Davis attended Gonzaga University, where she worked to introduce video game music to the college orchestra and quartet members. Because of her influence, some of the game music would be played at weddings and other gigs. Davis graduated from Gonzaga University with a degree in Public Relations, and a minor degree in Violin Performance.|$|E

2500|$|There was no tour in 1971–72 and in 1972 Ian Chappell's {{young team}} came {{to fight the}} England {{veterans}} of 1970–71. England won the One Day Prudential Trophy 2–1, Snow taking 3–35 at Lord's. [...] Australia lost the First Test at Old Trafford by 89 runs thanks to Snow, who took 4/41 & 4/87. They fought back at Lord's where Bob Massie's outrageous swing bowling took 16–137. However, Snow took 5/57 to peg back the Australians to a 36 run lead in the first innings, but couldn't stop Australia's first win in The Ashes for 13 Tests. At Trent Bridge in the drawn Third Test Snow dismissed Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Ross Edwards and Bob Massie with 5/92 in the first innings and Keith Stackpole, Greg Chappell and Walters with 3/94 in the second as England held out for a draw. Snow took only two wickets at Headingley as [...] "Deadly" [...] Derek Underwood spun England to an Ashes retaining victory with 10/82, {{but he was the}} second highest scorer in the England first innings, adding 104 with Ray Illingworth (57) before he was stumped for 48 and given a standing ovation by the Yorkshire crowd. With The Ashes safe England lost the Fifth Test at The Oval by 5 wickets, Snow taking only one wicket after a Lillee bouncer bruised his wrist in the first innings, leading to more accusations that he did not try in the Australian fourth innings run chase. Even so, he was easily the biggest England wicket-taker with 24 wickets (23.12). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> ending for the England team, many feeling that this was the last series in which the veteran 1970–71 team would play together as some players neared retirement, while others were unpopular with the selectors. Snow was under no illusions [...] "as long as I was taking wickets I was safe. If I missed out then I would be on the way out".|$|E
