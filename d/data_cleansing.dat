"For data {{warehouse}} and data mart applications, CoSort performs source data extraction, <b>data</b> <b>cleansing,</b> sorting, reformatting, data type conversion, aggregation, and indexing, {{all in a}} single pass. Most operational data in commercial and public sector enterprises reside internally in sequential flat files, (relational) database tables, or are imported from data tapes and transmissions generated externally. These historical databases are optimized for ad hoc queries and transactions, rather than for extraction. CoSort accepts multiple input files (large-scale tables or flat-file data dumps), or records streaming through pipes, to perform conditional selection on records for downstream processes."

50|$|The actual {{process of}} <b>data</b> <b>cleansing</b> may involve {{removing}} typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address {{that does not}} have a valid postal code) or fuzzy (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). Some <b>data</b> <b>cleansing</b> solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set. A common <b>data</b> <b>cleansing</b> practice is data enhancement, where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to that address. <b>Data</b> <b>cleansing</b> may also involve activities like, harmonization of data, and standardization of data. For example, harmonization of short codes (st, rd, etc.) to actual words (street, road, etcetera). Standardization of data is a means of changing a reference data set to a new standard, ex, use of standard codes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>cleansing</b> is {{the process}} of {{selectively}} choosing data to pass on to or reject from the feature selection process. The <b>data</b> <b>cleansing</b> process is usually based on knowledge gained by individuals directly involved with the data acquisition. As an example, an inspection of the test setup may reveal that a sensor was loosely mounted and, hence, based on the judgment of the individuals performing the measurement, this set of data or the data from that particular sensor may be selectively deleted from the feature selection process. Signal processing techniques such as filtering and re-sampling can also be thought of as <b>data</b> <b>cleansing</b> procedures.|$|E

Our findings show that, besides obvious duplicates, many erroneous data epochs were also detected by monitoring the slowly changing I 0 and Ω 0 parameters. The <b>cleansed</b> <b>data</b> shows small deviation precision errors steadily decay in the 2000 - 2016 period, as expected. Also the number of large errors show a decaying nature. Many large errors occur frequently in first operation period of new satellite vehicles, especially the new Block IIF, but these happened also to show in time epochs close to periods flagged as unhealthy. Further, it is shown that ephemeris data performance is independent on Toe parameter being modulo 100 or not...|$|R

40|$|Reprints {{available}} through open access at www. westjem. org Background: Physician reimbursement laws for diagnostic interpretive services require that only those services provided contemporaneously and /or contribute directly to patient care can be billed for. Despite these regulations, cardiologists and radiologists in many hospitals continue to bill for ECG and plain film diagnostic services {{performed in the}} emergency department (ED). The reimbursement value of this care, which is disconnected in time and place from the ED patient encounter, is unknown. In a California community ED with a 32, 000 annual census, the emergency physicians (EPs) alone, by contract, bill for all ECG readings and plain film interpretations when the radiologists are not available to provide contemporaneous readings. Objectives: To determine {{the impact of this}} billing practice on actual EP reimbursement we undertook an analysis that allows calculation of physician reimbursement from billing data. Methods: An IRB-approved analysis of 12 months of billing <b>data</b> <b>cleansed</b> of all patient identifiers was undertaken for 2003. From the data we created a descriptive study with itemized breakdown of reimbursement for radiograph and ECG interpretive services (procedures) and the gross resultant physician income...|$|R

Every year, floods affecting biodiversity on this region and also causing property loss of this residential area. The residents in Dungun always suffered from floods since the water overflows to the areas adjoining to the rivers, lakes or dams. The rainfall and evaporation of the area have a large influence on the water level of Dungun River. Therefore, a suitable prediction model is needed to forecast the water level in Dungun River by adopting the ordinary linear regression (OLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) based on hydrological data. However, we need to perform <b>cleansing</b> <b>data</b> of the hydrological data since the original data contain inconsistent data.
