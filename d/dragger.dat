25|$|A fishing trawler, {{also known}} as a <b>dragger,</b> is a {{commercial}} fishing vessel designed to operate fishing trawls. Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along {{the bottom of the sea}} or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).|$|E

In 1927, several Scandinavian fisherman united to form the Independent Fishery. During this period, gillnetting declined in popularity, but it would later gain a comeback in the 1950s. Also in the 1950s, <b>dragger</b> fishing was ended and tilefishing began.|$|E

Florence is the only working <b>dragger</b> in a museum collection. Florence is now used to carry students to collect marine biology specimens from Fishers Island Sound.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>draggers</b> {{was found}} to be {{extremely}} detrimental to the cod population in several ways. Not only did it decimate the number of adult cod, but it wreaked havoc on their reproduction. While spawning, cod are extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Their eggs are often dispersed due to the <b>draggers.</b> The <b>draggers</b> also emit a chemical that is thought to negatively affect the embryogenic development of the cod. Finally, the <b>draggers</b> destroy the habitat of the cod, other fish and crustaceans.|$|R

It does not tend to bounce. Unlike most tail <b>draggers,</b> slow speed three point landings are quite difficult because {{there is not enough}} elevator authority to bring the tail down to the correct three point attitude. This means that the tail needs to be brought down sharply at just the right speed in order for the angular momentum to carry it down sufficiently.|$|R

5000|$|... "Make and Break Harbour" [...] {{is about}} the dying of fishing traditions and the {{importance}} of the two-stroke [...] one-piston inboard engines (known as the Make and Break engine or the [...] "one-lunger") that Atlantic Canadian fishing communities used. The one-piston style engine was an important piece of technology featured on inboard motors for small fishing vessels that dot the Atlantic Canadian coastline. These engines served {{an important role in the}} history of the Atlantic fisheries. Throughout the song Rogers talks of the dying traditions associated within those small communities. With lines such as [...] "And the young folk don't stay with the fisherman's way/Long ago they all moved to the cities" [...] and [...] "Now I can see the big <b>draggers</b> that stirred up the bay/Leaving lobster traps smashed on the bottom/And they think it don't pay to respect the old ways/That make and break men have not forgotten", Rogers cites some of the reasons for the loss of tradition.|$|R
40|$|The local fish {{harvesters}} of the Port au Port area {{noticed an}} increase in the number of dead/empty scallops (also known as ‘clappers’) in the Fall of 2012. By 2013 almost all of the scallops in the area were clappers. For example, in one catch, 160 of 176 scallops were clappers (Gale, 2014). This problem has been limited to the Port au Port area including Fox Island, Shag Island, and Long Point and Shoal Point areas (Hillier, 2014). However, clappers are not a problem in nearby St. George (Fig. 1 a). Scallops have been tested and determined to be free of disease. However, testing has not been performed to determine if organic or inorganic contamination could have been the cause in the collapse of the scallops’ fishery in the Port-au-Port area in 2013. In the Port au Port area alone there are typically 12 to 15 scallop <b>draggers</b> from July to December, and it is estimated that the lost of the scallops in this area will cost these individuals 25...|$|R
