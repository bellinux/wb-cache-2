40|$|Modern {{consumer}} culture {{is dominated by}} two ideals [...] the body perfect and the material good life. Mass media is replete with depictions of these two ideals (Dittmar, 2008), often portrayed in conjunction (Ashikali 2 ̆ 6 Dittmar, 2012). Only in recent years, the role of these two cultural ideals 2 ̆ 7 influence on individuals has been explored. For example, {{it was found that}} internalization (i. e., cognitively buying into the belief) of the body perfect and the material good life ideals are detrimental to individuals 2 ̆ 7 well-being. For example, Gudnadottir and Gardarsdottir (2014) found a positive relationship between internalization of the two cultural ideals and <b>disturbing</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> behavior (e. g., excessive dieting) among Icelandic males and females. Therefore, the present study explored the influence of the body perfect and material good life ideals on consumption behaviors [...] specifically, fashion consumption behaviors. Additionally, the study also examined potential sociocultural antecedents that may contribute to internalization of these cultural ideals among individuals. Based on literature related to body satisfaction, materialism, and fashion involvement, a hypothesized research model was proposed, consisting of 10 hypotheses. To test the model, data were collected from over 600 U. S. male and female adult participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). SEM was performed to test the hypothesized research model. In total, nine of the 10 hypotheses were supported by the collected data. Also, a pretest was conducted in order to reduce number of survey items. For the pretest, over 170 U. S. male and female adult participants were recruited via AMT. Findings from the present study revealed that the proposed hypothesized research model is valid across gender. It also revealed that parents, peers, and mass media have contributed towards cultural ideals internalization, which, in turn, influenced an individual 2 ̆ 7 s level of body satisfaction via two mediating mechanisms [...] appearance internalization and appearance comparison. Furthermore, a positive relationship between an individual 2 ̆ 7 s level of body satisfaction and fashion involvement was found. Some nuances related to gender differences were identified.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [36]- 40). This thesis {{assessed the}} effectiveness of weight training on improving the <b>body</b> <b>image</b> of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> college females. A quasi-experimental design was employed to compare the differences in <b>body</b> <b>image</b> between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> females participating in weight training and <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> females not participating in weight training following a 13 -week training period using intact classes. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if weight training is effective in improving body satisfaction of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> females. The methodology consisted of administering two <b>body</b> <b>image</b> questionnaires (<b>Body</b> Shape Questionnaire and Body Cathexis Scale) both prior to and following a 13 -week period either involving or avoiding weight training. All participants were also questioned regarding their exercise habits, more specifically, their experience with weight training. In addition, participants were pre- and posttested on both upper and lower body strength tests by determining their one-repetition maximum on the lateral pulldown and leg press. During the 13 -week period, participants took part in either a total-body weight training program supervised by one of two physical education staff or refrained from weight training completely. Statistical analysis of responses to the Body Cathexis Scale indicated that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> females who participated in weight training demonstrated greater improvements in body perception than <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> females who did not participate in weight training (weight trainers M= 150. 20, SD= 27. 88 : controls M= 136. 06, SD- 21. 50). Forty-one percent of weight training participants displayed sufficient <b>body</b> <b>image</b> improvements that they were no longer classified as being ?<b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed.</b> ? Weight trainers? <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance mean scores dropped from 106. 87 fSD= 17. 74) to 95. 29 (?D= 21. 21). Improvements were also noted in both the upper and lower body strength of the weight trainers with gains in the maximum amount of weight lifted on the lateral pulldown (M= 89. 33 lbs., SD= 15. 30) and leg press (M= 350. 67 lbs., SD= 73. 69). The results of this study suggest that weight training is an effective method of improving body satisfaction of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>disturbed</b> college females and may be useful in the treatment of this disorder.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} review is to give an {{overview}} of the current findings on various facets of body image disturbance in Binge Eating Disorder such as body dissatisfaction, overconcern with weight and shape, body-related checking and avoidance behavior, misperception of body size, and body-related cognitive bias. In addition, treatments for a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> in BED and evidence of body image disturbance in youth with binge eating are reviewed. The results show that a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> in BED is present in the form of overconcern with weight and shape. Furthermore, there are hints that body dissatisfaction, as well as body-related checking and avoidance behavior, are also impaired. Research concerning misperception of body size in BED has been neglected so far, but first findings show that individuals with BED rate their own body shape rather accurately. Furthermore, there are first hints that body-related cognitive biases are present in individuals with BED. Moreover, in children and adolescents, there are first hints that body dissatisfaction, as well as shape and weight concerns, seem to be associated with loss of control and binge eating. Treatments aimed directly at the convertibility of a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> in BED have revealed encouraging outcomes. In conclusion, body image disturbance seems to occur in BED, and first studies show that it can be treated effectively...|$|E

The researchers surveyed {{a convenience sample of}} 208 adolescent females at an ethnically diverse urban high school. Statistical analyses found that ethnicity influenced awareness of socially sanctioned standards of appearance but the effects of ethnicity varied by level of caregiver educational attainment. Ethnicity and caregiver educational attainment together accounted for variance in the internalization of these standards. Moreover, African American girls with ethnically heterogeneous peer groups had significantly higher awareness and internalization scores than those without mixed friends. These findings highlight the importance of multiple ecological factors in assessing risk for <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and eating disorders. Ethnicity remains an important predictor of <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> but should be treated as a dynamic, rather than a fixed risk factor.

40|$|The {{quality of}} life of burn-injured {{patients}} can be impaired physically and psychologically. Burn patients who experience facial disfigurement have psychological, social, and economic difficulties living with their appearance in addition to difficulties associated with their medical treatment. The aim of this review was to investigate, within a cognitive behavioural framework, the effect of facial disfigurement on <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and social integration in burn patients. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> is a complex concept used to express the mental image of a person's physical self. Newell offered a cognitive-behavioural model which drew on clinical studies of phobic disorders, assuming that many of the psychological difficulties in patients who have suffered a threat to their <b>body</b> <b>image</b> are mediated primarily by fear and avoidance. The model proposes two ends of a continuum for <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> image: confrontation leading to social integration, and avoidance leading to social isolation. The literature suggests that many of the confrontational and adaptive processes described in the model are likely to be important in addressing facial disfigurement issues in burn patients.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{anorexia}} nervosa is characterized by a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> The video distortion method {{is one of the many}} methods to systematically study the perceptual aspect of this body image.

The reliability of this method has been assessed in a study involving 67 anorexic patients and 105 female university students. Test-retest results within the same session and over a one-week interval were sufficiently constant. Nonetheless, for both anorexics and controls, significant differences were found between estimates with a narrowed (thin) image initially and those with a widened (fat) image initially.

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationships between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> evaluation, and specific coping factors based on the WEIGHTCOPE measure. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility was also examined as a mediator {{of the relationship between}} <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction and weight-related coping factors in women. Methods: An online link of the survey (Qualtrics Research Software Program) was distributed through social media and word of mouth to women of all body shapes and sizes (N= 267). The survey included the BICS as a measure of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction, the MBSR (AE) as a measure of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> evaluation, the BI-AAQ as a measure of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility, and the WEIGHTCOPE as a measure of weight-related coping. Findings: Results supported that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction had significant relationships with particular coping factors as well as <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility. Once determining these relationships, the mediation analysis supported the idea that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility had a role in the relationships between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction and suggested negative weight related coping responses. Conclusions: The findings suggest the need to integrate interventions based on <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility.

40|$|The aetiology, {{assessment}} {{and treatment of}} anorexia nervosa are reviewed {{in the light of}} the classical accounts of Morton, Lasègue and Gull. The core symptoms are deliberate weight loss, <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and amenorrhoea, and complications may include cardiac failure, electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia and osteoporosis. Common clinical findings are described. Disturbed brain serotonin activity is implicated in the aetiology of anorexia nervosa, but there is little support for the use of pharmacological treatments. Psychological theories of aetiology are discussed with reference to Bruch, Crisp, Palazzoli and Minuchin: the common theme is the reaction of the patient and her family to the physical and social changes of puberty. Individual and/or family psychotherapy is seen as central to the treatment of anorexia nervosa, and the relevant clinical research is reviewed.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out whether in bulimia nervosa the perceptual {{component}} of a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> is restricted to the overestimation of one’s own body dimensions (static body image) or can be extended to a misperception of one’s own motion patterns (dynamic body image). Method: Participants with bulimia nervosa (n 30) and normal controls (n 55) estimated their body dimensions by means of a photo distortion technique and their walking patterns using a biological motion distortion device. Results: Not only did participants with bulimia nervosa overestimate their own body dimensions, but also they perceived their own motion patterns corresponding to a higher BMI than did controls. Static body image was correlated with shape/ weight concerns and drive for thinness, whereas dynamic body image was associated with social insecurity and body image avoidance. Conclusion: In bulimia nervosa, body image disturbances can be extended to a dynamic component. VC 2006 by Wile...|$|E
40|$|Body dissatisfaction pervades Western society. Men {{and women}} alike {{experience}} negative feelings about their bodies because their physical appearance is not “ideal” according to societal norms of beauty. Such negative evaluations of one’s body can exacerbate or trigger {{the development of}} <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and disordered eating behavior. According to current social-cultural theories of body dissatisfaction, exposure to Western media is a defining factor {{in the development of}} body dissatisfaction. One such theory, the Tripartite Influence Model (TIM) of body image, posits that internalization of societal ideals and social comparisons mediate the effects of the core social influences; namely, family, peer, and media, on body image distortions and body dissatisfaction. Problematic social comparison, a mediator in the TIM, may manifest as a bias in visual attention in which one visually compares one’s own body to the ideal body type that is glamorized in Western media. Further, to the extent that social influences promote the idealization of “thin ” or “muscular ” body types, individuals should hold positive evaluations (implicit attitudes) of such body types during social comparison. ii...|$|E

This study examined the impact of music videos on female undergraduate body satisfaction and mood and a possible alternate route to stabilize <b>body</b> <b>image</b> levels. Undergraduate students (n= 107; 89 females) watched two music videos which varied on the type of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> displayed.

Participants then completed a questionnaire measuring current mood and body satisfaction levels and the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Attractiveness Questionnaire (SATAQ). Participants in condition 2 showed significantly higher scores on confidence, physical satisfaction, and body satisfaction than participants in the first and third condition regardless of SATAQ scores.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN), {{which is}} the most serious of the eating disorders, starts earlier in life and often {{continues}} into adulthood. AIM: To discuss the typical features of AN in adolescents. METHOD: We present an overview based on the literature about AN in adolescents and on analysis performed by experts. RESULTS: Youngsters with AN run considerable physical risks because their bodies are less well developed and are more easily injured. These injuries can be a lifelong handicap if the patient's body weight does not rapidly return to normal. However, if the body weight recovers satisfactory, this can point to the possibility of a full psychological recovery. The best route to recovery is to start dining again with the family, {{to go back to school}} and to participate in social activities. So far, no other types of treatment have proved to be entirely successful. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed into matters such as an ideal weight for the patient and the best ways of increasing his or her food-intake. We need to find out how best to deal with a patient's <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and how to treat any comorbid disease that often accompanies AN...|$|E

The purpose of this research was to investigate Body Mass Index (BMI) and perceived <b>body</b> <b>image</b> among male and female adolescents, and to investigate if nutrition education lessons regarding healthy lifestyles can influence <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> Six preadolescent children’s weight and height were measured using a stadiometer in order to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m 2) and assess BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese). An evaluation of children’s personal <b>body</b> <b>image</b> using the Gardner 13 -figure schematic contour scale and the CDC 13 -item <b>body</b> <b>image</b> questionnaire was used before and after nutrition education lessons were presented.

40|$|Background: Negative <b>body</b> <b>image</b> is a {{risk factor}} for {{development}} and relapse in eating disorders (ED). Many patients continue to be dissatisfied with their body shape or weight after treatment. This study presents a qualitative analysis of written reflections on <b>body</b> <b>image</b> from patients with an ED and a negative <b>body</b> <b>image</b> before and after an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy group treatment at a specialized ED-unit. Method: Before and after the treatment participants (n = 47) answered a questionnaire with open ended questions on their thoughts on <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> Data were analyzed through conventional content analysis. Results: <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> meant different things for different participants. For some {{it had to do with}} how you evaluate your body, whereas others focused on whether their <b>body</b> <b>image</b> was realistic or not. Some emphasized their relationship with their body, while some described <b>body</b> <b>image</b> as strongly related to global self-esteem. These different views on the concept of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> affected the participants' descriptions of their own <b>body</b> <b>image,</b> and how they wanted it to change. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> was considered a state that fluctuated from day to day.

40|$|Introduction: Being {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer is devastating for women because they face a sense of loss. Since this loss is observed by the women themselves as well as by those around them, this can often lead to depression. Objectives: (1) To verify a possible association between body image and depression; (2) To establish a relation between depression and time since breast cancer diagnosis. Method: The data came from the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Body Image Scale (BIS), which were used to evaluate the subjects. A random sample of n= 120 women was divided into two groups. The women in Group 1 had been recently {{diagnosed with}} breast cancer, but had not at that time had any type of surgical treatment. The women in Group 2 had undergone a mastectomy over a year ago. Results: The women in Group 1 were found to be more severely depressed, and a statistically significant association was detected between depression and body image (p 0. 05). Conclusions: The women in Group 1, the majority of whom were suffering from severe depression, had a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> even though they had not had a mastectomy. The women in Group 2, who had been operated, also suffered from similar body image problems, but their depression was not as intense...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{qualitative}} {{research of the}} case study type, this article aims at establishing Nursing Diagnosis (ND`s) of patients with colorectal neoplasia undergoing chemotherapy treatment considering their altered basic human needs. The project {{was approved by the}} Research and Post-Graduation Group of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) (project number 07 - 001). The study analyzed 11 subjects starting ambulatory chemotherapy treatment in the Ambulatory Chemotherapy Unit of HCPA. Out of 23 established ND`s, 15 were related to physiological needs, 6 to alterations in protection and safety needs and 2, related to alterations in esteem needs. The collected data led {{to the conclusion that the}} most prevalent ND`s are connected with physiological needs, namely: Infection Risk; Sleep Disturbance Pattern; Unbalanced Nutrition: below the body needs; Damaged Tissue Integrity; and, High Risk for Damaged Tissue Integrity. Regarding alterations in protection and safety needs, Anxiety ND was the most prevalent one. At last, the ND`s established from esteem needs were: <b>Disturbed</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Image</b> and Impotence. According to the obtained results, it is possible to reaffirm the importance of the ND as a tool in the nursing care because it can interfere in an efficient, individual and proper way for each kind of problem experience by the patien...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the nature of body image and body change strategies, {{as well as the}} sociocultural influences on these variables, among a group of 1, 266 adolescents (622 males, 644 females). In particular, it investigated weight gain and increased muscle, as well as weight loss. It was found that females were less satisfied with their bodies and were more likely to adopt strategies to lose weight, whereas males were more likely to adopt strategies to increase weight and muscle tone. Respondents with higher body mass index (BMI) evidenced greater body dissatisfaction and more weight loss strategies, but there were no differences between BMI groups in weight gain or strategies to increase muscles. Weight gain and strategies to increase muscles {{were more likely to be}} undertaken by older adolescents, but there were no grade level differences in weight loss. Media influences to alter weight, as well as feedback from mother, father, and both male and female peers, were greater for females. There were few grade level or BMI differences in regard to any of the sociocultural influences. The importance of these findings in terms of providing a better understanding of factors which may lead to a <b>disturbed</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and body change disorders, particularly among adolescent boys, is discussed. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objective: Cultural {{diversity}} in <b>body</b> <b>image</b> {{has been studied}} elsewhere. In this study, we extend previous research by inclusion of (1) multiple ethnic groups for comparison and (2) measures {{for the assessment of}} multiple dimensions of <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> Method: Participants were college students who self-identified as African, Asian, Caucasian, or Hispanic-American. Quantitative measures of weight-related <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and general appearance <b>body</b> <b>image</b> were included. General <b>body</b> <b>image</b> was also assessed qualitatively. Results: Caucasian and Hispanic-Americans showed more weight-related <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance than African-Americans and Asian-Americans. African-Americans had the most positive general appearance <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> Ethnic groups were generally similar in their ideal <b>body</b> <b>image</b> traits but some differences occurred for the valuing of skin color and breast size. Discussion: This study highlights the importance of studying multiple ethnic groups with multiple measures, rather than simply comparing non-Caucasians to Caucasians on weight-related bod...|$|R
40|$|While {{research}} suggests {{positive effects of}} massage on psychological health, {{little is known about}} the effects of massage on <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of massage on <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and to examine relationships between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and attitudes toward massage. Twenty-one female college students aged 18 to 67 (M= 25. 2, SD= 13. 20) were randomly assigned to either a massage or control condition. Participants completed questionnaires measuring <b>body</b> <b>image</b> state and trait, attitudes toward massage, and demographics. It was hypothesized that the experimental group would show greater <b>body</b> <b>image</b> change than the control group. Results showed improved <b>body</b> <b>image</b> in both conditions, while large correlations were found between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and attitudes toward massage...|$|R
