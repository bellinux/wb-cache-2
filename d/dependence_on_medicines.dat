40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of obesity on Flow Volume curves of middle aged {{individuals}} with obstructive pulmonary disease. Background: Obesity and obstructive pulmonary disease quite often co-exist in the same individual seeking treatment for respiratory illness. Not many {{studies have been done}} about the impact of obesity on dynamic respiratory mechanics in patients with obstructive lung disease in South India. Materials & Methods: This is a retrospective cross sectional study where data was collected from the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, JSS hospital, Mysore. 120 normotensive non diabetic subjects in the age group of 40 - 60 years, were divided into four groups based on their BMI and the presence of obstructive findings. Flow Volume loop, FEV 1, FVC and FEV 1 / FVC were recorded using computerised spirometer. Results: The measured FEV 1 /FVC % in obese patients with obstructive findings was significantly lower than in normal BMI patients with obstructive findings. Obese individuals without obstructive findings also showed significantly lower measured FEV 1 /FVC % than normal BMI individuals without obstructive findings. Conclusion: Obese individuals have more obstruction when compared to even normal BMI individuals with symptoms. As the changes in respiratory mechanics due to obesity are almost completely reversible, early intervention in obese patients with COPD will ensure lower <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>medicines</b> to manage the respiratory condition...|$|E

40|$|Although {{academic}} {{writing about}} risk as a conceptual and theoretical category has burgeoned in recent years, {{debates about the}} characteristics of the risk society have tended to by-pass more mundane but ubiquitous dimensions of health and health-related behaviour. In this article, we argue that focusing on lay people’s understanding of the risks of a relatively commonplace example of modern medical technology (the use of non-prescription medicines for the self-medication of minor ailments) provides an insight and a challenge to what theorists of the risk society have described as the existential contours of life in late modernity. In the context of an empirical study detailing consumer responses to a naturally occurring risk, we explore some of the arguments proposed by Ulrich Beck and amplified by Anthony Giddens concerning {{the characteristics of the}} risk society. We provide evidence both for and against the propositions described by these authors and posit a more nuanced understanding of the risks of scientific medicine which acknowledges both lay expertise over medicines usage coupled with <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>medicine</b> and medical technology as forms of healing...|$|R

The second reflects a <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>medicine</b> to provide a quick fix for social as well as physical ills.

The effects of time pressures changing gender roles, and lack of health insurance are considered in particular.

The narratives women tell about self-medication efforts are integral to their strategies for survival because they enable women to transform situations of "making do" into esteem-building episodes.

50|$|Medicine {{flourished in}} the period of the Joseon. In 1433, the Hyangyak Jipseongbang (향약집성방) was {{completed}} and included 703 Korean native medicines, providing an impetus to break away from <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> Chinese <b>medicine.</b> The medical encyclopaedia named Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions (醫方類聚, 의방유취), written by Kim Ye-mong (金禮蒙, 김예몽) and other Korean official doctors from 1443 to 1445, was {{regarded as one of the}} greatest medical texts of the 15th century. It included more than 50,000 prescriptions and incorporated 153 different Korean and Chinese texts, including the Concise Prescriptions of Royal Doctors (御醫撮要方, 어의촬요방) which was written by Choi Chong-jun (崔宗峻, 최종준) in 1226. Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions has very important research value, because it keeps the contents of many ancient Chinese medical books that had been lost for a long time.After this, many books on medical specialties were published. There are three physicians from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) who are generally credited with the development of traditional Korean medicine — Heo Jun, Saam, and Lee Je-ma. After the Japanese invasion in 1592, Dongeui Bogam (동의보감) was written by Heo Jun, the first of the major physicians. This work further integrated the Korean and Chinese medicine of its time and was influential to Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese medicine.|$|R

Methods This study was conducted in the Community of the Wajãpi Indigenous People, a Brazilian territory located in the central western State of Amapá. Wajãpi women were selected for the interview since they have the responsibility to harvest, collect and prepare the preparations. The studied women were residents of four villages. The number of women within these four villages is 24. Results and conclusions The findings fell into the following three categories: 1) The daily use of medicinal plants by women and main methods of application. In this category, the botanical families found included Leguminosae-Caesalpinoideae, Anacardiaceae, Meliaceae, and Rubiaceae. The main forms of use found were teas, baths, maceration, in natura, and juices; 2) Through analysis of illness and treatment records, a lack of knowledge integration in the health system was shown to be due to a variety of gaps and the need of health professionals to be more aware about the local culture which they intend to work with, what could decrease the prevailing barriers between the social groups involved; 3) Traditional knowledge and possible sustainability can be fostered by stimulating the transmission of traditional knowledge from generation to generation, therefore reducing the <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> industrialized <b>medicines</b> and also by maintaining an appreciation of those practices among youngsters, who tend to question them. </p...|$|R

The results showed that the economy and infrastructure components (access to electricity, means of education, income level, health facilities, distance from the highway, remoteness, and the fastest time toward the road) and the number of people graduating from elementary school affect the number of medicinal plant species used.

Aroids plant is one of the medicinal herbs that use by our ancestor as therapeutic remedies. This study was conducted to identify and documented the aroids species that have medicinal values. The questionnaire survey was done among the people in Machang and Kota Bharu in order to know and collected the aroids species. Based on the interview with 270 informants within the study area, information on the traditional medicinal plants was classified according to their vernacular and local names, scientific names, part of plants used and application methods. From the survey, seven medicinal aroids were documented in Machang and Kota Bharu, namely Homalomena truncata (Keladi Kemoyang), Alocasia longiloba (Keladi Candik), Alocasia macro rrhizos (Keladi Birah), Typhon/um trubelutum (Keladi Tikus), Armotphallus prainii (Keladi Sarek), Calocasia esculenta (Keladi Pinang) and A/ocasia gigantea (Keladi Gajah). The most popular aroids species used in traditional herbs is Homalomena truncata (Keladi Kemoyang). In study area, most of aroids species used in treating external wound. According to the result, most people in study area are aware the medicinal value of aroid, however they prefer to use modern medicine in curing some illness. It was also found the popularity of aroids plants with traditional uses among the people in Kota Bharu district was fading as compared to Machang districts due to lost interest of younger generations and heavy <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> modern <b>medicine.</b> Further research should be carried out in order to conserve this knowledge from being eroded by the time. ...|$|R
