50|$|During strong lodos winds, {{especially}} in December, large vessels are warned against crossing the Bosphorus Strait and at times, the strait is closed to all naval traffic due to lodos shifting charted surface currents. Vessels {{are most vulnerable}} to these shifting currents if they lack speed or experience an engine failure. {{in which case the}} only means to <b>halt</b> a <b>vessel</b> would be anchoring, but there is not enough distance at Bosphorus for such a measure, and disaster becomes inevitable.|$|R
40|$|VEGFs (vascular endothelial growth factors) are master {{regulators}} of vascular {{development and}} {{of blood and}} lymphatic vessel function during health and disease in adults. This family of five mammalian ligands acts through three RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases). In addition, co-receptors such as NRPs (neuropilins) associate with the ligand–receptor signalling complex and modulate the output. Therapeutics to block several of the VEGF signalling components as well as NRP function have been developed {{with the aim of}} <b>halting</b> blood <b>vessel</b> formation, angiogenesis, in diseases that involve tissue growth and inflammation, such as cancer. The present review outlines the current understanding of NRPs in relation to blood and lymphatic vessel biology...|$|R
5000|$|Aquila (Italian language: [...] "Eagle") was an Italian {{aircraft}} carrier converted from the trans-Atlantic passenger liner [...] during World War II. Work on Aquila began in late 1941 at the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa and continued {{for the next}} two years. With the signing of the Italian armistice on 8 September 1943, however, all work was <b>halted</b> and the <b>vessel</b> remained unfinished. Aquila was eventually scrapped in 1952.|$|R
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factors}} (VEGFs) are master {{regulators}} of vascular development and {{of blood and}} lymphatic vessel function during health and disease in the adult. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} mechanism of action of this family of five mammalian ligands, which act through three receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In addition, coreceptors like neuropilins (NRPs) and integrins associate with the ligand/receptor signaling complex and modulate the output. Therapeutics to block several of the VEGF signaling components have been developed with the aim to <b>halt</b> blood <b>vessel</b> formation, angiogenesis, in diseases that involve tissue growth and inflammation, such as cancer. In this review, we outline the current information on VEGF signal transduction in relation to blood and lymphatic vessel biology...|$|R
50|$|The US Navy {{provided}} {{support to}} the naval blockade, <b>halting</b> and searching <b>vessels</b> suspected of carrying Iranian arms to the Houthis. On 21 April, the United States announced it was deploying warships to Yemeni waters to monitor Iranian ships. The US in particular noted a convoy of Iranian vessels, which US authorities said could potentially be carrying weapons to Houthi fighters in contravention of UN sanctions. The US reported that the Iranian convoy reversed course on 23 April.|$|R
2500|$|Camosun left Troon, Scotland on February 19, 1905 {{under the}} command of Captain B.L. Johnson for {{delivery}} to British Columbia. [...] The ship initially proceeded to Kingston, Jamaica, where command was changed over to Capt. C.B. Smith. [...] The ship then proceeded around Cape Horn to the west coast of North America, where the <b>vessel</b> <b>halted</b> at San Francisco, California, for one month to caulk the decks. [...] Camosun finally arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia on June 20, 1905. [...] Repairs necessary to Camosun following the delivery voyage brought Union Steamship into litigation with the ship's builders.|$|R
5|$|Mediterranean {{trade was}} busy, and Levant {{took part in}} <b>halting</b> and {{examining}} <b>vessels</b> with crews of various nationalities including Dutch, Genoese, Spanish, and the British Caribbean. Neutral shipping was permitted to continue on its way. However Levant detained a South Carolina merchantman named Dolphin in October 1776, on suspicion of being a supply vessel for the rebels, and sent her into Gibraltar along with her cargo of rice. In November 1776 Levant secured a substantial prize with the capture of another South Carolina vessel, Argo, carrying rice and indigo worth £37,200. Argo was to have exchanged her cargo in Bordeaux for clothing and medicine to supply the American rebellion.|$|R
500|$|... was {{a planned}} {{battleship}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Designed by Yuzuru Hiraga, she was envisioned {{as the lead}} ship of the [...] of two [...] ships. The battleships would have been armed with ten [...] guns and bring Japan closer to its goal of an [...] "Eight-four" [...] fleet (eight battleships and four battlecruisers). However, after the Washington Naval Conference and {{the signing of the}} Washington Naval Treaty, all work on the ship was <b>halted.</b> With the <b>vessel</b> required to be destroyed in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the incomplete Tosa was then subjected to various tests to gauge the effect of Japanese weaponry before being scuttled on 9 February 1925.|$|R
50|$|At St. Louis, the {{regiment}} went into garrison at Benton Barracks. The Thirty-sixth {{was attached to}} the XIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee, and commenced drill by brigade and division. On 20 December 1862 they embarked by steamer for the federal garrison at Helena, Arkansas. The <b>vessel</b> <b>halted</b> at Memphis, Tennessee when the local citizens hailed it from shore with an alarming report that Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his cavalry were in the neighborhood and were preparing an attack on the city. That night the men of the 36th slept with their arms stacked nearby in Jackson Square. The regiment eventually moved to some old vacated mule-sheds and remained in Memphis performing guard duty at Fort Pickering until 1 January 1863, when it resumed its movement to Helena.|$|R
50|$|The {{disaster}} {{resulted in}} {{changes to the}} regulations pertaining to shipping movements on the Derwent River. The Marine and Safety (Pilotage and Navigation) Regulations (2007) contains specific provisions dealing with the Bridge, e.g.:"The master of a vessel approaching the Bridge to navigate it through a span must (a) have the vessel fully under control; and (b) navigate the vessel with all possible care at the minimum speed required to pass safely under the bridge".Vessels above a certain size are required to be piloted, and vehicle movements on the bridge are temporarily <b>halted</b> when large <b>vessels</b> are to pass underneath the bridge. As an added precaution, it is now mandatory for most large vessels to have a tug in attendance as they transit the bridge {{in the event that}} assistance with steerage may be required.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 February the five-day voyage upriver began. The {{transports}} and {{the baggage}} were left at Cap Saint-Jacques. The gunboat Dragonne scouted ahead, {{followed by the}} two other gunboats, the two corvettes and the Spanish despatch vessel. Three companies of marine infantry and two Spanish companies, 2,000 men in all, were distributed among the vessels which towed the launches of the naval force. The allied flotilla advanced cautiously as the currents were unknown, and anchored each night in the river. During their passage the French and Spanish <b>vessels</b> <b>halted</b> to reduced six riverside forts, and squads of engineers {{under the command of}} capitaine de génie Gallimard were put ashore to burn the wooden stockades that linked the forts. The Vietnamese defended themselves vigorously: Dragonne was hit with three cannonballs, and Avalanche by seven. The invaders took care to ensure that the river could not be closed behind them. After each fort was taken its cannon were either spiked or taken aboard the ships.|$|R
2500|$|The {{battleship}} was departing {{to escort}} two troop transports sailing for the United Kingdom when a request {{was made for}} the boom to be opened for her at 1830. Revenge began making her way towards the gate, which opened at 1826. However, before arriving at the gate, the battleship stopped inside the harbour, closer to the gate. The two troop transports had not joined up with the battleship on time and the officer in charge of gate operations did not inform the gate vessels {{of the change in}} departure time. When the ships finally did sail, the gate vessels had little time to get the gate open fully. Gate Vessel 1 reported the gate being open at 2055 and at 2056, Revenge rammed the gate vessel, rolling the trawler almost onto her side and flooding Gate Vessel 1 through her upper deck openings. The trawler, attached to the boom, bounced {{off the side of the}} battleship, which dragged the trawler and boom for roughly [...] before the battleship came to a <b>halt.</b> Gate <b>Vessel</b> 1 was abandoned as the ship settled onto the boom and sank at roughly 2125. There was no loss of life in the collision, with Revenge collecting thirteen members of the crew and Gate Vessel 2 (sister Festubert) collecting five more sailors, one of them a member of Revenges crew who had jumped overboard to save a Canadian. Revenge and her convoy sailed once ascertaining that there had been no deaths. Another Battle-class trawler, , assumed Ypres position as Gate Vessel 1. After this incident, the crews of other gate vessels would pretend to make elaborate preparations for a collision every time Revenge visited Halifax.|$|R
