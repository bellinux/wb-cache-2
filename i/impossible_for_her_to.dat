5|$|Shortly {{before her}} {{scheduled}} Missouri trial date, Kinne's Missouri counsel {{filed a motion}} to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial {{in the death of}} James Kinne, claiming that news coverage of Kinne's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> get a fair trial there.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> not love him.|$|E
25|$|None of {{the fictional}} {{accounts}} however are considering the single contemporary (yet also unreliable) source from the year 1817: Nakşidil was reportedly abducted {{when she was still}} two years old. That version of her story makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be identical with the missing Aimée.|$|E
60|$|It was {{somewhat}} remarkable that all her romantic fantasies arrived at this self-same dreary termination,--it appeared <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> even <b>to</b> imagine any {{other than a}} disastrous result from her connection with her ill-omened attendant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sylvia again," [...] said she, half laughing. [...] "Yes, she has {{returned}} to the House of Martha, and you can see for yourself that, if you continue in your present state of mind, it will be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> ever <b>to</b> go outside of the house." ...|$|R
60|$|She was silent, unsympathetic, and {{he watched}} her moodily, realizing how <b>impossible</b> it was <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{what he had been}} through.|$|R
25|$|Her seventh Japanese album, Identity was {{released}} on February 10, 2010, but only charted at No. 4, selling 37,606 copies in its first week. With little promotion from her label, it ended her run of six consecutive No. 1 albums, suggesting {{that it would be}} <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sustain her career in three territories simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Jelinek {{was criticized}} for not {{accepting}} the prize in person; instead, a video message {{was presented at the}} ceremony. Others appreciated how Jelinek revealed that she suffers from agoraphobia and social phobia, paranoid conditions that developed when she first decided to write seriously. Both conditions are anxiety disorders which can be highly disruptive to everyday functioning yet are often concealed by those affected, out of shame, or feelings of inadequacy. She has said her anxiety disorders make it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.|$|E
25|$|After the {{repertory}} {{seasons in}} 1906–08, however, {{the company did}} not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time. Carte wrote in 1911 that her health made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> produce any more revivals at the Savoy. In March 1909, Charles H. Workman assumed management of the Savoy Theatre from the now frail Helen Carte Boulter. However, she continued to manage {{the rest of the}} family businesses with the assistance of Rupert. In 1911, the company hired J. M. Gordon, who had been a member of the company under Gilbert's direction, as stage manager. Carte was also so generous that King George V granted to her the Order of the League of Mercy in 1912.|$|E
50|$|Her newly founded choirs in New York flourished {{until her}} early retirement, {{due to an}} accident, in 1936. As a return to Nazi Germany was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> she retired <b>to</b> Locarno, Switzerland, where she died in 1944.|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour approached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room. She could not have {{supposed}} it in the power of any concurrence of circumstances <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> so many painful sensations {{on the first day of}} hearing of William's promotion.|$|R
60|$|He stopped short, <b>for</b> {{something}} in <b>her</b> face perplexed him. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> of course, <b>to</b> feel disappointment to that extent, {{and yet she}} had all {{the appearance of a}} child about to cry. He felt suddenly awkward and ill at ease.|$|R
25|$|Henrietta Maria married Charles {{by proxy}} on 11 May 1625, {{shortly after his}} {{accession}} to the throne. They were then married in person at St. Augustine's Church, Canterbury, Kent, on 13 June 1625, but her Catholic religion made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be crowned {{with her husband in}} an Anglican service; Henrietta Maria proposed that the French Catholic Bishop of Mendes crown her instead, but this was unacceptable to Charles and the court. Henrietta Maria was allowed to watch Charles being crowned, at a discreet distance. In the end, her failure to be crowned went down badly with the London crowds, although England's pro-French policy gave way rapidly to a policy of supporting French Huguenot uprisings, and then a disengagement from European politics as internal problems grew.|$|E
500|$|Detective Hudak (Daniel Kamin) tells Mulder and Scully that an {{anonymous}} caller phoned 911 {{with a message}} regarding Penny Timmons, one of the killer's victims. The caller claimed that Timmons' last words were [...] "She is me." [...] Hudak notes, however, that the victim's larynx was severed, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> utter dying words. The agents trace {{the source of the}} 911 call to a payphone at the New Horizon Psychiatric Center. Mulder notices one of the patients, Harold Spuller, avoiding his gaze. After viewing photographs of the murder victims, Scully comes to the conclusion that Spuller fits the killer's profile: a compulsive person consumed with the desire to organize, clean and reorder. Scully uses a rest room to attend to a nose bleed. There she encounters the spirit of another blond girl. Moments later, Mulder tells her that the body of yet another victim was found nearby - the same girl Scully had just seen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{realizing that}} {{alcoholism}} {{had made it}} <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> function as an artist, Barnes stopped drinking in order to begin work on her verse play The Antiphon. The play drew heavily on her own family history, and the writing was fueled by anger; she said, [...] "I wrote The Antiphon with clenched teeth, and I noted that my handwriting was as savage as a dagger." [...] When he read the play, her brother Thurn accused her of wanting [...] "revenge for something long dead and to be forgotten". Barnes, in the margin of his letter, described her motive as [...] "justice", and next to [...] "dead" [...] she inscribed, [...] "not dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, Judge, but {{you have}} only to see her--to hear her voice--to realize how <b>impossible</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> kill even a coyote. All I ask, now, is that you save <b>her</b> from going <b>to</b> jail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, he did kneel at my feet;" [...] {{and as she}} {{answered}} the question she rose up, {{as though it were}} <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> any longer <b>to</b> sit {{in the presence of a}} man who so evidently had set a spy upon her actions.|$|R
6000|$|Fanny's {{consequence}} increased on {{the departure}} of her cousins. Becoming, as she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room, the only occupier of that interesting division of a family {{in which she had}} hitherto held so humble a third, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> be more looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever been before; and [...] "Where is Fanny?" [...] became no uncommon question, even without <b>her</b> being wanted <b>for</b> any one's convenience.|$|R
2500|$|..... this epistle is the {{principal}} and most excellent {{part of the new}} testament, and most pure evangelion, that is to say glad tidings and what we call the gospel, and also a light and a way in unto the whole scripture ... The sum and whole cause of the writings of this epistle, is, to prove that a man is justified by faith only: which proposition whoso denieth, to him is not only this epistle and all that Paul writeth, but also the whole scripture, so locked up that he shall never understand it to his soul's health. And to bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only justifieth, Paul proveth that the whole nature of man is so poisoned and so corrupt, yea and so dead concerning godly living or godly thinking, that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> keep the law in the sight of God.|$|E
2500|$|Mendleson {{was quietly}} {{released}} on parole in November 1976, {{just four years}} after the end of the trial. The news was not disclosed by the Home Office until 13 February 1977, causing a storm of press coverage which one reporter described as [...] "scandalous and distasteful". The issue was raised in Parliament with Home Secretary, Merlyn Rees, saying that Mendleson was no longer a danger to society; William Whitelaw criticised the decision and asserted that protection of the public and police morale came first. Mendleson returned to Stockport to live with her family, and her father gave an interview to BBC Radio explaining that prison had had a terrible effect on her, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> concentrate. He also said that she had taken no part in the bombings and that she and the other defendants were [...] "good young people" [...] who tried to help others.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} think of another word, not one, and she fell into a horrible silence, {{wringing}} her hands piteously. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go on, and <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave the floor till the word of release came.|$|E
60|$|The way {{in which}} Prue put the case made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> hearers not <b>to</b> laugh. But Sylvia held her breath while waiting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband's answer. He was {{standing}} behind her chair, and spoke with the smile still on his lips, too confident to harbor even a passing fancy.|$|R
60|$|Her {{thoughts}} were speaking with her, speaking pleasantly, as it seemed, for she {{smiled as she}} listened. She looked pretty meditating thus; but a brighter thing than she was in that apartment--the spirit of youthful Hope. According to this flattering prophet, she was to know disappointment, to feel chill no more; she had entered on {{the dawn of a}} summer day--no false dawn, but the true spring of morning--and her sun would quickly rise. <b>Impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> now <b>to</b> suspect that she was the sport of delusion; her expectations seemed warranted, the foundation on which they rested appeared solid.|$|R
50|$|During her {{secondary}} education, Matthei {{developed a}} passion for music and piano, and upon graduation expressed interest in becoming a concert pianist. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> family <b>to</b> pay <b>for</b> a tutor on her father’s meager salary as an Air Force Captain, but Matthei was able <b>to</b> obtain scholarships <b>for</b> <b>her</b> studies. Following graduation, she took the admissions exams for university; {{but at the time}} her father was appointed military attaché to the Chilean Embassy in London, and she decided <b>to</b> pursue <b>her</b> piano career in Britain. Three years later, she realized she would not become a concert pianist and decided to return to Chile.|$|R

We have received a telegram from Illghera with grave news concerning the health of his Majesty the King of Waldenburg, and notwithstanding the indisposition of the Princess Adelaide, the Archduchess has arranged to leave for Illghera at once. A fuller explanation will appear in the Court Circular, and the Archduchess is particularly anxious <b>to</b> express <b>her</b> great regret <b>to</b> all those whom the cancellation of her engagements may inconvenience.

50|$|Flight 715 - A {{girl has}} a nightmare, {{in which she}} {{foresees}} that the airliner which is about <b>to</b> fly <b>her</b> family home from a vacation in Vancouver is destined <b>to</b> crash. Since <b>her</b> family do not believe her, the girl takes matters into her own hands. She wanders off on her own - making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> family <b>to</b> travel - and only returns after the aircraft has taken off. What neither she nor her family find out is that the aircraft is damaged in flight, and that if their extra weight had been on board, it wouldn't have landed safely and the girl's nightmare would have come true.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now we {{will say}} nothing {{more about it}} till to-morrow morning," [...] said Fanny. But Lucy felt that this saying nothing more about it till to-morrow morning would be {{tantamount}} to an acceptance on her part of Lord Lufton's offer. Mrs. Robarts knew, and Mr. Robarts also now knew, the secret of her heart; and if, such being the case, she allowed Lord Lufton to come there with the acknowledged purpose of pleading his own suit, it would be <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> yield. If she were resolved {{that she would not}} yield, now was the time <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stand <b>her</b> ground and make her fight.

60|$|Something in {{the tone}} of those last words, and the {{pressure}} of the strong, kind hand, touched Christie's sore heart, and made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> hide the truth entirely.|$|E
50|$|Back in {{fighting}} trim, Southfield departed Hampton Roads on December 2, arrived at Hatteras Inlet the next day, {{and proceeded to}} Plymouth, North Carolina. On the morning of December 10, she engaged a Confederate land force which attacked that city. A Southern shot pierced her steam chest, disabling her engine and filling the ship with hot steam. The scalding vapor prevented the gunboat's crew from reaching her magazine and thus made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> guns <b>to</b> continue their fire. Boats were lowered to pull the disabled ship downstream; but , hearing the firing, steamed up, took Southfield in tow, and returned with <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Plymouth. By that time, the Confederate raiders had withdrawn.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, popular Pakistani {{social media}} celebrity Qandeel Baloch was strangled by her brother {{in an act}} of honour killing in Multan in the {{province}} of Punjab. She had reportedly raised controversy by posting controversial pictures of herself on social media, including one alongside a Muslim cleric, and her brothers had asked <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stop. The state was named as complainant in Qandeel's murder case, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> family <b>to</b> pardon <b>her</b> killers. Qandeel's brother Waseem was arrested on the charges of murder. He confessed to murdering his sister, saying [...] "she Baloch was bringing disrepute to our family's honour and I could not tolerate it any further. I killed her around 11:30 p.m. on Friday night when everyone else had gone to bed." ...|$|R
60|$|His reticence {{served only}} <b>to</b> fortify <b>her</b> trust--to elevate it. It was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> feel {{something}} of that which was in him and crying for utterance. She was a woman. And if this one action had been but the holding of her coat, she would have known. A man who could keep silent under these conditions must indeed be a rock of might and honour; and she felt sure now, with a surging of joy, that the light she had seen shining from it was the beacon of truth. A question trembled on <b>her</b> lips--the question <b>for</b> which she had long been gathering strength. Whatever {{the outcome of this}} communion, she felt that there must be absolute truth between them.|$|R
