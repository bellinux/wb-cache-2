50|$|The {{number of}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> on {{locomotives}} varied quite a bit. Some early locomotives had {{as few as}} two <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> (one axle). The largest number of total <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was 24 (twelve axles) on the 2-8-8-8-2 and 2-8-8-8-4 locomotives. The largest number of coupled <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was 14 (seven axles) on the ill-fated AA20 4-14-4 locomotive.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{framework}} {{with the}} <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> housing {{is outside the}} wheel disks of the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> is enclosed by a quill camped in the locomotive cabinet, on which the gear wheel sits. Examples included the Pennsylvania Railroad O1b, and the Deutsche Reichsbahn ET11.01.|$|R

50|$|Although Atlantics were {{sometimes}} used as mountain helpers {{prior to the}} First World War, they were not well-suited for mountain or for very long distance operations. They had large-diameter <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> in some cases exceeding 72 in, which were adequate for 70 to 100 mph trains, although they tended to oscillate at higher speeds. Climbing any substantial grade required a smaller <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter for better adhesion, or more <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> for better traction.|$|R
50|$|Between 1869 and 1873, new {{locomotives}} {{were built}} to replace {{four of the}} original 9 ft diameter <b>driving</b> <b>wheeled</b> engines, re-using the engine numbers of the locomotives being replaced.

50|$|The {{coupling}} rod's off-center {{attachment to}} the crank pin of the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> inevitably creates an eccentric movement and vibration when in motion. To compensate for this, the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> of an inside-frame locomotive always had built-in counterweights to offset the angular momentum of the coupling rods, {{as shown in the}} figures above. On outside-frame locomotives, the counterweight could be on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> itself, or it could be on the crank outside the frame, as shown in the adjacent figure.|$|R
50|$|A {{coupling}} rod or side rod connects the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> of a locomotive. Steam locomotives in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The {{coupling rod}}s transfer {{the power to}} all <b>driving</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{movement}} of the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> results in the gear segments moving due to the internal mechanism, and the <b>driving</b> <b>wheel</b> can move in a horizontal or vertical direction {{with respect to the}} gear wheel, while still transferring the momentum of the gear wheel.|$|R
50|$|The S1 {{had less}} than half its total weight on the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> the rest being carried by the massive six-wheel pilot (leading) and {{trailing}} truck. This left {{the two sets of}} four duplex <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> susceptible to wheel slippage, a dangerous condition for any steam locomotive.|$|R
50|$|These {{types of}} engines, that Casey pilots, are very {{different}} and have different wheel arrangements, such as the 4-6-0s having ten wheels (four leading, six <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> and no trailing wheels), and the 4-4-0s having eight wheels (four leading, four <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> and no trailing wheels).|$|R

50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's class Q1 {{comprised}} {{a single}} experimental steam locomotive for freight service, #6130, built in March 1942. A duplex locomotive, {{it had a}} wheel arrangement of 4-6-4-4, comprising a four-wheel leading truck, two sets of <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> (six followed by four) in a rigid locomotive frame, and a four-wheel trailing truck. The first group of six <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> was driven {{by a pair of}} cylinders mounted conventionally in front of them, while the rear four <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> were driven by cylinders mounted behind them {{on either side of the}} firebox.|$|R
50|$|The term {{tractive}} effort is often qualified as starting {{tractive effort}}, {{continuous tractive effort}} and maximum tractive effort. These terms apply to different operating conditions, but are related by common mechanical factors: input torque to the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> the wheel diameter, coefficient of friction (μ) between the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and supporting surface, and the weight applied to the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> (m). The product of μ and m is the factor of adhesion, which determines the maximum torque {{that can be applied}} before the onset of wheelspin or wheelslip.|$|R

50|$|In Whyte notation, a 4-6-6-4 is a {{railroad}} steam locomotive that has four leading wheels followed by six coupled <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{a second set}} of six <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> and four trailing wheels. 4-6-6-4s are commonly known as Challengers.

These locomotives usually employ the Mallet principle of articulation, with a swinging front engine and a rigidly attached rear engine.|$|R
50|$|In the Whyte notation, <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{designated}} by the middle number or numbers in the set. The UIC classification system counts {{the number of axles}} rather than the number of <b>wheels</b> and <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are designated}} by letters rather than numbers. The suffix 'o' is used to indicate independently powered axles.|$|R
50|$|The 6-2-0 was a {{most unusual}} wheel arrangement, where {{the bulk of the}} locomotive's weight was on the {{unpowered}} leading wheels rather than the powered <b>driving</b> <b>wheels,</b> therefore giving poor adhesion. The type was only practicable on the Crampton locomotive with a low boiler and large <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> placed behind the firebox.|$|R
50|$|Driving {{wheels are}} {{generally}} larger than leading or trailing wheels. Since a conventional steam locomotive is directly driven, {{one of the}} few ways to 'gear' a locomotive for a particular performance goal is to size the <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> appropriately. Freight locomotives generally had <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> between 40 and 60 in in diameter; dual-purpose locomotives generally between 60 and 70 in, and passenger locomotives between 70 and 100 in or so. Some long wheelbase locomotives (four or more coupled axles) were equipped with blind drivers. These were <b>driving</b> <b>wheels</b> without the usual flanges, which allowed them to negotiate tighter curves without binding.|$|R
