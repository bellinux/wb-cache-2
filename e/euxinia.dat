25|$|<b>Euxinia</b> most {{frequently}} {{occurred in the}} Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate.|$|E
25|$|This {{spread of}} toxic, oxygen-depleted water {{would have been}} devastating for marine life, {{producing}} widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and <b>euxinia</b> would have been closely associated with hypercapnia (high levels of carbon dioxide).|$|E
25|$|Biomarkers {{for green}} sulfur bacteria, such as isorenieratane, the diagenetic product of isorenieratene, {{are widely used}} as {{indicators}} of photic zone <b>euxinia</b> because green sulfur bacteria require both sunlight and hydrogen sulfide to survive. Their abundance in sediments from the P-T boundary indicates hydrogen sulfide was present even in shallow waters.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{widespread}} ocean anoxia (severe {{deficiency of}} oxygen) and <b>euxinia</b> (presence of hydrogen sulfide) is found from the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. Throughout {{most of the}} Tethys and Panthalassic Oceans, evidence for anoxia, including fine laminations in sediments, small pyrite framboids, high uranium/thorium ratios, and biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria, appear at the extinction event.|$|E
25|$|A second {{extinction}} pulse, the Hangenberg event {{closed the}} Devonian period {{and had a}} dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas. Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event, as did most members of other groups including lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats, leaving {{only a handful of}} survivors. This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as <b>euxinia</b> and anoxia in the seas.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that poisoning from hydrogen sulfide, anoxia, and hypercapnia acted {{together as a}} killing mechanism. Hypercapnia best explains the selectivity of the extinction, but anoxia and <b>euxinia</b> probably contributed to the high mortality of the event. The persistence of anoxia through the Early Triassic may explain the slow recovery of marine life after the extinction. Models also show that anoxic events can cause catastrophic hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere (see below).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Euxinia</b> or euxinic {{conditions}} {{occur when}} water is both anoxic and sulfidic. This {{means that there}} is no oxygen (O2) and a raised level of free hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water. [...] The word <b>euxinia</b> is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (Euxeinos Pontos)- which translates to [...] "hospitable sea". Euxinic deep water is a key component of the Canfield ocean, a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the Boring Billion proposed by Donald Canfield, an American geologist, in 1998. There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans. <b>Euxinia</b> is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Presence of <b>euxinia</b> in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, {{the deep}} ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 {{billion years ago}} and stayed that way {{for much of the}} boring billion. Periodic <b>euxinia</b> {{dominated}} through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. <b>Euxinia</b> reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. <b>Euxinia</b> is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008 ...|$|E
50|$|The Mesozoic is {{well known}} for its {{distinct}} Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for <b>euxinia,</b> many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation. Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing <b>euxinia,</b> especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone <b>euxinia</b> did not happen everywhere.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{study the}} occurrence of <b>euxinia</b> in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in sedimentary rock created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of <b>euxinia,</b> while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing <b>euxinia</b> most likely vary between the two.|$|E
50|$|Molybdenum {{isotopes}} {{have been}} used to examine the distribution of <b>euxinia</b> in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps <b>euxinia</b> was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between <b>euxinia</b> and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions. Further work has suggested that from 700 million years ago (late Proterozoic) and onward, the deep oceans may have actually been anoxic and iron rich with conditions similar to those during the formation of BIFs.|$|E
50|$|Evidence for <b>euxinia</b> {{has also}} been tied to the Kellwasser events of the Late Devonian Extinction event. <b>Euxinia</b> in basinal waters {{in what is now}} central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, {{contributing}} to the extinction event.|$|E

50|$|Geological {{records from}} the {{paleozoic}} in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δ34S, {{it was determined that}} hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than sulfate. Although this was not originally attributed to <b>euxinia,</b> further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for <b>euxinia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some fjords develop <b>euxinia</b> if the {{connection}} to the open ocean is constricted, similar {{to the case of}} the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord. Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water. Ground sources of sulfur are also an important cause for <b>euxinia</b> in fjords.|$|E

5000|$|The {{periodic}} {{presence of}} euxinic {{conditions in the}} Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread <b>euxinia,</b> perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period. [...] Towards {{the end of the}} Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until <b>euxinia</b> was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.|$|E
50|$|Few {{episodes of}} <b>euxinia</b> {{are evident in}} the {{sedimentary}} record during the Cenozoic. Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.|$|E
50|$|Conditions {{required}} {{for the formation of}} persistent <b>euxinia</b> include anoxic waters, high nutrient levels, and a stratified water column. These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of <b>euxinia.</b> Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the Canfield ocean, are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the geologic record at relevant locations. The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.|$|E
5000|$|Molybdenum (Mo), {{the most}} common {{transition}} metal ion in modern seawater, {{is also used to}} look for evidence for <b>euxinia.</b> Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO42- into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO42- [...] is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the Black Sea, molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO4−xSx2- [...] ). The isotope ratio for Molybdenum (δ97/95 Mo) in euxinic sediments appears to be higher than in oxic conditions. Additionally, the concentration of molybdenum is frequently correlated with the concentration of organic matter in euxinic sediments. The use of Mo to indicate <b>euxinia</b> is still under debate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Euxinia</b> still occurs {{occasionally}} today, {{mostly in}} meromictic lakes and silled basins {{such as the}} Black Sea and some fjords. It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.|$|E
50|$|There {{was perhaps}} {{a period of}} {{oxygenation}} of bottom waters during the Carboniferous, most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point <b>euxinia</b> would be very rare in the paleo oceans.|$|E
50|$|This {{spread of}} toxic, oxygen-depleted water {{would have been}} devastating for marine life, {{producing}} widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and <b>euxinia</b> would have been closely associated with hypercapnia (high levels of carbon dioxide).This suggests that poisoning from hydrogen sulfide, anoxia, and hypercapnia acted together as a killing mechanism. Hypercapnia best explains the selectivity of the extinction, but anoxia and <b>euxinia</b> probably contributed to the high mortality of the event. The persistence of anoxia through the Early Triassic may explain the slow recovery of marine life after the extinction. Models also show that anoxic events can cause catastrophic hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere (see below).|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} thought that {{through most of}} Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, <b>euxinia</b> was largely absent because of low {{availability}} of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.|$|E
50|$|The Permian-Triassic {{extinction}} event {{may also}} have some ties to <b>euxinia,</b> with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species. Presence of a biomarker for anaerobic photosynthesis by green sulfur bacteria has been found spanning from the Permian to early Triassic in sedimentary rock in both Australia and China, meaning that euxinic conditions extended up quite shallow in the water column, contributing to the extinctions and perhaps even slowed the recovery. It is uncertain, however, just how widespread photic zone <b>euxinia</b> was during this period. Modelers have hypothesized that due to environmental conditions anoxia and sulfide may have been brought up from a deep, vast euxinic reservoir in upwelling areas, but stable, gyre-like areas remained oxic.|$|E
5000|$|The Proterozoic is the {{transition}} era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model {{is that the}} end of the Banded iron formations (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the Great Oxygenation Event. Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide. Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin. [...] In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep <b>euxinia</b> was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena. This <b>euxinia</b> is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom <b>euxinia</b> a potentially widespread feature throughout the Boring Billion.|$|E
50|$|Evidence for {{widespread}} ocean anoxia (severe {{deficiency of}} oxygen) and <b>euxinia</b> (presence of hydrogen sulfide) is found from the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. Throughout {{most of the}} Tethys and Panthalassic Oceans, evidence for anoxia, including fine laminations in sediments, small pyrite framboids, high uranium/thorium ratios, and biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria, appear at the extinction event.However, in some sites, including Meishan, China, and eastern Greenland, evidence for anoxia precedes the extinction.Biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria, such as isorenieratane, the diagenetic product of isorenieratene, are widely used as indicators of photic zone <b>euxinia</b> because green sulfur bacteria require both sunlight and hydrogen sulfide to survive. Their abundance in sediments from the P-T boundary indicates hydrogen sulfide was present even in shallow waters.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Map of the Black Sea {{showing the}} many rivers that supply the basin with low-density fresh water, {{along with the}} narrow Bosphorus Strait to the {{southwest}} that supplies the basin with high-density salt water. This assists in the stratification and <b>euxinia</b> {{that exists in the}} modern Black Sea.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Erchin Maslen and {{his colleagues}} {{detected}} crocetane in highly-mature Devonian sediments and crude oils of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. They propose that natural product precursor for this crocetane is green sulfur bacteria derived isorenieratene and palaerernieratene, which means that crocetane can also be related to photic zone <b>euxinia</b> in highly matured samples.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It {{is most likely}} that <b>euxinia</b> was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, {{there is some evidence}} that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the Late Devonian and Permian-Triassic.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{stratification}} {{occurs when}} water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers {{that act as}} barriers to water mixing {{which could lead to}} anoxia or <b>euxinia.</b> [...] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Euxinia</b> most {{frequently}} {{occurred in the}} Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate. The original model {{was that it was}} quite constant for approximately a billion years. Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small black shale deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.|$|E
50|$|Further {{evidence}} for <b>euxinia</b> {{was discovered in}} the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found. The degree of pyritization and the δ34S were both high, supporting the presence of anoxia and sulfide, {{as well as the}} depletion of sulfate. A different study found biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria in the same area, providing further {{evidence for}} the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
50|$|Like the Canfield Ocean model, the Johnston {{hypothesis}} {{serves as}} a potential explanation of causal factors for tempered oxygenic production. The model ultimately claims that sulfide driven anoxic photosynthesis via sulfidic prokaryotes helped sustain {{a long period of}} deep ocean anoxia, and more specifically, <b>euxinia.</b> This period ended with the exhaustion of sulfide resources, leading to the coupling of oxygenic production and carbon burial that is characteristic of today’s oceans.|$|E
50|$|A second {{extinction}} pulse, the Hangenberg event {{closed the}} Devonian period {{and had a}} dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas.
