50|$|Polyamide-imide resin is hygroscopic, {{and picks}} up ambient moisture. Before {{processing}} the resin, drying is required to avoid brittle parts, foaming, and other molding problems. The resin must be dried to a moisture content of 500 ppm or less. A <b>desiccant</b> <b>dryer</b> capable of maintaining a dew point of -40 °F (-40 °C) is recommended. If drying is done in pans or trays, put the resin in layers no more than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) deep in drying trays. Dry for 24 hours at 250 °F, or 16 hours at 300 °F, or 8 hours at 350 °F. If drying at 350 °F (177 °C), limit drying time to 16 hours. For the injection molding press,a desiccant hopper dryer is recommended. The circulating air suction pipe {{should be at the}} base of the hopper, as near the feed throat as possible.|$|E

5000|$|The {{system has}} success in many {{applications}} including natural gas. It {{is possible to}} have interference from glycol, methanol, and damage from hydrogen sulfide which can result in erratic readings. The sensor itself is relatively inexpensive and very precise. The required calibration system is not as precise and adds to the cost and mechanical complexity of the system. The labor for frequent replacement of <b>desiccant</b> <b>dryers,</b> permeation components, and the sensor heads greatly increase the operational costs.

2500|$|PET is hygroscopic, {{meaning that}} it absorbs water from its surroundings.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{energy prices}} and more demanding competition within the manufacturing industry Swedish corporations {{are forced to}} decrease their energy needs to handle being profitable on the market. We have with this report tried to help Nexans IKO Sweden AB in Grimsås to decrease the energy use in drying plastic granules in their cable production. We also did an inventory of their machine park for drying plastic granules at the time being. An investigation of the market was also done to analyze what other possibilities there are for drying and what the future looks like. Our own tests were done with plastic granules to get an understanding for how the material behaves when drying it and re-moisturising it. What we quickly discovered is that {{the handling of the}} <b>desiccant</b> <b>dryers</b> is very important to get it as economic as possible in use. It was also discovered that batch drying should be avoided as far as possible because it is uneconomical in many aspects; the material is re-moisturising among others. Another advantage with avoiding batch drying is that hot material reaches the extruder that in turn will not have to heat the material as much...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the investigation of the}} feasibility of rapid drilling in ice sheets and glaciers to depths of up to 600 m, with cuttings and cores continually transported by air reverse circulation. The method employs dual wall drill rods. The inner tubes provide a continuous pathway for the chips and cores from the drill bit face to the surface. To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original cutter drill bits and air processing devices (air-cooled aftercoolers, air receivers, coalescing filters, <b>desiccant</b> <b>dryers)</b> should be used. The airflow velocity for conveying a 60 -mm diameter and 200 -mm long ice core should not be lower than 22. 5 m/s, and the minimal airflow rate for continual chip and cores transport is 6. 8 m 3 /min at 2. 3 – 2. 6 MPa. Drilling of a 600 -m deep hole can be accomplished within 1. 5 days in the case of 24 h drilling operations. However, to avoid sticking while drilling through ice, the drilling depth should to be limited to 540 m at a temperature of − 20 °C and to 418 m at a temperature of − 10 °C. この論文では、氷床や氷河の深度 600 mまでの氷コア掘削について、空気を循環して送ることで氷の切削と氷コアの輸送を連続的に行う高速掘削の実行可能性について述べている。この方法は、二重のチューブにしたドリルロッドを使うことで可能である。二重ドリルロッドの内側チューブは、ドリルの切削面から地上までの切削チップおよび氷コアの輸送経路となる。様々な氷河の状況によって空気循環掘削技術を適応するために、それに対応するドリルロッドのカッターと空気処理装置（乾燥した冷たい空気を送るための、空冷クーラー、空気貯留タンク、空気乾燥機など）を使用する必要がある。直径 60 mm、長さ 200 mmの氷コアを運ぶための空気速度は 22. 5 m/s以上でなければならず、連続的な切削チップおよび氷コア輸送のための最小空気流量は 2. 3 〜 2. 6 MPaの時に 6. 8 m 3 /分になる。 24 時間の掘削作業の場合には、 600 mの深さの孔を 1. 5 日以内に掘削することが可能である。しかし、氷河や氷床の掘削中にスタックするのを避けるためには、掘削深度を− 20 ℃の氷温では 540 mに、− 10 ℃の氷温では 418 mに制限する必要がある...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A forced {{convection}} with <b>desiccant</b> integrated solar <b>dryer</b> {{has been built}} and tested. The main parts are: two flat plate solar air collectors, a drying chamber, desiccant bed and a centrifugal blower. The system is operated in two modes, sunshine hours and off sunshine hours. During sun shine hours the hot air from the flat plate collectors is forced to the drying chamber for drying the product and simultaneously the desiccant bed receives solar radiation directly and through the reflected mirror. In the off sunshine hours, the dryer is operated by circulating the air inside the drying chamber through the desiccant bed by a reversible fan. The dryer is used to dry 20 kg of green peas and pineapple slices. Drying experiments were conducted with and without the integration of desiccant unit. The effect of reflective mirror on the drying potential of desiccant unit was also investigated. With the inclusion of reflective mirror, the drying potential of the desiccant material is increased by 25 % and the drying time is reduced. The drying efficiency of the system varies between 48 % and 59 % and the pick-up efficiency varies between 25 % and 60 %, respectively. Approximately in all the drying experiments 68 % of moisture is removed by air heated using solar energy and the remainder by the desiccant. The inclusion of reflective mirror on the desiccant bed makes faster regeneration of the desiccant material.
