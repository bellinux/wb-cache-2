500|$|Wiedemann and Lammers had {{provided}} assurances that Hess {{would not be}} harmed. In August 1940, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, issued {{a letter to the}} Düsseldorf Gestapo ordering that Hess should not be [...] "inopportuned in any way whatsoever". Noting that Hess had been [...] "both in the same company as the Führer and briefly the Führer's company commander", Himmler instructed that Hess should be granted [...] "relief and protection as per the Führer's wishes" [...] and asked that he be informed if Hess should leave Düsseldorf. A follow-up letter was sent by Lammers in November 1940, informing Hess that [...] "it is, however, the Führer's wish that you should not be subject to any further restrictions because of your ancestry beyond those required by law." [...] Lammers expressly informed Hess that he was to use the letter for his protection: [...] "I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> letter, if necessary, to make use [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E

2500|$|The show's {{accuracy}} was playfully rebuffed in {{an episode}} of the television programme QI, itself having been forced to accept corrections at times, when Mitchell, one of the panellists {{on the subject of}} film and fame (Series F, Episode 11), found himself supplying answers based on information gathered from The Unbelievable Truth. [...] The answers received klaxons on QI, causing Mitchell to acknowledge that some of the show's [...] "unbelievable truths [...] out, unbelievably, to be untrue." [...] Mitchell then added in comic resignation, [...] "People <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> shit and you read it out", and later jokingly accused QIs host Stephen Fry of trying to [...] "kill off the medium" [...] of radio. The show was nonetheless praised by Stephen Fry and fellow panellist Emma Thompson.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 February 2008, she {{was awarded}} the César Award for Best Actress for her {{performance}} in La Vie en Rose. Alain Delon presented the award and announced the winner as [...] "La Môme Marion" [...] (The Kid Marion), also praising her on stage saying: [...] "Marion, I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> César. I think this César is for a great great actress, and I know what I'm talking about". Two days later, on 24 February 2008 at the Academy Awards, she won Best Actress, becoming the first woman and second person (after Adrien Brody, The Pianist) to win both a César and an Oscar for the same performance. Cotillard is the second French cinema actress to win this award and the third overall to receive an Academy Award after Simone Signoret in 1960 and Juliette Binoche in 1997. She is the first Best Actress winner in a non-English language performance since Sophia Loren's win in 1961. She is also the first and (as of 2017) only winner of an Academy Award for a performance in the French language. In her Oscar acceptance speech, Cotillard proclaimed [...] "thank you life, thank you love" [...] and, speaking of Los Angeles, said [...] "it is true, there is some angels (sic) in this city!" [...] The day following the ceremony, Cotillard was congratulated and praised by the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, in a statement saying, ...|$|E

2500|$|Theodore of Mopsuestia paraphrases: [...] "In {{addition}} to all which I have said, I <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> last commandment, to remember My law, which I gave to all Israel through Moses, plainly declaring {{what they ought to}} do in each thing, and as the first token of obedience, to receive the Lord Christ when He cometh, appearing for the salvation of all men: Who will end the law, but show His own perfection. It had been well, had you immediately believed Him when He came, and known Him, as He whom Moses and all the prophets signified, Who should {{put an end to the}} law, and reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed Elias shall be sent to you before the second Coming of Christ, when He will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness, shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with the godly thence ensuing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Zimmerman {{critically}} {{framed the}} question of Confucius Institutes and academic freedom, [...] "Let's suppose that a cruel, tyrannical, and repressive foreign government offered to pay for American teens to study its national language in our schools. Would you take the deal?" [...] Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but [...] "on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy." [...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs." [...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus." [...] According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, [...] "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer." [...] The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
