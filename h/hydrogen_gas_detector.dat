An increase of about 7000 % in the production of atoms in the hyperfine state desired for maser operation is observed at certain values of the applied magnetic field.

40|$|Materials Science & EngineeringIn {{the part}} 1, Single crystal {{vanadium}} dioxide (VO 2) nanowires were grown by {{physical vapor deposition}} (PVD) under atmospheric pressure and synthesized on a silicon dioxide (SiO 2), a sapphire (Al 2 O 3) C-plan and a sapphire R-plan as a substrate. The controllable spontaneous conversion of thin films into nanowires for large area production is investigated. The synthesis is found to depend critically on the thickness of V 2 O 5 layer. We have controlled that the nanowires that are single crystal vanadium dioxide can be grown with thickness of V 2 O 5 thin film and also we can synthesize VO 2 nanowires to various directions on the substrate. By using the patterned substrate, we can not only control the numerous VO 2 nanowire morphologies but also fabricate the guided growth of millimeter-long VO 2 nanowires. In the part 2, we report the high effective hydrogen gas sensor based on the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) by the electro-thermally induced Palladium-nanoparticles-decorated VO 2 nanowire prepared by the efficient and size-controllable growth method originated from V 2 O 5 thin film driven. We have many experiments for improved <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> <b>detector</b> based on the MIT. First by doping the tungsten we showed that the MIT temperature was reduced to about 40 °C. Second by irradiating a well-defined electron beam into the nanowires, we could considerably increase the conductivity up to 4 times with only a modest change in the MIT temperature (< 2 °C). When exposed to trace amounts of hydrogen gas in a single nanowire configuration, the enhanced conductivity gave rise to about two times as fast transition to metallic phase even near room temperature (35 °C), by reaching much faster (3 x) a critical current density at which the self-heating initiates. Last, especially Palladium-VO 2 nanowire near-corshell nanostructure shows remarkably large current increase at a temperature 10 °C lower than the MIT temperature in the bulk. This current increase occurs slowly over the duration of several seconds to several tens of seconds, depending on the Pd coverage, temperature, and hydrogen concentration. This novel finding thus mentions the capability of detecting selectively hydrogen of different three gases (O 2, CO 2, and ethylene) and has significant implications for the effective engineering the physicochemical properties of vanadium dioxide by a heterogeneous catalytic process. ope...|$|E

40|$|Low-cost, hydrogen-gas-leak {{detectors}} {{are needed}} for many hydrogen applications, such as hydrogen-fueled vehicles where several detectors may be required in different locations on each vehicle. A fiber-optic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> leak <b>detector</b> could be inherently safer than conventional detectors, because it would remove all detector electronics from the vicinity of potential leaks. It would also provide freedom from electromagnetic interference, a serious problem in fuel-cell-powered electric vehicles. This paper describes progress {{in the design of}} a fiber-optic, surface-plasmon-resonance hydrogen detector, and efforts to make it more sensitive, selective, and durable. Chemochromic materials, such as tungsten oxide and certain Lanthanide hydrides, can reversibly react with hydrogen in air while exhibiting significant changes in their optical properties. Thin films of these materials applied to a sensor {{at the end of an}} optical fiber have been used to detect low concentrations of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> in air. The coatings include a thin silver layer in which the surface plasmon is generated, a thin film of the chemochromic material, and a catalytic layer of palladium that facilitates the reaction with hydrogen. The film thickness is chosen to produce a guided-surface plasmon wave along the interface between the silver and the chemochromic material. A dichroic be m-splitter separates the reflected spectrum into a portion near the resonance and a portion away from the resonance, and directs these two portions to two separate photodiodes. The electronic ratio of these two signals cancels most of the fiber transmission noise and provides a stable hydrogen signal...|$|R

Previous studies have been investigated on olivine serpentinization, and temperatures and pressures were very limited (<= 300 degrees C, 500 bar). Here, we performed a series of hydrothermal experiments at 300 similar to 500 degrees C and 1 similar to 3 kbar to explore the formation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> and alkanes during serpentinization of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, peridotite, basalt, and mixtures of peridotite and basalt. At 300 degrees C and 3 kbar, the quantity of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> after olivine serpentinization {{is much higher than}} that after pyroxene alteration. As temperatures increase, e. g., at 400 similar to 500 degrees C and 3 kbar, the amount of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> after olivine alteration is much lower due to its sluggish alteration rate, which is slightly less than that after orthopyroxene serpentinization. Clinopyroxene is completely unaltered after experiments, and therefore no <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> and alkanes are produced. Compared to peridotite, the quantity of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> after olivine and orthopyroxene at 400 similar to 500 degrees C is identical, while the amounts of alkanes are much less. The quantities of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> and alkane during basalt alteration are comparable with those after hydration of mixtures of basalt and peridotite, but they are much lower than those after peridotite alteration. This is mainly due to production of Fe 2 + -rich diopside (similar to 8. 1 % FeO) after basalt alteration, which dramatically reduces the amount of Fe 3 + and consequently <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas.</b> This study suggests that olivine and pyroxene cannot completely represent peridotite for the formation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> and alkanes during serpentinization. Moreover, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> and alkane are produced not only after serpentinization of abyssal peridotite, which could be also formed during hydration of oceanic crust in subduction zones.
