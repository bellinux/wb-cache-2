50|$|The China Railways DJ1 is a {{high power}} {{mainline}} electric freight locomotive built as a <b>double</b> <b>locomotive</b> unit of two nominally independent single cab units.|$|E
50|$|The train's {{designated}} {{top speed}} is 210 km/h. It reached 276 km/h during a trial run with <b>double</b> <b>locomotive</b> units in 1993. However, {{the maximum speed}} allowed in regular traffic is 204 km/h for safety reasons - the signal system (and systems like the catenary) are not built for more, and it shares the track with regular trains; also, most of the lines it uses {{were built in the}} mid to late 19th century. The 19th century railways Stockholm-Gothenburg/Malmö are relatively straight, since they were planned the shortest way without taking intermediate cities into account, and the landscape is relatively flat. Other 19th century railways are generally curvier. In comparison to other high-speed trains, the X2000 is not particularly fast; but compared to regular train services, it cuts journey time by about 25% - enough to make it competitive with airlines on many routes. It typically averages about 150 km/h. The fastest part is Katrineholm-Skövde, a distance of 180 km that is covered in 1h 2min, resulting in an average speed of 174.2 km/h.|$|E

50|$|Little Wonder was a Double Fairlie type {{articulated}} locomotive designed by Robert Francis Fairlie. It {{was the first}} <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive</b> on the Festiniog Railway and the fourth <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive</b> to be built. It was an improvement on earlier designs because it had two fireboxes, instead of one, and this allowed it to steam more freely.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive</b> was {{initially}} numbered E7 in the Eastern System's numbering sequence, {{but it was}} renumbered to E33 before 1878. The second Double Fairlie was numbered E34. While the various improvements on the second <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive</b> proved to be effective and the engine performed well, it still offered cramped crew space and was therefore equally unpopular with enginemen, who considered it a clumsy locomotive to work.|$|R
50|$|To use the D-series in {{the same}} pool as the Rc locomotives, the Dus were {{upgraded}} with multiple operation capabilities, so they could operate as <b>double</b> <b>locomotives.</b> This rebuilding started in 1967 and was concluded in 1976. 162 D-locos were rebuilt to Du2s. It was the last type in service until 1993, ending 63 years of service for D locomotives. The oldest unit in service had an age of 55 years.|$|R

5000|$|The China Railways HXD1 (also {{known as}} the DJ4) is an eight axle high power heavy freight twin unit {{locomotive}} of axle configuration Bo'Bo'+Bo'Bo'. Both the HXD1 and HXD2 <b>double</b> unit <b>locomotives</b> were designated DJ4, the HXD2 units being disambiguated DJ4-6000.|$|R
50|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{requirement}} for more powerful locomotives on the Eastern System of the Cape Government Railways due to the heavy grades on the mainline out of East London, a single 0-6-0+0-6-0 <b>Double</b> Fairlie tank <b>locomotive</b> was acquired for experimental purposes in 1876. It was built by the Avonside Engine Company and supplied through the Crown Agents for the Colonies. When it was shipped from England, the locomotive was accompanied by Mr. Edmund Roberts, a specialist engine driver who had gained considerable experience on <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotives</b> in Peru.|$|R
2500|$|In 1874 New Zealand Railways ordered two NZR B class <b>locomotives.</b> They were <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotives,</b> {{supplied}} by Avonside; the first use in New Zealand of Walschaerts valve gear {{and probably the}} first time that a British manufacturer had supplied it. They were Cape gauge.|$|R

50|$|In December 1869 the BP&GVR {{tried out}} a <b>double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive,</b> named Pioneer, {{which had been}} {{constructed}} for a Swedish railway but not delivered to them. The trial was very successful and the company purchased the locomotive for £1,822, renaming it Mountaineer. A second double Fairlie was acquired soon after.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>double</b> cabin <b>locomotives</b> {{were the}} GE CM20EMP's predecessors, such as CC200s (Alco-GE UM 106T), BB301s and BB304s (Krupp M1500BB), and BB305s (built by CFD). While {{they were once}} used for express {{passenger}} train duty, they are now mostly operated as switchers and haulers of local trains, or have been withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|The Queensland Railways <b>Double</b> Boilered Cross <b>Locomotives</b> class {{locomotive}} was {{a locomotive}} class of 0-6-6-0 steam locomotives built for, but never operated by, the Queensland Railways.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was placed}} in service between East London and Belstone on the King William's Town line. At the same time, a pair of Stephenson's Patent permanently coupled back-to-back 0-6-0 tank locomotives {{was placed in}} service on the Cape Eastern system. They also worked out of East London, in comparative trials with the <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1913 {{quarrying}} {{started on}} land {{near the village}} of Thorpe Malsor, more than two miles from the ironworks. A new branch of the tramway was laid to reach these, requiring a substantial viaduct to cross the valley below the village. In 1926 a unique <b>double</b> Sentinel <b>locomotive</b> was purchased for the Thorpe Malsor branch, though it was not a great success.|$|R
50|$|In the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotive wheel arrangement, a 0-4-4-0 is a locomotive with no leading truck, two sets of four driving wheels, and no trailing truck. Examples of this type were constructed as Shay, Heisler, Climax, Mallet, Meyer and <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotives.</b> A similar configuration was used on some Garratts, but it {{is referred to as}} 0-4-0+0-4-0.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{can work}} in double, multiple and push-pull formation with other Vectron, Eurosprinter and Eurorunner locomotives {{as well as some}} other locomotives fitted with the same multiple working equipment. The design also allows single cab version for use in permanent <b>double</b> coupled <b>locomotive</b> working or for use with passenger trains with a blanking module replacing one of the cab ends.|$|R
50|$|Today, the {{following}} classes of railcar and locomotive {{are used in}} scheduled commercial services on the Bernina Railway: fifteen ABe 8/12I starting service in 2010, to replace the old series of engines, such as four ABe 4/4I and nine ABe 4/4II. Still in service also six ABe 4/4III and two Gem 4/4 that can operate without electrical feeding, thanks their diesel-generator inside (<b>double</b> engine <b>locomotives).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{conversions}} to Class 7E4 were costly, however, and it {{was decided}} to modify further Class 7E3 locomotives to a lesser extent, gaining almost the same benefits at a lower cost since they remained as <b>double</b> cab <b>locomotives.</b> In total about fifty locomotives of both series were upgraded in this manner. These were reclassified to Class 7E5, although externally they were still identical to the Class 7E3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first six}} single ended {{examples}} were delivered in 1955/56 to operate over the steeply graded Adelaide to Tailem Bend line and onwards to Serviceton. A further 31 double ended examples entered service between July 1957 and June 1967 and operated across the broad gauge network. The <b>double</b> ended <b>locomotives</b> had a [...] "bulldog nose" [...] at one end, and a flat {{end at the}} other.|$|R
50|$|Royal trains usually {{operated}} {{with special}} carriage stock {{set aside for}} the purpose. Most trains operated with <b>double</b> headed <b>locomotives</b> to reduce the chance of the train being stranded due to locomotive failure, with a third locomotive running in front of the train to ensure the track was clear. A special headboard with the royal coat of arms was usually affixed {{to the front of the}} leading locomotive.|$|R
50|$|In 1865, all 250 {{employees}} of the Ironworks went on strike to dispute England's harsh working practices, especially {{the circumstances under which}} an employee could be dismissed. Even though the workers were persuaded to return, the company lost several important orders, which significantly weakened the business. England was searching for business for the Hatcham Ironworks. He approached the Ffestiniog Railway in 1868 with an offer to build a <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotive,</b> England went into business with his son-in-law.|$|R
5000|$|The second <b>Double</b> Northern <b>locomotive</b> {{class were}} the AD60 class Garratts of the Australian [...] New South Wales Government Railways, of which 47 were {{delivered}} in 1952. Of these, 42 were delivered fully assembled while {{the last five}} were delivered in pieces as spare parts. The locomotive weighed 260 imperial tons and was the largest locomotive in the Southern Hemisphere. The last of the AD60 class entered service in 1956 {{and the last one}} was withdrawn from service in 1973.|$|R
50|$|In 1875, seeking {{additional}} {{motive power}} for the lightly-laid lines of the period, the national Government placed an order with Avonside for six <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotives</b> that became the E class. Larger and {{more powerful than the}} Vulcan Double Fairlies, the Avonside locomotives proved to be the most successful Double Fairlies in NZ. An initial feature of the class was the positioning of the sandboxes on top of the smokebox and {{around the base of the}} funnel, later changed. The class also continued the use of Walschaerts valve gear that was introduced on the B class Double Fairlies.|$|R
50|$|The Ffestiniog Railway in Wales still uses Fairlie patent {{locomotives}} to this day; it {{has three}} double Fairlies and one single Fairlie in running condition. The most recent <b>double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotives,</b> Earl of Meirioneth and David Lloyd George, {{were built in}} 1979 and 1992 respectively in the Ffestiniog's own Boston Lodge works. The veteran Merddin Emrys of 1879 was the first engine to be built at Boston Lodge. The Ffestiniog also owned and operated Taliesin, a single Fairlie, from 1876 to 1927. It was scrapped in 1935 but a replica was built at Boston Lodge in 1999.|$|R
50|$|The NZR E {{class of}} <b>Double</b> Fairlie steam <b>locomotives</b> were two {{different}} types of Fairlie locomotive, and were the first classes to take that designation, followed by the E class Mallet compound locomotive of 1906 and then the E class battery electric locomotive of 1922. The other Double Fairlie class was the B class, and there were also the Single Fairlie R and S classes.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a {{prototype}} diesel locomotive which could work through London's tube tunnels was first considered in 1936, and work began on its construction at Acton Works in 1939. It was designed to use its diesel engine when in the open air, but to draw current from {{the third and fourth}} rail when underground. Two Brush built 1915 Stock (also known as 'Ealing Stock') driving motors, numbered 3937 and 3941, which had been withdrawn from the Central London line, were converted into the electro-diesel locomotive. The work involved scrapping the passenger saloons and joining the two driving ends together to form a <b>double</b> ended <b>locomotive.</b> The central bay held a six-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine, manufactured by Petters, which was coupled to a direct current generator.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, New Zealand Railways ordered {{two types}} of <b>Double</b> Fairlie <b>locomotives</b> from Avonside. Both the B class and E class Double Fairlies were fitted with Walschaerts valve gear. This was {{certainly}} the first use of this technology {{to be used in}} New Zealand, and is possibly the first time a British manufacturer has supplied it. The B class lasted in service until the late 1880s. The E class were officially written off in 1899, however, most were still in use during the first world war. An 0-4-4T single Fairlie was built for the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway in 1878. To use a valve gear that fitted entirely outside the wheels, leaving the space between the frames clear for the boiler, this was the first British-based locomotive to use Walschaerts valve gear.|$|R
