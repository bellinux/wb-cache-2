[...] But Sam Hildreth thought all that would change with maturity, especially as the colt had injured his leg just before another two-year-old race. And Hildreth was right. Racing {{at the age of}} three, Purchase was barely beaten out of winning the three-year-old colt division by Sir Barton even though Purchase had won nine races of 11 that year, including the inaugural running of the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Hildreth would have entered Purchase in the 1919 Kentucky Derby as well as the Preakness Stakes, but just before the Derby, Purchase reared up in his stall and caught a front hoof in a <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> This delayed his third year campaign until he beat the first Triple Crown winner Sir Barton by three lengths in the Dwyer Stakes on July 10, 1919.|$|E
50|$|The chief {{structure}} is the residence, built in 1933 {{to replace a}} smaller cabin that had previously served as the guard station.The 12 ft by 16 ft cabin is built of peeled logs on a stone foundation with a gable roof. One end of the roof overhangs at the gable to form a porch supported by log posts. A shed roof on the opposite elevation shelters the front door. An woodshed was built nearby in 1934, of frame construction. A barn was built in 1933 by Civilian Conservation Corps laborers, 20 ft by 20 ft in size with four stalls, a manger and a <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> The log barn was relocated in 1996 due {{to changes in the}} course of the nearby Elwha River. An open-fronted shelter was constructed in the early 1930s, one of six built at the time, and the only survivor. The 14 ft square shelter is saltbox-shaped with a wood floor and built-in bunk beds. The shelter was relocated at the same time as the barn.|$|E

40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a wire <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> Results: Drying on a <b>hay</b> <b>rack</b> produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay dried on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried on a wire <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the hay dried on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage.

40|$|Five {{different}} types of feeders were designed and tested on goats to find out their effectiveness in reducing feed wastage and cost fabrication. Experiment was conducted at Agriculture Research Station (ARS) -Bandipur for two years. Tested feeders were hexagonal, rectangular, <b>hay</b> <b>rack,</b> chain barrel and conventional wooden Tatnu. Feeders were fabricated using iron bars and woods. They were tested with the adult goats for feed wastage and feed contamination. Experimental feeds were fodders twigs (Tanki), forage (Stylo, Napier), crop residue (straw from black bean) and commercial concentrate. Chain barrel type of feeder was also tested at farmer’s field at Baradi. Rectangular feeders have significantly lower (P< 0. 01) feed wastage (6. 61 % for fodders) compared to other tested feeders. The fabrication cost was NRs 3200, 1700, 700, 900, and 150 for hexagonal, rectangular; <b>hay</b> <b>rack,</b> chain barrel and conventional wooden Tatnu respectively. The rectangular feeder is suitable for goats feeding in Tarai and {{in the hills of}} Nepal. It has provision for feeding fodders, grasses, crop residues and concentrates together at the same time. Chain barrel type had comparatively higher wastage (10. 7 % for fodder) than the rectangular but was preferred by the farmers due to its low fabricating cost, portable in size, small space required and easy to handle. Therefore, the rectangular feeder is recommended for middle level farmers and chain barrel for small farmers who rear few goats...|$|E
40|$|Horses {{housed in}} small {{enclosures}} perform minimal exercise. A novel feeder system may promote exercise but may have behavioral consequences. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the ability of horses to learn to use a novel feeding system and determine the behavioral effects of its use. A dynamic feed station was developed to force horses to exercise to continuously access feed. The behaviour of five groups of two horses was assessed while being housed for three days in either a control (contained a simple <b>hay</b> <b>rack)</b> and research (with the novel feeder) paddock. In the research paddock on day 1, horses were taught to use the feeder by the observer. On day 2 (feeder operational) and day 3 (feeder nonoperational) horses were observed for 4 hours per day to determine speed of learning and incidence of aggressive behaviours between horses. Horses quickly learnt to use the feeder system. Learning was affected by domination relationships between horses. Dominating horses learnt faster and aggressive behaviours appeared to be amplified when the feeder was operational. To reduce the stress impact of the feeder system on horses, horses housed together should be well matched to avoid strong domination relationships. The dynamic feeder system could then be utilized more successfully to increase exercise in horses housed in small paddocks...|$|E

40|$|These days, {{especially}} in organic piglet production, {{it is necessary}} to reduce the production costs to be competitive on the market. A large proportion of the production costs are caused by labor and construction costs to ensure a high level of animal welfare. The farrowing pen of Wels, currently existing in prototype form, was designed to fulfill organic farming requirements, improve animal welfare, and minimize the costs for construction and labor. The housing system is characterized by four separate functional areas: the lying area, the excretion and moving area, the feeding area for the sow, and a piglet nest. To identify the working time requirements of routine and special tasks, a time study, based on the work element method and an electronic time recording system (ortim b 3) (a Pocket PC with time recording software), was conducted. The influencing variables and the time measurements were collected by directly observing work processes in the farrowing unit, which had 5 farrowing pens, over a period of 21 days at the “LFZ Raumberg Gumpenstein. ” The data were descriptive and statistically analyzed to obtain planning data on the element basis. The time requirement was modeled according to the related task and in total over the suckling period. The routine tasks consisted in transporting the feed to the pen, feeding the sows, monitoring the sows and piglets, mucking out the dung corridor with a tractor and sprinkling straw in it, as well as filling up the <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> The labor input was 3. 99 AKmin per sow and day in total. The special tasks included inoculating the piglets, marking with ear tags, castrating the male piglets, cleaning the whole pen and the dung corridor, and preparing the farrowing pen for the next sows. Special work required 25. 9 MPmin per sow over the keeping period of 21 days. The total working time requirements over the period of 21 days were 1. 82 MPh per sow. Overall, the farrowing pen of Wels has low time requirements and {{can be seen as a}} good alternative to the existing organic pens...|$|E
40|$|Pri svojem terenskem delu sem se velikokrat srečala s sušilnicami za sadje, ki so bile v času od 19. do ½ 20. stoletja, skoraj obvezen gospodarski objekt, na gorskih samooskrbnih kmetijah. Med leti 1950 in 1960 so sušilnice izgubile svojo primarno funkcijo, saj so v njih sušenje sadja opustili. Kljub temu pa so se sušilnice vse do danes ohranile v večjem številu. Evidententirala sem jih nad sedemdeset, vse so opuščene, le ena je še delujoča. V prehrani je imelo sadje na slovenskem zelo pomembno vlogo. Razvijalo se je skozi stoletja in desetletja, čeprav vedno v povezavi s poljedeljstvom in živinorejo. Zato je izročilo in dediščina o sadjarstvu pri nas pestra in bogata bodisi, da je povezana s sadjarskim poklicem ali dejavnostjo. Na sadjarsko dejavnost se navezujejo tudi objekti, ki jih uvrščamo med najmanjša gospodarska poslopja. To so sušilnice za sadje ali pajštve, ki pa sodijo med našo najbolj ogroženo stavbno dediščino, saj jih večina ni več v prvotni funkciji. V raziskavi sem se najprej usmerila v pregled virov in literature, ki predvsem obravnava sadne sušilnice in sušenje sadja. Pomembnejši avtorji so: P. Santonino, J. V. Valvasor, M. Pohlin, S. Rutar, A. Muznik ter Francijscejski kataster. Geografsko obravnavam Posočje. To je svet na zahodu Slovenije, kjer so razmere za gojenje sadnega drevja dokaj ugodne. Sušenje sadja, hrušk, sliv ter jabolk, v sadnih sušilnicah ali krušni peči, pa pretežno v uporabi do ½ 20. stoletja. Posebnost sušenja sliv in fig so Goriška Brda, kjer so sušili in žveplali sadje v t. i. kasonih ali na soncu (zraku). Sušenje na soncu je bilo značilno tudi za Vipavsko dolino. Sadne sušilnice sem evidentirala in inventarizirala med leti 1999 in 2002. Glede na zastavljene kriterije in obdelavo podatkov, pa jih razvrstila v tabele. Osrednji del raziskave pa je posvečen opisu ter tipologiji sušilnic /dimne, brezdimne, elektirične/, pripravam za shranjevanje suhega sadja in uporabi letega. From the {{historical}} {{point of view}} fruit has always had {{an important role in}} nutrition. Up to the mid 20 th century fruit-growing was a complementary activity to cultivation of crops and to stock-farming. The tradition and the heritage of fruit-growing are varied and rich, either those relative to the profession of the fruit-grower and to the activities of fruit-growing or to those relative to the buildings – drying-houses, which are the smallest farm-buildings in Slovenia. From 19 th century to the mid 20 th century the drying-house or "pajštva" was an indispensable part of mountain self-sufficient farms. Drying-houses lost their basic function between 1950 and 1960 when farmers stopped using them for drying fruit. In the introduction of my paper I present the sources and the literature that treat the subject of fruit-growing and drying-houses. Among the most important authors emerge P. Santonino, J. V. Valvazor, M. Pohlin, S. Rutar, A. Muznik and the 19 th century Austro-Hungarian cadastre. For the topography resp. for the recording of drying-houses I chose the region of Posočje. The land of Posočje is rather suitable for fruit-growing and the drying of fruit – – pears, prunes and apples – in drying-houses or ovens for baking bread was extensively practised till the mid 20 th century. A peculiar method of fruit-drying was in use in the area of Goriška Brda. There, fruit was dried and smoked with brimstone in "keson" or air-dried. Air-drying was in use also in the Vipava valley, for ex. apricots in the village of Budanje. I carried out the registration and the inventory of drying-houses between 1999 and 2002. After processing the data I classified the drying-houses and entered them in a table according to the set criteria. In order to make the survey more complete I entered the ruined and the partly ruined drying-houses as well. The table contains the following data: - EŠD (code number of the cultural heritage item if considered cultural heritage or a monument) - name of the drying-house - degree of preservation - typology - TTN (topographic plan) The paper is divided in several chapters. Besides the typology (drying with smoke, without smoke, electrically heated) I also described some old sorts of fruit trees, tools for gathering, picking, drying and storing of fruit and added some recipes for dishes with dried fruit. In the conclusion I describe the only drying-house still in use, namely the one belonging to the farm called "Pri Francu" in Kneške Ravne. The farm lies in an amphitheatre formed by the mountains Žabiški Kum, Vogel and Rodica and the slopes of Masovnik. The farm is situated higher than any other and its owners are proud and faithful to the traditional way of life. Their farm is a symbol of the past, perseverance, tradition and knowledge. The farm-buildings such as the "Kozolec toplar" (double roofed ridge top <b>hay</b> <b>rack),</b> the saw "venecijanka" (vertical frame one band blade saw), the wooden and the stone/brick barns, the basement with a smithy, the joiner 2 ̆ 7 s workshop and the drying-house are venerable buildings and conceal extraordinary technical achievements. The farm is surrounded by meadows, pasture-grounds and woods. At the border of the farm-grounds grow, scattered, old sorts of fruit trees of venerable age for the fruit-growing has been a tradition of the farm for centuries...|$|E

50|$|A linhay (English: , -nee) {{is a type}} of farm {{building}} found particularly in Devon, south-west England. It is characterised as a two-storied building with an open front, with tallet or hay-loft above and livestock housing below. It often has a lean-to roof, and the front generally consists of regularly spaced pillars or columns. Cattle linhays were used to house cattle in the winter with hay storage above. Due to the wide open front hay was easily thrown up into the tallet by use of a pitch-fork by a man standing on a hay-cart for storage after haymaking operations. The hay was kept dry by the roof {{and at the same time}} acted as insulation for the livestock below and was easily fed as daily rations to the cattle below by dropping it through openings in the floor directly into <b>hay</b> <b>racks</b> accessible to the livestock. A cart linhay stored carts and other farm machinery in place of livestock, with hay above. Linhays are now largely obsolete as in England cattle are generally housed in large pole barns with corrugated iron or plastic roofs and are fed silage, either in large round bales or in troughs, chopped up by machinery. These modern structures make possible feeding and mucking-out with large tractors.|$|R

The design was 3 feeding treatments: Control (C) - grazing with no supplement; Straw (S) - grazing with ad libitum barley straw; Lupin (L) - grazing with ad libitum whole lupin grain (Lupinus angustifolius) x 3 replicates each of 4 goats. Feeding began on June 26 and finished on August 18. From August 19 to November 17 all goats grazed together with green pasture availabilities> 2500 kg DM/ha. Intake of straw in S was 412 ± 59 g DM/head/day and intake of lupins in L was 723 ± 24 g DM/head/day. Animals in S wasted 57 % of the straw fed in the <b>hay</b> <b>racks.</b> L resulted in substitution of lupins for pasture. Feeding of lupins significantly increased liveweight {{at the end of}} winter and spring, and increased pasture availability and body condition at the end of winter. Supplements of low digestible straw provided no benefits in liveweight gain. Results indicate that to obtain liveweight gain during winter cashmere goats require green pasture availabilities significantly> 850 kg DM/ha. Supplementation did not affect cashmere production (mean ± se, total fleece weight 353 ± 15 g, cashmere weight 126 ± 9 g and cashmere fibre diameter 15. 2 ± 0. 1 µm). Weaner cashmere bucks exhibited only partial compensatory liveweight gain during spring.

60|$|They {{walked on}} the gravel across a green court, where the snow still lay in islets on the grass, and in masses on the boughs of the great cedar and the crenelated coping of the stone walls, and then into a larger court, where there was another cedar, to find the {{beautiful}} choir long ago turned into stables, {{in the first instance}} perhaps after an impromptu fashion by troopers, who had a pious satisfaction in insulting the priests of Baal and the images of Ashtoreth, the queen of heaven. The exterior--its west end, save for the stable door, walled in with brick and covered with ivy--was much defaced, maimed of finial and gurgoyle, the friable limestone broken and fretted, and lending its soft gray to a powdery dark lichen; the long windows, too, were filled in with brick as far as the springing of the arches, the broad clerestory windows with wire or ventilating blinds. With the low wintry afternoon sun upon it, sending shadows from the cedar boughs, and lighting up the touches of snow remaining on every ledge, it had still a scarcely disturbed aspect of antique solemnity, which gave the scene in the interior rather a startling effect; though, ecclesiastical or reverential indignation apart, the eyes could hardly help dwelling with pleasure on its piquant picturesqueness. Each finely-arched chapel was turned into a stall, where in the dusty glazing of the windows there still gleamed patches of crimson, orange, blue, and palest violet; for the rest, the choir had been gutted, the floor leveled, paved, and drained according to the most approved fashion, and a line of loose boxes erected in the middle: a soft light fell from the upper windows on sleek brown or gray flanks and haunches; on mild equine faces looking out with active nostrils over the varnished brown boarding; on the <b>hay</b> hanging from <b>racks</b> where the saints once looked down from the altar-pieces, and on the pale golden straw scattered or in heaps; on a little white-and-liver-colored spaniel making his bed on the back of an elderly hackney, and on four ancient angels, still showing signs of devotion like mutilated martyrs--while over all, the grand pointed roof, untouched by reforming wash, showed its lines and colors mysteriously through veiling shadow and cobweb, and a hoof now and then striking against the boards seemed to fill the vault with thunder, while outside there was the answering bay of the blood-hounds.|$|R
