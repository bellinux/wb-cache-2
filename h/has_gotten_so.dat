25|$|In recent years, {{medical records}} have changed considerably. Although many {{physicians}} and hospitals still maintain paper records, {{there is a}} drive for electronic records. Filing cabinets are giving way to desktop computers connected to powerful servers, where patient records are processed and archived digitally. This digital format allows for immediate remote access by any physician who is authorized to review the patient information. Reports are stored electronically and printed selectively as the need arises. Many MTs now utilize personal computers with electronic references and use the Internet not only for web resources {{but also as a}} working platform. Technology <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> sophisticated that MT services and MT departments work closely with programmers and information systems (IS) staff to stream in voice and accomplish seamless data transfers through network interfaces. In fact, many healthcare providers today are enjoying the benefits of handheld PCs or personal data assistants (PDAs) and are now utilizing software on them.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show <b>has</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E

Amidst growing public concern, social unrest incidents are growing around the country. For example, in December 2011 the government suspended plans to expand a coal-fired power plant in the city of Haimen after 30,000 local residents staged a violent protest against it, because [...] "the coal-fired power plant was behind a {{rise in the number of}} local cancer patients, environmental pollution and a drop in the local fishermen's catch." ...|$|E
