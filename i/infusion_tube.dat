40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals for health science {{educational}} programs is to support the development of evidenced based, critically reflective entry-level healthcare professionals who practice within a patient centered interprofessional model of care. Recognizing the importance of experiential learning in preparing students, Seton Hall University Core Signature IPE Experience employs social media innovations to immerse students in real life situations. Specifically, You Tube {{is used as a}} platform for students to meet “in person” patient/clients within their “real- life situations” during their didactic coursework. You Tube IPP immersion opportunities do not replace hands on activities within real life situations, but it does offer educators an alternate medium to engage students as active learners. You Tube IPP immersion experiences can be used to prepare students by allowing them to err without harming the patient, it also provides students the opportunity to build their self-confidence as entry-level health care professionals. This presentation will describe the You Tube IPP immersion experience used at SHU, discuss perceived benefits, and engage participants in collegial discussion addressing how to <b>infusion</b> You <b>Tube</b> IPP immersion opportunities within their educational curriculums. Results: Data on faculty and student perceptions regarding the You Tube IPP immersion opportunity used at SHU to provide students across health professional programs with a sustainable and consistent immersion experience will be shared. Conclusion and Relevance: As health science educators we must assess the utility of emerging web based technologies to assist us in meeting the needs of preparing interprofessional healthcare practitioners. The You Tube IPP immersion model used at SHU is one potential innovation that provides an opportunity to engage students across professions as they seek to learn from and with each other.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} 20 -, 23 -, and 25 -gauge retinal infusion air jet impact pressure (force per unit area) in an experimental setting. Methods: Experimental laboratory investigation. Infusion cannulas {{were connected to}} a compressed air system. A controlled valve mechanism was used to obtain increasing levels of infusion pressure. Each <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> was positioned {{in front of a}} manual transducer to measure force. Impact pressure was calculated using known formulas in fluid dynamics. Results: the 20 -gauge infusion jet showed similar impact pressure values compared with the 23 -gauge infusion jet. Both showed higher levels than the 25 -gauge infusion jet. This was because of the smaller jet force for the 25 -gauge system. Conclusion: in this experimental study, both the 23 - and the 20 -gauge air infusion jet showed higher impact pressure values compared with the 25 -gauge air infusion jet. This could be of concern regarding air infusion during 23 -gauge vitrectomy since retinal damage has been shown in standard-gauge surgeries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Duodenal acid {{infusion}} induces gastric {{relaxation and}} sensitization to distension in healthy volunteers. The acid-sensitive mechanism is still unknown. We hypothesized that 5 HT(3) -blockade can inhibit the acid-induced duodenogastric sensorimotor reflex in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Fourteen healthy volunteers {{were included in}} a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial. An <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> with attached pH-electrode was positioned in the duodenum and a barostat balloon was located in the gastric fundus. Proximal gastric volume and sensitivity to distension were assessed before and during duodenal acid infusion and after pretreatment with intravenous (i. v.) ondansetron (a 5 HT(3) -receptor antagonist, 8 mg) or saline. An overall perception score (0 - 6) and an assessment of nine dyspeptic symptoms by visual analogue scales (VAS) were obtained. Results are given as mean ± SEM. KEY RESULTS: Ondansetron {{had no effect on}} duodenal pH and on the acid-induced increase of proximal gastric volume (increase of 80 ± 20 vs 83 ± 15 mL after ondansetron and placebo; effect of acid < 0. 001, between treatments ns). After ondansetron, the overall perception score during duodenal acidification and gastric distension was significantly decreased compared with placebo (P= 0. 01). There was no effect of ondansetron on the individual dyspeptic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Ondansetron decreased gastric sensitivity during duodenal acid infusion and gastric distension. 5 HT(3) -receptors are involved in acid-induced duodenogastric sensitization, but not in the duodenogastric inhibitory motor reflex. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES Prior {{studies have}} {{established}} peak postoperative lactate and the vasoactive-inotrope score (VIS) as modest predictors of outcome following paediatric cardiac surgery. We developed a novel vasoactive-ventilation-renal (VVR) score and aimed {{to determine if}} this index, which incorporates postoperative respiratory, cardiovascular and renal function, would more consistently predict outcome in this patient population. METHODS We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective analysis of 222 infants at our institution less than 365 days old who underwent surgery for congenital heart disease at our centre from January 2009 to April 2013. The VVR score was calculated as follows: vasoactive-inotrope score + ventilation index + (change in serum creatinine from baseline × 10). For all patients, peak lactate and admission, peak, and 48 h VIS and VVR were recorded. RESULTS For all outcome measures, areas under the curve for 48 -h VVR were greater than its corresponding admission and peak values, VIS alone at all three time points and peak lactate. On multivariate regression, 48 -h VVR was strongly associated with prolonged intubation [odds ratio (OR) : 39. 13, P < 0. 0001], significantly more so than 48 -h VIS (odds ratio: 6. 18, P < 0. 0001) and peak lactate (odds ratio: 2. 52, P = 0. 017). The 48 -h VVR was also more significantly associated with prolonged use of vasoactive <b>infusions,</b> chest <b>tube</b> drainage and ICU and hospital stay when compared with VIS alone and peak lactate.

40|$|Decreased acid {{clearance}} {{and increased}} exposure to acid of the duodenum {{have been reported}} in a subset of functional dyspepsia patients. However, the mechanism by which increased duodenal acid exposure may affect symptoms is unclear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of duodenal acidification on proximal gastric tone and mechanosensitivity in humans. An <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> with a pH electrode attached was positioned in the second part of the duodenum, and a barostat bag was located in the gastric fundus. In 12 healthy subjects, fundic tone and sensitivity to distensions were assessed before and during duodenal infusion of 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid or saline in a randomized, double-blind design. In 10 healthy subjects, meal-induced accommodation was measured during duodenal infusion of acid or saline. Acid infusion in the duodenum significantly increased fundic compliance and decreased fasting fundic tone. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the pressures and the corresponding wall tensions at the thresholds for discomfort. During infusion of acid, significantly higher perception and symptom scores were obtained for the same distending pressures. The meal-induced fundic relaxation was significantly smaller during acid infusion compared with saline infusion. In conclusion, duodenal acidification induces proximal gastric relaxation, increases sensitivity to gastric distension, and inhibits gastric accommodation to a meal. Through these mechanisms, increased duodenal acid exposure may be involved in the pathogenesis of dyspeptic symptoms. status: publishe...|$|E

Methods: Thirty-seven eyes underwent 23 -gauge sutureless vitrectomy. Oblique sclerotomies were made parallel to the limbus and tangentially to the sclera. Once past the trocar sleeve, the angle was changed to 90 degrees perpendicular to the surface and the trocar and cannula inserted. Vitreous gel was removed until the intraocular edge of the infusion cannula was free from the gel. The cannula was extracted with insertion of a light probe. The sclerotomy site was evaluated endoscopically through another cannula in 32 eyes; in five eyes, another <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> was inserted into the cannula to maintain intraocular pressure, the original infusion was removed, and the sclerotomy site observed. Results: No vitreous incarceration occurred in 30 (94 %) eyes when one cannula was removed with insertion of a light probe, and minimal incarceration occurred in two (6 %) eyes. No incarceration occurred in five eyes with observation of the infusion site. Conclusion: The incidence of vitreous incarceration is low when a light probe or vitreous cutter is inserted. Inserting the light probe through the cannula during its removal and creating an oblique sclerotomy may reduce vitreous incarceration.

40|$|In sheep {{fitted with}} {{re-entrant}} cannulas in the proximal duodenum, secretory rates of acid in the abomasum increased with protein or buffering {{content of the}} rations. In sheep fitted with an abomasal <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> and with duodenal re-entrant cannulas, proteins and inorganic buffers continuously infused into the abomasum stimulated acid secretion. Intra-abomasal infusion of amino acids {{had little effect on}} secretion of acid. Soya protein, partly hydrolysed in advance, was a more active stimulator of acid secretion than unhydrolysed soya protein. Volatile fatty acids and L-lactic acid stimulated acid secretion slightly. After infusion into the abomasum of soya protein, partly hydrolysed in advance, or of a KHCO 3 buffer, concentration of gastrin in blood plasma increased. Infusion of α-alanine, β-alanine and glycine did not alter gastrin concentration. Pepsin activity of duodenal digesta did not correspond with that to be expected from abomasal secretion of pepsinogen. In tests in vitro, proteins inhibited pepsin activity. Blood flow in the abomasal mucosa, as measured by aminopyrine clearance, was not related to abomasal secretion of acid. Mucosal blood flow was measured in a feeding trial and after intra- abomasal infusion of soya protein or of a KHCO 3 buffer into the abomasum. Abomasal antral and pyloric contractile activity, recorded in sheep fitted with strain gauges, were regular. The pattern depended little on feeding regime, and was not affected by continuous infusion of soya protein into the abomasum. Discontinuous infusions of soya protein, of a KHCO 3 buffer, of amino acids, and of fatty acids into the abomasum showed minor effects on antral and pyloric contractile activity. The motility data indicated that propulsion of abomasal digesta into the duodenum cannot be explained by frequency and intensity of antral and pyloric contractile activity only...|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, in {{patients}} with suspicion of VUA leak an additional focussed investigation with conventional radiographic cystography or MDCT cystography is recommended. At our department diluted iodinated CM to be used during MDCT cystography is prepared by removing 40 – 50  ml of normal saline from a 500 -ml bag and injecting a similar amount of non-ionic contrast agent (such as 350 mgI/ml iomeprol or 370 mgI/ml iopromide) into the same saline solution bag. The bag is then connected to standard tubing for intravenous <b>infusions,</b> filling the <b>tube</b> with diluted contrast to avoid instilling air in the bladder. With the patient supine on the CT scanner table, slow retrograde infusion is obtained by gravity. Differently from conventional MDCT cystography to investigate bladder trauma and spontaneous colovesical fistulas, in postoperative patients the injected CM volume should not exceed 150  ml because of concern about excessive pressure on the newly created VUA. The volumetric MDCT acquisition at sufficient bladder distension is visualised with multiplanar image reformations at CT angiography window settings (width 600 – 900 level 150 – 300 Hounsfield Units, HU) and by maximum intensity projection (MIP) or 3 D-VR techniques.

Studies suggest that one-half of all harmful medication errors originate during drug administration; of those errors, about two-thirds involve injectables. Therefore, injection device management is pivotal to safe administration of medications. In this article, the authors summarize the relevant experiences by retrospective analysis of injection device-related near misses and adverse events in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, People&# 39;s Republic of China. Injection device-related near misses and adverse events comprised the following: 1) improper selection of needle diameter for subcutaneous injection, material of infusion sets, and pore size of in-line filter; 2) complications associated with vascular access; 3) incidents induced by absence of efficient electronic pump management and <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> management; and 4) liquid leakage of chemotherapeutic infusion around the syringe needle. Safe injection drug use was enhanced by multidisciplinary collaboration, especially among pharmacists and nurses; drafting of clinical pathways in selection of vascular access; application of approaches such as root cause analysis using a fishbone diagram; plan–do–check–act and quality control circle; and construction of a culture of spontaneous reporting of near misses and adverse events. Pharmacists must be professional in regards to medication management and use. The depth, breadth, and efficiency of cooperation between nurses and pharmacists are pivotal to injection safety.

Seven fish were randomly added to each tank {{at the start of}} the exposure phase. For determination of the PSOA concentration, samples were taken from the testing concentrations and the controls at − 24, 0, 24 and 96  h. For each test concentration, RFW was passed from a header tank into a pre-exposure glass mixing vessel containing a magnetic follower. The nominal flow rate of RFW to each mixing vessel was 35  mL/min which equated to five volume replacements per tank every 24  h. The water was mixed with a continuous flow of stock solution of PSOA in acetone or acetone alone for the solvent control. The stock solutions were contained in Becton–Dickinson syringes equipped with a 16 -gauge Teflon syringe <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> and delivered using Medfusion Syringe Infusion Pumps, Model 2001. Stock solutions at the appropriate concentration were delivered to the mixing vessel at a rate of 0.21  mL/h where they were mixed with the dilution water. The test solutions flowed through tubing directly to the appropriate tank at a continuously controlled flow rate. Excess solution was siphoned off with an overflow tube. The delivery of solutions to the solvent and non-solvent control tanks was identical to the treated tanks but excluded PSOA. The solvent control received acetone only from the infusion pump, which was mixed with RFW and the non-solvent control received only RFW. Dose solution delivery rates were confirmed daily for each tank by collecting the outflow of dose solution over a timed interval and measuring the volume. Temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and hardness of test water were also monitored throughout the study. During the in-life phase of the test, fish were observed at 1, 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96  h. Incidence of fish death was recorded and abnormalities noted.

40|$|Current sensors {{employed}} in medicine {{are used to}} detect chemical and biochemical abnormalities. Their applications range from biopsy (brain), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (spinal fluid), blood (bio-barcode), and sweat and urine bio-diagnostics where the primary focus is the selection of biomarkers that can pinpoint the occurrence of the disease. Emerging sensors for cholesterol detection are based on enzymatic functions, which degrade these molecules, where the signal can be visualized optically by using a transducer. Cholesterol is a steroid metabolite that is employed for the synthesis of steroid hormones, {{and the establishment of}} proper membrane permeability and fluidity. Since cholesterol is insoluble in blood, it is transported in the circulatory system within lipoproteins, complex spherical particles which have an exterior comprising of amphiphilic proteins and lipids with outward-facing surfaces that are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces that are lipid-soluble. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is known as ‘bad’ cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as ‘good’ cholesterol. LDL is linked to cardiovascular conditions such as atherosclerosis and hypertension, which ultimately lead to coronary heart disease, myocardial and cerebral infarction (stroke). An appropriate therapeutic response to a sensor system for cholesterol, specifically LDL, detection implicates the design of an implantable system for stimuli-responsive drug release. The proposed system was designed to detect specific biochemical changes by employing nanoparticles made of glyceryl behenate, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer, avidin, biotin and anti-beta lipoprotein antibodies as sensors. This was achieved by coating nanoparticles with antibodies specific to the antigen (i. e. LDL) to create an antibody-conjugated antibody conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles (henceforth known as ‘antibody conjugated SLN). Fenofibrate was used as a model drug due to its low water solubility and to its lipophilic properties similar to statins. The antibody conjugated SLNs were of 150 nm in size and had a zeta potential of - 28 mV. Their drug entrapment efficacy was 86 %, with a drug release of 16 mg/day due to Fickian diffusion and erosion mechanism. The slow release was due semi-crystalline structure determined by XRD and DSC. Antigen responsive hydrogel was designed by incorporation of thiolated antibody conjugated SLN via Traut’s reagents, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, methyl acrylic acid and polyethylene glycol 200. The osmotic pump was designed from polyethylene oxide, ethyl cellulose and mannitol. The drug reservoir was synthesized from ethyl cellulose coated gelatin capsule via coacervation phase separation method. The polymeric tube synthesized from ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and castor oil was coated with antigen responsive hydrogel. Ex vivo studies evaluating intravascular stability of the implant in correlation with mechanical analysis indicated the polymeric tube unstable. An 18 -gauge catheter was used for forming an <b>infusion</b> <b>tube</b> as a substitute for the polymeric tube. The implant showed a correlation of Korsmeyer-Peppas drug release during in vivo and in vitro studies. A constant drug release of 881 μg/day was observed during in vivo. This played a role in reduction of total cholesterol by means of reduction in LDL sub-fractions by 30 %; in correlation with LDL particle enhance clearance from the plasma due to SLN-LDL uptake. An increase by 46 % in HDL was observed, which correlated to fenofibrate therapeutic effect. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated improved mean residence time and efficacy. This indicated that the device could be used for delivery of lipophilic drugs and detection of circulating biomarkers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the threshold amount of constantly infused feed needed to trigger lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) {{in the right}} lateral position (RLP) and left lateral position (LLP). STUDY DESIGN: Eight healthy infants (3 male; gestational age: 32. 9 +/- 2. 4 weeks; corrected age: 36. 1 +/- 1. 3 weeks) were studied using an esophageal impedance-manometry catheter incorporating an intragastric <b>infusion</b> port. After <b>tube</b> placement, infants were randomly positioned in RLP or LLP. They were then tube-fed their normal feed (62. 5 [40 to 75] mL) at an infusion rate of 160 mL/h. Recordings were made during the feed and 15 minutes thereafter. The study was repeated with the infant in the opposite position. RESULTS: More TLESRs were triggered in the RLP compared with LLP (4. 0 [3. 0 to 6. 0] vs 2. 5 [1. 0 to 3. 0], P =. 027). First TLESR occurred at a significantly lower infused volume in RLP compared with LLP (10. 6 +/- 9. 4 vs 21. 0 +/- 4. 9 mL, P =. 006). The percentage of feed infused at time of first TLESR was significantly lower in RLP compared with LLP (17. 6 % +/- 15. 5 % vs 35. 4 % +/- 8. 02 %, P =. 005). CONCLUSIONS: In the RLP, TLESRs and gastroesophageal reflux are triggered at volumes unlikely to induce gastric distension. Michiel P. van Wijk, Marc A. Benninga, Geoffrey P.

40|$|The Netherlands, Oregon and Switzerland are {{the only}} areas {{in the world where}} {{assistance}} in dying has legally been practised in recent years. This article provides a detailed comparison {{of the history of the}} origins, legislation, monitoring systems and the extent of assistance in dying in these three places. It shows that the actual practice in Switzerland which, unlike Oregon, also allows assistance in suicide by means of <b>infusions</b> or gastric <b>tubes,</b> can today be technically quite similar to the permitted practice of active euthanasia on request in the Netherlands. Considering the preconditions restricting these practices, Swiss regulations are the most open, in that the law requires neither a medical second opinion (as in both the Netherlands and Oregon) nor the existence of a terminal illness (as in Oregon) as prerequisite to assistance in dying. In 2001, the proportion of assisted deaths (as reported to the authorities) in all deaths was almost ten times higher in the Netherlands (1. 5 % of all deaths) then in Oregon (< 0. 1 % of all deaths) or Switzerland (0. 2 % of all deaths). The analysis of the different normative concepts underlying legislation reveals that in the Netherlands the basis for non-prosecution lies in the conflict of the physician's duties to respect life versus relief of suffering, while in the USA and in Switzerland the right-to-die concept plays a major role. These two concepts allow appreciation of distinctions between the roles of the physician in end-of-life practices and between assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia...|$|R
