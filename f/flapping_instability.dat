We characterize the symmetry of this instability and its frequency. The intact liquid length is measured {{as a function}} of gas and liquid velocity, and turns out to be longer than the one predicted by Raynal (1997) for a planar mixing layer. The frequency of the instability is measured with a spectral method, and is in agreement with the frequency observed for the planar shear instability, though slightly smaller.

Our theory accounts for the various physical mechanisms at work: the finite length and the small but finite bending stiffness of the flag, the unsteadiness of the flow, the added mass effect, and vortex shedding from the trailing edge. Our analysis allows us to predict a critical speed for the onset of flapping as well as the frequency of flapping.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model of flapping wing structures for bio-inspired micro air vehicles {{is presented in}} this dissertation. Bio-inspired micro air vehicles (MAVs) are based on insects and hummingbirds. These animals have lightweight, flexible wings that undergo large deformations while flapping. Engineering studies have confirmed that deformations can increase the lift of flapping wings. Wing flexibility has been studied through experimental construction-and-evaluation methods and through computational numerical models. Between experimental and numerical methods {{there is a need}} for a simple method to model and evaluate the structural dynamics of flexible flapping wings. This dissertation's {{analytical model}} addresses this need. A time-periodic assumed-modes beam analysis of a flapping, flexible wing undergoing linear deformations is developed from a beam analysis of a helicopter blade. The resultant structural model includes bending and torsion degrees of freedom. The model is non-dimensionalized. The ratio of the system's structural natural frequency to wingbeat frequency characterizes its constant stiffness, and the amplitude of flapping motion characterizes its time-periodic stiffness. Current flapping mechanisms and MAVs are compared to biological fliers on the basis of the characteristic parameters. The beam analysis is extended to develop an plate model of a flapping wing. The time-periodic stability of the flapping wing model is assessed with Floquet analysis. A flapping-wing stability diagram is developed as a function of the characteristic parameters. The analysis indicates that time-periodic instabilities are more likely for large-amplitude, high-frequency <b>flapping</b> motion. <b>Instabilities</b> associated with the first bending mode dominate the stability diagram. Due to current limitations of <b>flapping</b> mechanisms, <b>instabilities</b> are not likely in current experiments but become more likely at the operating conditions of biological fliers. The effect of structural design parameters, including wing planform and material stiffness, are assessed with an assumed-modes aeroelastic model. Wing planforms are developed from an empirical model of biological planforms. Non-linearities are described in the effect of membrane thickness on lift generation. Structural couplings due to time-periodic stiffness are identified that can decrease lift generation at certain wingbeat frequencies...|$|R

First, we study the dependence of KH modes upon two control parameters, namely the liquid and gas velocities, and discuss the symmetry of these modes.

40|$|Developing {{optimized}} distributed protocols {{for large-scale}} networks is a challenging problem due to scalability and stability concerns. Scalability concerns can be naturally addressed by interpreting distributed protocols as a non-cooperative game of local protocol components attempting {{to maximize their}} individual utilities. One of the difficulties in implementing this approach is developing adaptive algorithms capable of learning of the expected utilities and adjusting the corresponding control actions {{for the purpose of}} approaching the solution to the corresponding game, and thus optimization of the global system performance. It is known that the best response by each component to its expected utility may result in unstable behavior and deterioration of the overall performance. On an example of cross-layer optimization of a TCP/IP network, this paper discusses the possibility of avoiding these undesirable effects by allowing the control actions occasionally deviate from their best response values. Using simulations, the paper suggests that (a) sufficient level of randomness in route selection improves the network performance by eliminating the route <b>flapping</b> <b>instability,</b> (b) the optimal level of randomness keeps the network within the stability region in close proximity to the border of this region, and (c) {{it may be possible to}} optimize the network performance by adjusting the level of randomness.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the compressible Rayleigh equation {{as a model}} for the Mach wave emission mechanism associated with high temperature supersonic jets. Solutions to the compressible Rayleigh equation reveal the existence of several families of supersonically convecting instability waves. These waves directly radiate noise to the jet far field. The predicted noise characteristics are compared to previously acquired experimental data for an axisymmetric Mach 2 fully pressure balanced jet operating over a range of jet operating total temperatures from ambient to 1370 K. The results of this comparison show that the first order supersonic instability wave and the Kelvin-Helmholtz first, second, and third order modes have directional radiation characteristics that are in agreement with observed data. The assumption of equal initial amplitudes for all of the waves leads to the conclusion that the <b>flapping</b> mode of <b>instability</b> dominates the noise radiation process of supersonic jets.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} 50 knees in 46 patients treated by arthroscopic removal of chondral flaps is reported. There was {{a relationship between}} the site of the flap and the type of symptoms; patellofemoral flaps produced anterior knee pain, posterior condylar <b>flaps</b> produced <b>instability.</b> At review after 18 to 36 months, after a second arthroscopy in eight cases, 44 ofthe 50 knees had retained significant improvement and 33 were symptom-free. Chondral flaps on the articular surface of the knee, which do not involve bone, were described by O’Don-oghue (I 966), Dandy (198 1) and Johnson-Nurse and Dandy (1985), but there have been no reports on the result of treatment. Chondral flaps must be differentiated from other conditions, including osteochondritis dissecans and articula r cartilage degeneration. Osteochondritis dissecans shows a bony component on radiographs and raw hone can often be seen arthroscopically. Soft degenerative fibrillation of articular cartilage has a distinct appearance (Fig. I) which {{is very different from the}} well-defined chondral flap surrounded by normal articular cartilage. Chondral flaps may be associated with an area of frank degeneration but this is easily recognised by the presence of an area of bare bone. latrogenic chondral flaps have a different shape; the edge of a sharp trocar produces long thin flaps (Fig. 2) in contrast to the thick flaps which produce symptoms. This paper reports a retrospective review of patients in whom chondral flaps (Fig. 3) were the main pathologi-cal lesion diagnosed and treated by arthroscopy.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a review and theoretical {{study of the}} added-mass and aeroelastic instability exhibited by a linear elastic plate immersed in a mean flow. We first present a combined added-mass result for the model problem with a mean incompressible and com-pressible flow interacting with an elastic plate. Using the Euler–Bernoulli model for the plate and a 2 D viscous potential flow model, a generalized closed-form expression of added-mass force has been derived for a flexible plate oscillating in fluid. A new com-pressibility correction factor is introduced in the incompressible added-mass force {{to account for the}} compressibility effects. We present a formulation for predicting the criti-cal velocity for the onset of <b>flapping</b> <b>instability.</b> Our proposed new formulation considers tension effects explicitly due to viscous shear stress along the fluid-structure interface. In general, the tension effects are stabilizing in nature and become critical in problems involving low mass ratios. We further study the effects of the mass ratio and channel height on the aeroelastic instability using the linear stability analysis. It is observed that the proximity of the wall parallel to the plate affects the growth rate of the instability, however, these effects are less significant in comparison to the mass ratio or the tension effects in defining the instability. Finally, we conclude this paper with the validation of the theoretical results with experimental data presented in the literature. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4025304]...|$|E
40|$|In air {{assisted}} atomization, small droplets {{arise from the}} stripping of the liquid jet (or film) by the fast gas stream [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Yet, the incoming liquid is never fully atomized by the stripping process alone. Instead, the remaining jet experiences a <b>flapping</b> <b>instability</b> [2], similar to the instability observed on liquid sheet configurations [6]: the resulting large scale structures (see fig. 1 a) break into large liquid lumps at some distance downstream the injection. Little is known on the underlying mechanisms of this instability, and {{on the characteristics of}} the large drops it produces, though these large drops most probably control flame extent in combustion devices. We therefore examine the break-up conditions as a function of two control parameters, namely the liquid and gas exit velocities. The break-up distance, given as the longitudinal extent of the liquid structure still connected to injection, happens to smoothly decrease with M=GUG 2 /LUL 2 (fig. 1 c). We also investigate the break-up mode, by considering the time evolution of the number of daughter drops versus time, and we sought to relate the size of the very first drops with the wavelength. The flapping frequency is a constant for given control parameters [2] but the wavelength increases with the distance to the injector. This behavior arises from the acceleration experienced by the large scale structures as they are convected downstream (fig. 1 b). This acceleration is found to be larger than the one due to gravity, indicating that the co-flowing air stream plays {{an active role in the}} spatial evolution of these structures. According to available observations, it happens that the size of the largest detached drop is directly controlled by the wavelength, and besides, that the number of daughter inclusions is a smooth function of the gas and liquid velocities. These findings will be discussed in more detail during the presentation...|$|E
40|$|Part I: A classic {{problem in}} the field of fluid-structure {{interaction}} is the flapping-flag instability. Fluid-mechanical studies of the phenomenon date back to the 19 th century, increased in number in recent years with increasingly accurate representations for the coupled fluid-structure interaction. The problem continues to attract attention because the effect of fluid forces and aspect ratio on stability is non-obvious. In {{the first part of the}} flapping studies, we examine three-dimensional effects on the flapping dynamics of a flag, modeled as a thin membrane, in a uniform fluid inflow. We consider periodic span-wise variations of length (ignoring edge effects) characterized by discrete span-wise wavenumber. Using linear stability analysis we show the increase in stability with discrete span-wise wavenumber. We confirm the stability analysis and study the nonlinear responses of three-dimensional flapping, using direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations on a moving body-fitted computational grid for thin membrane structure undergoing arbitrarily (large) displacement. We perform direct numerical simulations, initialized using normal modes we derive, up to Reynolds number 1000 based on L. For nonlinear evolutions, we identify and characterize the effect of span-wise variations on the fundamental modes and responses of flapping in terms of span-wise standing wave (SW) and travelling wave (TW) modes respectively in the absence and presence of cross flow; and their corresponding flag displacements and wake vortex structures. We report for TW, the flag flapping and vortex shedding frequencies and angles are matched, and are related to the corresponding shedding frequency of SW. When both SW and TW modes are present due to stabilization of drag by the cross-flow, the fluid-flag response trends to be dominated over time by TW with continuous wake structure. In the second part of the flapping work we investigate the absolute or convective nature of the instability of a two-dimensional flapping filament submerged in a uniform fluid inflow. When the structure-to-fluid mass ratio is zero, we show that two families of flapping waves exist, with phase velocities that are equal in magnitude and have opposite signs, increasing the mass ratio for a given Reynolds number increases the phase velocity of the waves propagating in the same direction as the flow, and decreases the phase velocity of the waves propagating opposite to the flow. Using a linearized energy conservation law we show that after a critical value of mass ratio is exceeded the <b>flapping</b> <b>instability</b> is sustained when the fast (positive energy) and the slow (negative energy) waves coalesce creating waves with zero energy which do not require an energy source or a sink to be sustained, and grow exponentially in time. Under such conditions an analytical condition for absolute instability is derived. We further show based on a group velocity criterion, that when the two characteristic speeds have opposite signs the instability is absolute, where as if they have the same sign the instability is convective. A range of mass ratio regimes is found where the instability is absolute and where it is convective; with the unstable flapping amplitude at the instability threshold, satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation. Part II: Accurate prediction of the highly mixed flow in the near field of a surface ship is a challenging and active research topic in Computational Ship Hydrodynamics. The disparity in length and time scales recognizes the importance of accurate bubble source and mixed-phase flow models; whereas the current state of the art models are adhoc at best. Second part of the thesis details the air entrainment characteristics in the incompressible highly variable density turbulent flow-field behind a canonical stern with the inclusion of simple speed/geometry/Reynolds number effects. Using high-resolution two-phase flow data sets generated from high fidelity simulations of a canonical stern simulated down to the scales of bubble entrainment. The study details key variables for: (i) characterization of wake structure, near-wake air entrainment and the nature of incompressible variable density turbulence, underlining the major implications and dominant terms by studying the dynamics of the continuity equation, the momentum equation, the density variance equation, the turbulent mass flux and the turbulent kinetic energy; (ii) the role of non-Boussinesq effects and turbulent mass flux in the wake of the stern, identifying the breaking event to be related to the air-entrainment and subsequent generation of turbulent mass flux and establishing the density intensity as an effective metric; (iii) develop and a priori validate novel multiphase models for turbulent mass flux and turbulent kinetic energy using gradient hypothesis and measuring the model performance for varied geometry/speed/Reynolds number effects. The first part of the thesis advances our understanding in varying applications ranging from the biomechanics of snoring, to improving novel designs for flow energy harvesters.

40|$|Miniflaps at the {{trailing}} edges of airfoils (e. g., Gurney flaps or divergent trailing edges) change the Kutta condition and thus produce higher lift. Unfortunately, however, the drag is also increased {{due to the}} flow separation downstream of this particular type of trailing edge. Therefore, the trade-off between beneficial and detrimental effects is considered in this paper. Various aspects of the flow on airfoils with Gurney flaps are addressed: (1) Transonic flow. Wind tunnel experiments {{have been carried out}} with a CAST 10 - 2 /DOA 2 airfoil with Gurney flap and at high subsonic flow speed. The lift to drag ratio is improved and the test wing behaves like one having a 20 % larger surface area. In addition, buffeting becomes less critical. (2) Selection of flap size. Detailed wind tunnel studies have been carried out with a low-drag glider wing at low subsonic velocities. The Gurney flap height was varied in six steps so that the most relevant parameter regime was covered. For the lift increase and for the device drag, simple empirical laws were obtained. Subsequently, for practical applications, a procedure for the selection of a suitable flap height providing a beneficial effect has been devised. (3) Drag reduction by wake stabilization.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and computational investigation {{was carried out}} to determine the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a flap side-edge. A porous side-edge treatment {{was applied to the}} flap side-edge in an attempt to reduce airframe noise. Measurements taken as part of the experimental study were forces, on-surface pressures, particle image velocimetry, hotwire anemometry and on-surface microphones. Oil flow was performed to visualise the on-surface flow. A detached eddy simulation was performed on a geometry that consisted of a main element and a half span flap to understand the flowfield. From the {{experimental and}} computational investigation four sources of vorticity in the flowfield were identified, i. e. the main element cove, the main element trailing-edge, separation on the flap suction surface, and the flap side-edge vortical system. These sources of vorticity interacted to produce a significantly unsteady flowfield above the solid flap surface. Three potential acoustic sources on the flap were identified. The first two sources were the turbulent shear layers that rolled up to form the flap side-edge vortex, reattaching firstly on the side-edge and secondly on the suction surface of the flap. A mid-frequency broadband hump was measured by an on-surface microphone at the point of reattachment of the turbulent shear layer on the flap side-edge. The third source was a low frequency instability in the off-surface vortex due to non-linear vortical interactions upstream of the <b>flap.</b> This <b>instability</b> was measured by a hotwire in the downstream vortex and by an on-surface microphone in the main element flap cove. The application of a porous flap side-edge had two favourable effects. Firstly, it reduced the magnitude of vorticity in the turbulent shear layer and the vortex. This reduced the magnitude of the hydrodynamic instabilities induced by the flap side-edge vortex. Secondly, it displaced the vortex further away from the flap surface due to the finite mass flux allowed through the porous material. This reduced the magnitude of the disturbances that interacted with the solid flap surface by moving them further away. The effect of applying a porous flap side-edge was most noticeable in reducing the mid frequency broadband hump in the on-surface microphone measurements.
