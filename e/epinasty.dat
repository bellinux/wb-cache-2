None of these mechanical stresses produced significant epinasties, but vigorous hand-shaking (120 seconds per day) generated minor epinasties, as did Ag+ applied daily (concentrations high enough to cause leaf browning).

For traits that strongly depend on environmental conditions, this can be extremely difficult and knowledge and collaboration with experts from other disciplines becomes essential. A well-known example is breeding for disease resistance. Here, we describe a similar approach to assist breeding against adverse leaf deformations that severely reduce the ornamental value of some chrysanthemum (Dendranthema × grandiflora) genotypes during greenhouse cultivation in winter. These leaf deformations occur rather unpredictably, but seem {{to be related to}} the increased use of assimilation light. To breed against this trait knowledge is needed (i) about inductive environments in which sensitive and insensitive genotypes are distinguishable, and (ii) about the physiological background associated with leaf <b>epinasty.</b> In this paper hypothetical physiological factors and mechanisms are discussed, which may mediate effects of light spectrum and greenhouse climate on leaf <b>epinasty.</b> One factor involved could be starch accumulation, since leaf <b>epinasty</b> usually aggravates after disbudding - a practice that most probably alters the sink-source balance. Additionally, light spectra can affect the circadian clock and thereby disturb starch synthesis and breakdown resulting in accumulation. Both within and independent of this process, plant hormones such as auxin and ethylene may play a role in leaf <b>epinasty.</b> This theoretical framework will be used to further investigate the physiological background of leaf <b>epinasty</b> and to come up with a test in which susceptibility for leaf <b>epinasty</b> can be assessed...|$|E

Pollen (one anther each) from Ruellia tuberosa L. (Acanthaceae) and Caesalpinia pulcherrima (L.) Sw. (Fabaceae) also increased ethylene production and caused early <b>epinasty</b> and fading.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{waterlogging}} the soil on leaf water potential, leaf epidermal conductance, transpiration, root conductance to water flow, and petiole <b>epinasty</b> {{have been examined}} in the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Stomatal conductance and transpiration are reduced by 30 % to 40 % after approximately 24 hours of soil flooding. This is not due to a transient water deficit, as leaf water potential is unchanged, even though root conductance is decreased by the stress. The stomatal response apparently prevents any reduction in leaf water potential. Experiments with varied time of flooding, root excision, and stem girdling provide indirect evidence for an influence of roots in maintaining stomatal opening potential. This root-effect cannot be entirely accounted for by alterations in source-sink relationships. Although 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid, the immediate precursor of ethylene, is transported from the roots to the shoots of waterlogged tomato plants, it has no direct effect on stomatal conductance.

40|$|The epinastic growth {{responses}} of petioles to auxin and ethylene were quantified in two developmental mutants of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). In the wild type parent line, cultivar VFN 8, the epinastic response of excised petiole sections was approximately log-linear between 0. 1 and 100 micromolar indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) concentrations, {{with a greater}} response to 2, 4 -D at any concentration. When ethylene synthesis was inhibited by aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), <b>epinasty</b> was no longer induced by auxin, but could be restored {{by the addition of}} ethylene gas. In the auxin-insensitive mutant, diageotropica (dgt), no epinastic response to IAA was observed at IAA concentrations that effectively induced <b>epinasty</b> in VFN 8. In the absence of added IAA, epinastic growth of dgt petioles in 1. 3 microliters per liter exogenous ethylene gas was more than double that of VFN 8 petioles. IAA had little additional effect in dgt, but promoted <b>epinasty</b> in VFN 8. These results confirm that tomato petiole cells respond directly to ethylene and make it unlikely that the differential growth responsible for <b>epinasty</b> results from lateral auxin redistribution. The second mutant, Epinastic (Epi), exhibits constitutively <b>epinasty,</b> cortical swelling, and root branching symptomatic of possible alternation in auxin or ethylene regulation of growth. Only minor quantitative differences were observed between the epinastic responses to auxin and ethylene of VFN 8 and Epi. However, in contrast to VFN 8, when ethylene synthesis or action was inhibited in Epi, auxin still induced 40 to 50 % of the epinastic response observed in the absence of inhibitors. This indicates that the target cells for epinastic growth in Epi are qualitatively different from those of VFN 8, having gained the ability to grow differentially in response to auxin alone. The dgt and Epi mutants provide useful systems in which to study the genetic determination of target cell specificity for hormone action...|$|E

To evaluate the effect of ethylene on potato tuber yield, a module was developed for an existing crop growth simulation model by incorporating the effects of ethylene on <b>epinasty</b> and photosynthesis. Explorations with the model showed that in a worst case scenario, ethylene-induced <b>epinasty</b> had only a marginal effect on tuber yield. Short-term exposures to ethylene under laboratory conditions inhibited photosynthesis, but it recovered within 48 h. When exposed to ethylene for longer than 12 h, irreversible damage of the photosynthesis apparatus occurred. Exposure to ethylene in the OTCs resulted in <b>epinasty</b> and reduced flowering.

Ethylene concentrations up to 800 ppb, administered 4 times weekly for 3 h during the growing season, did not affect vegetative growth and yield in fumigated potatoes. Under these experimental conditions, the modified simulation model incorporating the effects of ethylene on <b>epinasty</b> and photosynthesis forecasts a 5 percent effect on tuber yield at concentrations of 1600 ppb.

The UVR 8 effect thus mimics the effect of phytochrome (phy) B in red light. In addition, a meta-analysis of transcriptome data indicates that the UVR 8 and phyB signaling pathways have over 70 % of gene regulation in common. Moreover, in low levels of supplementary UV-B light, mutant analysis revealed that phyB signaling is necessary for <b>epinasty</b> of the blade edges. Analysis of auxin levels and the auxin signal reporter DR 5 ::GUS suggest that the <b>epinasty</b> relies on altered auxin distribution, keeping auxin at the leaf blade edges in the presence of UV-B.

The leaf angle of the treated plants was almost three times that of untreated controls. BR-induced <b>epinasty</b> appeared to be due to stimulation of ethylene production.

As ethylene production increased, the degree of petiole bending also increased, and inhibition of ethylene production by AOA or CoCl 2 also inhibited <b>epinasty.</b> BR-treated plants had increased levels of the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) in the leaf tissue. ACC appeared to accumulate primarily in the petioles with the greatest amount of ACC accumulating in the youngest petioles.

Simultaneous measurements were made of ethylene synthesized by the roots and shoots of tomato plants exposed to either aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres in the root zone. When the root zone was made anaerobic by a flowing stream of N 2 gas, petiole <b>epinasty</b> and accelerated ethylene synthesis by the shoots were observed. In soil-grown plants, ethylene synthesis by the root-soil complex increased under anaerobic conditions; but when grown in inert media under the same conditions, ethylene synthesis by roots remained constant or declined {{during the period of}} rapid epinastic growth by the petioles. Other characteristic symptoms of flooding, e. g. reduced growth and chlorosis, were also observed in plants with anaerobic roots. Pretreatment of plants with AgNO 3, an inhibitor of ethylene action, completely prevented <b>epinasty,</b> demonstrating that ethylene is the agent responsible for waterlogging symptoms. These results indicate that deprivation of O 2 to the roots is the primary effect of soil flooding, and that this is sufficient to cause increased ethylene synthesis in the shoot. The basis of the observed root-shoot communication is unknown, but root-synthesized hormones or specific ethylene-promoting factors may be involved...|$|E

It was found that horizontal and vertical shaking, twisting, intermittent horizontal rotating, and gentle hand shaking failed to induce epinasties that approached those observed on the slow clinostat.

Tobacco and Arabidopsis plants with elevated auxin and normal levels of ethylene were obtained by this strategy. Transgenic auxin-overproducing Arabidopsis plants were also crossed with the ethylene-insensitive ein 1 and ein 2 mutants. Analysis of these plants indicates that apical dominance and leaf <b>epinasty</b> are primarily controlled by auxin rather than ethylene. However, ethylene is partially responsible for the inhibition of stem elongation observed in auxin-overproducing tobacco.

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} {{ethylene}} {{is involved in}} many developmental processes, including fruit ripening, abscission, senescence, and leaf <b>epinasty.</b> Tomato contains a family of ethylene receptors, designated LeETR 1, LeETR 2, NR, LeETR 4, and LeETR 5, with homology to the Arabidopsis ETR 1 ethylene receptor. Transgenic plants with reduced LeETR 4 gene expression display multiple symptoms of extreme ethylene sensitivity, including severe <b>epinasty,</b> enhanced flower senescence, and accelerated fruit ripening. Therefore, LeETR 4 is a negative regulator of ethylene responses. Reduced expression of this single gene affects multiple developmental processes in tomato, whereas in Arabidopsis multiple ethylene receptors must be inactivated to increase ethylene response. Transgenic lines with reduced NR mRNA levels exhibit normal ethylene sensitivity but elevated levels of LeETR 4 mRNA, indicating a functional compensation of LeETR 4 for reduced NR expression. Overexpression of NR in lines with lowered LeETR 4 gene expression eliminates the ethylene-sensitive phenotype, indicating that despite marked differences in structure these ethylene receptors are functionally redundant...|$|E

Although cis-CA solution has been reported to act as a weak auxin, the vapor of cis-CA was found to induce <b>epinasty</b> of tomato plants similar to the effect of ethylene. This fact and the similarity of the structure and gaseous nature between the vapor of cis-CA and ethylene, led us to suspect that gaseous irradiated-CA might: (1) act as an ethylene analog; (2) induce ethylene synthesis in plant tissue; (3) act on the steps downstream of ethylene signal transduction pathway; or (4) act through an ethylene independent pathway. To test and distinguish these possibilities, an antisense l-arninocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase transgenic tomato plant (All) was employed. Our results show that the vapor of irradiated-CA failed to trigger the All fruit ripening, and it delayed ripening of banana fruit, indicating that the gaseous compound does not act as an ethylene analog. To further study the physiological functions of the vapor of cis-CA and differentiate it from ethylene, an ethylene-perception deficient tomato mutant (Nr) was used to circumvent ethylene disturbance. Unlike ethylene, the vapor of irradiated-CA was found to induce <b>epinasty</b> and the triple response of the ethylene-insensitive Nr mutant, as well as abolishing gravitropism of both wildtype and Nr mutant plants, indicating that the primary physiological functions of cis-CA and ethylene are different.

The version of record in Volume 65, Issue 17, pp. 4783 - 4793 is available online at: [URL] acid (2, 4 -D) is a synthetic auxin used as a herbicide to control weeds in agriculture. A high concentration of 2, 4 -D promotes leaf <b>epinasty</b> and cell death. In this work, the molecular mechanisms involved in the toxicity of this herbicide are studied by analysing in Arabidopsis plants the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), and their effect on cytoskeleton structure and peroxisome dynamics. 2, 4 -D (23 mM) promotes leaf <b>epinasty,</b> whereas this process was prevented by EDTA, which can reduce ·OH accumulation. The analysis of ROS accumulation by confocal microscopy showed a 2, 4 -D-dependent increase in both H 2 O 2 and O 2 ·(-), whereas total NO was not affected by the treatment. The herbicide promotes disturbances on the actin cytoskeleton structure {{as a result of}} post-translational modification of actin by oxidation and S-nitrosylation, which could disturb actin polymerization, as suggested by the reduction of the F-actin/G-actin ratio. These effects were reduced by EDTA, and the reduction of ROS production in Arabidopsis mutants deficient in xanthine dehydrogenase (Atxdh) gave rise to a reduction in actin oxidation. Also, 2, 4 -D alters the dynamics of the peroxisome, slowing the speed and shortening the distances by which these organelles are displaced. It is concluded that 2, 4 -D promotes oxidative and nitrosative stress, causing disturbances in the actin cytoskeleton, thereby affecting the dynamics of peroxisomes and some other organelles such as the mitochondria, with xanthine dehydrogenase being involved in ROS production under these conditions.

Experimental data are presented showing that 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), the immediate precursor of ethylene, serves as the signal. Xylem sap was collected from detopped tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. VFN 8). ACC in the sap was quantitated by a sensitive and specific assay, and its tentative chemical identity verified by paper chromatography. ACC levels in both roots and xylem sap increased markedly in response to waterlogging or root anaerobiosis. The appearance of ACC in the xylem sap of flooded plants preceded both the increase in ethylene production and epinastic growth, which were closely correlated. Plants flooded and then drained showed a rapid, simultaneous drop in ACC flux and ethylene synthesis rate.

To gain insight into this architecture in the absence of genetic markers for waterlogging tolerance, we compared populations of seedlings of each species for diversity in the expression of quantitative phenotypic traits induced by severe hypoxia. To determine the capacity for hypertrophied lenticel formation, we applied gas-impermeable mastic to stems of seedlings. Two months after application, the mastic treatment had induced the formation of 3 (± 2) cm– 2 hypertrophied lenticels in the absence of root hypoxia.

Of the total amount of label in the petiole sections, 24 to 30 % was located in the adaxial half and this distribution was not altered significantly by exposing plants to an atmosphere containing 50 μl/l ethylene. Thus when epinastic curvature is induced by ethylene there is no associated increase in the IAA content of the expanding adaxial half. The role of endogenous IAA in petiole <b>epinasty</b> was studied by restricting its movement with DPX 1840 (3, 3 a-dihydro- 2 -[p-methoxyphenyl]- 8 H-pyrozolo{ 5, 1 -a}isoindol- 8 -one). The leaf petioles still showed an initial epinastic response to ethylene. It is concluded that ethylene-induced <b>epinasty</b> is not dependent upon either any change in the transport of IAA or its redistribution within the petiole...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced {{ethylene}} {{production and}} leaf <b>epinasty</b> are characteristic responses of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) to waterlogging. It {{has been proposed}} (Bradford, Yang 1980 Plant Physiol 65 : 322 - 326) that this results from the synthesis of the immediate precursor of ethylene, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC), in the waterlogged roots, its export in the transpiration stream to the shoot, and its rapid conversion to ethylene. Inhibitors of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway are available for further testing of this ACC transport hypothesis: aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) or aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) block the synthesis of ACC, whereas CO 2 + prevents its conversion to ethylene. AOA and AVG, supplied in the nutrient solution, were found to inhibit the synthesis and export of ACC from anaerobic roots, whereas Co 2 + had no effect, as predicted from their respective sites of action. Transport of the inhibitors to the shoot was demonstrated by their ability to block wound ethylene synthesis in excised petioles. All three inhibitors reduced petiolar ethylene production and <b>epinasty</b> in anaerobically stressed tomato plants. With AOA and AVG, {{this was due to}} the prevention of ACC import from the roots as well as inhibition of ACC synthesis in the petioles. With Co 2 +, conversion of both root- and petiole-synthesized ACC to ethylene was blocked. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the export of ACC from low O 2 roots to the shoot {{is an important factor in}} the ethylene physiology of waterlogged tomato plants...|$|E
40|$|Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) D {{satellite}} RNA (satRNA) attenuates {{the symptoms}} induced by CMV in most plants, but causes leaf <b>epinasty</b> and systemic necrosis in tomato plants, where {{programmed cell death}} (PCD) is involved. However, {{our understanding of the}} cellular and molecular responses to the infection of CMV D satRNA that result in this lethal disease remains limited. In this article, we show for the first time, by histochemical and molecular analysis, that multiple defense responses are specifically induced in CMV and D satRNA (CMV/D satRNA) -infected tomato plants but not in mock-inoculated or CMV-infected plants. These responses include callose deposition and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in infected plants. Furthermore, the transcription of several tomato defense-related genes (e. g., PR- 1 a 1, PR- 1 b 1, PR- 2, and PR- 10) were activated, and the expression of tomato PR- 5 and some abiotic and biotic stress-responsive genes (e. g., catalase II and tomato analogs of Arabidopsis AtBI- 1 and tobacco hsr 203 j) are enhanced. The activation and increase in expression of these genes is correlated with the appearance of leaf <b>epinasty</b> and the development of systemic necrosis in infected tomato plants, while increased expression of the hsr 203 j analog precedes the development of any disease symptoms. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes as detected by RNA in situ hybridization point to the involvement of a complex developmental program that accompanies disease development resulting from CMV/D satRNA infection...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} genetic regulation of differential growth of plant organs, a dominant and semidwarf mutant, constitutive differential growth 1 -Dominant (cdg 1 -D), was isolated utilizing {{the technique of}} activation tagging. cdg 1 -D showed pleiotropic phenotype including dwarfism, exaggerated leaf <b>epinasty,</b> and twisted or spiral growth in hypocotyl, inflorescence stem, and petiole. Hypocotyls of cdg 1 -D were longer than those of wild type under light conditions. The phenotype was caused by activation tagging of CDG 1 gene that encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase of RLCKVII subfamily. When treated with high concentrations of brassinolide, light-grown wild-type seedlings showed long hypocotyls and strong leaf <b>epinasty</b> as observed in cdg 1 -D seedlings. Treatment of cdg 1 -D with brassinazole, a specific inhibitor of brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, did not rescue the mutant phenotype. Gene expression of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS AND DWARFISM involved in BR biosynthesis and phyB ACTIVATION-TAGGED SUPPRESSOR 1 that inactivates BR was repressed and induced, respectively, in cdg 1 -D plants, suggesting constitutive activation of BR signaling in the mutant. CDG 1 was expressed at a very low level in all the organs of the wild type tested. We isolated two independent intragenic suppressors of cdg 1 -D. However, they showed normal morphology and responded to BR {{in a similar manner}} to wild type. Taken together, CDG 1 gene may interfere with signal transduction of BR when overexpressed, but is not an essential factor for it in the wild type...|$|E
