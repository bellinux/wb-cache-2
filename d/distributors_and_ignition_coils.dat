50|$|The {{compressor}} housing was a welded steel sheet construction, divided in two parts. The upper half contained the fuel- and engine control systems, later also the automated starter control <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> for two ignitors {{located in the}} combustion chambers upper area.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{four-stroke}} engines {{have used}} a mechanically timed electrical ignition system. The heart {{of the system is}} the distributor. The distributor contains a rotating cam driven by the engine's drive, a set of breaker points, a condenser, a rotor <b>and</b> a <b>distributor</b> cap. External to the distributor is the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil,</b> the spark plugs and wires linking the distributor to the spark plugs <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b> (see diagram Below) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1980 Bosch K-Jetronic {{mechanical}} {{fuel injection}} was offered, {{leading to the}} 308 GTBi and GTSi; emissions decreased, {{at the price of}} a power drop to [...] on European models and [...] on federalized models. The fuel injection was coupled to a Marelli MED 803A Digiplex electronic <b>ignition,</b> incorporating a <b>coil,</b> <b>distributor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> module for each bank of cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame of}} the T140 is {{manufactured}} from mild steel tube and uses a 'duplex' layout. Twin rear adjustable shock absorbers provide suspension through a swinging arm, sprung and oil-damped front telescopic forks are used. The 19 inch diameter front wheel and 18 inch rear wheel were spoked with optional cast alloy wheels available from 1979 onwards. The under-seat area is occupied by the battery <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{ignition}} switch or starter switch is a switch {{in the control}} system of an internal combustion engined motor vehicle that activates the main electrical systems for the vehicle. Besides providing power to the starter solenoid <b>and</b> the <b>ignition</b> system components (including the engine control unit <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>coil)</b> it also usually switches on power to many [...] "accessories" [...] (radio, power windows, etc.). The {{ignition switch}} usually requires a key be inserted that works a lock built into the switch mechanism. It is frequently combined with the starter switch which activates the starter motor. The ignition locking system may be bypassed by disconnecting the wiring to the switch and manipulating it directly; {{this is known as}} hotwiring.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycles {{and older}} cars, which {{often have a}} {{carbureted}} engine <b>and</b> a single <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> <b>and</b> <b>distributor,</b> can be hot-wired from the engine bay. Using standard lock picking to start a vehicle is now usually ineffective, since most cars now use electronic chip or transponder verification.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of a magnetic reluctor and pickup in the <b>distributor,</b> <b>and</b> an <b>ignition</b> module to trigger the coil. Typically, Duraspark II distributors have both mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device <b>and</b> the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> <b>and</b> a rotary <b>distributor.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{distributor}} is {{an enclosed}} rotating shaft used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines that have mechanically-timed ignition. The distributor's main {{function is to}} route secondary, or high voltage, current from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the spark plugs in the correct firing order, and for the correct amount of time. Except in magneto systems, the distributor also houses a mechanical or inductive breaker switch to open <b>and</b> close the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil's</b> primary circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The straight-six engine used a {{one-piece}} iron {{block and}} non-detachable cylinder {{head with a}} crankcase made from Elektron, a magnesium alloy. It featured an overhead camshaft driven by a Bentley patented [...] "three-throw drive" [...] system of triple connecting rods with, like all earlier Bentleys, four valves per cylinder <b>and</b> twin-spark <b>ignition</b> (<b>coil</b> <b>and</b> magneto), which were state-of-the-art at the time. The engine had a bore of 110 mm and a stroke of 140 mm, giving a capacity of [...] Pistons were of an aluminium alloy.|$|R
50|$|Plunger rear {{suspension}} was offered later, with a swingarm {{rear suspension}} frame available from 1954. The model continued in production until 1959, {{by which time}} the traditional Lucas magdyno {{had been replaced by}} an alternator <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
50|$|The new {{detachable}} {{aluminium alloy}} cylinder head was fitted over inclined side valves and anodised aluminium alloy pistons. Pressure lubrication was supplied to the tappets, coolant temperature {{was controlled by}} thermostat <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> was provided with automatic advance.|$|R
50|$|In 1898 or 1899 Charles Metz of the Metz Company of Waltham, Massachusetts {{built the}} first US {{produced}} motorcycle. It used an Aster engine which was a copy of De Dion-Bouton's small, light, high reviving four-stroke single with battery <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{distributor}} cap has one post for each cylinder, <b>and</b> in points <b>ignition</b> systems {{there is a}} central post for the current from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> coming into the distributor. There are some exceptions however, as some engines (many Alfa Romeo cars, some 1980s Nissans) have two spark plugs per cylinder, so there are two leads {{coming out of the}} distributor per cylinder. Another implementation is the wasted spark system, where a single contact serves two leads, but in that case each lead connects one cylinder. In General Motors high energy ignition (HEI) systems there is no central post <b>and</b> the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> sits on top of the <b>distributor.</b> Some Toyota <b>and</b> Honda engines also have their coil within the {{distributor cap}}. On the inside of the cap there is a terminal that corresponds to each post, and the plug terminals are arranged around the circumference of the cap according to the firing order in order to send the secondary voltage to the proper spark plug at the right time.|$|R
50|$|Setting {{the idle}} speed, fuel/air mixture, {{carburetor}} balance, spark plug <b>and</b> <b>distributor</b> point gaps, <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> timing were regular maintenance items for all older engines {{and the final}} but essential steps in setting up a racing engine. On modern engines, equipped with electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>and</b> fuel injection, {{some or all of}} these tasks are automated, although they still require periodic calibration.|$|R
5000|$|In modern systems, the <b>distributor</b> is omitted <b>and</b> <b>ignition</b> {{is instead}} {{electronically}} controlled. Much smaller coils are used with one coil for each spark plug or one coil serving two spark plugs (for example two coils in a four-cylinder engine, or three coils in a six-cylinder engine). A large <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> puts out about 40 kV, {{and a small}} one such as from a lawn mower puts out about 15 kV. These coils may be remotely mounted {{or they may be}} placed on top of the spark plug (coil-on-plug or Direct <b>Ignition).</b> Where one <b>coil</b> serves two spark plugs (in two cylinders), it is through the [...] "wasted spark" [...] system. In this arrangement, the coil generates two sparks per cycle to both cylinders. The fuel in the cylinder that is nearing the end of its compression stroke is ignited, whereas the spark in its companion that is nearing the end of its exhaust stroke has no effect. The wasted spark system is more reliable than a single coil system with a <b>distributor</b> <b>and</b> less expensive than coil-on-plug.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{gasoline}} (petrol) {{internal combustion}} engines used a magneto ignition system, since no battery was fitted to the vehicle; magnetos are still used in piston-engine aircraft. The voltage {{produced by a}} magneto {{is dependent on the}} speed of the engine, making starting difficult. A battery-operated coil can provide a high-voltage spark even at low speeds, making starting easier. [...] When batteries became common in automobiles for cranking <b>and</b> lighting, the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> system displaced magneto ignition.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{designated}} M 56 S 6 or 212, was a twin-cylinder boxer configuration - {{four stroke}} with a flathead design. The BMW R12 with two carburetors used a battery <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition,</b> while R12s {{with a single}} carburetor used a magneto ignition, capable of working independently from the battery.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of ignition sparks {{was determined by}} measuring the volume (or mass) of hydrogen and of oxygen which combines at low pressures. The sparks were generated by a magneto <b>and</b> an <b>ignition</b> spark <b>coil.</b> It was found that with constant energy the amount of reaction increases as the capacitance component of the spark increases. The use of a series spark gap may decrease or {{increase the amount of}} reaction, the effect depending upon the amount and distribution of capacitance in the circuit. So far as the work has progressed, it has been found that sparks reported by other investigations as being most efficient for igniting lean mixtures cause the largest amount of reaction. Differences between the amount of reaction with a magneto spark <b>and</b> an <b>ignition</b> spark <b>coil</b> were noted. The method appears to offer a means of determining the most efficient spark generator for internal-combustion engines as well as determining a relation between the character of spark, energy, and effectiveness in igniting inflammable mixtures...|$|R
5000|$|For 2016, FCA {{released}} {{an updated version}} of the 3.6 L engine for the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango￼￼. This engine now featured two-stage variable valve lift (VVL), a cooled EGR, a new intake manifold, new fuel injectors, <b>and</b> new <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b> It also features upgrades to the variable valve timing (VVT) system, an increased compression ratio (11.3:1), lower internal friction and lower weight. The new engine also has MDS like the Hemi and will shut off two of its cylinders while driving and make it a v4 while cruising the freeway. These improvements help to increase power as well as efficiency. [...] The new version, however, has lost its flex-fuel capability.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between a trembler <b>coil</b> <b>and</b> a modern <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{is that in a}} modern coil the primary current is broken only once by the contact breaker for each cycle of the piston, creating a single spark. In the trembler coil, in contrast, each [...] "break" [...] of the trembler contact produces a pulse of high voltage from the coil. During the time the points in the timer are closed, the vibrating trembler arm produces a series of high voltage pulses, producing multiple sparks.|$|R
50|$|La Foudre (Lightening) was {{a pioneer}} of French {{motorcycle}} history. It used a 350 cc 'inlet over exhaust' Buchet engine. The inlet valve worked on the atmospheric principle, but the exhaust valve was operated by pushrod and rocker. It had an accumulator <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> system, <b>and</b> a Longuemare carburettor. It used both front and rear wheel brakes and 26 inch wheels.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{car engines}} have {{multiple}} <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> (one for {{each pair of}} cylinders) built into a coil pack, {{eliminating the need for}} a <b>distributor</b> <b>and</b> coil wire. Some car engines use a small <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> mounted on top of each spark plug, eliminating the need for spark plug wires entirely.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} studies {{were carried out}} on two compact {{electric}} discharge plasma sources for controlling nitrogen oxides (NOX) emission in diesel engine exhaust. The plasma sources consist of an old television flyback transformer to generate high frequency high voltage ac (HVAC) <b>and</b> an automobile <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to generate the high voltage pulses (HV Pulse). The compact plasma sources are aimed at retrofitting the existing catalytic converters with electric discharge assisted cleaning technique. To enhance NOX removal efficiency cascaded plasma-adsorbent technique has been used. Studies were reported at different flow rates and load conditions of the diesel engine...|$|R
5000|$|The race {{returned}} to the Nürburgring after {{a year at the}} Hockenheimring after the safety was improved on the track. The race distance was shortened to 12 laps. Notable driver changes included Vic Elford, who replaced Pedro Rodríguez. Jackie Stewart took pole and dominated the race, leading home a Tyrrell 1-2. Clay Regazzoni finished third with Mario Andretti, Ronnie Peterson and Tim Schenken rounding out the points. Mike Beuttler was disqualified on the third lap after entering the pits via the [...] "short chute", after suffering a flat tire just after passing the pits, and not wanting to drive 14 miles on a flat tire. Jo Siffert was also disqualified on lap seven for taking the short chute into the pits, after his right-hand lower front wishbone started detaching from the chassis <b>and</b> his <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> started acting up.|$|R
50|$|Both engines had a 106 mm stroke, {{meaning the}} 65 model {{measured}} 2,110 cc and the 75 model measured 2,810 cc The 75 model was predominately targeted towards export markets, given the additional £5 horse-power tax that was payable owing to its larger capacity. The straight-six engine featured side valves, a detachable head <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition.</b> There was a dry single-plate clutch and the gearbox had four speeds with silent third.|$|R
5000|$|A less {{expensive}} {{version of the}} Type 35 appeared in May, 1925. The factory's [...] "Type 35A" [...] name was ignored by the public, who nicknamed it [...] "Tecla" [...] after a famous maker of imitation jewelry. The Tecla's engine used three plain bearings, smaller valves, <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> like the Type 30. While this decreased maintenance requirements, it also reduced output. One-hundred thirty nine of the Type 35As were sold.|$|R
50|$|The ML 2.1 system {{integrates}} {{an advanced}} engine management with 2 knock sensors provision for adaptive fuel & timing adjustment, purge canister control, precision sequential fuel control & diagnostics (pre OBD-1). Fuel enrichment during cold-start {{is achieved by}} altering {{the timing of the}} main injectors based on engine temperature. The idle speed is also fully controlled by the digital Motronic unit, including fast-idle during warm-up. Updated variants ML 2.10.1 thru 2.5 add MAF Mass Air Flow sensor logic <b>and</b> direct fire <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> per cylinder. Motronic 2.1 is used in the Porsche 4 cyl 16V 944S/S2/968 and the 6 cyl Boxer Carrera 964 & 993, Opel/Vauxhall, FIAT & Alfa Romeo engines.|$|R
25|$|Some designs {{using an}} EMS retain the {{original}} <b>ignition</b> <b>coil,</b> <b>distributor</b> <b>and</b> high-tension leads found on cars throughout history. Other systems dispense with the <b>distributor</b> altogether <b>and</b> have individual coils mounted directly atop each spark plug. This removes {{the need for}} both <b>distributor</b> <b>and</b> high-tension leads, which reduces maintenance and increases long-term reliability.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasma is {{now being}} widely developed for simple surface treatment process and for fast medical tools sterilization. Plasma surface modification involves {{the interaction of the}} plasma generated excited species with a solid interface or coatings. The previous vacuum plasma system is not applicable and very costly. In the present project, we have developed the high voltage power supply and atmospheric pressure plasma using dielectric barrier discharge concept. The high voltage power supply was developed using a simple 555 timer <b>and</b> car’s <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b> Then, we investigate the plasma surface modification effect from the contact angle measurement and evaluate the roughness using surface profiler. We found that the contact angle decreased with the exposure time and surface roughness changed when exposed with atmospheric pressure plasma. It has been understood that a film coating will be create on glass and silicon surface when expose with atmospheric pressure plasma system in water vapor environment...|$|R
50|$|The BSA {{development}} team {{decided to}} keep costs down by re-using the well proven single sided front brake from the BSA Gold Star and the same full race camshaft as the BSA Lightning. Fitted with 12 volt electrics, a Zener diode voltage regulator <b>and</b> twin <b>coil</b> <b>ignition,</b> the Thunderbolt sold well in the important US import market and with the 3.5 imp gal fuel tank gave a range of 210 mi.|$|R
5000|$|Its F106 AB V8 {{engine was}} {{equipped}} with four twin-choke Weber 40DCNF carburettors <b>and</b> single <b>coil</b> <b>ignition.</b> European versions produced [...] at 6600 rpm (7700 rpm redline), but American versions were down to [...] at 6,600 rpm due to emissions control devices. European specification cars used dry sump lubrication. Cars destined to the Australian, Japanese and US market were fitted with a conventional wet sump engine from the GT4.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2004, the Avanza 1.3 S (series S) with {{automatic}} transmission launched to the market. The 1.3-litre engine was upgrade to use VVT-i (K3-VE) technology <b>and</b> individual direct <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b> Major changes in {{this version of}} Avanza occurred in the interior to change the odometer and digital tripmeter located beside the speedometer and tachometer. The braking system was upgraded to include anti-lock. The launch of this version is also designated as [...] "Test Market" [...] for the development plan of the All Avanza-Xenia VVT-i and Automatic Edition. This special edition comes {{with automatic}} transmission only. Only 200 units of Avanza Type S manufactured. A new exterior color (black) was added at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> (also {{called a}} spark coil) is an {{induction}} coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the <b>distributor</b> <b>and</b> the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b> A modern passenger automobile may use one <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables <b>and</b> a <b>distributor</b> to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, BSA {{introduced}} new short-stroke unit construction 500 and 650 cc parallel twins to replace their existing pre-unit long-stroke engines. Triumph modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650 cc parallel twins into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500 cc twins had been unit construction from their introduction in 1957. The decision by Lucas to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators <b>and</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> systems, {{was a significant}} factor in forcing the redesign.|$|R
40|$|An {{electric}} igniter for engine/hybrid vehicles is presented. The igniter comprises a flyback converter, a voltage-stacked capacitor, a PIC-based controller, a {{differential voltage}} detector, <b>and</b> an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil,</b> of which structure is non-contact type. Since the electric igniter adopts a capacitor to accumulate energy for engine ignition instead of traditional contacttype approach, it enhances the igniting {{performance of a}} spark plug effectively. As a result, combustion efficiency is promoted, fuel consumption is saved, and exhaust emission is reduced. The igniter not only is good for fuel efficiency but also can reduce HC and CO emission significantly, which therefore is an environmentally friendly product. The control core of the igniter is implemented on a single chip, which lowers discrete component count, reduces system volume, and increases reliability. In addition, the ignition timing can be programmed so that a timing regulator can {{be removed from the}} proposed system, simplifying its structure. To verify the feasibility and functionality of the igniter, key waveforms are measured and real-car experiments are performed as well...|$|R
