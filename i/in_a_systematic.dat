5|$|Another {{work from}} Ancient Greece that made an early impact on botany is De Materia Medica, a five-volume {{encyclopedia}} about herbal medicine {{written in the}} middle of the first century by Greek physician and pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides. De Materia Medica was widely read for more than 1,500 years. Important contributions from the medieval Muslim world include Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī's (828–896) the Book of Plants, and Ibn Bassal's The Classification of Soils. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and Ibn al-Baitar (d. 1248) wrote on botany <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> and scientific manner.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles. Animals were procured from private owners <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380000 animals as soon as 1945.|$|E

5|$|Poles {{were viewed}} by Nazis as subhuman non-Aryans {{and during the}} German {{occupation}} of Poland 2.7 million ethnic Poles {{were killed by the}} Nazis. Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry, internment, wholesale expulsions to make way for German colonists and mass executions. The German authorities engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> effort to destroy Polish culture and national identity. During operation AB-Aktion, many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested and executed, or transported to concentration camps. During the war, Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 percent of its physicians and dentists, 26 to 57 percent of its lawyers, 15 to 30 percent of its teachers, 30 to 40 percent of its scientists and university professors and 18 to 28 percent of its clergy.|$|E
5|$|The first paper, {{written with}} Jordan and Kundt, is a {{treatise}} {{on how to}} characterize exact solutions to Einstein's field equations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> way. The analysis presented there uses tools from differential geometry such as the Petrov classification of Weyl tensors (that is, {{those parts of the}} Riemann tensor describing the curvature of space-time that are not constrained by Einstein's equations), isometry groups and conformal transformations. This work also includes the first definition and classification of pp-waves, a class of simple gravitational waves.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
