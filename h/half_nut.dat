50|$|A {{lead screw}} is {{sometimes}} {{used with a}} split nut also called <b>half</b> <b>nut</b> which allows the nut to be disengaged from the threads and moved axially, independently of the screw's rotation, when needed (such as in single-point threading on a manual lathe).|$|E
50|$|Some lathes {{have only}} one {{leadscrew}} that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For screw cutting, a <b>half</b> <b>nut</b> is engaged {{to be driven by}} the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into the leadscrew to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the lathe bed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} trapezoidal thread form, {{and still}} probably {{the one most}} commonly encountered worldwide, is the Acme thread form ( [...] ). The Acme thread was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point threading or die than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires tool bit or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and it makes for smoother engagement of the <b>half</b> <b>nuts</b> on a lathe leadscrew than square does.|$|R

40|$|The rate {{at which}} fallen hickory nuts are removed from beneath the parent tree, and the effect on this rate of the seed {{predator}} Conotrachelus affinis, was studied in an oak-hickory forest in southeastern Michigan, USA, during {{a year in which}} few nuts were produced. The trees responded to Conotrachelus, which destroyed <b>half</b> the <b>nut</b> crop, by aborting inviable nuts during the summer. The seed dispersers, mostly gray squirrels, removed fallen nuts rapidly, showing the ability to distinguish viable nuts and remove them preferentially. The number of nuts removed in a week varies directly with the number available, and removal rate increases when many viable nuts are falling. The death of most seeds before dispersal, and the squirrels' efficiency at foraging on nuts and recovering them after burial, imply that successful hickory reproduction takes place only in years of heavy nut production. ...|$|R

500|$|In an aside, {{the narrator}} tells {{the reader that}} the couple had great {{quantities}} of nuts because they never lost them, noting that most squirrels lose <b>half</b> their <b>nuts</b> because they cannot remember where they buried them. Silvertail is the most forgetful of squirrels in the wood, and, while trying to find his nuts, digs up another squirrel's hoard. A commotion erupts among the nutting squirrels, and, as ill luck would have it, a flock of birds fly by singing [...] "Who's bin [...] digging-up my nuts?" [...] and [...] "Little bit-a-bread and-no-cheese!" [...] One bird finds a perch in the bush where Timmy is working and continues to sing about digging up nuts. The other squirrels take notice, suspect Timmy of robbing others of their hoards, rush upon him, scratch and cuff him, chase him up a tree, and stuff him with great difficulty through the woodpecker's hole. Silvertail suggests they leave him there until he confesses.|$|R
50|$|The Allegheny chinquapin {{is closely}} related to the American chestnut, Castanea dentata, and both trees {{can be found in the}} same habitat. Allegheny chinquapin can be {{distinguished}} by its smaller <b>nut</b> (<b>half</b> the size of a chestnut) that is not flattened (chestnuts are flattened on one side). The leaves of the Allegheny chinquapin are smaller than the American chestnut and have less distinct teeth. Allegheny chinquapin, however, is less susceptible to the chestnut blight fungus that devastated the American chestnut. While the chinquapin does blight to some degree, it continues to send out suckers that will produce fruit. Chinquapins are quite vulnerable nevertheless, and there are many reports of heavily diseased and cankered trees.|$|R
50|$|The {{trees of}} D. turbinatus are lofty, growing 30-45m tall. The bark is gray or dark brown, and is shallowly {{longitudinally}} fissured and flaky. Branchlets are glabrescent. The leaf buds are falcate, with both buds and young twigs densely gray and puberulous. The stipules are 2-6 cm, densely, shortly dark grayish or dark yellow puberulous; the petiole is 2-3 cm, densely gray puberulous or glabrescent; the leaf blade is ovate-oblong, 20-30 × 8-13 cm, leathery, glabrous or sparsely stellate pubescent, lateral veins are in 15-20 pairs conspicuously raised abaxially, base rounded or somewhat cordate, margin entire or sometimes sinuate, apex acuminate or acute. The racemes are axillary, 3-6-flowered. Calyx segments are 2 linear, 3 shorter, all glabrous, outside glaucous. The stamens are about 30; anthers linear-lanceolate; connective appendages filiform. The ovary is densely pubescent; style terete, silvery gray tomentose on lower <b>half.</b> The <b>nut</b> is ovoid or narrowly ovoid, densely appressed tomentose; the calyx tube {{is up to}} 2.8 cm in diameter, glabrous and glaucous; the winglike calyx segments are linear-lanceolate, 12-15 × ca. 3 cm, glabrous, minutely papillate near much-ramified solitary midvein. Flowering is from March to April, and fruiting occurs in June and July.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} timing {{strategies are}} used for collecting the fallen nuts. The first is to harvest early, when about <b>half</b> of the <b>nuts</b> have fallen. With less material on the ground, the harvester can work faster with less chance of a breakdown. The second option is to wait for all the nuts to fall before harvesting. Although the first option is considered the better of the two, two or three passes do take more time to complete than one. Weather also must be a consideration. Rain inhibits harvest and should a farmer wait for all the nuts to fall after a rainy season, it becomes {{much more difficult to}} harvest. Pickup also varies with how many acres are being farmed as well as the number of sweepers, harvesters, nut carts, and forklifts available.|$|R
50|$|Spion Kop College {{continued}} the tradition and philosophy, but other activities achieved prominence. A {{great deal of}} building was done and so students were involved in brick making, carpentry, and building construction. On the extensive farm lands, they helped with gardening, milking and harvesting. The repair shop sharpened ploughs and repaired trucks. In addition there were particular enterprises to provide work for the students and an income for the College, such as the clothing factory in which some fourteen students worked. Payment for one completed buttonhole was one and a <b>half</b> pence. A <b>nut</b> butter factory was started to provide a non-dairy spread which was {{in harmony with the}} health principles of the College. Students were required to work 30 hours a month, for which they were paid.|$|R

This work has involved {{the use of}} the Naval Postgraduate School's TRITECH ST 725 high frequency mechanically scanned sonar system to acquire sonar images of simulated surface roughness on an aluminum plate. Signal post processing for such image data is reviewed, and post processed data is analyzed and compared to the known roughness locations on the plate. The simulated roughness pattern of one <b>half</b> inch steel <b>nuts</b> is used as a preliminary experiment in the developemnt of a sonar detection system for marine growth on ship hull plating. Such a sonar system will {{be an integral part of}} any ship hull cleaning robot (SHACR). Contained in this report is a description of the experimental arrangement, typical sonar returns, a summary of image processing techniques, and results of processed data.

40|$|Genus Vatica L. {{is one of}} {{the largest}} groups in the family Dipterocarpaceae with 71 species have been botanically described, {{distributed}} from India, Sri Lanka to Myanmar, Indochina, Sumatra, Borneo and the Philippines. Borneo with 35 species has the largest representative. In Sarawak, 32 species have been recorded, occurring especially in mixed and upper dipterocarp forests and also non-saline habitats from sea level up to about 1, 800 m altitude. Kubah National Park is among the richest site for genus Vatica in Sarawak with 11 species recorded. The Vatica species are distinguished from other genera of Dipterocarpaceae by the absence of looped intra-marginal nerves on leaf, winged fruits encloses less than <b>half</b> of the <b>nut,</b> glabrous anthers and stout style. However, in term of inter species within its genus, Vatica is the most difficult dipterocarp to be identified, which explains why this common genus so poorly known. This study was conducted to examine leaves characteristics particularly its micro morphology to differentiate some selected Vatica species from Kubah National Park. Leaves samples were observed via Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM). The characteristics and indumentums were compared between each species and noted. Results show that leaf micro morphology characteristics are significantly useful to differentiate the species level and intra-specific level...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a century, {{northern}} Bolivia has had a tradition of commercial forest exploitation. For several decades into the twentieth century, the extraction of rubber and Brazil nuts was combined with subsistence agriculture, resulting in an agro-extractive cycle that fostered a sedentary lifestyle of forest dwellers. The extraction of rubber and Brazil nuts used to be organized in a debt-peonage system, often leaving extractivists in debt to the patron. The decline of the Bolivian rubber market during the 1980 s induced {{the breakdown of the}} agro-extractive cycle. Most people left the patron-controlled extraction areas (barracas), and either established themselves as farmers in independent communities close to urban areas or migrated to the cities where the processing of forest products had increased job opportunities. About <b>half</b> the Brazil <b>nut</b> collectors are now seasonal migrants, mainly from the cities. Depending on access to land, forest resources, and markets, extraction-based income can contribute to more than 50 % of the overall household income, especially in the more remote forest settlements. Some processing plants gain direct access to tbe Brazil nut resource base through vertical integration, thereby increasing their control of the production process. These large enterprises partly take over the role of the former patrons (e. q. on making advance payments to the Brazil nut collectors). The increasing demand for Brazil nuts and the increased in-country processing in Bolivia has benefited all participants in the production process, including the collectors. Especially the collectors from independent communities manage to get a higher price for the nuts they collect. Even so, an unequal exchange continues to be characteristic of many non-timber-forest-products-based (NTFP-based) production systems. In addition, more recent extractive activities (e. q. logging and palm-heart extraction) are threatened by depletion of the resource area. None of the extractive activities thus fulfills all the criteria of sustainable developmen...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{close-up}} of a specimen of branches from a scrub oak (quercus dumosa), ca. 1920. The edges of the leaves are curly and have prickly points {{at the end of}} each curve. The branch holds several acorns (still attached) and a large circular ball (fruit?). "This is a large group of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs that are found wild throughout Europe, Asia, northern Africa, and North and South America. Some require tropical or sub-tropical conditions to survive, while the majority are hardy in the North. The Oaks are varied in their appearance; it is hard to believe that some kinds can be classified with the same species. They do, however, have one characteristic in common, which is the fact that their seeds are carried in little caps. Acorns vary considerably with the different kinds of Oak trees. Some have stalked or stalkless caps; in some, the caps only enclose the base of the acorn, while in some, only the tip peaks out. Some caps are rough because they're made of irregular scales; others are smooth because their scales are even and smooth. Some acorns mature six months after the flowers appear and some take as long as 18 months to ripen. Male and female flowers appear on the same tree. The male flowers are borne in noticeable thin, catkins and the inconspicuous female flowers are produced two or more, or sometimes singly on a short stalk. As mentioned above, some Oaks lose their leaves and some don't and some need warmer climates than others. A few will be described for each of these characteristics. " [...] unknown author.; "North American leaf-losing Oaks are divided into two groups. One is the White Oak group, in which the leaves and lobes of the leaves don't end in bristles, and the acorns ripen during the first year; the other is the Black Oak group, which produces acorns that ripen the second year and the lobes of the leaves are usually tipped with bristles. Q. alba, the White Oak, is a native from Maine to Florida and Texas. This tree is one of the largest of the trees. On average, they will grow from 60 to 80 feet high, but they frequently grow much larger. The leaves are from 5 to 9 inches in length and about half that in width. They have from 5 to 9 (usually 7) rounded lobes. They are smooth, bright green above and whitish beneath. The acorns have short stalks. They are egg-shaped, light brown and shiny, about 3 / 4 -inch in length. Only about a quarter of their length is covered by the cap. In the autumn, the foliage turns a beautiful purplish-red color. Q. coccinea, the Scarlet Oak, is a member of the Black Oak group (the former, Q. alba, was a member of the White Oak group). This is one of the most beautiful of the American Oaks. It grows up to 80 feet high with a diameter of 1 or 2 feet. When young, it has a somewhat pyramidal crown, but as it gets older it develops a broad, round head. The leaves are from 3 to 6 inches long. There are from 5 to 9 long, narrow lobes, which are tipped with bristles and sparingly toothed. The tops of the leaves are dark green and glossy and below they are paler and fairly smooth. The nuts are light reddish-brown with a brown cap, which covers about <b>half</b> of the <b>nut.</b> In the fall, the leaves turn a gorgeous scarlet. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
