50|$|Therapy {{regarding}} deep {{fungal infections}} {{should be provided}} with amphotericin B therapy. Oral ketoconazole with topical <b>enilconazole</b> {{has been found to}} help treat skin lesions. Animal treatment is usually done with itraconazole or ketoconazole; most European countries use off label terbinafine in cats and dogs. However the most common antifungal drug used for systemic use is griseofulvin because it’s often the cheapest; treatment is usually on a common dose regimen of 50 mg per kg every twelve to twenty four hours. Most of these administered drugs are variants of imidazoles. The treatment of onychomycosis involves the administration of itraconazole with systemic griseofulvin in combination with topical <b>enilconazole,</b> sometimes a ciclopiroxolamine solution and systemic terbinafine is used. The mistreatment of fungal pathogens is due to the thought of bacterial infection and the administration of corticosteroids. This causes a change in appearance of the lesion and can lead to a harder diagnosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of rhinotomy and surgical debridement associated with topical administration of 2 per cent <b>enilconazole</b> and oral itraconazole in dogs with severe or recurrent sinonasal aspergillosis. METHODS A standard rhinotomy was performed on seven dogs. In the initial study, the bone flap was left attached cranially and replaced {{at the end of the}} procedure. In the main study group, the bone flap was discarded. Nasal passages were debrided and irrigated with <b>enilconazole</b> solution for one hour. Oral itraconazole was administered to four dogs for one month postoperatively. Follow-up rhinoscopy was performed in all dogs. RESULTS All three dogs in the initial study had recurrence of the disease and two dogs had a second surgery to remove the flap. The main study group included four dogs in which the flap was initially removed, and the two dogs from the initial study that required a second surgery. At follow-up rhinoscopy, five dogs were free of aspergillus but had bacterial or inflammatory rhinitis and one dog had a small aspergilloma but was subsequently asymptomatic. Telephone follow-up revealed that four dogs were asymptomatic, one dog had intermittent sneezing and serous nasal discharge, and one dog had intermittent epistaxis.

40|$|Dermatophytes are a {{group of}} keratinophilic and keratinolytic molds, {{some of which are}} {{responsible}} for ringworm. Among them Trichophyton equinum, which mostly infects equids, can cause extensive outbreaks in stud farms. The conventional treatment of equine trichophytosis is topic, based upon medicated shampoos to reduce the spread of infection among the animals. Nevertheless the popularity of phytotherapy is at an all-time peak, and the interest for natural alternatives or complements to conventional drug therapy is challenging both in human and veterinary field. Among herbal remedia Tea Tree Oil (TTO) shows a wide range of antimicrobial activities. A randomized open clinical trial was carried out on 60 thoroughbred breeding horses affected by equine ringworm. The animals were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 subjects. Diagnostic criteria were the presence of clinical signs and positive T equinum culture. Specificity control using TTO mixture in 5 not dermatophyte affected animals was achieved also. The antimycotic activity against T equinum of a mixture containing 25 % TTO in sweet almond oil, was evaluated in vivo treating 30 subjects, the others were administered <b>enilconazole</b> 2 % solution. The animals of both groups were topically treated twice a day for 15 days with a 25 % mixture of TTO diluted in sweet almond oil and every 3 days, four times with <b>enilconazole</b> rinses, respectively.

All the treated animals showed complete clinical and aetiological healing. Part of control subjects also, showed an improvement and none of them exacerbate the lesions. This therapeutic protocol appears to be effective and versatile, being applicable immediately after physical examination, prior to have the laboratory response.

We describe a simple method to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antifungal agents that involves adding zoospores to various drug concentrations in 96 well plates and microscopic observation after four days. We report results from testing 10 commercially available antifungal compounds: benzalkonium chloride (< 0. 78 μg/ml), povidone iodine (312. 5 μg/ml), amphotericin B (3. 125 μg/ml), fluconazole (< 1. 56 μg/ml), itraconazole (< 1. 56 μg/ml), <b>enilconazole</b> (< 1. 56 μg/ml), mercurochrome (6. 25 μg/ml), sodium chloride (12. 5 mg/ml), methylene blue (< 1. 56 μg/ml) and Virkon (3. 125 μg/ml).

40|$|Imazalil (IMA) is {{a widely}} used imidazole-antifungal {{pesticide}} and, therefore, a food contaminant. This compound is also used as a drug (<b>enilconazole).</b> As intestine is the first site of exposure to ingested drugs and pollutants, we have investigated the effects of IMA, at realistic intestinal concentrations, on xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and efflux pumps by using Caco- 2 cells, as a validated in vitro model of the human intestinal absorptive epithelium. For comparison, other conazole fungicides, i. e. ketoconazole, propiconazole and tebuconazole, were also studied. IMA induced cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A 1 activity {{to the same extent}} as benzo(a) pyrene (B(a) P) or 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Moreover, IMA strongly inhibited the CYP 3 A 4 activity in 1, 25 -vitamin D(3) -induced Caco- 2 cells. The other fungicides had weak or nil effects on CYP activities. Study of the apical efflux pump activities revealed that ketoconazole inhibited both P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP- 2) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), whereas IMA and other fungicides did not.

Simulsol 1292, Tween 80, Cremophor RH 40, ethanol and both drugs reduced the fatty acid release. C 8, C 10 and C 12 fatty acids, originating from oil hydrolysis, were able to reverse the inhibitory effect of phospholipids present in the release medium. Similarly Cremophor RH 40 lost its inhibitory capacities in combination with Captex 200 P hydrolysis. In addition, UC 781 did not decrease fatty acid release in combination with a Captex 200 P-Tween 80 -ethanol mixture. The release of UC 781 from smedds significantly increased compared to the dissolution of the pure drug. The drug release profiles were characterized by rapid and complete release followed by precipitation. In order to detect possible correlations between drug release and oil digestion, release results were compared to those of vehicle digestion experiments. Contrary to what one would assume, a higher extent of fatty acid liberation did not enhance drug release.

40|$|OVERVIEW: Dermatophytosis, usually {{caused by}} Microsporum canis, {{is the most}} common fungal {{infection}} in cats worldwide, {{and one of the most}} important infectious skin diseases in this species. Many adult cats are asymptomatic carriers. Severe clinical signs are seen mostly in kittens or immunosuppressed adults. Poor hygiene is a predisposing factor, and the disease may be endemic in shelters or catteries. Humans may be easily infected and develop a similar skin disease. INFECTION: Infectious arthrospores produced by dermatophytes may survive in the environment for about a year. They are transmitted through contact with sick cats or healthy carriers, but also on dust particles, brushes, clothes and other fomites. DISEASE SIGNS: Circular alopecia, desquamation and sometimes an erythematous margin around central healing ('ringworm') are typical. In many cats this is a self-limiting disease with hair loss and scaling only. In immunosuppressed animals, the outcome may be a multifocal or generalised skin disease. DIAGNOSIS: Wood's lamp examination and microscopic detection of arthrospores on hairs are simple methods to confirm M canis infection, but their sensitivity is relatively low. The gold standard for detection is culture on Sabouraud agar of hairs and scales collected from new lesions. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: In shelters and catteries eradication is difficult. Essential is a combination of systemic and topical treatments, maintained for several weeks. For systemic therapy itraconazole is the drug of choice, terbinafine an alternative. Recommended topical treatment is repeated body rinse with an <b>enilconazole</b> solution or miconazole with or without chlorhexidine. In catteries/shelters medication must be accompanied by intensive decontamination of the environment. VACCINATION: Few efficacy studies on anti-M canis vaccines (prophylactic or therapeutic) for cats have been published, and a safe and efficient vaccine is not available...|$|E
