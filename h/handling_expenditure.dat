40|$|Many {{small island}} states have {{developed}} economies that are strongly dependent on tuna fisheries. Consequently, they {{are vulnerable to}} the socio-economic {{effects of climate change}} and variability, processes that are known to impact tuna fisheries distribution and productivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the impacts of climate oscillations on the tuna-dependent economy of Seychelles. Using a multiplier approach, the direct, indirect and induced economic effects of the tuna industry expenditure benefiting the Seychelles' economy declined in 1998 by 58, 26 and 35 %, respectively (mean decline: 42 %), a year of strong climate oscillation in the western Indian Ocean. Multivariate patterns in tuna purse-seine vessel expenditures in port were substantially modified by strong climate oscillations, particularly in 1998. A cointegration time-series model predicted that a 40 % decline in tuna landings and transhipment in Port Victoria, a value commensurate with that observed in 1998, would result in a 34 % loss for the local economy solely through reductions in cargo <b>handling</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Of several indices tested, the Indian Oscillation Index was best at predicting the probability of switching between low and high regimes of landings and transhipment, which translate into impacts for the economy. It is hypothesised that a late 2006 /early 2007 climate oscillation was compounded by prior overfishing to produce a stronger impact on the fishery and economy of Seychelles. The effects of fishing and climate variability on tuna fisheries are complex and pose significant challenges for fisheries management and the economic development of countries in the Indian Ocean...|$|R
40|$|In {{this second}} of two papers based on a study of payment issues within foster care, {{the focus is on}} expenditure. It is argued that the hybrid public/private nature of {{fostering}} gives rise to contradictory pressures for carers, including the status of maintenance payments as both part of family budgets and a form of delegated public expenditure. For example, carers are required in principle both to spend fixed amounts upon foster children and to treat them in like fashion to their own children. In this paper, the issue of ‘like treatment’ is explored, along with the significance of payment for ‘children who foster’ and for relationships between carers and foster children. Also examined are the challenges presented by differences between carers’ material circumstances and those of birth families, especially when reunification is planned. Overall, the paper seeks to show how the <b>handling</b> of <b>expenditure</b> becomes closely entwined with inter-personal dynamics within foster care...|$|R

5|$|As secretary, Calhoun had {{responsibility}} for management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, {{to preserve the}} sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe. The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty. A reform-minded modernizer, he attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either {{failed to respond to}} his reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to <b>handling</b> all <b>expenditures</b> and correspondence concerning Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head of the bureau.|$|R

40|$|Income {{is a major}} {{indicator}} of the economicwell-being of families. But income measures onlyshort-term inflows that affect current consumption and saving. Wealth, on the other hand, measures the surplus accumulated by families and thus provides a better {{indicator of}} long-term well-being. Wealth may be targeted toward long-term goals such as retirement, {{but it can also}} help families cope with income inter-ruptions or <b>handle</b> unexpected <b>expenditures.</b> Income is widely available from survey and adminis-trative sources. Wealth, on the other hand, is much harder to measure and, as such, {{has been the focus of}} only infrequent surveys (see Data source and definitions). Wealth has many components, some of which are measured more easily than others. The main division is between marketable components, which can be sold or transferred, and non-marketable assets, which have value only for those who hold them. Some market-able assets such as savings accounts, tax-deferred sav-ings plans, stocks, bonds and mutual funds are readily measured. Others such as real estate, durable goods or business equity are seldom traded, and so their value must be estimated. The principal non-marketable asset is an employer pension plan. Employees or their survivors may draw benefits according to the plan, but its present value is not a tradable commodity and is complicated to estimate. After all assets are valued and summed, debt must be subtracted to arrive at a final measure of wealth. This article explores the levels and components of wealth inequality in Canada. Many studies have detailed the effects of regional diversity on the distribution of income (Alasia 2003; Finnie 1998; Melvin 1987...|$|R

Our study documented that, although {{a large percentage of}} women were enjoying empowerment at various domestic and non domestic related issues still it is not in a satisfactory level.

Findings revealed that 79. 7 % respondent's expressed their opinion having freedom of movement outside the home without husband's permission and 83. 0 % respondents gave their opinion for equal right in education of son and daughter which seem to be a good indication regarding women's empowerment. From the logistic regression model considering decision-making power for household affairs as the dependent variable we saw that urban respondents, respondents living in combined family, having mass media facility have more decision making power regarding household affairs. The model also shows that as the level of education of the respondents increases their decision making power also rises From the logistic regression model concerning decision-making power about casting vote the main contributing factors that have significant impact on women's decisions making power towards vote were found to be respondent's education, type of family, mass media exposure, age at marriage, daily household expenditure, freedom of movement, decision for household affairs and women's participation as representative. Key words: household affairs; freedom of movement; caste of vote; daily expenditure; logistic regression analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure energy {{expenditure}} and trunk kinematics while performing three standardized pulling tasks. It is hypothesized that as the height of pulling increases (<b>handle</b> height) energy <b>expenditure</b> and trunk kinematics will change to reflect this. In order to accomplish this research twelve female and seventeen male subjects from a university aged population participated in the study. The subjects were instructed to pull at three heights (hip, shoulder, eye) at a rate of ten pulls per minute, for a period of 10 minutes (one hundred total pulls). The load was fixed at 15 % of the subject's absolute body mass. Based on previous research, subjects were instructed to assume a standardized fixed foot position. This was performed in order to control the foot positioning while performing the pulling task. Statistics. The data set was verified to satisfy assumptions inherent with a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Where main effects existed, a Bonferroni pairwise comparison was performed to determine significance. Results. Statistical significance was obtained for energy expenditure, sagittal displacement and twisting velocity. Hip pulling energy expenditure was lower than shoulder and eye pulling energy expenditure (7 % and 11 %, respectively, p< 0. 05). Finally, twisting velocity at hip and shoulder pulling were 30 % and 36 % (p< 0. 05) than twisting velocity at eye pulling. Hip pulling involves less sagittal displacement than shoulder (p=. 004) and eye (p= 0. 001) by 37 % and 46 %, respectively. Conclusion. Physiological data indicate that all three heights of pulling are characterized as 'light' work and a slight increase in energy expenditure was apparent as the pulling height increased.

60|$|The {{intimacy}} existing {{between the}} two young men had suffered no immediate dislocation from the circumstance that they were tacitly paying court to the same lady. It was an intimacy founded not in the least on friendship or community of tastes and ideas, but owed its existence to the fact that each was amused and interested by the other. Youghal found Comus, for the time being at any rate, just as amusing and interesting as a rival for Elaine's favour as {{he had been in the}} role of scapegrace boy-about-Town; Comus for his part did not wish to lose touch with Youghal, who among other attractions possessed the recommendation of being under the ban of Comus's mother. She disapproved, it is true, of a great many of her son's friends and associates, but this particular one was a special and persistent source of irritation to her from the fact that he figured prominently and more or less successfully in the public life of the day. There was something peculiarly exasperating in reading a brilliant and incisive attack on the Government's rash <b>handling</b> of public <b>expenditure</b> delivered by a young man who encouraged her son in every imaginable extravagance. The actual extent of Youghal's influence over the boy was of the slightest; Comus was quite capable of deriving encouragement to rash outlay and frivolous conversation from an anchorite or an East-end parson if he had been thrown into close companionship with such an individual. Francesca, however, exercised a mother's privilege in assuming her son's bachelor associates to be industrious in labouring to achieve his undoing. Therefore the young politician was a source of unconcealed annoyance to her, and in the same degree as she expressed her disapproval of him Comus was careful to maintain and parade the intimacy. Its existence, or rather its continued existence, was one of the things that faintly puzzled the young lady whose sought-for favour might have been expected to furnish an occasion for its rapid dissolution.|$|R

40|$|With {{reference}} to point 4. 3. 2 in the protocol from the 23 rd Session of the Mixed Norwegian- Russian Fisheries Commission, the parties agreed that necessary testing of sorting grids systems {{had to be}} performed during 1995 in order to enable the Fisheries Comrnission to reach a decision on the introduction of grid systems in the trawl fishery for cod in the Barents Sea. During the period 15 - 27 September 1995, joint Russian-Norwegian selectivity experiments with sorting grid systems were {{carried out in the}} Barents Sea on board the Russian vessel "Bizon" and the Norwegian vessel "Anny Kræmer". Two different grid systems were used, both with an inter-bar distance of 55 mm. The Norwegian vessel used predominantly the 4. 5 m semi-rigid "Sort-X" system, while the Russian vessel used a 1. 5 m single-grid system. In a few tows the Norwegian vessel used a single-grid system mounted in a two-panel Alfredo-type trawl. The experiment were divided into four periods. By assistance from the Norwegian vessel during the first period, the Russian trawl was observed by an underwater vehicle carrying video camera. The single-grid system appeared to perform as anticipated. Underwater observations of the singlegrid system in the Norwegian trawl revealed poor performance, and it was reinstalled to give a better performance. Comparative fishing trials in the second period with covers and blinders gave almost similar 50 % retention values for "Sort-X" used in the Norwegian trawl and the Russian single-grid system in the russian trawl, with L 50 of 50. 3 and 49. 7 cm, respectively. The "Sort-X" system gave a somewhat sharper selection, with a selection range of 11 cm compared to 15 cm for the singlegrid system. Both systems had a very good release of small fish; with an escape rate for fish smaller than 42 cm of 93 - 94 % and of fish smaller than 47 cm of 88 - 89 %. During the third period, single-grid systems were used on board both vessels. This system worked as before for the Russian trawl, but did not work properly with the Norwegian Alfredo-type trawl. Although a good performance during UTV-observation, the selectivity experiments revealed that the single grid in the Norwegian trawl had a low angle of attack, and that far from all fish were brought into contact with the grid. During the fourth and perhaps the most important stage of the experiments, the trawls were rigged as during commercial fishing, with a single-grid system and a 135 mm codend in the Russian trawl, and the "Sort-X" system and a 135 mm twin-codend in the Norwegian Alfredo-type trawl. The size distribution from the five parallel tows were not significantly different. Analysis of data from hauls with and without blinder revealed a slight codend selection in the Russian trawl aft of the single-grid system and minor or no codend size selection aft of the "Sort-X" system. The two grid-systems tested during these experiments have both their benefits and drawbacks regarding selectivity, <b>handling</b> and <b>expenditure</b> aspects. The grid systems as used in the respective trawls with ordinary codends give a close to similar selectivity, and will undoubtedly improve the overall size selectivity of bottom trawls. NORSK SAMMENDRAG:På oppfordring fra Den blandete norsk-russiske fiskerikommisjon (sesjon 23) ble det i september 1995 utført sammenlignende forsøk med to ristsorteringssystemer i torsketrål, det norske "Sort-X"-systemet og det russiske sorteringssystemet med enkel rist. Feltforsøkene ble utført ombord i MRr "Anny Kræmer" og MITr "Bizon" på kysten av Øst-Finnmark og ved Bjørnøya. Resultatene viser at det norske sorteringssystemet isolert sett ga litt bedre seleksjon enn det russiske.
