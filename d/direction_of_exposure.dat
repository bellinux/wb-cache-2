40|$|The {{relationship}} between macroalgal assemblages and abiotic factors was quantified by gradient analyses {{in an area}} where longterm changes in macroalgal depth distributions have previously been documented. Biomass data from 4, 6, 8 and 10 m depth in an area of similar salinity (5) and substrate (rock) in the northern Baltic Proper was constrained by a set of environmental variables defining different aspects of abiotic control of species distributions (sediment cover. effective fetch, clarity index, the curvature and slope of the bottom, and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure)</b> in multivariate analyses at different scales. Furus vesiculosus dominated the biomass at 4, 6 and 8 m depth, and Furcellaria lumbricalis at 10 m. The applied models explained 30. 7 - 53. 3 % of the total variance in community structure, and 49. 3 - 60. 9 % when analysed separately for each depth. A separate analysis of species depth distributions demonstrated that effective fetch was most strongly related to upper limits of the algal belts. sediment cover to the lower limit and density of the F. vesiculosus belt, and clarity index to the lower limits of F. vesiculosus, perennial red algae. and of the red algal and Sphacelaria spp. belts. The results show a strong correlation between environmental variables and vegetation structure even on a small, local scale in the northern Baltic Proper, indicating a high suitability of the phytobenthic zone for environmental monitoring. The results add to previous studies that show a strong importance of abiotic factors on large-scale variation in phytobentic community composition in the Baltic Sea. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the mathematics and numerical implementation in Matlab for analyzing birefringence data to assess laser damage of glass. The physical system under consideration is silica glass (SiO 2) for lenses used in photolithography for computer chip manufacture. The 193 -nm light used in current photolithography systems {{is known to}} damage the glass over time (with billions of pulses of exposure). One feature of the damage is a permanent structural change with an associated density change that produces permanently altered optical properties. When the optical property change exceeds roughly 10 − 6, the smallest features on a silicon wafer cannot be resolved. It is of interest to characterize the laser-induced damage with precise measurements. One method to characterize damage involves exposing a bar of glass using a controlled exposure (through an aperture) and measuring the birefringence periodically {{through the course of}} the exposure. The birefringence is measured in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> on a two-dimensional grid of points. This paper describes how to analyze the resulting map of birefringence using a calculation of the strain field in the glass following exposure and a calculation of the related strain-induced birefringence. The methods are implemented in a set of Matlab routines that manage the reading of experimental data, subtraction of a birefringence baseline after aligning the baseline with the raw data, calculation of the theoretical birefringence using Finite Element Analysis, accounting for the measurement resolution, and finally calculation of a single overall scale factor (the unconstrained density change) that characterizes the level of damage. All these manipulations are automated and managed within a convenient Graphical User Interface that also provides for plotting both experimental and theoretical results...|$|E

40|$|The Mediterranean is {{regarded}} as a region of intense climate change. To better understand future climate change, this area has been the target of several palaeoclimate studies which also studied stable isotope proxies that are directly linked to the stable isotope composition of water, such as tree rings, tooth enamel or speleothems. For such work, it is also essential to establish an isotope hydrology framework of the region of interest. Surface waters from streams and lakes as well as groundwater from springs on the island of Corsica were sampled between 2003 and 2009 for their oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions. Isotope values from lake waters were enriched in heavier isotopes and define a local evaporation line (LEL). On the other hand, stream and spring waters reflect the isotope composition of local precipitation in the catchment. The intersection of the LEL and the linear fit of the spring and stream waters reflect the mean isotope composition of the annual precipitation (dP) with values of - 8. 6 (± 0. 2) per mil for d 18 O and - 58 (± 2) per mil for d 2 H. This value is also a good indicator of the average isotope composition of the local groundwater in the island. Surface water samples reflect the altitude isotope effect with a value of - 0. 17 (± 0. 02) per mil per 100 m elevation for oxygen isotopes. At Vizzavona Pass in central Corsica, water samples from two catchments within a lateral distance of only a few hundred metres showed unexpected but systematic differences in their stable isotope composition. At this specific location, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> seems to be an important factor.

40|$|Saltwater {{intrusion}} {{driven by}} water extraction, coastal modifications, {{and climate change}} may alter the biogeochemical cycling of freshwater coastal wetlands. Anaerobic respiration in freshwater wetlands is typically dominated by methanogenesis, leading to a high methane (CH 4) flux, but the availability of sulfate (SO 42 —) in seawater may shift the dominant pathway to SO 42 — reduction, decreasing CH 4 flux. Seawater may also impact nitrogen cycling by releasing ammonium (NH 4 +) from soil and causing salinity and hydrogen sulfide stress to nitrifiers and denitrifiers. This experiment tests the soil biogeochemical impacts of artificial seawater amendments to intact sediment cores taken from a freshwater coastal wetland on the Albemarle Peninsula of North Carolina. Intact cores were {{assigned to one of}} four experimental treatments designed to compare the impact of surface and subsurface saltwater exposure on sediment biogeochemistry. Cores received surface water treatments 2 - 3 times per week and were exposed continuously to subsurface treatments. Gas flux and porewater were sampled 9 times over the 20 -week experiment. Saltwater added to the soil surface raised soil solution to 10. 4 ppt average salinity {{by the end of the}} experiment and led to significant increases in NH 4 + concentration and significant declines in dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In surface saltwater exposed cores we measured a significant increase in nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production but no significant change in carbon dioxide (CO 2) or CH 4 flux. Surface exposure treatments led to significant reductions in microbial biomass, and all salinity treatments (regardless of <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure)</b> had significant reductions in carbon mineralization and respiration efficiency by the end of the experiment. Our results suggest that saltwater exposure altered microbial biomass and function, and that surface water salinization will have more immediate and measurable impacts on biogeochemical cycling in these soils than exposure to saline ground water...|$|E

This is a long-contested question which {{goes to the heart}} of any decision on property investment. The critical factor that distinguishes listed real estate from any other investment sector is the fundamental tangible nature of the investment – bricks and mortar. The asset class draws a regular, attractive income, underlying direct property performance over the medium to long term, and possesses the additional benefit of liquidity - unlike direct property investment. This report goes a some way laying to rest a long-term debate concerning the performance of listed real estate – is it equities or is it real estate? The result is clear – listed real estate performance is significantly influenced by the direct real estate market over the medium to long-term. This conclusion suggests that an investment in listed property delivers the accepted security, appreciation and inflation hedge characteristics of bricks and mortar. However, as investors look to diversify risk in their multi-asset portfolio, allocations to listed real estate allow a balance <b>of</b> property <b>exposure</b> across country, sector and markets in an efficient and cost-effect way.

40|$|Most {{road safety}} studies rely on summary {{measures}} <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> The term summary measure denotes any aggregate indicator <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> {{that does not}} directly identify and {{count the number of}} opportunities for accidents to occur. This paper shows how elementary units <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> can be developed on the basis of known aggregate measures, such as AADT. An elementary unit <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> refers to any event that generates an opportunity for an accident to occur. Four such events are identified: (1) Encounters, i. e. vehicles passing each other in opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> travel; (2) Simultaneous arrivals at points of intersection between potentially conflicting <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> travel, in particular vehicles entering intersections at the same time or within a very short time interval; (3) Change of travel lane on multi-lane highways; (4) Braking or stopping. These events describe traffic movements prior {{to a wide range of}} crash types. The only major group of accidents that is not directly related to particular events is running off the road. The number of events expected to occur for each of the four types identified is estimated by relying on the assumptions: (A) that AADT is known − when estimating the number of events, mean hourly volume (AADT/ 24) is used; (B) that vehicles or road users arrive at a point of potential conflict according to a Poisson process, and (C) that simultaneous arrivals within a very short time interval (such as 1 second) have the potential for generating a conflict. It is found that the number of encounters and simultaneous arrivals in intersections increases considerably faster than AADT. The number of events that may generate conflicts involving lane changes or braking or stopping increases more slowly than AADT.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a Fusarium derived mycotoxin, often {{occurring}} on cereals {{used for}} {{human and animal}} nutrition. The intestine, as prominent barrier for nutritional toxins, has to handle the mycotoxin from the mucosa protected luminal side (apical exposure), as well as already absorbed toxin, reaching the cells from basolateral side via the blood stream. In the present study, the impact <b>of</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> DON <b>exposure</b> on epithelial cell behaviour and intestinal barrier integrity was elucidated. METHODS: A non-transformed intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J 2), cultured in membrane inserts, serving as a polarised in vitro model {{to determine the effects}} of deoxynivalenol (DON) on cellular viability and tight junction integrity. RESULTS: Application of DON in concentrations up to 4000 ng/mL for 24, 48 and 72 hours on the basolateral side of membrane cultured polarised IPEC-J 2 cells resulted in a breakdown of the integrity of cell connections measured by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), as well as a reduced expression of the tight junction proteins ZO- 1 and claudin 3. Epithelial cell number decreased and nuclei size was enlarged after 72 h incubation of 4000 ng/mL DON from basolateral. Although necrosis or caspase 3 mediated apoptosis was not detectable after basolateral DON application, cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in DNA fragmentation, decrease in G 0 /G 1 phase and slight increase in G 2 /M phase after 72 hours incubation with DON 2000 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of impact of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol on the intestinal epithelial barrier is dependent on route of application. The epithelium appears to be rather resistant towards apical (luminal) DON application whereas the same toxin dose from basolateral severely undermines barrier integrity...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss the}} {{characteristics}} of good (and bad) stress tests {{as well as some}} of the nagging issues facing risk managers who are trying to make stress tests useful. A review of some of VaR's shortcomings suggests why stress tests can add value to the risk measurement effort. 1. VaR reflects price behavior in everyday markets but may not reflect what happens during abnormal events. As a result, managers relying on VaR-based risk measures can't reliably extrapolate the size of losses that would result from large shocks in market prices. 2. VaR provides no information on the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> risk <b>exposure.</b> If a portfolio has a VaR of $ 10 million, a manager still doesn't know whether the risk of loss is from a price or rate increase or a price or rate decrease. To illustrate, note that a linear portfolio dependent on a normally distributed market factor will have the same VaR whether the position is long or short. 3. VaR does not provide information on the potential magnitude of losses for those days on which the VaR measure is exceeded. Large moves in market pric es can result not only in portfolio losses that are greater than VaR, but also in large losses that arise from specific risk sources not apparent in the VaR. Stress tests are well suited to address each of these shortcomings by simulating portfolio performance during abnormal market periods. Stress tests need not reflect the correlations among prices and rates observed in normal markets. Stress test results are predicated on specific directional moves in rates and prices. They also embed both the effects of large market moves that cannot be reliably statistically estimated and (where systems allow) the nonlinear effects of these large moves on the value of positions in the portfolio.
