25|$|Due to {{the current}} vogue for {{brilliant}} and brilliant-like cuts, step cut diamonds may suffer somewhat in value; stones that are deep enough may be re-cut into more popular shapes.

Antique jewelry of the period features step-cut stones prominently, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> in producing new step-cut stones to repair antique jewelry or to reproduce it. The slender, rectangular baguette (from the French, resembling a loaf of bread) was and {{is the most common}} form of the step cut: today, it is most often used as an accent stone to flank a ring's larger central (and usually brilliant-cut) stone.|$|E
25|$|A {{commodity}} market <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products.

Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} costing/valuation {{of inventory}} can be complex. Whereas {{in the past}} most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision {{since there is no}} market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.|$|E
