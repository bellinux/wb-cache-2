According {{to a recent}} study focusing on restaurant reviews in the metropolitan area of Boston, US, roughly 16 % of restaurant reviews on Yelp are suspicious reviews [15]. Specifically, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when it has few reviews [15]. In this study, to reduce effects of suspicious reviews, we filtered venues with few reviews. We thus filtered restaurants, <b>fast</b> <b>foods</b> and bars with a review count less than 10. As a result, we selected 2578 restaurants, 981 <b>fast</b> <b>foods</b> and 797 bars as the empirical data. Besides, 518 Foursquare restaurants collected via Foursquare API ([URL] were used in comparison of analysis based on Yelp venues.
