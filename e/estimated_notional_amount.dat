The Survey began by reporting notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps and options, and added credit default swaps in 2001 and equity derivatives in 2002. The only known prior effort was {{a study by the}} Bank for International Settlements, which <b>estimated</b> <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of interest rate swaps for 1984 and 1985 (BIS 1986).

5000|$|The {{interest}} rate derivatives market is the largest derivatives market in the world. The Bank for International Settlements <b>estimates</b> that the <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> outstanding in June 2012 [...] were US$494 trillion for OTC {{interest rate}} contracts, and US$342 trillion for OTC interest rate swaps. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 80% of the world's top 500 companies as of April 2003 used {{interest rate derivatives}} to control their cashflows. This compares with 75% for foreign exchange options, 25% for commodity options and 10% for stock options.|$|R
50|$|In a {{currency}} forward, the <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> of currencies are specified (ex: {{a contract to}} buy $100 million Canadian dollars equivalent to, say $75.2 million USD at the current rate—these two amounts are called the <b>notional</b> <b>amount(s)).</b> While the <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the leverage created, which is typical in derivative contracts.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} total return swap, one party pays a fixed or {{floating}} rate multiplied by a <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> plus the depreciation, if any, in a <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of property {{in exchange for}} payments by the other party of the appreciation, if any, on the same <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of property. For example, assume the underlying property is the S&P 500 stock index. A would pay B LIBOR times a $100 <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> plus depreciation, if any, on a $100 notional investment in the S&P 500 index. B would pay A the appreciation, if any, in the same notional S&P 500 investment.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the CDS market may be a threat to {{financial}} stability. Such concern may stem from the counterparty risk assumed by market participants and the high sensitivity of these instruments to the business cycle. The open interest of the CDS market mirrors investors’ maximum exposure and captures aggregate inventory risk, liquidity risk, and trading activity. In this paper, we aim to identify the main determinants of the dynamics of two alternative measures of open interest, the gross and net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts.</b> Our results suggest that both asymmetry of information and divergence of opinions on firms’ future performance help explain the growth of the net <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of single-reference contracts, but systematic factors have a much greater influence. Net <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> growth of different obligors co-varies in time and the dynamics of open interest is pro-cyclical. The CDS market expands following a positive stock market performance and contracts when large negative (positive) jumps in stock (CDS) prices are perceived by investors. In line with the market microstructure theory, funding costs and counterparty risk reduce CDS market players’ willingness to incur inventory risk, thus contracting gross <b>notional</b> <b>amounts.</b> undação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia and FEDER/COMPETE (grant UID/ECO/ 04007 / 2013...|$|R

50|$|In {{simple terms}} the <b>notional</b> {{principal}} <b>amount</b> is essentially {{how much of}} the asset or bonds a person has. For example, if a premium bond was bought for £1 then the <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> would be the face value amount of premium bond that your £1 was able to purchase. Hence the <b>notional</b> principal <b>amount</b> is the quantity of the assets and bonds.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{notional}} principal contract (NPC) {{is a term}} of art used by U.S. {{federal income}} tax professionals for contracts based on an underlying <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> (other financial services professionals refer to such NPCs under the more general heading [...] "swaps," [...] although not all swaps are NPCs). The reason the underlying amount is [...] "notional" [...] is because neither party to the NPC is required to actually hold the property comprising the underlying amount. NPCs involve two parties who agree contractually to pay each other amounts at specified times, based on the underlying <b>notional</b> <b>amount.</b> The simplest example of an NPC is a so-called interest rate swap, in which one party (Party A) pays the other party (Party B) an amount each quarter determined by multiplying a floating, market-determined interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) by the notional amount; and Party B pays Party A on the same date an amount determined by multiplying a fixed interest rate by the <b>notional</b> <b>amount.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} determinants of trading in the sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) market, using weekly data for single-name sovereign CDS from October 2008 to September 2015. We describe the anatomy of the sovereign CDS market, derive a law of motion for gross positions and their components, and identify the key factors that drive the cross-sectional and time-series properties of trading volume and net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding. While a single principal component accounts for 54 percent {{of the variation in}} sovereign CDS spreads, the largest common factor explains only 7 percent of the variation in sovereign CDS net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding. Moreover, unlike for CDS spreads, common global factors explain very little of the variation in sovereign CDS trading and net <b>notional</b> <b>amounts</b> outstanding, suggesting that it is driven primarily by idiosyncratic country risk. We analyze several local and regional channels that may explain the trading in sovereign CDS: (a) country-specific credit risk shocks, including changes in a country's credit rating and related outlook changes, (b) the announcement and issuance of domestic and international debt, (c) macroeconomic sentiment derived from conventional and unconventional monetary policy, macro-economic news and shocks, and (d) regulatory channels, such as changes in bank capital adequacy requirements. All our findings suggest that sovereign CDS are more likely used for hedging than for speculative purposes...|$|R

30|$|A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is {{a credit}} {{derivative}} via which one party buys {{protection against the}} default of a reference entity from another party.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} credit derivatives by US bank holding companies with assets in excess of one billion dollars from 1999 to 2005. Using the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Holding Company Database, we find that in 2005 the gross <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of credit derivatives held by banks exceeds the amount of loans on their books. Only 23 large banks out of 395 use credit derivatives and most of their derivatives positions are held for dealer activities rather than for hedging of loans. The net <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of credit derivatives used for hedging of loans in 2005 represents less than 2 % of the total <b>notional</b> <b>amount</b> of credit derivatives held by banks and less than 2 % of their loans. Banks hedge less risky loans more than riskier ones. The banks {{are more likely to}} be net protection buyers if they have lower capital ratios, a lower net interest rate margin, engage in asset securitization, originate foreign loans, have more commercial and industrial loans in their portfolio, and have fewer agricultural loans. We conclude that the use of credit derivatives by banks to hedge loans is limited because of adverse selection and moral hazard problems and because of the inability of banks to use hedge accounting when hedging with credit derivatives. Our evidence raises important questions about the validity of the often-held view that the use of credit derivatives makes banks sounder. ...|$|R
