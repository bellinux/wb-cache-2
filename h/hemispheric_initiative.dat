40|$|The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) {{process was}} {{launched}} during the Miami Summit of Heads of State in December 1994. It was {{the centerpiece of}} a broader <b>hemispheric</b> <b>initiative</b> of political and socio-economic cooperation among 34 countries of the Americas with the objective to negotiate a hemispheric free trade agreement by the year 2005. The preparatory phase began in January 1995 and formal negotiations were launched in April 1998. The creation of an FTAA would clearly be the most important chapter in the history of regional cooperation in the Western Hemisphere and mark a fitting culmination to a fast maturing trade policy framework in Latin America and the Caribbean. The FTAA process is the result of progressive globalization of the world economy and a profound transformation in the region based on: (i) structural economic reforms in almost all the countries directed at stimulating market activity and a better articulation with the world economy; (ii) the emergence, or strengthening, of democratic regimes almost everywhere and (iii) political commitments to foster peace and cooperation among neighbors with a history of rivalry and conflict. Regional integration has been a fundamental complementary tool for achieving these ambitious national objectives, which permeate the entire region. Latin America and the Caribbean have a long tradition of interest in regional integration. An intense amount of activity in this area emerged out of the Post-War period. However, the initiatives in the first three decades following the War inserted themselves in the prevailing state-led import substitution strategy of the time, itself to a large extent a product of "market skepticism" derived from the Great Depression. In the 1990 s, however, a "new" regionalism emerged in Latin America and the Caribbean that conformed to the new national strategies for economic and political transformation and preparation for globalization...|$|E

50|$|When Juan Perón acceded to the {{presidency}} {{for the first time}} in 1945, nationalists in Argentina debated on whether to support him or not. At first, most decided to join him. However, two events pushed them apart from him. First was a bombing which occurred during turmoil over the <b>hemispheric</b> political <b>initiative,</b> the Acta de Chapultépec (signed by Edelmiro Farrell, it would be approved in 1947). This was a plan aimed at Latin America's integration under the leadership of the USA. Within Argentina, this initiative was supported by both a Perón supporter, John William Cooke, and a Perón opponent Arturo Frondizi of the Radical Civic Union (the future president of Argentina). Perón himself was publicly strongly opposed to the Acta but was rumored to be considering acceding, under pressure from military and business interests. Nationalists organized a protest against it, which ended with 200 being jailed. Agitation continued. On April 15, 1953, two bombs exploded in Plaza de Mayo, killing five. The second event which pushed various nationalists to oppose Perón was his suppression of mandatory Catholic education in 1954. Thus, the nationalists acclaimed Eduardo Lonardi's arrival by plane to the chanting of Cristo Vence (Christ Victorious), in the aftermath of Perón's ouster in September 1955. However, as early as 1956, the nationalists returned to opposing the government, upset by the assumption of control of the junta by General Aramburu, who was allied with the old Conservative establishment.|$|R
40|$|Europe {{represents}} {{the most advanced}} regional arrangement the world has seen. Because of its advanced nature, Europe will consequently serve as our paradigm for the new regionalism in Latin America {{in the sense that}} its conceptualization eagerly draws on empirical observations of the European process. The aim of this study assesses the advisability of regional integration in Latin America by applying the theory of regionalism and new regionalism which was born from a thick network of initiatives that combined all forms of integration from unilateral tariff reduction, bilateral trade agreements, to <b>hemispheric</b> <b>initiatives.</b> The theoretical framework that needs to be applied {{in order to understand the}} actual situation in the relationship between the European Union (EU) and Mexico is based on the theory of regionalism. The study states that Latin America has improved in terms of regionalism, in Latin America; the motor driving the new regionalism of the 1990 s no longer consisted of rounds of multinational negotiations as in the past, but rather the increasing number of bilateral agreements being forged in the region. These agreements follow the unilateral opening of Latin American economies. My aim is to give a clear perspective on the Latin American new regionalism, as well as an overview on which the main regional entities are, and how the relations have evolved in these regions, considering international integration schemes such as Common Market of the South (Mercosur), North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The main hypothesis of this work states that describing the actual process of integration in Latin America will allow us to determine if it is possible to recreate the EU’s architecture in the region. Can the process of integration in Latin America be similar to the one adopted in Europe? The methods used to measure the integration in Latin America are trade openness, trade interdependence and overall financial openness, among others. The study suggests that none of the regions in Latin America should engage in monetary integration. They are subject to asymmetric shocks and their degree of trade and integration remains insufficient. These regions should refrain from adopting exchange rate stabilisation schemes before achieving deeper integration and convergence. The final remarks that can be mentioned about the relation between the EU and Mexico are that the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Mexico is a consequence of many advantages for all the involved countries among others: to open up bigger markets, same legal footing as their competitors and new potential investments. Mexico has had an increase in exports through NAFTA, and nowadays has a preferential access to the world’s largest market, the EU. Mexico also serves as a regional leader in Latin America. Success lies in the regional integration efforts, education, and fundamental economic orthodoxy. That is why there is a great possibility that Mexico, in the course of one generation, will become the leading Latin American nation to join the first world. Endast sammandrag.

[...] Part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's prescient <b>Hemispheric</b> Defense <b>Initiative,</b> the history-making flight commanded by Col. Robert Olds traveled 6,000 miles from Langley Field, Virginia, to Lima, Peru and Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Roberto M. Ortiz was being inaugurated as president. The feat was widely publicized, [...] and an Air Corps newsletter provided lengthy descriptions."On a bitingly cold Tuesday morning, at 9 o'clock, February 15, to be exact, {{the last of the}} six Boeings lifted gracefully into the air headed south for Miami. This departure was an example of all of the other take-offs of the flight. They were two minutes apart, the flight commander being the first to push the nose of his flying fortress into the cold ozone. With him he carried the greetings of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt to the President-elect of the Argentine, Roberto Ortiz." [...] "As the planes flew toward the appointed rendezvous at Point Salinas, just north of Lima, thousands of Peruvian officials and aviation fans at the Loma Tambo airport were eagerly awaiting the visitors from the Big neighbor of the North. Where frightened civilians in other countries during the past quarter century scanned the skies with dread, these friendly people were eagerly awaiting these Ambassadors of Good Will, who were bringing not bombs but messages of Friendship. Landing at 4:25 PM, the six planes made the record non-stop flight of 2695 miles in 15 hours and 32 minutes." ...|$|R

The early years of this new decade have brought good news for Latin America and the Caribbean. The region weathered the international crisis with unprecedented resilience and emerged from it sooner and more strongly than the developed economies. It grew by 6 % in 2010, and is expected to grow by over 4 % in 2011. The region's economic reforms of past decades, its fiscal and macroeconomic prudence and its sound financial supervision, together with ever closer commercial ties with China and other emerging economies, have allowed it not only to successfully navigate through the worst international crisis of the past 80 years but also to enter the new decade with a promising outlook for growth and advances in quality of life. For the first time in its history, the region achieved during the past decade a combination of high growth, macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction and improvement in income distribution. On the strength of the foregoing and of its privileged endowment in natural resources, energy, water and biodiversity, the Latin American and Caribbean region will be called upon to assume an increasingly larger role in the global economy. At Davos and other specialized forums, it has been said that this could be the decade of the Latin American and Caribbean region and that, with regard to global economic recovery, the region is today firmly part of the solution. The region's resilience to, and strong recovery from, the international financial crisis have renewed the interest of the European Union in strengthening linkages with it. At the same time, the Asia-Pacific region ?particularly the People's Republic of China? has become a privileged trading partner for Latin America and the Caribbean. These closer trade and investment links have been both a cause for and a result of the increasing number of trade agreements already in force or under negotiation that link various countries of the region with the European Union and Asia-Pacific. In this context of special opportunities and diversification of trading partners, the share of the United States of America in the region's trade has been shrinking. More importantly, there is a perception in Latin America and the Caribbean that the United States lacks strategic vision vis-à-vis the region. In past decades, the Alliance for Progress, the Initiative for the Americas and, later, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (with which ECLAC, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Organization of American States collaborated through the Tripartite Committee) were all ambitious United States initiatives for regional cooperation. Today no such initiatives exist. Despite recent improvements on many fronts, the Latin American and Caribbean region faces some formidable structural challenges. It still has the highest indices of inequality in the world, as well as serious lags in technology, innovation and competitiveness. Nevertheless, the region, together with its main partners, is approaching these challenges as opportunities for new partnerships that promote growth and development through increased trade and investment. The United States can and should be an active partner of the region in this endeavour. The visit of President Obama to three Latin American countries provides the United States with a unique opportunity to revitalize hemispheric relations. It could do so by presenting proposals for a strategic dialogue and for new <b>hemispheric</b> <b>initiatives</b> in trade and investment to strengthen cooperation between the United States and the region. ...|$|R
