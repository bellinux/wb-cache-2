5|$|Nature’s Plan For Parkways - Recreational Lands was {{published}} in 1932 and proposed a regional plan that would place Darby and Cobbs Creeks in an interior network of parks. These streams were chosen {{due to the fact}} that the flowed through some of the most densely populated areas in Southeastern Pennsylvania and it could serve as buffers through urban areas. During the 1930s there were a number of projects undertaken on Darby Creek by the Army Corps of Engineers. The dikes along the southern end of the creek were repaired by a joint force of the Works Progress Administration, the Pennsylvania legislature, and Delaware County. A series of ditches in the Tinicum marshland were constructed by the Corps in 1935 as a means of mosquito control.

5|$|The Environment Agency is {{responsible}} for monitoring water quality on the river and its tributaries, which have been divided into seventeen separate water bodies. In 2013, seven water bodies were assessed as having good quality and ten as being moderate. The reasons for not achieving good status included pollution from waste water, pollution from agriculture and physical modifications. The physical modifications include dredging work on the lower reaches, near the junction with the Parrett to increase the channel flow to reduce flooding. The use and storage of the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> in bank restoration may also have an impact. In 1998 improvements were sought to treatment works and surface water outfalls to improve water quality. A vegetable washing plant on the Chelston stream at Wellington was also identified {{as a source of}} pollution. The waters of the Upper Tone have been classified as having good ecological status, whereas the section from Wellington to Taunton and downstrean of Taunton are rated as moderate.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dredge</b> <b>material</b> from an {{entrance}} waterway {{to the port}} of Rotterdam and sediments from the North Sea off-shore disposal site were tested for toxicity using three different sediment bioassays, The goals {{of the study were}} to evaluate if bioassays generate useful additional information to chemical based sediment quality criteria, and to investigate potential changes in toxicity of <b>dredge</b> <b>material</b> after off-shore disposal, Sediment elutriates were tested with larvae of the oyster Crassostrea gigas, whole sediments with the infaunal amphipod Bathyporeia sarsi, and sediment suspensions with the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The contamination of the investigated <b>dredge</b> <b>material</b> was low according to the limited set of chemical parameters that was analysed, Nevertheless the three bioassays showed that some of the <b>dredge</b> <b>material</b> samples significantly affected the survival of oyster larvae and the amphipod B. sarsi, as well as the aerial survival time of mussels, Toxicity was reduced at the off-shore disposal site, probably due to the dispersal of the most polluted finer sediment fractions by strong residual currents, It is concluded that the sediment bioassays used for this study are a meaningful tool that should be incorparated in decision making frameworks for the management of <b>dredge</b> <b>material.</b> [KEYWORDS: <b>dredge</b> material; off-shore disposal; sediment bioassay; EIA; sediment quality criteria; sediment toxicity North-sea sediments; mytilus-edulis-l; contaminated sediment; bioassays; american; survival; amphipod; tests...|$|R
