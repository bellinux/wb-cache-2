Also, compared standard {{finite difference method}} to this non-standard finite <b>different</b> <b>method</b> in terms of stability and accuracy. As a numerical example, Hybrid Selection & Genetics equation is considered as the candidate from class of first order ODEs with polynomial right-hand sides.

5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The {{extent to which a}} risk parity portfolio is managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity funds available today.|$|E
5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E

Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> to estimate it.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of the episode used several <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> to represent 21st century Detroit, including exterior shots in Los Angeles, the Paramount studios downtown New York standing sets and exterior sets at the Lacy Street Production Center. The guest cast featured Matt Winston returning as Temporal Agent Daniels, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as a Xindi-Reptilian.

5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E

Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues.

Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so <b>different</b> <b>methods</b> were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
