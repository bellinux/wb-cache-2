50|$|In {{contrast}} to most manual gearboxes, most automatic transmissions have far less effective engine braking. This {{means that the}} engine does not slow the car as effectively when the automatic transmission driver releases the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control.</b> This leads to more usage of the brakes in cars with automatic transmissions, bringing shorter brake life. Brakes {{are also more likely}} to overheat in hilly or mountainous areas, causing reduced braking ability, brake fade, and the potential for complete failure with the automatic transmission vehicle.|$|E

This latter feature became standard on later locomotive models. The constant-speed prime mover, on the other hand, was not successful enough to duplicate. The locomotive was from 1975 used as a heavy switcher at UP's North Platte, Nebraska hump yards, a fate common to UP's other surviving SD24s.|$|E
50|$|What {{distinguished}} the Clerget {{rotary engine}} from its rivals (Gnome and Le Rhône) {{was that the}} Clerget had normal intake and exhaust valves unlike the Gnome, and the connecting rod arrangement was much simpler than the Le Rhone. A source of failure among the Clerget engines were the special-purpose piston rings, called obturator rings. These were located below the gudgeon or wrist pin, to block heat transfer from the combustion area to {{the lower part of}} the cylinder and overcome their subsequent distortion. These rings were often made from brass and only had a lifespan of a few hours. The Clerget engines were considered reliable but they cost more per unit to produce than their rivals. Unlike other contemporary rotaries in which the ignition system was either switched on or off to provide a rudimentary form of <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control,</b> the Clerget featured a throttle.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} {{air inlet}} behind the reduction gear has a de-icing device using hot air. The compressor's two axial stages use blisks. The shaft runs on ball bearings. Air {{flow through the}} annular combustion chamber is S-wise, with fuel being added in radial direction by a rotating atomizer disc. The blades of the three-stage turbine's wheels, also blisks, are air-cooled from the inside. The jet nozzle is fixed with an interior cone. Auxiliary drives are mounted on a mounting plate behind the inlet, which also has the connections for starter motor/generator, oil and fuel pumps, <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> and tachometer. There are also optional drives for an AC generator and a hydraulic pump. The whole engine is mounted at three points, two trunnions {{on the right and}} left front of the turbine casing and one on its underside to the rear. Speed control is effected automatically by governing the injection volume, with a thermal regulator allowing for short-term overloads.|$|E

30|$|In the {{experiment}} with the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controlled</b> constantly, {{it turned out that}} the torque was in positive correlations with NO and NOx. As for correlations between the torque and NO and NOx, it turned out that those of WCO 0 were stronger than those of WCO 15. The engine brake power of WCO 0 was higher than that of WCO 15, and the O 2 concentration in exhaust elements was lower, which indicates that the combustion of WCO 0 was closer to complete combustion. In general, with the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> maintained constantly in {{the experiment}}, the torque was in a “positive” correlation with NO and NOx, which is in correspondent to the existing studies. As for the correlations between the torque and NO and NOx, this study verifies that those of WCO 0 were stronger than those of WCO 15. The NOx concentration in exhaust of a diesel engine tends to increase as it is closer to complete combustion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract i A {{vehicular}} driveline {{consists of}} engine, clutch, transmission, shafts, and wheels, which {{are controlled by}} a driveline management system. Experiments and modeling using a heavy truck show that there are significant torsional resonances in the driveline. A linear model with a drive shaft flexibility is able to sufficiently explain the measured <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and wheel <b>speed.</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>control</b> for automatic gear shifting is an approach {{at the leading edge}} of technology. A critical step is the controlling of the engine such that the transmission transfers zero torque, whereafter neutral gear can be engaged. Driveline oscillations is a limiting factor in this system. A model of the transmission torque is developed and a state-feedback controller is used to drive this torque to zero. The result is a possibility to optimize the time needed for a gear shift. Furthermore, neutral gear can successfully be engaged also when facing load disturbances and initial driveline oscillations. Traditionally in diesel trucks, the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is <b>controlled</b> by a system called RQV. This system has the desired property of a load dependent stationary error, and the undesired property of vehicle shuffle following a change in pedal position. A model based state-feedback controller is derived that actively reduces wheel speed oscillations. The performance and driveability is significantly improved, while maintaining the desired load characteristics for RQV control. In conclusion, the proposed strategies improve performance and driveability in both <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> and gear-shift control. Acknowledgment ii...|$|R

In this paper we analyze an <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> system from the perspective of achieving swapping modularity of the throttle actuator. Specifically, we analyze approaches to distribute the optimal controller transfer function between a throttle actuator time constant dependent portion (which is swappable with the actuator) and throttle actuator time constant independent portion (which {{does not need to be}} changed when the actuator is swapped). Two distributed controller architectures, with unidirectional and bidirectional communications, are considered. I...|$|E

50|$|The major {{advantages}} of a GDI engine are increased fuel efficiency and high power output. Emissions levels can also be more accurately controlled with the GDI system. The cited gains are achieved by the precise control over the amount of fuel and injection timings that are varied according to engine load. In addition some engines operate on full air intake. This means there is no air throttle plate, which greatly improves efficiency, and reduces piston 'pumping losses'. It also eliminates air throttling losses in some GDI engines, when compared with conventional fuel-injected or carbureted <b>engines.</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>speed</b> is <b>controlled</b> by the engine control unit/engine management system (EMS), which regulates fuel injection function and ignition timing, instead of having a throttle plate that restricts the incoming air supply.
