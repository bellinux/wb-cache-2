5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are <b>harmful.</b> However, {{the vast majority of}} mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or <b>harmful</b> are often situational; a mutation that is <b>harmful</b> in one environment may be helpful in another.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian mimicry, {{where two}} or more <b>harmful</b> species {{mutually}} advertise themselves as <b>harmful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or <b>harmful</b> model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are <b>harmful,</b> and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more <b>harmful</b> than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a <b>harmful</b> interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. <b>Harmful</b> interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E

5|$|Advancements in {{computer}} modeling have allowed scientists to identify compounds that can treat prion-caused diseases, {{such as one}} compound found to bind a cavity in the PrPC and stabilize the conformation, {{reducing the amount of}} <b>harmful</b> PrPSc.|$|E
5|$|Agent Orange dries {{quickly after}} {{spraying}} and breaks down within hours to days {{when exposed to}} sunlight (if not bound chemically to a biological surface such as soil, leaves and grass) {{and is no longer}} <b>harmful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as <b>harmful.</b> The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} <b>harmful</b> to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E
5|$|Defensive or {{protective}} mimicry {{takes place}} when organisms {{are able to}} avoid <b>harmful</b> encounters by deceiving enemies into treating them as something else.|$|E

5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be <b>harmful,</b> even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause <b>harmful</b> fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E

Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said that the act would have a <b>harmful</b> effect and 5 percent said it would be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|A July 1966 {{report by}} the New York Academy of Medicine Committee on Public Health cautioned that New York City's air-pollution problem made it {{susceptible}} to acute and lethal episodes and recommended a reduction of air pollution.

5|$|A young star such as Epsilon Eridani {{can produce}} {{large amounts of}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation that may be <b>harmful</b> to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|E
5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this {{was considered to be}} an amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any <b>harmful</b> effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E
5|$|Although {{unpalatable}} when consumed raw, when boiled {{the leaves}} of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be potentially <b>harmful</b> to humans, and as of 1993 {{it had not been}} fully analyzed chemically to assess the wider impact it could have on health.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a {{harmless}} species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a <b>harmful</b> species directed at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not <b>harmful</b> to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that cats use grass {{as a source of}} folic acid.

5|$|Climate change {{concerns}} are also driving increasing {{growth in the}} renewable energy industries.

5|$|Council {{activities}} include attempts to hold advertisers {{accountable for the}} content of the programs they sponsor, encouraging the development of what the council considers to be responsible, family-friendly entertainment, pressuring broadcasters to stop and/or limit television content the council claims to be <b>harmful</b> to children, as well as pressuring cable operators to unbundle cable channels so consumers can pick and pay for only the channels they want to watch.|$|E
5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was <b>harmful</b> due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{potentially}} <b>harmful</b> {{effects on}} ecosystems, various {{efforts have been}} made to control introduced populations of C.maenas around the world. In Edgartown, Massachusetts, a bounty was levied in 1995 for catching C.maenas, to protect local shellfish, and 10tons were caught.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing <b>harmful</b> noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Flea {{phylogeny}} {{was long}} neglected, {{the discovery of}} homologies with the parts of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization. Whiting and colleagues prepared a detailed molecular phylogeny in 2008, with the basic structure shown in the cladogram. The Tungidae, including the <b>harmful</b> chigoe flea or jigger, is sister {{to the rest of}} the Siphonaptera.|$|E
