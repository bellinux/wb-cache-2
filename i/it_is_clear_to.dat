25|$|The {{area was}} milled for kauri from 1910-1921 until milling stopped. All the mature {{trees in the}} area were cut down. At {{the top of the}} falls, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> see the notches in the rocks (rectangular cutouts for large pieces of wood to rest in). This was the {{location}} of the Glen Esk dam. The first attempt to drive logs down the falls resulted in their destruction on the rocks below and the dam was thereafter only used to flush the logs waiting in the stream below down to the mill. The remains of the heavy beams used can still be found in the stream today although they tend to move from time to time. In 2007 a beam fell, broke and half of it wedged itself into rocks {{at the base of the}} three tiered falls.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin {{that their}} {{daughter}} {{is in love}} with the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

500|$|The Planet People's leader, Kickalong (Ralph Arliss), {{believes}} that the Planet People gathered at Ringstone Round have been transported—as promised—to the planet, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Quatermass and Kapp {{that they have been}} reduced to ashes. One survivor – a girl called Isabel (Annabelle Lanyon) who deliriously talks about [...] "lovely lightning" [...] – is found and is brought back to the Kapps' cottage. Making contact with NASA scientist Chuck Marshall (Tony Sibbald), they learn that thousands of young people have disappeared in similar incidents all around the world. Quatermass, aided by District Commissioner Annie Morgan (Margaret Tyzack), decides to bring Isabel to London for tests. As they make their journey, Quatermass speculates as to whether there is any connection between recent events and the decline in society. Reaching London, they are attacked by a gang. Quatermass is yanked from the car but Annie and Isabel manage to escape. Meanwhile, a large number of Planet People arrive at the radio telescope, congregating at the stone circle on its grounds. Working at a perimeter building, Kapp is horrified to see the light strike the area around his home – rushing home, he finds his family gone.|$|E

2500|$|These systems, {{which are}} {{discussed}} more fully in [...] below, generally allow {{the game to}} end as soon as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the players which stones would remain on the board if the game continued.

2500|$|The {{two main}} {{sides of the}} cross (north and south) feature figurative relief carvings, now {{considerably}} worn, that depict Christ and several other figures; their subjects and interpretation have been much discussed by art historians, and the cross continues to be [...] "one of the most extensive and most studied of all surviving visual programs of the early Middle Ages."

[...] Thaer commented in his diary, [...] "personally I had to force myself to the conviction that the troops now operated under a crushing burden of disappointment.

Richie tries to get Babe to give him another chance, but Babe is adamant {{that she does not}} need Richie in her life. During this time, JR and Babe see more of each other. At Krystal's bar, they bond over old times and other matters. Babe sees a side to JR that signals that he has matured more since they divorced. When JR needs a ride back to his home, Babe offers to take him. Once there, sexual tension between the two is evident. As Babe states that she should leave, JR goes in for a goodbye kiss to her cheek. The kiss leaves them in a more awkward state, and JR apologizes. However, their desire overtakes them as JR says that he misses kissing her. The two make love. While in bed, JR suggests that they marry again and is elated that he has [...] "his" [...] Babe back. Even with this obvious connection between the two still apparent, Babe tells JR that their recent love-making was just comfort sex, and that she is not in love with him anymore. He pretends that he is not hurt by this declaration of hers, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Babe that he is. She promptly apologizes for hurting him and leaves.|$|E
2500|$|The {{topic of}} the Hebrew Bible and rape has been controversial.

[...] In a piece for AlterNet, Valerie Tarico writes that a literal interpretation on the Bible on the topic was [...] "disturbing" [...] and argued that [...] "the Bible never teaches that women should have a choice about sex", that [...] "Male-female relationships in the Bible are determined by a property ethic", and that [...] "the Bible is loaded with divinely sanctioned rape babies." [...] A variety of religious scholars surveyed by TheBlaze condemn this viewpoint, saying [...] "Some atheists and Biblical critics have held up the notion that the Bible condones rape. Across the board, TheBlaze’s entire panel of faith experts reject that the criminal act of rape is upheld in any form in the holy book." [...] In The Bible Now, Richard Elliott Friedman and Shawna Dolansky write [...] "What should not be in doubt is the biblical view of rape: it is horrid. It is decried in the Bible's stories. It is not tolerated in the Bible's laws." [...] Sunil Francis concurs in her book Violence Against Women: A Christian Ethical Analysis on Rape, writing [...] "The Bible always sees rape as violence and sin." ...|$|E
