Century magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend Mark Twain, understanding how bad Grant's <b>financial</b> <b>condition</b> was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor, offered by a family friend.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center, such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous <b>financial</b> <b>condition</b> eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald, and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E

We separate the effects of <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> from those of financial development. Based on a sample of firms from five Asian emerging economies, we find that (1) <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> and <b>financial</b> development affect corporate investments through different channels. <b>Financial</b> <b>conditions</b> affect firms' growth opportunities and investment demand. Financial development primarily affects firms' external financing constraints. (2) Large firms benefit more from improved <b>financial</b> <b>conditions,</b> while small firms benefit more from financial development. (3) The effects of <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> and the level of financial development are asymmetric: they are stronger when the global financial crisis was unfolding and weaker during the subsequent rebound...|$|R
5|$|WMATA's {{bus system}} is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better <b>financial</b> <b>condition</b> than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a publicly owned bus system, and requested takeover.|$|E

First, principal component analysis and an vector autoregressive model are utilized to build <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> indices for South Africa and its trading partners, namely, China, Germany, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, France and Belgium.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Illinois {{farmland}} market {{during the period}} 1985 - 1999. <b>Financial</b> <b>conditions,</b> market liquidity, and industry conditions are used to explain the farmland price discounts. The study addresses the following questions: 1) whether farmland prices are independent of the farmer’s <b>financial</b> <b>conditions,</b> 2) whether prices are associated with farmland market liquidity, and 3) whether prices are independent of the industry business cycle. Hypotheses are tested using average county level financial information and average county level price of farmland transactions in Illinois throughout the period 1985 - 1999. In {{the first step of}} the empirical study, farmland fundamental values are estimated following the standard present value model, including risk and other farm and geographic characteristics. In the second step, price discounts associated with the estimated fundamental values from the first step are regressed against <b>financial</b> <b>conditions,</b> farmland turnover ratio, and transaction characteristics. <b>Financial</b> <b>conditions</b> are measured alternatively by the debt-to-asset ratio, and high and low-spare debt capacity dummies (defined based on liquidity and solvency measures) ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigate}} financial spillovers across {{countries with}} an emphasis on the effect of shocks to <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> in the United States on <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> and economic activity in Canada. These questions are addressed within a global vector autoregression model. The framework links individual country vector autoregression models in which the domestic variables are related to the country-specific foreign variables. The authors' results highlight the importance of financial variables in the transmission of shocks to real activity and <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> in the United States to Canada. First, they show that shocks to U. S. output are transmitted quickly to Canada, with important implications for <b>financial</b> <b>conditions.</b> Second, they show that the most important source of financial transmission between the United States and Canada is through shocks to U. S. equity prices. Financial transmission through movements in the quantity of U. S. credit is also important for Canada.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> and {{economic}} activity. We first review existing measures, including both single indicators and composite <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> indexes (FCIs). We then build a new FCI that features three key innovations. First, besides interest rates and asset prices, it includes {{a broad range of}} quantitative and survey-based indicators. Second, our use of unbalanced panel estimation techniques results in a longer time series (back to 1970) than available for other indexes. Third, we control for past GDP growth and inflation and thus focus on the predictive power of <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> for future economic activity. During most {{of the past two decades}} for which comparisons are possible, including the last five years, our FCI shows a tighter link with future economic activity than existing indexes, although some of this undoubtedly reflects the fact that we selected the variables partly based on our observation of the recent financial crisis. As of the end of 2009, our FCI showed <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> at somewhat worse-than-normal levels. The main reason is that various quantitative credit measures (especially issuance of asset backed securities) remained unusually weak for an economy that had resumed expanding. Thus, our analysis is consistent with an ongoing modest drag from <b>financial</b> <b>conditions</b> on economic growth in 2010. ...|$|R
