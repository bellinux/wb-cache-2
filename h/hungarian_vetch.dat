50|$|Vicia pannonica is {{a species}} of vetch known by the common name <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch.</b> It is native to southern, central Europe and western Asia, and it is {{sometimes}} cultivated as an agricultural crop for use as hay and fodder. It may escape cultivation and grow as a casual roadside weed. This is an annual herb producing a hairy, climbing stem supported by the tendrils on its leaf-tips. The leaves are each made up of 10 to 20 oval or oblong leaflets measuring up to 2.5 centimeters in length. The inflorescence bears two to four pealike flowers each up to 2 centimeters long. The flower corolla is yellow or purple-marked {{and the back of}} the banner (the large top petal) is coated in soft hairs. The fruit is a hairy legume pod 2 to 3 centimeters long.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} row spacing (12, 5 cm and 50 cm) on seed yield {{components}} and seed yield of winter-sown hairy, <b>Hungarian</b> and common <b>vetches</b> (V. villosa Roth, V. pannonica Crantz and V. sativa L.) were investigated in this paper. Number of plants per m 2, number of stems per plant and per m 2, crop height, plant length, lodging index, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, 1, 000 seed weight and seed yield were determined. Increased row spacing resulted in increased crop height by 13. 6 %, decreased plant length by 8. 5 %, increased lodging index by 22. 3 %, {{increased number of}} stems per plant by 57. 0 %, number of pods per plant by 43. 5 %, number of seeds per pod by 14. 7 %, 1, 000 seed weight by 4. 7 % and seed yield by 29. 0 %.

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{legume crops}} in maize {{rotation}} systems may decrease {{the need for}} nitrogen (N) fertilization and increase total output. The effect of previous crops (wheat, barley, lentil, <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch,</b> and fallow) and different N fertilization rates (0, 120, 160, 200, and 240 kg of N ha– 1) on yield and N content of silage maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated under irrigated conditions in Diyarbakır, Turkey, during the 1999 - 2000, 2000 - 2001, and 2001 - 2002 growing seasons. Dry matter yield varied between 10, 068. 2 and 16, 480. 4 kg ha– 1. It was determined that <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> was a suitable rotation crop, and that 200 kg of N ha– 1 was the best N fertilization rate for silage maize production across years and N rates. Moreover, according to the previous crop × N fertilization rate interaction, the highest dry matter yield was obtained from 240 kg of N ha– 1 after barley. Silage maize following <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> in rotation {{did not respond to}} the application of more than 120 kg of N ha– 1, in terms of dry matter and N yields, while in barley-maize and wheat-maize these 2 parameters increased in response to every level of N fertilization applied. Additionally, fallow-maize and wheat-maize did not respond to the application of more than 200 kg of N ha– 1. The legumes showed potential as previous crops that could replace fallow and cereals in silage maize production by reducing the amount of N fertilizer used on silage maize without significantly decreasing dry matter and N yield. Nonetheless, the cereals demonstrated high dry matter yields, base...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine a suitable mixture of annual feed legumes and barley as a winter crop under dry-land conditions. Seeds of <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> (cv. 2670), smooth vetch (cv. Maragheh), and local varieties of grass pea and field pea were mixed with barley (cv. Abidar) in a 1 : 1 ratio and were tested, along with related monoculture. All legumes in the mixture survived winter while legumes alone, except <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch,</b> did not survive in the cold areas. The maximum fresh and dry forage yields (56 and 15 ton ha- 1 respectively) were obtained from a mixture of smooth vetch and barley in provinces with mild winter and more than 400 mm of rainfall. The mixture of barley and smooth vetch resulted in the highest mean crude protein content (17 %). Autumn seeding of smooth vetch and barley in a 1 : 1 ratio produced more than 2 ton ha- 1 of dry biomass with good quality in all studied areas and thus could serve as an alternative cropping system after wheat/barley in cold and semi-cold dry land...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} major differences in yield (herbage yield, dry matter yield, biological yield and crude protein yield) response to some Nitrogen (0, 2, 4 and 6 kg da - 1) and Phosphorus doses (0, 4, 8 and 12 kg da - 1) between Hungarian and Hairy vetch species. The experiment was {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design with three replications. Test results indicated significant differences between vetch species in terms of herbage yield, dry matter yield, biological yield and crude protein yield. The highest herbage and dry matter yield were obtained from <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> in fertilized plots (6 kg da - 1 nitrogen 4 kg da - 1 phosphorus applications). The lowest herbage and dry matter yield were obtained from Hairy vetch in nonfertilizer plots.

40|$|Isolation {{were made}} from {{original}} seed stocks of different lines of <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia pannonica Crantz) to determine seedborne fungi. The seed coat, cotyledon and embryo were cultured and the fungi were determined. Newly harvested seeds obtained from the plants grown in the field, after sowing of the original seed stocks, were examined in the similar manner and the variations of incidence of fungi on different seed parts were evaluated. The transmission of the determined fungi on original seed stocks to the plant roots was also investigated in both sterile and field soil. Aspergillus niger v. Tieghem was found at the high rates {{in all parts of}} original seed samples and in roots of the plants that developed from these seeds in sterile and field soil, differing to the lines. This fungus was re-established to the newly harvested seeds after vegetation period, however its incidence in the tissues decreased at high rates in the most of lines. Aspergillus alutaceaus Berk. and Curt was determined in the original seed stocks of some lines, but was not transmitted from seeds to the roots or newly harvested seeds. Alternaria alternata (Fr.)

40|$|Plant genetic {{resources}} are a live treasury of both one {{country and the}} whole mankind, although their ex situ preservation and in situ conservation are very demanding in numerous ways, especially if human resources and financial issues are considered. Legumes (Fabaceae Lindl.) are facing the bottlenecks caused by breeding emphasizing yield and quality, raising the questions how to solve the issue of this narrowing the genetic basis of cultivated legume species. The reintroduction of neglected and underutilised crops, such as red vetchling (Lathyrus cicera), Cyprus vetchling (Lathyrus ochrus), French serradella (Ornithopus sativus), Ethiopian pea (Pisum abyssinicum), field pea (Pisum sativum var. arvense), fenugreek (Trigonella phoenum-graecum), bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), Narbonne vetch (Vicia narbonensis), <b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia pannonica) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) may significantly assist many contemporary farming systems by diversifying their needs and improve the efficiency of environment resources...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hungarian</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia pannonica Crantz.) is an {{important}} forage crop in both central Turkey (CT) and central European countries. It can be grown in CT as winter crop, but frequent spring droughts cause yield losses. Our objectives were (I) to investigate agro-biological variation among populations, (II) to identify useful plant characters and (III) to develop selection strategies. Forty-five accessions of both var. pannonica and var. purpurascens were evaluated for the 11 plant characters in 2002 / 03 cropping season. Var. pannonica was late flowering, had more stems and seeds per pod, and longer stems and pods. Var. purpurascens had earlier flowering, more days to physiological maturity, more pods, greater plant biomass and heavier seeds. As var. purpurascens was early flowering, its longer seed-filling period is likely to contribute to greater seed size and weight. However, in var. pannonica, late flowering and ensuing delayed maturity caused strong negative associations between days-toharvest and other characters. If the earliness, higher biomass and seed size from var. purpurascens, and the many long stems and long pods from var. pannonica could be incorporated into one or more genotypes through Mendelian crossings, seed and hay yields would be substantially increased...|$|E

30|$|Two {{independent}} papers using {{very diverse}} type of plants found qualitative similar results when PGPB and HA were used under saline conditions [61, 62]. In the first report, the mitigation of salinity effects was attributed due improvements in K+/Na+ and Ca 2 +/Na+ ratios by chili peppers under inoculation with Pseudomonas stutzeri or HA treatment [61]. Changes in the ionic balance {{is the first}} and fast plant adaptation against stress including due promoted by high Na+ concentration. The increase on H+-ATPase activity induced by HS is well reported and necessary to energize K+ and Ca 2 + transporters. The other paper where the effect of salinity was observed in <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Vetch</b> and the mitigation was attributed to promotion of plant growth parameters [62]. Finally, {{we would like to}} do mention to the work of Young et al. published in 2006 [63] where the authors proposed the encapsulation of PGPB Bacillus subtilis CCpg 104 in alginate enriched with HA. The inoculation of encapsulated PGPB-HA enhanced the growth of lettuce under gnotobiotic (sterile) condition in respect to control (no-inoculated) but the differences were not significant compared with non-encapsulated inoculation. However, the time of cell viability was larger in the encapsulated PGPB offer promising alternatives to increase the shelf-life of the inoculant and increase the protection against the deleterious effects of soil environment after delivering.|$|E
