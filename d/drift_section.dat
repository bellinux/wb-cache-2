40|$|The NTX {{experiment}} at the Heavy Ion Fusion Virtual National Laboratory {{is exploring}} {{the performance of}} neutralized final focus systems for high perveance heavy ion beams. The final focus scenario in an HIF driver consists of several large aperture quadrupole magnets followed by a <b>drift</b> <b>section</b> in which the beam space charge is neutralized by a plasma. This beam is required to hit a millimeter-sized target spot {{at the end of}} the <b>drift</b> <b>section.</b> The objective of the NTX experiments and associated theory and simulations is to study the various physical mechanisms that determine the final spot size (radius r{sub s}) at a given distance (f) from the end of the last quadrupole. In a fusion driver, f is the standoff distance required to keep the chamber wall and superconducting magnets properly protected. The NTX final quadrupole focusing system produces a converging beam at the entrance to the neutralized <b>drift</b> <b>section</b> where it focuses to a small spot. The final spot is determined by the conditions of the beam entering the quadrupole section, the beam dynamics in the magnetic lattice, and the plasma neutralization dynamics in the <b>drift</b> <b>section.</b> The main issues are the control of emittance growth due to high order fields from magnetic multipoles and image fields. In this paper, we will describe the theoretical and experimental aspects of the beam dynamics in the quadrupole lattice, and how these physical effects influence the final beam size. In particular, we present theoretical and experimental results on the dependence of final spot size on geometric aberrations and perveance...|$|E

40|$|As {{directed}} by a written development plan (CRWMS M&O 1999 a), Task 1, an overall {{conceptualization of the}} physical and chemical environment (P/CE) in the emplacement drift is documented in this Analysis/Model Report (AMR). Included are the physical components of the engineered barrier system (EBS). The intended use of this descriptive conceptualization is to assist the Performance Assessment Department (PAD) in modeling the physical and chemical environment within a repository drift. It is also intended to assist PAD in providing a more integrated and complete in-drift geochemical model abstraction and to answer the key technical issues raised in the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Issue Resolution Status Report (IRSR) for the Evolution of the Near-Field Environment (NFE) Revision 2 (NRC 1999). EBS-related features, events, and processes (FEPs) have been assembled and discussed in ''EBS FEPs/Degradation Modes Abstraction'' (CRWMS M&O 2000 a). Reference AMRs listed in Section 6 address FEPs {{that have not been}} screened out. This conceptualization does not directly address those FEPs. Additional tasks described in the written development plan are recommended for future work in Section 7. 3. To achieve the stated purpose, the scope of this document includes: (1) the role of in-drift physical and chemical environments in the Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) (Section 6. 1); (2) the configuration of engineered components (features) and critical locations in <b>drifts</b> (<b>Sections</b> 6. 2. 1 and 6. 3, portions taken from EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction (CRWMS M&O 2000 b)); (3) overview and critical locations of processes that can affect P/CE (Section 6. 3); (4) couplings and relationships among features and processes in the <b>drifts</b> (<b>Section</b> 6. 4); and (5) identities and uses of parameters transmitted to TSPA by some of the reference AMRs (Section 6. 5).

The design change will result in a greater ability of the waste packages to reject heat after closure of the repository, thereby maintaining the two thermal requirements.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a free-electron laser {{can be enhanced}} by sustaining {{the growth of the}} radiation power beyond the initial saturation. One notable method is undulator tapering, which involves the variation of the gap height and/or the period along the undulator.
