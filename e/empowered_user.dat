40|$|With {{this article}} we aim to propose an {{analytical}} alternative to what we could call the substitution and condemnation of the spectator as {{an element of the}} new technological apparatuses. Actually, what we see in many of the current reflections on new media is that while the spectator is being accused of ultimate passivity, he is also being mobilized to emancipated action as an <b>empowered</b> <b>user.</b> Through the critique of an online application available on Portuguese Radio Television (RTP) ’s website, the state-owned television network, called O Meu Telejornal 1, we will try to demonstrate that we actually need to develop a spectator theory to critically understand the political position of the citizen within our changing contemporary media environment...|$|E

An <b>empowered</b> <b>user</b> – whose structuring trait revolves around creative expression, cooperative activity, and a “playful” attitude – has arisen whereas online collaboration is animated {{by a sense of}} ‘fun’ and the promise of new interactive experiences on the virtual platforms. Taking our cue from Angels 4 Travellers, a reflection will be carried out on whether social communities harness free time to work and to what extent participants are aware that their free time is somehow being exploited. In a context where companies seem to show an increased willingness to engage talent from beyond the confines of their offices, a reflection will be done on new future forms of participation. ...|$|E

One objective is to enhance the wellbeing of persons with disabilities by using their descriptions of needs in relation to assistive devices as a starting point for product development. We aim to give users an active role in developing their own assistive devices by allowing people from various disciplines to work with them in a product development team, to improve the wellbeing of persons with disabilities, and to develop product development methodology with respect to a more <b>empowered</b> <b>user</b> role in product innovation processes.

50|$|The most {{difficult}} part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable, complete list of the problems to be solved. Of course, the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design. So, Alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned, <b>empowered</b> <b>users,</b> as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions, maximizing the utility of a design, and minimizing the design rework. The desire to <b>empower</b> <b>users</b> of architecture was, in fact, what led Alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place.|$|R

40|$|As actuais potencialidades tecnológicas abrem, perante o (tele) spectador, a promessa de um ilusório <b>empowered</b> <b>user</b> que se vai construindo alicerçado na narrativa mítica da omnipotência, tornada modo verbal e complemento directo da promessa moderna da omnividência. No entanto, os plateaux informativos da televisão portuguesa do século XXI ainda não vêem no telespectador um elemento estruturante do seu trabalho. São escassos os programas que abrem o alinhamento à participação do público e aqueles que o fazem atiram-no para margens que pouco ou nada interferem no desenvolvimento das emissões. Neste artigo, analisamos a integração dos telespectadores em 1673 emissões informativas, distribuídas por seis canais de televisão (RTP 1, SIC, TVI, SICN, RTPN, TVI 24). Trata-se de uma investigação que desenvolvemos no âmbito do projecto “Jornalismo televisivo e cidadania”. New media fast-paced {{technologies}} are constantly feeding the contemporary (tele) spectator {{with the promise}} of "empowerment". In the last decades, an "empowered user" notion is being built around the mythical narrative of 'omnipotence', that becomes the verb and the active complement to the modern promise of 'omnividence": the one who sees everything, can do everything. However, what we actually find when we scan the news and information broadcasts of portuguese TV, is that we don't find many traces of this supposedly "empowered" spectator. Broadcasts scarcely consider a structural participation of their public, or they only include spectators in euphemistical terms, letting them in {{just for the sake of}} having them in, thus treating the public not as citizens but as audiences and revealing a false "empowerment". In this article we analyze the integration of TV spectators on a total of 1673 news and information broadcasts in 6 Portuguese channels (RTP 1, SIC, TVI, SICN, RTPN, TVI 24). This work is part of a research project called "Television journalism and citizenship". Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT) - "Jornalismo televisivo e cidadania...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{in the context of}} an EU Seventh Framework Programme project Fireball, in which the author took part. The project is coordinated in Finland by Aalto University's Center for Knowledge and Innovation Research (CKIR). The purpose of this study is to examine why the user driven open innovation approach is adapted to Finnish innovation policy and how can the approach be carried out in practice, looking at what works and what does not. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate the success of user driven open innovation and the conditions needed for it. This {{research was}} done by using a qualitative single case study methodology. The focal case organization of the study was Forum Virium Helsinki. The main method of data collection used in the study was 6 in depth, thematic interviews. In addition, news articles and articles from the digital archive of the case company were used to construct a coherent view of the case organization and its activities. User driven open innovation was adapted to Finnish innovation policy due to the shift in the scope of innovation policy, rooting from the changing operation environment of organizations and intensified global societal, environmental and economic challenges. The <b>empowered</b> <b>user</b> was seen as a source of new opportunities. The study found that there are no clear ways of carrying out user driven open innovation in practice. The most promising method proposed by the literature (living labs) was found to be over positive and lack practical feasibility. The existing innovation culture and practices of organizations inhibit collaborative innovation and a private sector led user driven open innovation ecosystem did not materialize. Instead, by ideating and discovering development projects from inside the city concern, successful user driven open innovation partnerships between the public, private and the civic sector were created. Opening data and interfaces of the public sector, tapping into existing user communities, finding ownership of projects in early stages and actively orchestrating collaboration were found to be some of the key success factors, turning pilots into actual services. Positive examples hindered the main challenges, such as mindsets, measuring problems and juridical issues. Still, changes in the regulatory environment, innovation culture and attitudes in general are required in order to fully benefit from user driven open innovation and make it more feasible for organizations and individual...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe recent {{applications}} {{of information and}} communication technology in consumer products unveiled a promising form of user-product interaction. Somehow, a handful succeeded to <b>empower</b> <b>users</b> to design their uses. We call them “smart products with built in flexibility”. One of the best pioneering examples is IPad. Users generated uses ranging from utilizing the product as a book to employing it as a music instrument. In this regard, {{it is evident that}} their values are less about their performance of fulfilling a given task but rather captured in their ability to <b>empower</b> <b>users</b> to self-design uses. This is why, in this paper, we aimed at better understanding how they do so. To reach this goal, we developed, by exploiting modern design theories like C-K theory, a novel theoretical framework for use generation and applied it on two types of smart products with built in flexibility i. e. the ADIDAS One running shoes and an app for mobile phone called EMOTIO. Mostly, with our findings, we revealed the nature of design mechanisms that are proper to each of these products and subsequently identified the design tasks assigned to users. Relying on these findings, we finally considered managerial implications so that these products better promote users ´abilities to design uses as after all, they are purchased products...|$|R
