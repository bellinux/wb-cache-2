5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E
5|$|According to Karl James, no {{detailed}} {{orders were}} produced {{for the attack}} and deliberate planning was hastily completed {{with little or no}} co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great {{emphasis was placed on}} continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

25|$|Many {{species are}} cryptically colored to {{resemble}} their surroundings. For example, Uroplatus geckos can be almost completely invisible, {{even to a}} nearby observer. Similarly, the katydids, a group of grasshopper-like insects found worldwide, are nocturnal and use their cryptic coloration to remain unnoticed during the day. They remain perfectly still, often in a position that increases the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> camouflage.|$|E
25|$|In {{alliance}} with the Ottoman Empire, Britain mounted an expedition to expel the French from Egypt. After careful preparations and rehearsals in Turkish anchorages, a British force under Sir Ralph Abercromby made a successful opposed landing at the Battle of Abukir (1801). Abercromby was mortally wounded at the Battle of Alexandria, where the British troops demonstrated the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> musketry, improved discipline and growing experience. The French capitulated and were evacuated from Egypt in British ships.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese soon {{worked on}} various {{techniques}} {{to improve the}} <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> guns. They developed a serial firing technique to create a continuous rain of bullets on the enemy. They also developed bigger calibers to increase lethal power. Protective boxes in lacquerware were invented to fit over the firing mechanism so it could still fire while it was raining, as were systems to accurately fire weapons at night by keeping fixed angles thanks to measured strings.|$|E

25|$|Under the Palo Alto Daily News model, {{papers are}} {{delivered}} to public {{places such as}} coffee shops, restaurants, stores, gyms, schools, corporate campuses, and news racks. Price and Pavelich have avoided putting {{the content of their}} newspapers online because that would reduce readership of their printed newspapers, and therefore reduce the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> print advertising. While ads can be placed on Web pages, they are not as effective for clients as print advertising.

25|$|The {{political}} {{partnership between}} Hawke and his Treasurer, Paul Keating, proved essential to Labor's success in government. The two men proved {{a study in}} contrasts: Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early. Hawke's enthusiasms were cigars, horse racing and all forms of sport; Keating preferred classical architecture, Mahler symphonies and collecting British Regency and French Empire antiques. Hawke was consensus-driven; Keating revelled in aggressive debate. Hawke was a lapsed Protestant; Keating was a practising Catholic. These differences, however, seemed only to increase the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> partnership, as they oversaw sweeping economic and social changes throughout Australia.|$|E
30|$|The {{anatomical}} {{and physiological}} barriers that the cornea offers against {{the entrance of}} bacteria and other pathogens may also pose difficulties for the access and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> drugs. Current topical treatment options for ocular surface inflammation available today include mainly corticosteroid eye drops containing antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclosporine A. Topical corticosteroids have shown through previous studies to have a rapid onset of action and efficacy when treating DED [20], {{but they have a}} limited range <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> potential side effects, which include posterior subscapsular cataract and increased intraocular pressure [21].

25|$|Price and Pavelich have {{an entirely}} {{different}} view of the Internet than other free daily publishers. While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, the creators of the Palo Alto Daily News model have refused to put their content online.

25|$|Typically, predators {{attempt to}} reduce {{communication}} to prey as this will generally reduce the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. deception by the predator. A well-known example is the angler fish, an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves {{in a better position}} for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne). These spiders are commonly referred to as “antmimicking spiders” {{because of the way they}} wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{instances}} of larger lionfish individuals engaging in cannibalism on smaller individuals, adult lionfish have few identified natural predators, likely from the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> venomous spines. Moray eels (family Muraenidae), bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), and large groupers, like the tiger grouper (Mycteroperca tigris) and Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), {{have been observed}} preying on lionfish. It remains unknown, however, how commonly these predators prey on lionfish. Sharks are also believed {{to be capable of}} preying on lionfish with no ill effects from their spines. Park officials of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras have attempted to train sharks to feed on lionfish as of 2011 in an attempt to control the invasive populations in the Caribbean. Predators of larvae and juvenile lionfish remain unknown, but may prove to be the primary limiting factor of lionfish populations in their native range.|$|E

25|$|To {{strengthen}} their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat {{and picking up}} guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics and then, a day before the trade deadline, trading Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake. Thanks {{in part to the}} improved <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> backup squad, boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the all-star break. Nonetheless, and despite several victories over top contenders, the team displayed a pattern of losing games to inferior teams even at their home arena. On April 11, in a 112–95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons {{for the first time since}} 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib that would keep him out of the post-season, a big blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.|$|E

In this paper we propose a novel wave based architecture that blends the high performance that can be achieved by recently proposed architectures with the simplicity of wave based bilateral teleoperation...|$|R

500|$|Aware that Imperial {{troops had}} {{breached}} the Schellenberg's defences Marlborough launched a third assault. This time the attackers formed a broader front, requiring d'Arco's men to spread their fire, thus reducing the deadly <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> musketry and grenades. But the defenders, including la Colonie, (unaware that the Imperialists had penetrated their left flank, and that d'Arco had retreated to Donauwörth), were still {{confident in their}} ability to repel the enemy– [...] "We remained steady at our post; our fire was regular as ever, and kept our opponents in check." [...] It was not long, however, before the Franco-Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of Baden's infantry approaching {{from the direction of the}} town. Many of the officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet's garrison in Donauwörth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact Baden's troops. [...] "They [...] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, without our being aware of the possibility of such a thing." [...] Wrote de la Colonie. [...] "So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post..." [...] After establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, Baden's men now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling them to re-align in order to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough's assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted English dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill. The enemy at last fell into confusion.|$|E
