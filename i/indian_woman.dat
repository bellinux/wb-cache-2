Alder, not realizing the treaty's importance, chose not to attend.|$|E
50|$|The {{deficit in}} <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> {{compared}} to men {{was caused by}} the recruitment quota ratio of 100 men to 40 women, most of the women were young and single, and the shortage of <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> for <b>Indian</b> men was aggravated when <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> were taken by Africans and European overseers, leading to high amounts of wife murders against <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> by <b>Indian</b> men and a decrease in morals. The appropriation of <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> by Europeans and Africans added up to the resentment which contributed to violence against <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> by <b>Indian</b> men. <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> on plantations took part in the struggle against Africans and European authorities who were sexually using them.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th to early 20th century, Chinese men in Mauritius married <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> {{due to a}} lack of Chinese women and the higher numbers of <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> on the island.

However, due to the lack of Chinese females entering the country, the Chinese men eventually established sexual unions with <b>Indian</b> <b>women.</b> A similar situation happened in Guyana, where the idea of sexual relations with <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> was initially unappealing to the Chinese migrants. Eventually their attitudes changed as well and Chinese men established sexual relationships with <b>Indian</b> <b>women.</b> The 1921 census in Mauritius counted that <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> there had a total of 148 children fathered by Chinese men.

At any given BMI, the <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> had a higher total body fat percentage, visceral fat level and high fat percentage than the Irish women (p= 0. 024, 0. 001 and 0. 001, respectively).

40|$|Traditional Indian {{cultural}} narratives are {{pervasive and}} serve to typify personal identity and experience. These cultural narratives portray <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> {{as a wife}} and mother, nurturing, obedient, forbearing, soft-spoken, and the primary transmitters of the ethnic culture.

As assimilation theory suggests, Asian Indians in the United States are likely to assimilate at least some degree into American society. Accordingly, these narratives make up the cultural identity of <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> in the United States.

Moreover, the colonial records do not reveal leadership roles among <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> because the records are based on imperial domination and exploitation, reflecting anecdotal rather than analytical evidence. The article shows {{that in spite of}} restrictions, indentured <b>Indian</b> <b>women</b> did engage in leadership roles on the sugar plantations but were not as open about these roles as their male counterparts were. Nonetheless, their engagement in leadership roles was instrumental in turning adverse circumstances to their advantage, and they used strategies that were not altogether obvious to the supporters of patriarchy...|$|R
