25|$|By Allah, {{while taking}} charge of your {{government}} I was not unaware {{of the fact that}} you are unhappy over my taking over of government and you people don’t like it. I am well aware of whatever is there in your hearts regarding this matter but still I have taken <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> on the basis of my sword… Now if you see that I am not fulfilling your rights, then you should be happy with me with whatever is there.|$|E

2500|$|... "Slay him not, for by Allah {{not a man}} {{among you}} shall slay him, but he shall meet the Lord {{mutilated}} without a hand, and verily the sword of God has continued sheathed, but surely by Allah if you slay him the Lord will indeed draw it, and will never sheath <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you.</b> Never was a Prophet slain, but there were slain on account of him 70,000 persons, and never was a Caliph slain, but 35,000 Persons were killed on his account." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I shall {{come and}} redeem <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>thee,</b> sulky carle as thou art,' said Bertram. 'Such jewels {{are not for}} greasy porridge-fed housewives. Hark thee, have it ready for me! I shall be at thy hovel ere long'-- as Anne waved to Hob when she was lifted to her seat.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} Francisco d'Anconia {{indicates the}} role of [...] "looters" [...] and [...] "moochers" [...] in relation to money: [...] "So you think that money {{is the root of}} all evil?... Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. ... Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or the looters who take <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce." ...|$|E
2500|$|If all {{the players}} choose to not take the card, then the dealer calls, [...] "Second", which means there is another chance in taking the card. If someone takes it as Sun, then {{no one else can}} buy it over him even if they were of a higher priority. That is a {{significant}} advantage of buying Sun in the second round over the first; that no one else can take <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> even if they were of a higher priority. They lose that right by saying no in the second round. But if someone takes it as Hokom, then the Hokom must be something different from the suit of the public card because it is on the second mode. Other players can take the card as Sun. The player that takes it as Hokom, has the option to choose between three suits before lifting up the two cards that the dealer just gave. Or it is Sun if the player lifts up the two cards before naming a suit for Hokom. There is not [...] "Ashkal" [...] in the second round.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you</b> than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Behold, in {{token of}} these things I lay my symbol on thy breast, and on her breast also shall that symbol be. When I lift <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>thee</b> and thou dost open thy eyes, then awaken Pharaoh at thy side and let these my words be written in a roll, so {{that none of them}} are forgotten.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, I {{should have}} an answer. You must realize that, {{and if it is}} one that hurts I should sooner <b>it</b> came <b>from</b> <b>you</b> than anybody else." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But your {{strength}} is detachable. It {{can be taken}} away <b>from</b> <b>you.</b> Even now the Plutocracy is taking <b>it</b> away <b>from</b> <b>you.</b> In the end it will take <b>it</b> all away <b>from</b> <b>you.</b> And then you will cease to be the middle class. You will descend to us. You will become proletarians. And {{the beauty of it}} is that you will then add to our strength. We will hail you brothers, and we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of humanity.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{lifted her}} hand and showed the marks.--"But <b>it</b> came <b>from</b> <b>thee,</b> my brother; and I would catch the plague <b>from</b> <b>thee,</b> so that <b>it</b> should make me share thee. Do thou clean thy hand; let mine alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was a very}} {{innocent}} {{commission that}} she undertook, poor thing. And in keeping <b>it</b> secret <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> she supposed, no doubt, that she was only saving you uneasiness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After I {{know all}} about <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you?</b> He ought to have told me before. Does he think I didn't care--because I left you so much liberty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sheen!" [...] Stanning stopped dead. [...] "Do {{you mean}} to say you let a fool like Sheen take <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you!</b> Why didn't you turn him out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Grizel looked alarmed, and {{thinking}} to weaken his case, said, hastily, [...] "I very nearly kept <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>you,</b> I said often to myself 'I won't tell him.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{the spirit}} {{confused}} [...] With misgiving and with sorrow, [...] Let me, my Saviour, borrow [...] The light of faith <b>from</b> <b>thee.</b> [...] O lift <b>from</b> <b>it</b> the burden [...] That bows it down before thee. [...] With sighs and with weeping [...] I commend myself to thee; [...] My faded life, thou knowest, [...] Little by little is wasted [...] Like wax before the fire, [...] Like snow-wreaths in the sun. [...] And {{for the soul}} that panteth [...] For its refuge in thy bosom, [...] Break, thou, the ties, my Saviour, [...] That hinder <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>thee.</b>|$|R

25|$|Afrocentricity {{can stand}} its ground among any {{ideology}} or religion: Marxism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, or Judaism. Your Afrocentricity will {{emerge in the}} presence of these other ideologies because <b>it</b> is <b>from</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "See, then, {{that the}} thing does not kill thee at last. It is Death! Remember, it is Death! There is enough in that thing to kill the men of all my city. Not long wilt thou hold it, Jungle Man, nor he who takes <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>thee.</b> They will kill, and kill, and kill for its sake!
