50|$|Because {{the station}} {{had been a}} {{terminus}} for the Metropolitan Railway the original <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> on the route to London Marylebone included a sharp curve. This became inconvenient once some Great Central trains began to run non-stop through Aylesbury from 1899 onwards. Rather than change the <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> to suit faster trains, a 15 mph speed restriction {{was applied to the}} curve.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sightline}} (also sight line) or {{visual axis}} is a normally unobstructed [...] between an intended observer (or spectator) and {{a subject of}} interest, such as a stage, arena, or monument. Sightlines are a particularly important consideration in theatre and stadium design, road <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> and urban planning. In cities such as London, construction within sightlines is restricted to protect the key views of famous landmarks.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the closure}} of {{adjacent}} (to the south) steel works and East Coast Main Line electrification, the <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> was revised in 1990/91 to allow Fast Line trains to pass through at higher speeds. It was {{as a result of}} these revisions that single lead junctions from the Kirkhill and Cambuslang directions were installed, that contributed to the Newton rail crash. After several months a double line link was reinstated from Kirkhill.|$|R
25|$|The {{section of}} the M4 in South Wales has to thread its way through mountainous terrain and {{built-up}} areas, {{so there are some}} unusual <b>junction</b> <b>layouts.</b> <b>Junction</b> 27 (High Cross) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the slip road onto the motorway. Junctions 30–31 (East Cardiff) were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges at the time of construction. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct Junction 31 (A469 road). Junction 39 can only be used to access the motorway from a single slip road onto the westbound carriageway from the A48 at Junction 38. There is no exit from the motorway at this junction.|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} World War II halted sign {{modernisation}} efforts across Europe, however, and governments removed direction signs from their road networks - fearing {{that they would}} assist enemy spies and/or invading forces. The end of the war, on the other hand, presented itself as an opportunity, seized by many European nations, to set about redeveloping their directional signage systems. The construction of high-speed motorways meant that traditional road signs were no longer practical, and so new, modern signs with bold, sans serif typefaces and diagrams indicating lanes and sliproads ahead were developed. The British Worboys Committee (established in 1963) went even further, creating signs with detailed diagrams of <b>junction</b> <b>layouts.</b> Such signs have now been in use almost unchanged for over half a century.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{report about the}} {{transport}} properties of mesoscopic normal-metal/superconductor (NS) hybrid systems with two different <b>junction</b> <b>layouts.</b> One is a junction fabricated by overlaying S on N wire {{and the other with}} S sandwiched between two N wires, forming an NSN structure. At zero bias all the junctions exhibited a sharp decrease of dV =dI; which is believed to arise from the interference between the disorder-scattered and the Andreev-reflected quasiparticles. A small magnetic field corresponding to one flux quantum through the normal metal region, applied in parallel with the NS junction, easily suppressed the anomalous zero-bias conductance enhancement for the sandwich-junction sample. This high sensitivity to a small magnetic field observed in our systems of mesoscopic NS junctions in a diffusive-transport regime directly confirms the electron–hole...|$|R
5000|$|After the accident, {{the driver}} {{went to the}} signal box and told the {{signalman}} [...] "You had double flashing yellows and the route was set for Stoke". With [...] "traditional" [...] <b>junction</b> <b>layouts</b> in mind, flashing yellows would have meant that the route was set for him right through the junction, with at worst, the red signal on the far side. It was not; at Colwich the signalling system was designed for the 'diverging route' to be only the crossover from the Down Fast to the Down Slow, and the driver was not expecting to see a red signal before taking the Stoke line. In this respect railway nomenclature had unwittingly set a trap; he had after all seen a 'Junction Indicator' illuminated and thus assumed that his train had been routed across the junction.|$|R
5|$|The first {{dealt with}} the Strand branch: it {{confirmed}} the <b>layout</b> of the <b>junction</b> between the branch and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend the branch south under the River Thames to the London and South Western Railway's (L's) terminus at Waterloo station. The extension included moving Strand station {{to the corner of}} Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel from there to the BS's Waterloo station which would be provided with additional lifts to serve the GNP's platforms. The branch was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station. The <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo. The bill received royal assent on 4 August 1905 as the Great Northern Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1905.|$|R
50|$|During its {{operational}} lifetime the Scarborough and Whitby line became notoriously impracticable {{and difficult to}} work. The <b>junction</b> <b>layouts</b> {{at both ends of}} the line (Prospect Hill in Whitby and Falsgrave in Scarborough) meant that trains had to reverse direction in order to gain access to the route. These movements, particularly in the days of steam, were time-consuming and disrupted the movement of other trains. This problem was especially acute at Scarborough, where Central station was extremely busy during the summer months. The route itself was steeply graded in both directions (1 in 39 being the steepest) and its location along the coast meant that the rails were often slippery due to rain and sea mists. This made driving conditions in bad weather extremely difficult and great skill was needed from the engine crews to prevent trains from stalling on the climbs.|$|R

5000|$|The {{junction}} {{underwent a}} minor redesign in 2006 when new section of carriageway was {{built at the}} M57 terminus, allowing motorists to directly transfer onto either the A5036 or A59 roads. The primary objective was to ensure the junction could withstand the predicted increase in road traffic {{for the next decade}} and help improve the flow of an estimated 43,000 vehicles daily. [...] At this time, the island was handling up to 80,000 vehicles every day, of which 10% were heavy goods vehicles and resulting in extensive traffic queues leading to increased risks of traffic accidents. The roadworks completed in Spring 2006, resulting in a revised <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> and removing the roundabout configuration. A short stretch of the original roundabout remained in existence to be utilised as an inspection area and weighbridge, operated by the Vehicle Inspectorate; this was reconstructed following construction of the new Thornton to Switch island link road which has carriageway {{in some parts of the}} old roundabout.|$|R
40|$|Three {{families}} of road noise prediction models {{can be distinguished}} depending on the way they account for traffic flow. Static noise models only consider free-flow constant-speed traffic with uniformly distributed vehicles. Analytic noise models assume that all vehicles are isolated from one another but account for their mean kinematic profile over the network. Micro-simulation noise models relax the hypothesis of no interaction between vehicles and fully capture traffic flow dynamic effects such as queue evolution. This study compares the noise levels obtained by these three methodologies at signalized intersections and roundabouts. It reveals that micro-simulation noise models outperform the other approaches. Particularly, {{they are able to}} capture the effects of stochastic transient queues in undersaturated conditions as well as stop-and-go behaviors in oversaturated regime. Accounting for traffic dynamics is also shown to improve predictions of noise variations due to different <b>junction</b> <b>layouts.</b> In this paper, a roundabout is found to induce a 2. 5 dB(A) noise abatement compared to a signalized intersection in undersaturated conditions while the acoustic contributions of both kinds of junctions balance in oversaturated regime...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Applied Ergonomics [© Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] aim {{of this article is to}} demonstrate how a 'value-added' approach can be used for user-centred design of geographic information. An information science perspective was used, with value being the difference in outcomes arising from alternative information sets. Sixteen drivers navigated a complex, unfamiliar urban route, using visual and verbal instructions representing the distance-to-turn and <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> information presented by typical satellite navigation systems. Data measuring driving errors, navigation errors and driver confidence were collected throughout the trial. The results show how driver performance varied considerably according to the geographic context at specific locations, and that there are specific opportunities to add value with enhanced geographical information. The conclusions are that a value-added approach facilitates a more explicit focus on 'desired' (and feasible) levels of end user performance with different information sets, and is a potentially effective approach to user-centred design of geographic information. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society...|$|R

40|$|An outline is {{presented}} {{of the work}} {{carried out in the}} 1974 fiscal year on the GCFBR safety research project consisting of the development of improved steam generator and circulator (steam turbine driven helium compressor) models which will eventually be inserted in the HELAP (1) code. Furthermore, a code was developed which will be used to generate steady state input for the primary and secondary sides of the steam generator. The following conclusions and suggestions for further work are made: (1) The steam-generator and circulator model are consistent with the volume and <b>junction</b> <b>layout</b> used in HELAP, (2) with minor changes these models, when incorporated in HELAP, could be used to simulate a direct cycle plant, (3) an explicit control valve model is still to be developed and would be very desirable to control the flow to the turbine during a transient (initially this flow will be controlled by using the existing check valve model); (4) the friction factor in the laminar flow region is computed inaccurately, this might cause significant errors in loss-of-flow accidents; and (5) it is felt that HELAP will still use a large amount of computer time and will thus be limited to design basis accidents without scram or loss of flow transients with and without scram. Finally it may also be used as a test bed for the development of prototype component models which would be incorporated in a more sophisticated system code, developed specifically for GCFBR's.

40|$|Abstract This diploma work {{is about}} Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) circuits. This supercoducting digital {{circuitry}} {{has the most}} promising properties in terms of speed and power consumption. The active elements of the RSFQ circuits are Josephson junctions (JJ). For their fabrication low temperature superconducting niobium films are used. Today the design and fabrication of RSFQ circuits are done in a standardized way with well-defined design rules. Nevertheless, to design complicated circuits with more than several hundred junctions a lot of practical problems must be solved. Different aspects of the RSFQ circuits design process were investigated in this work. In the theoretical part we propose a new, more realistic model of the Josephson junction for physical simulation (which is necessarily used for design of every RSFQ gate) {{in order to improve}} its quality and precision. The new model for the JJ includes additional inductances, which must reflect a specific environment of the <b>junction</b> <b>layout.</b> The influence of parameter deviations was investigated in the simulation. As sources of the deviation we chose the spread of c (the Stewart-McCumber parameter) and that of the inductances. Then the operational margins of the basic elements of the RSFQ logic SR flip-flop were determined and compared with the prediction of the previously used model. To prove the results of simulations we designed a test structure of the SR flip-flop, with c= 1 and c= 2 for the wellestablished HYPRES technology (USA). Another part of the work is practical measurements. A test chip, containing chains of 100 Josephson junctions was designed and measured in order to estimate the spread of critical currents in real technology...|$|R

5000|$|The {{accident}} {{was of a}} type known as [...] "ding-ding, and away"; caused primarily by a Signal passed at danger (SPAD) {{in conjunction with the}} single-lead <b>junction</b> track <b>layout,</b> where two lines converged into one just beyond the platform end and then diverged again - a layout which is simpler to maintain but is vulnerable {{in the event of a}} SPAD. This type of junction has been implicated in other accidents, notably to the south east of Glasgow in the Newton rail accident just a couple of years later.
