5|$|In {{the early}} days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> the songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E
5|$|Griffiths {{sought a}} {{historical}} origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe's theory, {{to account for}} it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so {{it is possible that}} the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his serekh-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.|$|E

5|$|Vermigli became deeply {{involved}} in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the Book of Common Prayer Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper {{should be forced to}} wear a surplice. Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum in 1552.|$|E
5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep it constantly balanced.|$|E
