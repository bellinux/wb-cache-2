In this study, we were interested in investigating sources of heat loss and movement of heat within the corridor. Through our investigation, we discovered that solar heat gain is as much of a problem as heat loss. Temperatures underwent extreme fluctuations and ended up spending time above the comfort zone as well as below.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} {{angularly}} selective fenestration systems {{has been developed}} {{in the past two}} decades and shows great potential in improving visual comfort while reducing energy consumption, especially when combined with spectrally selective properties. Such systems include light-redirecting <b>glazing,</b> <b>shading,</b> film coatings, reflectors and others. To assess the potential of these systems accurately and reliably, one needs to be able to predict in detail how they modify the energy, direction, and spectral make-up of solar radiation. For this assessment, spectral (wavelength-dependent) Bidirectional Transmission or Reflection Distribution Functions are used, usually referred to as BTDFs or BRDFs, or more generally BSDFs for Scattering Functions. To enable a faster, cheaper, and continuous investigation of these properties over most of the solar spectrum (400 to 1700 nm), an innovative goniospectrometric instrument has been created, relying on digital imaging, on light collection by an ellipsoidal half-transparent mirror, and on a filtering method in the visible range to generate spectral radiometric BSDFs. This so-called Heliodome instrument is described in this paper. It enables the performance of new fenestration technologies to be assessed in terms of lighting and solar gains management potential. Its major innovations compared to other devices are to enable an analysis of both the visible and the near-infrared portions of the solar spectrum, to provide spectral as well as photometric light distribution data, and to ensure a continuous investigation of the transmitted or reflected light in a time-efficient way. 1...|$|E

40|$|A Building Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (BIPV/T) {{system that}} {{consists}} of a mechanically ventilated, multi-skin facade, a between-the-panes venetian blind layer, and a between-the-panes Photovoltaic (PV) panel is considered. Ambient air is drawn in and forced to flow upward through the system. As air moves through the system, it is heated by the blind layer, the glazing layers, and the PV panel. This BIPV/T system is especially attractive because it can produce electricity and thermal {{energy in the form}} of preheated fresh air and allow for adjustable daylighting. There is a need to understand, design, and optimize BIPV/T systems. The velocity and temperature fields around the blind slats were experimentally and numerically studied. Experimental observations and numerical models are essential in understanding the complex fluid dynamical and thermal system and providing design and optimization guidelines. Solar-optical and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models were developed and validated at various blind slat angles and flow mean speeds. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and temperature measurements were taken inside the ventilated facade. A simple empirical one-dimensional (1 –D) model was developed, based on average surface temperatures and heat transfer coefficients, to quickly calculate average surface temperatures and heat flux rates. Between-the-panes convective heat transfer coefficients were obtained from CFD and used in the 1 –D model.

40|$|Overheating in {{domestic}} homes specifically in built up urban areas {{has become a}} pressing problem within the UK that may become a costly energy problem {{in years to come}} if passive design strategies are not fully understood and integrated. This research looks to investigate how internal and external solar shading systems impact on operative temperatures when an optimum blind and ventilation strategy is adopted within a renovated block of flats in London. Although shading and ventilation were overlooked at the initial stage of building design, the implementation of solar shading {{has been found to be}} beneficial in maintaining thermal comfort within the building when external temperatures were recorded both above and below 20 - 25 °C. During the study shading was combined with a night-time natural ventilation strategy which enabled most rooms to cool when external temperatures were at their lowest. However, night-time ventilation may not be desirable to the occupants due to external traffic noise and security issues combined with the intended design use of the rooms as in this case study. The authors believe lower indoor temperatures could be achieved if window opening areas were increased in the façade design. In two areas of the building natural ventilation was not possible leading to significant overheating and the retrofitting of mechanical ventilation. This highlights the need for an effective façade management strategy considering the <b>glazing,</b> <b>shading</b> and ventilation collectively at the design stage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} energy and light {{performance}} assessment of two configurations of an Active Transparent Façade (ATF), which are investigated {{by means of}} an experimental campaign that makes use of a full-scale mock-up room of an office building. The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or double pane glazing with low-e coating), while share all the other features - i. e. external <b>glazing,</b> <b>shading</b> system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated double pane glazing (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively. A higher amount of daylight is then guaranteed within the indoor space by Module A, but this might result in a higher probability of visual discomfort for the occupants. On the other hand, the Module B determines lower daily energy transmitted toward the indoor environment than Module A: on average, the daily energy gain/loss from/toward the outdoor environment are reduced of about 30 %, in summer (with or without the reflective roller screen), and in the range 30 - 40 % in winter (with or without the reflective roller screen...|$|E

For the first time, empirical study of daylighting performance was conducted for an existing typical government office building designed by Public Work Department (PWD) in Malaysia. Daylight field measurement of external illuminance and internal work plane illuminance was carried out. The findings demonstrated that internal daylight level in the building was insufficient despite the abundance of external daylight availability in the tropics which can achieve as high as 130 klx. Validation of simulation using Radiance-based software against the measurement under actual tropical sky indicated significant Pearson correlation of 0. 709.

40|$|With {{environmental}} protection posing {{as the number}} one global problem, man {{has no choice but}} to reduce his energy consumption. One way to accomplish this is to resort to passive and low-energy systems to maintain thermal comfort in buildings. The conventional and modern designs of wind towers can successfully be used in hot arid regions to maintain thermal comfort (with or without the use of ceiling fans) during all hours of the cooling season, or a fraction of it. Climatic design is one of the best approaches to reduce the energy cost in buildings. Proper design is the first step of defence against the stress of the climate. Buildings should be designed according to the climate of the site, reducing the need for mechanical heating or cooling. Hence maximum natural energy can be used for creating a pleasant environment inside the built envelope. Technology and industry progress in the last decade diffused electronic and informatics' devices in many human activities, and also in building construction. The utilisation and operating opportunities components, increase the reduction of heat losses by varying the thermal insulation, optimise the lighting distribution with louver screens and operate mechanical ventilation for coolness in indoor spaces. In addition to these parameters the intelligent envelope can act for security control and became an important part of the building domotic revolution. Application of simple passive cooling measure is effective in reducing the cooling load of buildings in hot and humid climates. Fourty-three percent reductions can be achieved using a combination of well-established technologies such as <b>glazing,</b> <b>shading,</b> insulation, and natural ventilation. More advanced passive cooling techniques such as roof pond, dynamic insulation, and evaporative water jacket need to be considered more closely. The building sector is a major consumer of both energy and materials worldwide, and that consumption is increasing. Most industrialised countries are in addition becoming more and more dependent on external supplies of conventional energy carriers, i. e., fossil fuels. Energy for heating and cooling can be replaced by new renewable energy sources. New renewable energy sources, however, are usually not economically feasible compared with the traditional carriers. In order to achieve the major changes needed to alleviate the environmental impacts of the building sector, it is necessary to change and develop both the processes in the industry itself, and to build a favourable framework to overcome the present economic, regulatory and institutional barriers. This article describes various designs of low-energy buildings. It also, outlines the effect of dense urban building nature on energy consumption, and its contribution to climate change.

40|$|Human {{efforts to}} {{increase}} their comfort rise in density of population in congested city areas, rapid growth of traffic and electric smog created due to constantly transforming communication technologies all resulted in an increase of stress in the immediate human environment. All of this, along with frequent reports about changes in global climate, gradually contributes to an alteration of thinking of the whole society, which is forced to face the consequences of economic damages caused by climatic changes. If we want to tenably assert adequate economic and social living conditions, we have to approach the natural environment in a more profound way. In accordance with the trend of substantional development {{for the purpose of}} enhancement {{of the quality of the}} living environment in the field of building industry, it is logical to concentrate on buildings, which are conceptually focused on saving of the energy. That is on energy-efficient houses. Pathway to sustainable building is not based on discovering one or several multipurpose technological solutions, but on usage of new designing principles, new materials and methods of processing them as well as new techniques of construction. For an effective creation of a building concept it is essential to have that kind of device which quickly responds to changes performed on a design, enables an easier work on variants and produces the most accurate results. Consistent application of energy optimizing methods is necessary particularly for designs of energy saving houses. Beginning efficient building design is the most “abstract factor of concept linked with very uncertain inputs,” because a lot of parameters in that moment is still unknown. Many mutually connected factors are invoked during designing passive house e. g. trajectory of the sun and the shielding effect of the surroundings, the aspect of sunlight and interior lighting, power quality construction, etc. Currently, the architect has no choice, he can use only well-known precepts, such as large windows are facing the South not the North. Unfortunately this "empirical formula" for the design of a real passive house is not enough. And yet the first draft of the house is most affected by not only its shape, form, but user´s comfortable, cost, feasibility and future energy behavior of buildings and related operating costs of the house too. It is obvious that this stage should not be underestimated, because “minor variation of the initial inputs greatly influence the outcomes. ” With this reasoning, the work focuses on early stage design decision, i. e. the architectural concept of a passive house (an idea, vision). Therefore the aim of this work is to simplify the issue into understandable form, i. e. the creation of relatively simple and illustrative sketches, which generalize the issue satisfactorily, show the individual parameters (<b>glazing,</b> <b>shading,</b> shape, size, etc.) and change need of heat for heating passive house. The results of the work will be useful when the architect picks up the pencil and starts to think about his future house. At this point, he will have on hand sketches, which give him an idea and streamline his further design. Therefore the main goal is to create new outcomes and identify energy behaviour of buildings with a computational tool.
