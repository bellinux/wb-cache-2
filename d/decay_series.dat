40|$|Abstract. Hyperbolic <b>decay</b> time <b>series</b> such as {{fractional}} Gaussian noise or fractional autoregressive moving-average processes exhibit {{two distinct}} types of behaviour: strong persistence or antipersistence. Beran (Statistics for Long Memory Processes. London: Chapman and Hall, 1994) characterized {{the family of}} strongly persistent time series. A more general family of hyperbolic <b>decay</b> time <b>series</b> is introduced and its basic properties are characterized {{in terms of the}} autocovariance and spectral density functions. The random shock and inverted form representations are derived. It is shown that every strongly persistent series is the dual of an antipersistent series and vice versa. The asymptotic generalized variance of hyperbolic <b>decay</b> time <b>series</b> with unit innovation variance is shown to be in®nite which implies that the variance of the minimum mean-square-error one-step linear predictor using the last k observations decays slowly to the innovation variance as k gets large...|$|R

Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium <b>decay</b> <b>series</b> as the daughter isotope of actinium-227.

5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive <b>decay</b> <b>series,</b> and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E
50|$|All {{amplifiers}} distort. So do SETs. This mainly {{harmonic distortion}} {{is a unique}} pattern of simple and monotonically <b>decaying</b> <b>series</b> of harmonics, dominated by modest levels of second harmonic. The result is like adding the same tone one octave higher. The added harmonic tone is lower in amplitude, at about 1-5% or less in a no feedback amp at full power and rapidly decreasing at lower output levels. Hypothetically, a single-ended power amplifier's second harmonic distortion might reduce similar harmonic distortion in a single driver loudspeaker, if their harmonic distortions were equal and amplifier {{was connected to the}} speaker so that the distortions would neutralize each other.|$|R
5000|$|Digital reverberators use various signal {{processing}} algorithms {{in order to}} create the reverb effect. Since reverberation is essentially caused by {{a very large number of}} echoes, simple reverberation algorithms use several feedback delay circuits to create a large, <b>decaying</b> <b>series</b> of echoes. More advanced digital reverb generators can simulate the time and frequency domain response of a specific room (using room dimensions, absorption and other properties). In a music hall, the direct sound always arrives at the listener's ear first because it follows the shortest path. Shortly after the direct sound, the reverberant sound arrives. The time between the two is called the [...] "pre-delay." ...|$|R
5|$|Actinium {{is found}} only in traces in uranium ores – one tonne of uranium in ore {{contains}} about 0.2 milligrams of 227Ac – and in thorium ores, which contain about 5 nanograms of 228Ac per one tonne of thorium. The actinium isotope 227Ac is a transient member of the uranium-actinium <b>series</b> <b>decay</b> chain, which begins with the parent isotope 235U (or 239Pu) and ends with the stable lead isotope 207Pb. The isotope 228Ac is a transient member of the thorium <b>series</b> <b>decay</b> chain, which begins with the parent isotope 232Th and ends with the stable lead isotope 208Pb. Another actinium isotope (225Ac) was transiently present in the neptunium <b>series</b> <b>decay</b> chain, beginning with 237Np (or 233U) and ending with thallium (205Tl) and near-stable bismuth (209Bi), but this chain existed only in the early Solar System, due to the short half-life of neptunium-237.|$|R
5|$|The known {{isotopes}} {{of plutonium}} range in mass number from 228 to 247. The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers {{lower than the}} most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and alpha emission, mostly forming uranium (92 protons) and neptunium (93 protons) isotopes as decay products (neglecting {{the wide range of}} daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is beta emission, mostly forming americium (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium <b>decay</b> <b>series,</b> decaying to americium-241 via beta emission.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long <b>decay</b> <b>series</b> that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} waves {{propagating}} in an infinite {{plate with a}} line of equally spaced point masses on it. In particular, we consider waves that are laterally decaying, i. e. waves that exist due to the point masses, not in spite of them. We begin with a simple continuum limit and then study the discrete case using a suitable Green function and a superposition method used earlier for other structures by Mead. The superposition involves a slowly <b>decaying</b> <b>series</b> that we transform to a rapidly converging one using the Poisson summation formula. The system has two non-dimensional parameters, and on this parameter plane we find a propagation zone and its boundary. The boundary involves successive point masses vibrating n radians out of phase, a situation far from the continuum limit. Outside the propagation zone, waves get attenuated; however, unlike common examples of linear periodic structures, and contrary to the usual assumption made in studies thereof, here the waves show sub-exponential attenuation. In particular, the eventual decay of the wave amplitude is like the 3 / 2 power of distance {{from the point of}} excitation. We conclude with a theoretical explanation of the 3 / 2 power in the decay...|$|R

Two lesser known time series models exhibiting hyperbolic decay are introduced and their basic properties are derived. A new algorithm for approximate likelihood estimation of the models using frequency domain methods is derived and implemented in R. The issue of mean estimation and multimodality in time series, particularly in the simple case of one short memory component and one hyperbolic component is discussed.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new laboratory technique {{for measuring the}} compressional wave velocity and attenuation of jacketed samples of unconsolidated marine sediments within the acoustic (sonic) frequency range 1 – 10 kHz and at elevated differential (confining – pore) pressures up to 2. 413 MPa (350 psi). The method is particularly well suited to attenuation studies because the large sample length (up to 0. 6 m long, diameter 0. 069 m) is equivalent to about one wavelength, thus giving representative bulk values for heterogeneous samples. Placing a sediment sample in a water-filled, thick-walled, stainless steel Pulse Tube causes the spectrum of a broadband acoustic pulse to be modified into a <b>decaying</b> <b>series</b> of maxima and minima, from which the Stoneley and compressional wave, velocity and attenuation of the sample can be determined. Experiments show that PVC and copper jackets have a negligible effect on the measured values of sediment velocity and attenuation, which are accurate to better than ± 1. 5 % for velocity and up to ± 5 % for attenuation. Pulse Tube velocity and attenuation values for sand and silty-clay samples agree well with published data for similar sediments, adjusted for pressure, temperature, salinity and frequency using standard equations. Attenuation in sand decreases with pressure to small values below Q− 1 = 0. 01 (Q greater than 100) for differential pressures over 1. 5 MPa, equivalent to sub-seafloor depths of about 150 m. By contrast, attenuation in silty clay shows little pressure dependence and intermediate Q− 1 values between 0. 0206 – 0. 0235 (Q = 49 – 43). The attenuation results fill a notable gap in the grain size range of published data sets. Overall, we show that the Pulse Tube method gives reliable acoustic velocity and attenuation results for typical marine sediments...|$|R
