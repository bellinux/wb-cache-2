5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society.

Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry <b>decorated</b> with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, <b>decorated</b> pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of the {{potential}} advantages of multiple classier sys-tems is an increased robustness to noise and other imperfections in data. Previous experiments on classication noise have shown that bagging is fairly robust but that boosting is quite sensitive. <b>Decorate</b> is a recently introduced ensemble method that constructs diverse committees using arti cial data. It {{has been shown to}} generally outperform both boosting and bagging when training data is limited. This paper compares the sen-sitivity of bagging, boosting, and <b>Decorate</b> to three types of imperfect data: missing features, classication noise, and feature noise. For miss-ing data, <b>Decorate</b> is the most robust. For classication noise, bagging and <b>Decorate</b> are both robust, with bagging being slightly better than <b>Decorate,</b> while boosting is quite sensitive. For feature noise, all of the ensemble methods increase the resilience of the base classier. ...|$|R
