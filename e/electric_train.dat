50|$|In 2009, Lionel <b>Electric</b> <b>Trains</b> (Lionel, LLC) and MTH <b>Electric</b> <b>Trains</b> {{began working}} {{together}} under the Lionel Corporation banner. For three decades, MTH Trains had been making Tinplate Reproductions of trains, but {{did not have the}} authentic Lionel and American Flyer graphics on the models and boxes. In 2009, the two joined forces, allowing MTH Trains to produce the Lionel tinplate <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> with the official graphics. The interior electronics are from MTH <b>Electric</b> <b>Trains,</b> but the exterior bears the Lionel Corporation graphics.|$|R
50|$|Ives {{released}} its first <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> in 1910, partially {{in response to}} companies such as American Flyer undercutting its prices on clockwork trains. Ives initially produced <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> in O gauge and 1 gauge.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> ran on 1 October 1907, {{and from}} 29 January 1908 {{the line from}} Blankenese to Ohlsdorf was served {{exclusively}} by <b>electric</b> <b>trains.</b> These dates are considered the birthdates of the S-Bahn.|$|R
5|$|The Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line (numbered T4, {{coloured}} azure blue) is {{a commuter}} railway {{line in the}} eastern and southern suburbs of Sydney and {{is a part of}} the Sydney Trains network. The line was constructed in the 1880s to Wollongong to take advantage of agricultural and mining potentials in the Illawarra area. In March 1926 it became the first railway in New South Wales to run <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> services.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tunnel under the Narrows to Brooklyn and a connection there with the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway system, the SIRT electrified its lines using third rail power distribution and cars {{similar to those of}} the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The first <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> was operated on the South Beach Branch between South Beach and Fort Wadsworth on May 30, 1925, and the other branches were electrified by November 1925. The promise of faster and more reliable service with electrification spurred developers and private individuals to purchase land alongside the SIRT lines, with the intention of providing housing for residents that would be attracted to living on Staten Island. The electrification brought no big increase in traffic, and the tunnel was never built. In the 1920s, a branch along the West Shore of Staten Island was built to haul materials to construct the Outerbridge Crossing. The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. The Gulf Oil Corporation opened a dock and tank farm along the Arthur Kill in 1928 and in order to serve it, the Travis Branch was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{completion}} of electrification and double-tracking, <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> services only began operating in 2010. Between 1 December 2008 and 2010, trains hauled by diesel locomotives were used, running 10 trips a day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>trains</b> {{were fully}} {{introduced}} into daily services across the Auckland electrified rail network on 20 July 2015. <b>Electric</b> <b>trains</b> operate {{as far as}} Swanson on the Western Line {{and as far as}} Papakura on the Southern Line.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the new Richmond to North Woolwich service quickly settled down, but {{the then}} British Rail made a serious {{management}} error replacing the existing 3-car [...] <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> (built 1957) with slightly newer but shorter 2-car [...] <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> (built 1959), that quickly became overcrowded. In 1988, by reorganising and reducing services on the Great Northern routes from Moorgate, about 18 relatively modern [...] dual-voltage <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> {{were transferred to}} operate the North London and Watford services, from both Euston and Liverpool Street.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>trains</b> followed, {{with the}} first {{appearing}} in 1897, produced by the U.S. firm Carlisle & Finch. As residential use of electricity became {{more common in the}} early 20th century, <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> gained popularity and as time went on, these <b>electric</b> <b>trains</b> grew in sophistication, gaining lighting, the ability to change direction, to emit a whistling sound, to smoke, to remotely couple and uncouple cars and even load and unload cargo. Toy trains from {{the first half of the}} 20th century were often made of lithographed tin; later trains were often made mostly of plastic.|$|R

25|$|Diesel {{multiple}} units were serviced in another open ended shed {{next to the}} carriage cleaning tracks. This shed was subsequently used to repair the <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> {{heating and air conditioning}} on the new Mark 3 and Mark 4 coaching stock.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the line, it had been {{operated}} under the train staff and ticket system; the sections were Monmouth Troy to Wyesham Junction, Wyesham Junction to Tintern, and Tintern to Wye Valley Junction. This basic system was rather limiting, and in 1907 the Great Western Railway implemented the <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> staff system, with more sections: Troy, Wyesham Junction, Redbrook, Bigsweir, Tintern, Tidenham and Wyesham Junction were the new staff stations. In addition an <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> tablet system was installed, enabling long section working at quiet periods. Nevertheless, the system incurred significant additional signalling staff costs, and in 1927 a rationalisation scheme was introduced, in which several of the staff stations were abolished.|$|E

25|$|Restoration of the {{passenger}} service in 1941 led to provision of <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> token signalling; an intermediate instrument was provided at Brixton Road to recess goods trains there, and a two lever ground frame was provided at Yealmpton. After the second closure, the signalling reverted to one engine in steam on 11 October 1952.|$|E
25|$|In 1906–7, the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad and the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad {{electrified}} {{their tracks}} with third rail on the approaches to Grand Central Terminal. This allowed electric trains {{to enter the}} then-future Grand Central Terminal upon its completion. On September 30, 1906, the first <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> departed for the soon-to-be-demolished Grand Central Station from Highbridge, Bronx.|$|E

25|$|Tokyo, as {{the center}} of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest {{domestic}} and international hub for rail, ground, and air transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of clean and efficient trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} Plymstock and Yealmpton {{was at first}} worked as a single section by <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> staff. Plymstock was a LSWR signalbox. Brixton Road later had a signal box, from 1905, {{breaking}} the branch into two sections, but it was closed in 1924 or 1925. When the passenger service was withdrawn in 1930, the signalling was converted to one engine in steam and Yealmpton box was abolished.|$|E

25|$|Hornby was {{at first}} a tradename for the railway {{productions}} of Meccano Ltd and based in Liverpool, which released its first train, a clockwork 0 gauge (1:48) model, in 1920. An <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> soon followed but was under-designed and the few that were made were sold out in France. In 1925, a much more successful electric model was introduced, operating on the high voltage of 110 volts AC power.|$|E
25|$|After {{inspection}} by the Board of Trade, {{the line}} was approved as fit for traffic on 3 April 1903. The last steam trains ran on Saturday 2 May, and the current to the electrified rails switched on at 3:30 am. At 4:53 am the first <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> arrived at Liverpool Central and for the Sunday morning trains ran at 3-minute intervals without passengers. Passengers were admitted when the advertised Sunday service started at noon.|$|E
25|$|The 'Elevated Electric' {{proved to}} be a {{technical}} and financial success, but was short-lived since the LSWR had adopted the third-rail system: its mileage far exceeded that of the LB In 1926 the Southern Railway announced that, as part of a huge electrification project, all overhead lines were to be converted to third rail, thus bringing all lines into a common system. The last overhead <b>electric</b> <b>train</b> ran on 22 September 1929.|$|E
