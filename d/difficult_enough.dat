5|$|The outdoor {{scenes were}} filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather {{conditions}} making shooting <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to require {{an extra day}} of work. The episode's production took place just a week before David Duchovny's wedding, with his fiancée Téa Leoni visiting the set during filming. The first cut of the episode was twelve minutes too long, resulting {{in some of the}} scenes in the mountains being removed. Series creator Chris Carter re-edited the entire episode two days before it aired.|$|E
25|$|After {{the second}} rest day, the Giro {{returned}} with a rolling stage that entered Austria. The stage began with the second-category Passo di Campolongo and a long descent from it, but the remaining terrain was not <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> for any riders to open up significant time gaps. Pre-race analysis thus {{found it to be}} an ideal stage for a winning breakaway.|$|E
25|$|Kanhai {{was out on}} {{the third}} day when the score had reached 124, having made 84. The {{remaining}} wickets added only another 57, though Nurse - the sheet anchor - battled away until he was ninth out for 70. His innings included only a single boundary, in sharp contrast to Kanhai's 13, and lasted for 305 minutes. Davidson finished with the fine figures of 6/53. Some rain had seeped through the covers overnight, but the pitch was not <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to justify the West Indian collapse.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for around 14% of GDP and employs 40-45% of the Moroccan working population. With a semi-arid climate and an ill-developed irrigation system, it is <b>difficult</b> to assure <b>enough</b> irrigation.|$|R
50|$|Chakrarahu is {{considered}} the steepest and the most difficult-to-climb six-thousander in the Andes. Although by no means worked out, the south face of the mountain has a quite staggering number of steep and <b>difficult</b> lines, <b>enough</b> to bear comparison with {{areas such as the}} south face of Mont Blanc du Tacul for maturity. The north side bore the brunt maturity of early development but still retains the greatest potential.|$|R
50|$|In the {{unsettled}} national climate {{after the}} September 11 attacks, Taos Talking Pictures found it {{more and more}} <b>difficult</b> to raise <b>enough</b> funding to continue its work. It folded The Taos Talking Picture Festival in 2003.|$|R
25|$|The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G) had {{main lines}} to Ayr and Carlisle; {{but the first}} section of the Ayr line was over the Glasgow and Paisley joint line: the line was {{operated}} by a Joint Committee, answerable to both the G and its rival, the Caledonian Railway. This lack of sovereignty was <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> in the railway politics of the time; but as traffic developed, congestion on the busy line became a serious issue. At that time goods traffic was heavy and slow, and line capacity and reliability were heavily compromised.|$|E
500|$|The peloton faced four {{categorized}} {{climbs in}} this stage, though none were considered <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be truly}} selective. Also on the profile were three uncategorized hills that simply were not as steep. With a [...] flat section {{at the end of}} the stage, a breakaway finish was likely.|$|E
500|$|The Passo del Turchino, {{famous for}} its use {{every year in the}} classic one-day race Milan–San Remo, was visited [...] from the end of this stage. The climb is not <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to be at all selective, so pre-stage {{analysis}} led to expectations that either a mass sprint would occur or a breakaway of riders deep down in the GC would finish first on this stage.|$|E
50|$|The Sikh defeat had {{resulted}} from several causes. Their {{administration of the}} population of the Punjab had been poor, which meant that their large armies found it <b>difficult</b> to find <b>enough</b> food. Finally, the East India Company had brought overwhelming force against them.|$|R
50|$|In a seconds match, Sunshine scored 57.42 (384) {{against a}} {{struggling}} Brighton team which was finding it increasingly <b>difficult</b> to find <b>enough</b> players {{to fill a}} seconds team. It set a new record for the highest score across all grades of the Association.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims to: 1. Knowing {{the ability}} of DMR in analysis of difficulty level, discrimination power, and distractor functions of the National Exam Questions, 2. Knowing the assurance level of the difficulty analysis results of National Exam Questions by DMR compared to manual calculation, 3. Knowing analysis results of difficulty level, discrimination power, and distractor functions of the National Exam Questions and improvements to be made. Type {{of this research is}} qualitative research with the development of conceptual models. Analysis of the data used in this research is content analysis. Procedure development starting from product development, product testing and products assessment. Data was collected by questionnaire {{in the form of the}} National Exam Questions. The results of this research are: 1. Difficulty level analysis of Indonesian Questions in the enough or moderate category, English in the too <b>difficult</b> and <b>enough</b> or moderate category, Science in the too <b>difficult</b> and <b>enough</b> or moderate category, Mathematics in the category of too <b>difficult</b> and <b>enough</b> or moderate. 2) Difficulty level of National Exam Questions being analyzed with DMR or manually, showed no significant difference at all the National Exam Questions being tested. That is the difficulty analysis of questions, the teacher can perform difficulty analysis of questions using DMR. 3) Follow up difficulty level analysis result of of National Exam Questions that can be done for an easy category is by removing the item and are not issued anymore, while the difficult category, questions items subject to reexamination, tracked, and traced so it can be known a factor that causes the items in question difficult to answer by students, whether the questions sentence is less clear, whether instructions on how to do the questions is difficult to understand, or whether the question is there are terms that are not clear, and after repair, the items are removed again in the the next achievement test...|$|R
500|$|Adjusting to {{post-injury}} {{changes in}} the body's sensation is <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to cause some {{to give up on}} the idea of satisfying sex at first. But changes in sensitivity above and at the level of injury occur over time; people may find erogenous zones like the nipples or ears have become more sensitive, enough to be sexually satisfying. They may discover new erogenous zones that were not erotic before the injury; care providers can help direct this discovery. These erogenous areas can even lead to orgasm when stimulated. Such changes may result from [...] "remapping" [...] of sensory areas in the brain due to neuroplasticity, particularly when sensation in the genitals is completely lost.|$|E
500|$|Mont Aiguille is a mesa eroded {{from the}} Vercors Plateau in the {{drainage}} basin of the Rhône. It {{is surrounded by}} steep cliffs and has a height of [...] and a clean prominence of [...] [...] The surrounding terrain is <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant a technical climb as the easiest method of ascent. The mountain is capped with meadows botanically similar to those on the Vercors High Plateau, but beneath the cliffs there are extensive forests. The mountain lies within the Vercors Regional Natural Park {{and is in the}} département of Isère. The nearest access by rail is in the village of Saint-Martin-de-Clelles and by road is from the north via the Col de La Bâtie.|$|E
500|$|The season finale, [...] "Gethsemane", was notable in that {{an entire}} set created to {{emulated}} icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which {{had previously been}} used for cold storage; and required the use of truckloads of lumber and [...] of Styrofoam. The set {{would become one of}} the most expensive and elaborate built during the series' history. The set required a constant temperature of [...] in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors' breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to [...] "have a place that feels real" [...] to aid their acting. The outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather conditions making shooting <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to require an extra day of work.|$|E
50|$|The Congress {{had little}} power {{and without the}} {{external}} threat of a war against the British, it became more <b>difficult</b> to get <b>enough</b> delegates to meet to form a quorum. Nonetheless the Congress still managed to pass important laws, most notably the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.|$|R
50|$|However, the band's singles {{failed to}} make the charts, making it <b>difficult</b> to earn <b>enough</b> money to support a family. In 1966 Dalton left Mark Four to join the {{building}} trade. Shortly afterwards Phillips, Jones and Pickett founded The Creation, {{one of the most influential}} bands of the late 1960s.|$|R
60|$|And Captain Fidanza meditated. The {{presence}} of strangers {{on the island}} would cut him completely off the treasure. It had been <b>difficult</b> and dangerous <b>enough</b> before. He was afraid, and he was angry. He thought with the resolution of a master and the cunning of a cowed slave. Then he went ashore.|$|R
500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, well thought out and best of all, <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> that you may not get it on your first attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|The weapon {{fire on the}} set was {{considered}} dangerous, which led the crew {{to build a new}} bulletproof plexiglas shield that could be bolted to the camera. This shield was useful particularly for one sequence in Hard Target where Van Damme empties a magazine of ammo into the camera. These camera dollies were nicknamed by the crew as [...] "the Woo-Woo Choo-Choo". Russell Carpenter found difficulty in filming the huge gunfight scenes. Carpenter specifically noted the Mardi Gras parade warehouse by recollecting that [...] "just the lighting for a space like that, with all those strange shapes and shadows was <b>difficult</b> <b>enough,</b> but John then added the further complication of wanting the scene shot from several angles at once—often with more than one of the cameras moving". Producer James Jacks supported this style of filming finding it the most economical way to shoot these types of action scenes.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{date was}} chosen by General Kenney based {{on the advice of}} his two weather-forecasting teams, one Australian and one American. Ideally, Z-Day would be clear from Port Moresby to Nadzab but foggy over New Britain, thereby {{preventing}} the Japanese air forces at Rabaul from intervening. Forecasting the weather days in advance with such precision was <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> in peacetime, but more so in wartime, when many of the areas from which the weather patterns developed were occupied by the enemy and data from them was consequently denied to the forecasters. When the two teams differed over the best possible date, Kenney [...] "split {{the difference between the two}} forecasts and told General MacArthur we would be ready to go on the morning of the 4th for the amphibious movement of the 9th Division to Hopoi Beach and about nine o’clock on the morning of the 5th we would be ready to fly the 503rd Parachute Regiment to Nadzab." ...|$|E
50|$|Internet Diplomacy {{is popular}} for many reasons, {{including}} avoiding the hassles {{of playing the}} game face-to-face, {{and the lack of}} availability of local players. Also, a face-to-face game needs up to seven players and can last several hours, which makes it <b>difficult</b> to find <b>enough</b> players with enough free time for a game.|$|R

500|$|Teller {{became part}} of the Theoretical (T) Division. He was given a secret {{identity}} of Ed Tilden. He was irked at being passed over as its head; the job was instead given to Hans Bethe. Oppenheimer had him investigate unusual approaches to building fission weapons, such as autocatalysis, in which the efficiency of the bomb would increase as the nuclear chain reaction progressed, but proved to be impractical. He also investigated using uranium hydride instead of uranium metal, but its efficiency turned out to be [...] "negligible or less". He continued to push his ideas for a fusion weapon even though it had been put on a low priority during the war (as the creation of a fission weapon proved to be <b>difficult</b> <b>enough).</b> On a visit to New York, he asked Maria Goeppert-Mayer to carry out calculations on the Super for him. She confirmed Teller's own results: the Super was not going to work.|$|E
500|$|Professor Jim Whitehead listed Defender as {{the first}} {{horizontally}} scrolling shooting game, and describes it as a breakthrough title for its use of full 2D motion, multiple goals, and complex gameplay that provides players with several methods to play. James Hague of Dadgum Games called Defender a landmark title from the 1980s. Stearny said that the game's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen. Cuciz stated that Defenders use of scrolling introduce the [...] "first true 'gaming environment'". He further said that though the game's minimap feature had been introduced before, Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner. Stearny described it {{as the most important}} space game in the early 1980s. He commented that its realism and technological advances pushed developers to create more popular games, citing Gorf and Phoenix as examples. Vince listed the game as a classic title that introduced new technology, specifically scrolling. Ellis stated that prior to Defender, companies designed video games to have a balanced challenge. They believed games should be easy enough to attract players, but <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to limit play time to a few minutes; anything too challenging would dissuade players. Loguidice and Barton commented that Defenders success, along with , illustrated that video game enthusiasts were ready for more difficult games, which spurred developers to create more complex game designs.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{stage was}} the most {{significant}} uphill finish of the race so far, finishing on the climb of the Alto de Capileira. It was won by Bert-Jan Lindeman (...) from the breakaway. Most of the general classification favourites finished together, though Fabio Aru gained seven seconds in the final kilometre and Chris Froome lost nearly half a minute. The following stage was a moderately difficult stage: it was too difficult for the pure sprinters to reach the finish line with the main group of riders, but not <b>difficult</b> <b>enough</b> to create gaps between those riding for the overall victory. The most notable event was a large crash [...] from the finish. Four riders were immediately forced {{to withdraw from the}} race with injuries, including Dan Martin, {{who had been in the}} top ten. The stage was won in a reduced bunch sprint by Jasper Stuyven (...) , who had been among the riders injured in the earlier crash. He was forced to withdraw from the race after the stage with a broken scaphoid. Stage 9 ended with a difficult climb. There was a series of attacks on the early part of the mountain, with many riders dropped from the lead group. Tom Dumoulin eventually took a solo win in the stage, two seconds ahead of Chris Froome, and took back the red jersey as Chaves lost significant time. Froome had originally been dropped, but rode at a steady tempo and came close to the stage victory. Stage 10, the final stage before the first rest day, ended in another bunch sprint, which was won by Kristian Sbaragli (...) [...]|$|E
