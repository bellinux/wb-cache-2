50|$|Grass tetany or hypomagnesemic tetany, {{also known}} as <b>grass</b> <b>staggers</b> and winter tetany, is a {{metabolic}} disease involving magnesium deficiency, which can occur in such ruminant livestock as beef cattle, dairy cattle and sheep, usually after grazing on pastures of rapidly growing grass, especially in early spring.|$|E
40|$|Well-known plant poisonings such as 'dunsiekte' (seneciosis) and 'jaagsiekte' (crotalariosis) {{of horses}} in {{southern}} Africa are briefly reviewed. Relatively unfamiliar mycotoxicoses such as stachybotryotoxicosis and perennial rye <b>grass</b> <b>staggers</b> and potentially occurring exotic intoxications such as equine nigropallidal encephalomalacia and ergot alkaloid poisoning are also discussed. This article {{is aimed at}} informing the southern African equine practitioner about probable poisonings that might occur locally in horses...|$|E
40|$|Grass tetany is a {{nutritional}} or metabolic disorder in cattle characterized by low blood magnesium, {{yet it is}} not just a simple magnesium deficiency. It is also called <b>grass</b> <b>staggers,</b> wheat pasture poisoning and hypomagnesemia. It primarily affects older cows nursing calves under 8 weeks of age, but may also occur in young or dry cows and growing calves. It happens most frequently when cattle are grazing lush, immature grass, but occasionally occurs when cattle are fed dry forages (winter tetany) ...|$|E

It may also be native to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{down his}} hat-brim against the {{increasing}} rain, {{he let the}} horses go. He need not try to hold them; the storm would stop them soon. It broke upon him with a scream and a shower of sand and withered <b>grass.</b> He <b>staggered</b> {{as if he had}} got a blow, and then leaned forward to resist the pressure. The horses swerved, and he had trouble to keep them on the trail, but their speed slackened and they fell into a labored trot. For a few minutes they struggled against the gale, and then the roar Festing had heard behind the scream drowned the rumbling thunder. He threw up his arm to guard his face as the terrible hail of the plains drove down the blast.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the risk}} profile of two {{pastoral}} production systems in New Zealand are examined. All farmers must manage and mitigate {{a multitude of}} risks. Traditionally, a farm budget is solely undertaken to satisfy a lending institution. Limited variance analysis takes place, usually for output prices and inputs such as: interest rates, energy costs, and fertiliser. The authors of this paper use “@Risk”, a risk profiling plug-in tool for Microsoft Excel to demonstrate how farm budgets can be more relevant to farmers. Many risk factors that affect farm financial performance, such as climate and commodity prices, are not controlled by the farmer. Wet summers help hill country sheep and beef pastoral farmers, as more grass growth occurs, which thereby reduces the cost of production and increases revenue, as more stock is finished. Whereas in drought years income falls as stock must be sold prior to finishing, in severe droughts capital stock may also be sold. Input costs also rise as pasture weed invasion occurs; health issues such as rye <b>grass</b> <b>staggers</b> may also add cost. Monte Carlo simulations on model farm budgets for a North Island sheep and beef property and a Canterbury dairy farm help demonstrate the risk profile of each farm type. fals...|$|E
