6000|$|For {{the first}} time Shelton {{conceived}} respect for them; he made a comprehensive gesture, and edged himself into the conversation of another group, for fear of having all his prejudices overturned. Here an Irish sculptor, standing in a curve, was saying furiously, [...] "Bees are not bhumpkins, d---n their sowls!" [...] A Scotch painter, who listened with a curly smile, seemed trying to compromise this proposition, which appeared to have relation to the middle classes; and though agreeing with the Irishman, Shelton felt nervous over his <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> Next to them two American ladies, assembled under the tent of hair belonging to a writer of songs, were discussing the emotions aroused in them by Wagner's operas.|$|E

I hardly dare venture, even in {{the most}} {{hypothetical}} form, to ask whether the Aurora Borealis and Australia may not be the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> thus urged towards the poles of the earth, from whence it is endeavouring to return by natural and appointed means above the earth to the equatorial regions. The non-occurrence of it in very high latitudes is not at all against the supposition; and it is remarkable that Mr. Fox, who observed the deflections of the magnetic needle at Falmouth, by the Aurora Borealis, gives that direction of it which perfectly agrees with the present view. He states that all the variations at night were towards the east[A], and this is what would happen if electric currents were setting from south to north in the earth under the needle, or from north to south in space above it.|$|E

6000|$|... 1455. The {{following}} {{are a few}} of the effects I observed in different gasses at the positively charged surfaces, and with atmospheres varying in their pressure. The general effect of rarefaction was the same for all the gases: at first, sparks passed; these gradually were converted into brushes, which became larger and more distinct in their ramifications, until, upon further rarefaction, the latter began to collapse and draw in upon each other, till they formed a stream across from conductor to conductor: then a few lateral streams shot out towards the glass of the vessel from the conductors; these became thick and soft in appearance, and were succeeded by the full constant glow which covered the discharging wire. The phenomena varied with the size of the vessel (1477.), the degree of rarefaction, and the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from the machine. When the latter was in successive sparks, they were most beautiful, the effect of a spark from a small machine being equal to, and often surpassing, that produced by the constant discharge of a far more powerful one.|$|E
6000|$|... 853. Now it is {{wonderful}} to observe how small {{a quantity of}} a compound body is decomposed by a certain portion of electricity. Let us, for instance, consider this {{and a few other}} points in relation to water. One grain of water, acidulated to facilitate conduction, will require an electric current to be continued for three minutes and three quarters of time to effect its decomposition, which current must be powerful enough to retain a platina wire 1/104 of an inch in thickness[A], red-hot, in the air during the whole time; and if interrupted anywhere by charcoal points, will produce a very brilliant and constant star of light. If attention be paid to the instantaneous <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> of tension, as illustrated in the beautiful experiments of Mr. Wheatstone[B], and to what I have said elsewhere on the relation of common and voltaic electricity (371. 375.), it will not be too much to say that this necessary quantity of electricity is equal to a very powerful flash of lightning. Yet we have it under perfect command; can evolve, direct, and employ it at pleasure; and when it has performed its full work of electrolyzation, it has only separated the elements of a single grain of water.|$|E
6000|$|... 1544. I {{will now}} notice a very {{remarkable}} circumstance in the luminous discharge accompanied by negative glow, which may, perhaps, be correctly traced hereafter into discharges of much higher intensity. Two brass rods, 0.3 {{of an inch}} in diameter, entering a glass globe on opposite sides, had their ends brought into contact, and the air about them very much rarefied. A <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from the machine was then made through them, and whilst that was continued the ends were separated from each other. At the moment of separation a continuous glow came over {{the end of the}} negative rod, the positive termination remaining quite dark. As the distance was increased, a purple stream or haze appeared {{on the end of the}} positive rod, and proceeded directly outwards towards the negative rod; elongating as the interval was enlarged, but never joining the negative glow, there being always a short dark space between. This space, of about 1/16th or 1/20th of an inch, was apparently invariable in its extent and its position, relative to the negative rod; nor did the negative glow vary. Whether the negative end were inductric or inducteous, the same effect was produced. It was strange to see the positive purple haze diminish or lengthen as the ends were separated, and yet this dark space and the negative glow remain unaltered (fig. 133).|$|E

That {{ordinary}} {{electricity is}} discharged by points with facility through air; {{that it is}} readily transmitted through highly rarefied air; and also through heated air, as for instance a flame; is due to its high tension.

Still no difficulty can arise in recognising it to be the same spark as that from the voltaic battery, especially under certain circumstances.

50|$|Two {{forms of}} lead styphnate are six-sided {{monohydrate}} crystals and small rectangular crystals. Lead styphnate is particularly sensitive to {{fire and the}} <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> static <b>electricity.</b> When dry, it can readily detonate by static discharges from the human body.

Lead styphnate does not react with metals and is less sensitive to shock and friction than mercury fulminate or lead azide. It is stable in storage, even at elevated temperatures. As with other lead-containing compounds, lead styphnate is toxic owing to heavy metal poisoning.|$|R
50|$|Strutt {{was born}} at Terling Place, the family home near Witham, Essex, the eldest son of John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh and his wife Evelyn Georgiana Mary (née Balfour).
