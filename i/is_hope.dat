5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray the idea that there <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E

25|$|One {{example of}} this is necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of premature infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of sepsis, and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment.

There <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> that a similar technique {{could be used as a}} quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.|$|E
25|$|Critics of MINUSTAH's goal of {{providing}} security {{say that the}} provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the joblessness and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton as the UN Special Envoy, there <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> that the international donor community will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, {{there are signs of}} a desire for political independence that the international community would rather ignore.|$|E

Two weeks after {{escaping}} Heavenly Host, Ayumi and Naomi go to investigate the Shinozaki estate, Sachiko's birthplace, believing there <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> in reviving their dead friends since Naho and Kou Kibiki's existences were not erased like the other victims.

Ayumi and Naomi perform a resurrection spell for Mayu, but fail.

500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent; their reunion was going well; and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that there <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor Elizabeth Smart has {{stressed the importance of}} focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: [...] "Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color." [...] He opined that she was brainwashed, would feel angry and now needs to move on with her life.|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to <b>is</b> <b>hope.</b> And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E
