25|$|This rescued work {{contains}} a great wealth of material, {{in which one}} follows {{in the footsteps of}} a master historian. Yet, perhaps because of its nature as reconstructed student lecture notes, it more often lacks the <b>fine</b> <b>points</b> of literary composition and style, and of course the narrative drive of the original three volumes. Nonetheless it is well to remember that the students involved here in taking the lecture notes were themselves quite accomplished people, and one listener and recorder was already a mature father.|$|E

500|$|John <b>Fine</b> <b>points</b> to the clemency {{shown by}} Thrasybulus and other {{democrats in the}} wake of their victory over the Thirty as a key {{contribution}} towards reestablishing stable government in Athens. [...] While many city-states throughout the Greek world broke down into vicious cycles of civil war and reprisal, Athens remained united and democratic, without interruption, until {{near the end of the}} 3rd century BC, and democracy, albeit interrupted several times by conquest or revolution, continued there until Roman times, several centuries later.|$|E
500|$|All Sebrights have plumage that is laced {{around the}} edges evenly with black, on a base of either dark gold or whitish silver. Sebrights have unfeathered legs with slateblue skin, and their beaks are ideally a dark horn color. Sebright roosters carry a rose comb covered with <b>fine</b> <b>points,</b> and a small spike that sweeps back from the head (called a leader). Combs, earlobes and wattles were {{originally}} a purple colour {{referred to in the}} fancy as mulberry, but today are often bright red though mulberry is still desired according to the standards in most countries. [...] Some breeders consider hen feathering to have an adverse effect on the fertility of male Sebrights, and may use roosters that don't carry the trait for breeding purposes, despite their automatic disqualification in shows.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe find time to get involved in a story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and <b>fine</b> <b>points</b> of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E

500|$|Animation was an {{essential}} and integral component of films produced at Fort Roach. Animation provided FMPU filmmakers with scenarios not possible with live action photography due to technical or secrecy constraints. In an introductory training film, pilots {{learn how to}} fly airplanes {{with the help of}} colorful cartoon characters named Thrust, Gravity and Drag, representative of the forces which act on airframes. Another character, Mr. Chameleon was created to teach the <b>fine</b> <b>points</b> of military camouflage. [...] "Trigger Joe"'s appearance in Position Firing was an immediate hit amongst gunners. Animators used humor to illustrate common pitfalls when loading and firing and techniques to maximize their efficiency and accuracy. Gunnery personnel clamored for more: [...] "We want more films like Position Firing that make the theory simple and clear and yet keep us interested. And Trigger Joe! He's great!" [...] Joe became the central character in an entire series of films developed to further gunnery training. The animation department was staffed with a stellar assortment of animators, including department head Rudolf Ising, one of the creators of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, and one of Disney's Nine Old Men, Frank Thomas.|$|E

IGN also called the game incomparable and peerless. GameSpot later called the game [...] "a towering achievement in the history of role-playing games." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer felt though the game was worthy being called the best game of the year and as good as games such as Fallout, , and Betrayal at Krondor, [...] "I won't trap myself with the 'best RPG ever' phrase." [...] He also felt the game's story was somewhere between Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale in terms of depth. Eurogamer lavished much praise upon the game, and noted that [...] "the story and quests are captivating, the gameplay tried and tested, and the overall feel is professional and entertaining." [...] In a 2007 Gamasutra article on the [...] "Platinum and Modern Ages" [...] of computer role-playing games (CRPGs), Matt Barton noted contemporary reviewers' universal praise for the game, and said, [...] "I consider it the finest CRPG ever designed."

2500|$|Asquith's legal {{practice}} was flourishing, {{and took up}} much of his time. In the late 1880s Anthony Hope, who later gave up the bar to become a novelist, was his pupil. Asquith disliked arguing {{in front of a}} jury because of the repetitiveness and [...] "platitudes" [...] required, but excelled at arguing <b>fine</b> <b>points</b> of civil law before a judge or in front of courts of appeal.

2500|$|In February 1911, Lathers {{returned}} to the Tigers for spring training. Press accounts suggested that, if the injured legs of Delahanty and Bush had healed, there was [...] "no chance" [...] of Lathers taking their starting spots. However, one newspaper opined that Lathers [...] "is a much better batter than O'Leary and if he could learn some of the <b>fine</b> <b>points</b> of the game while South, would have the call" [...] at second base. [...] As the spring progressed, Detroit manager Hughie Jennings tried moving Lathers to first base to find a spot {{for him in the}} starting lineup. The press reported that Jennings planned to have both a right and left hand batting first baseman, with Del Gainer or Ness getting the start when a left-hander was pitching and Lathers getting the start against right-handers. [...] In the end, Jennings moved Delahanty to first base in 1911, and Lathers saw even less playing time than he had in his rookie season. He played in only 29 games and compiled a batting average of [...]222 and an on-base percentage of [...]314 in 53 plate appearances.|$|E
