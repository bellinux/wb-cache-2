After coming in third in Delaware Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the South Carolina primary, Bush soundly {{defeated}} McCain. Some McCain supporters {{blamed it on}} the Bush campaign, accusing them of mudslinging and dirty tricks, such as push polling that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock. While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, he won both Michigan and {{his home state of}} Arizona on February 22. The primary election that year also affected the South Carolina State House, when a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted the state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a Civil War memorial on the capitol grounds.

5000|$|On November 3, 1998, the {{citizens}} of Alaska voted on ballot Measure 2, introduced by language that indicated the measure [...] "would amend the Declaration of Rights section of the Alaska Constitution to limit marriage." [...] The majority of the funding {{in support of the}} amendment, $500,000, came from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah, with another $25,000 contributed by <b>Gary</b> <b>Bauer's</b> organization, Campaign for Working Families, in Washington, D.C. The constitutional amendment determined that a valid marriage could exist only between one man and one woman." [...] The statement of support was written by Senator Loren Leman, the primary sponsor of Resolution 42, and indicated that the [...] "debate is about who should define marriage: the people, or a handful of non-elected judges." [...] In the statement of opposition, the League of Women Voters of Alaska argued that voters should vote [...] "no" [...] to eliminate limits on citizens' individual liberties and rights and to preserve the checks and balances of the three branches of government of Alaska. The results of the referendum revealed that with 68% of the votes, Measure 2 had been approved. After the passing of the amendment, Article I, section 25 of the Alaska Constitution was amended to read as follows:Marriage. To be valid or recognized in this State, a marriage may exist only between one man and one woman.Subsequently, in light of the amendment, the Alaska Superior Court dismissed the Brause lawsuit and rendered the previous rulings moot.|$|R
5000|$|President Reagan issued [...] {{creating}} the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic on June 24, 1987. On June 26, he appointed Dr. W. Eugene Mayberry, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, to chair the commission. Jeff Levi, {{executive director of}} the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force objected to the appointment of someone with no experience with the disease, but others praised Mayberry's experience in both medical research and clinical services. Administration officials said it would resist pressure from gay rights activists to include a representative of the gay community on the commission. <b>Gary</b> L. <b>Bauer,</b> the assistant to the President for policy development who would soon become head of the Family Research Council, said: [...] "I would be very surprised if an administration opposed to making appointments {{on the basis of race}} or sex would agree to make an appointment based on bedroom habits".

2500|$|With {{momentum}} {{building for}} Romney, Santorum interrupted campaigning (as did Romney) for the Easter holiday {{to give his}} campaign staff {{a chance to be}} with their families. He used the opportunity to meet with [...] "movement conservatives" [...] to strategize. Former Family Research Council chief <b>Gary</b> <b>Bauer,</b> who was present at the sit-down with Santorum, called it a strategy meeting. Four days later, on April 10, 2012, Rick Santorum suspended his campaign without endorsing any other candidate. He was at this point running out of money, having more campaign debt than cash on hand. Santorum won eleven contests (six states that allocated delegates and five non-binding caucus states) and forty-two delegate allocating congressional districts. More than 3.2 million people voted for him and he secured a total of 202 delegates before suspending his campaign. He can show a plurality in six states and that secures him the opportunity of a place on the first ballot nominating the Republican candidate for president at the National Convention.|$|E
2500|$|Kramer {{directly}} and deliberately defines AIDS as a holocaust {{because he believes}} the United States' government failed to respond quickly and expend the necessary resources to cure AIDS, largely because AIDS initially infected gay men, and, quite soon after, predominantly poor and politically powerless minorities. [...] Through speeches, editorials, and personal, sometimes publicized, letters to figures such as politician <b>Gary</b> <b>Bauer,</b> former New York Mayor Ed Koch, several New York Times reporters, {{and head of the}} National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, Kramer personally advocates for a more significant response to AIDS. [...] He implores the government to conduct research based on commonly accepted scientific standards and to allocate funds and personnel to AIDS research. [...] Kramer ultimately states that the response to AIDS in America must be defined as a holocaust because of the large number deaths that resulted from the negligence and apathy that surrounded AIDS in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and early Bill Clinton presidencies.|$|E
2500|$|George W. Bush {{became the}} early front-runner, {{acquiring}} unprecedented funding {{and a broad}} base of leadership support based on his governorship of Texas and the name recognition and connections of the Bush family. Former cabinet member George Shultz played an important early role in securing establishment Republican support for Bush. In April 1998, he invited Bush to discuss policy issues with experts including Michael Boskin, John Taylor, and Condoleezza Rice. The group, which was [...] "looking for a candidate for 2000 with good political instincts, someone they could work with", was impressed, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the race. Several aspirants withdrew before the Iowa Caucus because {{they were unable to}} secure funding and endorsements sufficient to remain competitive with Bush. These included Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander, and Bob Smith. Pat Buchanan dropped out to run for the Reform Party nomination. That left Bush, John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, <b>Gary</b> <b>Bauer,</b> and Orrin Hatch as the only candidates still in the race.|$|E

Instead, he volunteered for the Bauer campaign {{with the intent to}} infect the candidate with his flu. He wrote that he licked doorknobs and other objects in the campaign office, and handed Bauer a saliva-coated pen, hoping to pass the virus on to Bauer and his supporters. (Later he said much of his article had been fictitious). He also registered and participated in the caucus, which was illegal, as Savage was not an Iowa resident. He was charged and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent voting in a caucus, and was sentenced to a year's probation, 50 hours of community service, and a $750 fine.|$|E
