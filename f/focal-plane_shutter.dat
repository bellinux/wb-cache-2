5|$|In a {{panoramic}} camera, the <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E
25|$|Focusing can be manual, by {{twisting}} {{the focus on}} the lens; or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on the shutter release or a dedicated AF button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards {{in the direction of the}} arrow, the <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> (3) opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor (4), after which actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built in drive mechanism re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "double camera" [...] {{described}} in the patent had two lenses pointing in opposite directions (forward/backward), each with a focal length of 40mm. Operated by a single <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter,</b> the camera could take two simultaneous glass plate exposures at a time determined by the pneumatic system.|$|E
50|$|Shutter speeds are not {{a factor}} in the {{calculation}} of guide numbers. For most modern cameras (those with <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters),</b> shutter speed has no effect on flash exposures. See Shutter (photography) for more.|$|R
50|$|<b>Focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> {{are mounted}} near the focal plane {{and move to}} uncover the film or sensor.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable-lens {{rangefinder}} cameras with <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> {{are greatly}} outnumbered by fixed-lens leaf-shutter rangefinder cameras. The most popular {{design in the}} '50s were folding designs like the Kodak Retina and the Zeiss Contessa.|$|R
2500|$|After {{one more}} {{unsuccessful}} camera (Zenit-16) which {{was produced in}} very small quantities, in 1979 production of the Zenit-19 began. This was a camera with an original electromagnet-driven <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter,</b> M42 lens mount, and shutter speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000. [...] X-sync at 1/60 or 1/125 (camera was modified during production). The camera has only manual shooting mode (with a TTL-meter and a needle indicator of the proper exposition in the viewfinder). The Zenit-19 was, perhaps, the top-of-the-line Soviet M42 lens mount camera.|$|E
50|$|When using a <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> with a flash, if {{the shutter}} {{is set at}} its X-sync speed or slower the whole frame will be exposed when the flash fires (otherwise only a band of the film will be exposed).Some {{electronic}} flashes can produce a longer pulse compatible with a <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> operated at much higher shutter speeds. The <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> will still impart <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> distortions to a rapidly moving subject.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> is that their fastest speeds are quite high: 1/4000 second or even 1/8000 second; {{much higher than the}} 1/500 second of the typical leaf shutter. (See The Square-type metal-bladed <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> and The quest for higher speed, below.) ...|$|E
50|$|Because of {{mechanical}} considerations, the coupling of shutter and aperture {{was limited to}} lenses with leaf shutters; however, various automatic exposure modes now work to somewhat the same effect in cameras with <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The need to {{accommodate}} the shutter mechanism within the lens barrel limited the design of wide-angle lenses {{and it was not}} until the widespread use of <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> that extreme wide-angle lenses were developed.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> is that the shutter can be built into the body of a camera which accepts interchangeable lenses, eliminating the need for each lens to have a central shutter built into it.|$|R
50|$|These {{cameras were}} {{somewhat}} exceptional since {{they used a}} rotary <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter,</b> rather than the two-curtain <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> commonly used in other SLRs. Since this one-piece shutter opens fully before it starts to close, it can synchronize to electronic flash at all shutter speeds.|$|E

50|$|Many {{photographic}} devices use {{a form of}} strip photography due {{to the use of}} {{a rolling}} shutter for engineering reasons, and exhibit similar effects. This is common both on cheaper cameras with an electronic shutter (more sophisticated electronic shutters are global, not rolling), as well as cameras with mechanical <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> {{may also}} produce image {{distortion}} of very fast moving objects or when panned rapidly, {{as described in}} the Rolling shutter article. A large relative difference between a slow wipe speed and a narrow curtain slit results in cartoonish distortion, because one side of the frame is exposed at a noticeably later instant than the other and the object's interim movement is imaged.|$|R
50|$|Models with leaf {{shutters}} {{within the}} lens, rather than <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> installed inside the camera body, can synchronize with flash at higher speeds than can SLRs. Flashes on SLRs usually cannot synchronize accurately when the shutter speed is faster than 1/60th {{of a second}} and occasionally 1/125th. Some higher quality DSLRs can synchronize at up to 1/500th of a second. Leaf shutters allow for flash synchronization at all shutter speeds.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{these older}} <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> wiped the {{exposure}} fairly slowly, {{even under the}} highest available spring tension, because the delicate curtain was too fragile to survive the necessary accelerative shocks to move faster. The large relative difference between a slow downward wipe speed and a narrow curtain slit resulted in cartoonish distortion of very fast moving objects instead of truly freezing their motion.(See Section 4: [...] "Disadvantages," [...] above.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1953: Zeiss Ikon Contaflex I (West Germany): first leaf shutter 35 mm SLR. Had Synchro-Compur leaf shutter {{and front}} cell {{focusing}} 45mm f/2.8 Tessar lens, built-in selenium-coupled exposure meter. For many years, reliable <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> were very expensive and SLRs equipped with Compur or Prontor leaf shutters were strong competitors. As FP shutters improved, their faster available speeds won {{out in the}} late 1960s and leaf shutter 35 mm SLRs disappeared around 1976.|$|R
50|$|Konica's {{single lens reflex}} cameras pioneered auto-exposure in cameras with <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> {{and fully}} {{interchangeable}} lenses. The Konica Autoreflex of 1965 used an external light meter cell to set the lens diaphragm automatically after the user selected a shutter speed. With the Autoreflex T of 1968, Konica improved this design into a through-the-lens meter, using the same automation system. (The user could also set the exposure manually on these cameras). Other camera makers eventually adopted auto-exposure as well, but Konica was the first.|$|R

5000|$|The main {{advantages}} {{of central and}} behind-the-lens leaf shutters compared to a <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> are: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> {{are also}} {{difficult}} to synchronise with flash bulbs and electronic flash {{and it is}} often only possible to use flash at shutter speeds where the curtain that opens to reveal the film completes its run and the film is fully uncovered, before the second curtain starts to travel and cover it up again. Typically 35mm film SLRs could sync flash at only up to 1/60th second if the camera has horizontal run cloth curtains, and 1/125th if using a vertical run metal shutter.|$|R
5000|$|Electronics {{are also}} {{responsible}} for pushing the <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter's</b> X-sync speed beyond its mechanical limits. As stated earlier, a horizontal FP shutter for 35 mm cameras is fully open and usable only for flash exposure up to 1/60 s, while vertical FP shutters are usually limited to 1/125 s. At higher speeds, a normal 1 millisecond electronic flash burst would expose only the part open to the slit. (See Sections 4: [...] "Disadvantages," [...] and 7.2 [...] "The Leica-type dual curtain focal-plane shutter," [...] above.) ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{shutters}} have a flash synchronization {{switch to}} trigger a flash, if connected. This was quite a complicated matter with mechanical shutters and flashbulbs which took an appreciable time to reach full brightness, <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> making this even more difficult. Special flashbulbs were designed which had a prolonged burn, illuminating the scene for the whole time taken by a focal plane shutter slit to move across the film. These problems were essentially solved for non-focal-plane shutters {{with the advent of}} electronic flash units which fire virtually instantaneously and emit a very short flash.|$|R

5000|$|... 1948: Hasselblad 1600F (Sweden): first 2¼ medium format system SLR {{suitable}} for professional use. Took twelve exposures of 2¼×2¼ inch (6×6 cm) nominal frames (56×56 mm actual frames) on 120 film. Had modular design accepting interchangeable lenses, film magazines and folding waist level finder. The 1/1600 second corrugated stainless steel <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> was unreliable {{and was replaced}} by a slower but more reliable 1/1000 second <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter</b> in the Hasselblad 1000F (Sweden) of 1952.|$|E
50|$|The SL66 uses a <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutter,</b> {{although}} several lenses {{were available in}} leaf shutters to enable much higher flash synchronization speeds.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} construction, focal plane shutters, as used on most SLRs, only allow normal xenon flash units {{to be used}} at shutter speeds slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, {{typically}} at shutter speeds of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon's D40 DSLRs). Special electronic flash units for <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters</b> fire several times as the slit moves across the film. Electronic shutters used in some digital cameras do not have this limitation and may allow a very high X-sync speed.|$|R
50|$|In {{last few}} years, digital point-and-shoot cameras {{have been using}} timed {{electronic}} sampling of the image sensor, replacing the traditional mechanical leaf shutter, with delicate moving parts that can wear out, used by film-based point-and-shoot units. Something similar is now also occurring with more sophisticated digital cameras that, in the past, would have used <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters.</b> For example, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3 (2011, Japan) interchangeable lens digital camera has an FP shutter, but in its 20 frames per second SH Burst mode, it locks its mechanical shutter open and electronically scans its digital sensor, although with resolution reduced to 4 megapixels from 16 MP.|$|R
50|$|This {{is because}} {{even at the}} most {{powerful}} settings, flash durations seldom exceed a few milliseconds (thousandths of a second). With <b>focal-plane</b> <b>shutters,</b> a flash begins shortly after the shutter curtain has fully opened and must extinguish before the curtain begins to close. Selecting any shutter speed faster than the camera’s rated Xsync speed, which is often between 1/60&thinsp;th and 1/200&thinsp;th of a second (from as long as 16.7 milliseconds to as little as 5.0 milliseconds) causes the shutter curtain to begin wiping closed across the film or sensor before the flash has extinguished. When this happens, an underexposed, gradated band appears along an edge of the image—often trailing off darker towards the left or bottom.|$|R
