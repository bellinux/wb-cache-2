[...] For the moment he thought a turning might be concealed anywhere. He threw out his clutch and clapped on his brake. Then he repented {{of what he had}} done. But the engine, after three Herculean throbs, ceased to work. Mr. Britling with a convulsive clutch at his steering wheel set the <b>electric</b> <b>hooter</b> snarling, while one foot released the clutch again and the other, on the accelerator, sought in vain for help. Mr. Direck felt they were going back, back, in spite of all this vocalisation. He clutched at the emergency brake. But he was too late to avoid misfortune. With a feeling like sitting gently in butter, the car sank down sideways and stopped with two wheels in the ditch.|$|E

The road was narrow, but there was room for two {{vehicles}} to pass, provided that both kept well to the proper side. John, however, took the middle and did not swerve much when a dazzling beam swept round the curve. He blew his horn; there was an answering shriek from an <b>electric</b> <b>hooter,</b> and then a savage shout. John, who was near the left side now, but not so close as he ought to have been, freed the clutch and used the brake, and the other car, missing him by an inch or two, plunged into the wet grass across the road. As he stopped he saw the boggy soil fly up and the lamps sink towards the ground. Jumping off, he found the car had brought {{up in front of a}} wall, with the front wheels buried to the axle. The driver and a very angry man in a soft hat were getting out.|$|E
