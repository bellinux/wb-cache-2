5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. <b>Dobby</b> apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. <b>Dobby</b> drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as <b>Dobby</b> grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded <b>Dobby.</b> Harry insists that they bury <b>Dobby</b> properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by <b>Dobby,</b> revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees <b>Dobby</b> from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for <b>Dobby</b> to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E
5|$|On Harry Potter's {{birthday}} in 1992, the Dursley family—Harry's uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley—hold {{a dinner party}} for a potential client of Vernon's drill-manufacturing company. Harry is not invited, but is content to spend the evening quietly in his bedroom, although he is upset that his school friends have not sent cards or presents. However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named <b>Dobby</b> warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, <b>Dobby</b> then attempts to get him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who is not allowed to use magic out of school. Uncle Vernon's business deal falls through, but Harry is given a second chance and allowed to return {{at the start of the}} school year.|$|E

40|$|The dwell {{zones of}} a {{shedding}} cam allow lower {{strain on the}} wrap sheet compared to linkage driven <b>dobbies</b> for the same warp interference factor. Cam driven <b>dobbies</b> can be designed with dwell zones but they give higher jerk compared to linkage driven <b>dobbies.</b> This work explores the use of six bar linkages for driving <b>dobbies</b> which will allow the healds to be in near dwell condition during picking. The healds must be level at the same position in each loom cycle. This requires a mechanism with two nearly equal and symmetrical dwell zones in a crank cycle. The challenges in designing such a mechanism have been outlined in this paper and two possible solutions have been suggested...|$|R

5|$|Opposition to class, {{death and}} its impacts, {{experiencing}} adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant {{themes of the}} series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human <b>Dobby</b> and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.|$|E
5|$|The trio are {{captured}} by Snatchers {{and taken to}} Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione to learn how the three acquired the sword, which she had believed was in her vault at Gringotts. With the help of <b>Dobby</b> the house-elf they escape along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. Peter Pettigrew emerges and begins to strangle Harry, but Harry reminds him that he owes him a life debt. When Pettigrew hesitates, his brief moment of mercy causes his silver hand to turn on him, strangling and killing him, despite Harry and Ron's best efforts to restrain it. During the escape Harry steals Draco Malfoy's wand and <b>Dobby</b> dies. Bellatrix' terror in interrogating Hermione suggests to Harry some exceptional object is in her vault, and when questioned, Griphook confirms a gold cup is indeed in her vault. With Griphook's help, they break into the vault at Gringotts, retrieve the cup, and escape on a dragon, but in the chaos they lose the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry has a vision of Voldemort and sees he now understands their plan, and intends to make his remaining horcruxes even safer. The vision also confirms the unidentified horcrux is at Hogwarts.|$|E
5|$|Coggins {{was born}} in London, England on July 10, 1911, {{the only child of}} Ethel May (née <b>Dobby)</b> and Sydney George Coggins.

During World War I, Sydney Coggins served with, and was commissioned by the regiment. After the war, he was appointed regimental Riding Master, but he was retired when the 1st and 2nd Life Guards were amalgamated into a single regiment under the Geddes Axe. A fellow officer, married to an American steel heiress, offered Sydney work as a secretary to his wife, and the Coggins family emigrated to Long Island, New York in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{fly around}} the school {{regarding}} the Chamber of Secrets' history. Harry and his friends discover from Cuthbert Binns, the ghostly professor of History of Magic, that it houses a terrible monster and was created {{by one of the}} school’s founders, Salazar Slytherin, after a fundamental disagreement with the other founders (Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, and Rowena Ravenclaw). Slytherin believed that students of non-magical parentage should be refused entry to the school. When a Bludger, one of the balls involved in Quidditch, chases after Harry instead of zigzagging toward any player it can hit, breaking his arm, <b>Dobby</b> returns {{in the middle of the}} night to visit Harry in the hospital wing, revealing that it was he who charmed the Bludger and sealed the gateway at King’s Cross and that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened before. Another attack occurs, this time to a first-year Gryffindor named Colin Creevey who idolises Harry, and the school enters panic mode, setting up a dueling class for the students (led by Lockhart and Potions master/Head of Slytherin House Severus Snape), during which it is revealed that Harry is a 'Parselmouth', meaning he has the rare gift to speak to snakes.|$|E
25|$|The Hattersley 6 x 1 {{revolving}} skip box: {{this dress}} goods loom, {{used for the}} weaving of suiting fabrics etc., is fitted with a negative V or angle <b>dobby,</b> a development of the original invented by Hattersley's in 1867. Known throughout the textile industry as the Keighley <b>dobby,</b> it has since been copied, modified and manufactured {{in a variety of}} different forms. Hattersley also invented, in 1868, the skip box: a development of the circular or revolving box. This allowed the shuttle box to bypass or skip the next compartment along and pick out the shuttle of the following one.|$|E
25|$|The Sowden worsted coating loom: {{as in all}} {{mechanical}} devices, {{there is}} drive to improve efficiency, and this loom has several patent innovations. For example, the 28 shaft negative square <b>dobby</b> is similar in construction to Hattersley's Keighley <b>dobby.</b> However, to allow the shuttle more time {{to pass through the}} shed the <b>dobby</b> has special curved slots that allow the shafts to dwell or remain open for longer. In addition, the pattern chain or lags controlling the shafts can be set to control all 28 shafts, or set to operate the first sixteen shafts to weave the cloth and the remaining twelve shafts to produce a name list or selvedge. The word selvedge is derived from self-edge, the edge of the cloth where the weft is turned back as it returns through the shed. The selvedge would often have a brand name or the country of origin woven into it. On {{the left side of the}} loom is the patent four-shuttle drop box motion incorporating a foot pedal. This is part of an escape mechanism in case the shuttle becomes trapped.|$|E

Aberforth later reveals to the trio some facts they did not know about the history of the Dumbledore family. While being held prisoner in Malfoy Manor, Harry briefly glimpses Aberforth's eye in the remaining shard of the two-way mirror he was given by Sirius and calls for Aberforth's help. Aberforth bought its counterpart from Mundungus Fletcher. Using the mirror to watch over the trio, Aberforth sends <b>Dobby</b> to rescue them and the other prisoners from the Manor. He liked <b>Dobby</b> and was upset to hear Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} days, Terry lets {{it be known}} that he knows the ending to The Story. But the tale he tells during the final recess is {{different}} from the one Kennan outlined in his letter: Raul successfully breaks into the Wizard fortress, but half-frozen and overwhelmed by their technology, cannot overcome them. He is forced to escape aboard one of their flying craft. <b>Dobby</b> manages to wrench one arm free, but no more, while Gernisavien is securely fastened. They know their only course of action with Raul's defeat is to have <b>Dobby</b> smash some chemicals together. The resulting explosion levels the mountain. Raul is safely away when it happens, but he knows that the explosion means that the quest is dead, for his friends perished with the key and knowledge necessary to reactivate the farcaster.|$|E
25|$|The Dobcross H.K. {{box loom}} was {{manufactured}} in ca.1950 by Hutchinson, Hollingworth & Co. Ltd of Dobcross, Oldham. This loom was claimed by its makers {{to be one}} of the most widely used power looms in the woollen and worsted industries. It was used, with minor adaptations, for weaving goods as varied as light tropical suiting, costume cloths, overcoatings, army and police uniform cloths and heavy blankets. The main feature of this loom is the <b>dobby</b> (located top right of the loom with the hand wheel) which is known as the Knowles, American or positive wheel <b>dobby.</b> This device lifts and lowers the wooden shafts through which the warp ends are threaded, separating the warp threads to produce the shed. The loom has four rising or drop boxes at each side, which can be moved independently, and can weave up to seven shuttles, each with a different colour.|$|E

25|$|The Lancashire Loom was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} loom. Jacquard looms and <b>Dobby</b> looms are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A Northrop Loom was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet looms and rapier looms.|$|E
25|$|After Harry's first minor violation—a Hover charm {{that was}} {{actually}} performed by <b>Dobby</b> the House-elf—he is merely warned. His second violation, blowing up Aunt Marge, is forgiven by Fudge because the Minister fears that Sirius Black is after Harry and feels that his safety after running away from the Dursleys takes precedence. After his third offence (creating a Patronus to protect himself and Dudley from two Dementors), the letter sent to him states that he is expelled from school, that representatives will arrive at his home to destroy his wand, {{and that he is}} required to appear at a disciplinary hearing, given that the offence occurred after he had already received one warning. Dumbledore reminds Fudge that the Ministry doesn't have the power to expel students from Hogwarts or confiscate wands without benefit of a hearing.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Comic Relief {{performed}} a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan.

25|$|The {{hand loom}} with the witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of <b>dobby,</b> with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can work up to 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for woven fabrics made today were developed and created long ago on similar narrow-width pattern looms.|$|E

In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the car is borrowed by Fred, George and Ron, who use it to rescue Harry from the Dursleys' house. Ron and Harry later steal the car in order to return to Hogwarts after the gate to Platform 9¾ is sealed by <b>Dobby.</b> After they arrive at school, landing in the Whomping Willow, the car ejects Harry, Ron, and their luggage, then flees into the Forbidden Forest, ignoring Ron's pleas for it to come back. Mr Weasley soon faces an inquiry at the Ministry of Magic, as seven Muggles saw the car flying across the countryside, and is forced to pay a large fine.|$|E

Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the barrier to access Platform 9¾. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power {{at the end of the}} journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car.|$|E
