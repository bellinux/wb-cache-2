6000|$|RICHARD--[With a sardonic laugh.] And yet {{he keeps}} asking {{everyone}} to send for Bigelow--says <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him--not us. WE can't understand! [He laughs bitterly.] ...|$|E
6000|$|MAGGIE [scared]. And now, if you'll {{come with}} me, I think John has {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over with Lady Sybil. [Recovering and taking him on.] Or would you prefer, John, {{to say it}} before us all? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Sir. Mr. Caterham sent a flag of truce. The {{whole thing}} is a hideous misunderstanding. That is why <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you, and put his case before you. They insist, Sir, that you should intervene--" ...|$|E
50|$|The End Of The Wild is a {{documentary}} by CCTV, Animal Planet, NHNZ, WildAid and Yaoming.This was Yaoming's {{first trip to}} the African mainland. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the public about protecting elephants and rhinoceros. <b>He</b> also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> combat the poaching of elephant tusks and rhino horns.|$|R
60|$|Tom thought so: {{but when}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him the brick-maker {{was much too}} busy and proud of his work to take notice of him.|$|R
60|$|His {{mind was}} full of a much more {{important}} matter and he ran off <b>to</b> find Kate. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over his latest impressions with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{a deal in}} wheat, he {{can stay}} away," [...] said Mrs. Hastings sharply. [...] "If all one hears is true, he has lost {{quite a few of}} Harry's dollars on the market lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Elgood {{has been}} here this afternoon," [...] she said, [...] "from Sheffield. He is the {{secretary}} of the Union, you know. He is coming again to-morrow morning. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you about the boys' age limit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{a deal in}} wheat, he {{can stay}} away," [...] said Mrs. Hastings with a certain dryness. [...] "If all one hears is true, he has lost {{quite a few of}} Harry's dollars on the market lately." ...|$|E
60|$|When he had bagged three rabbits he was {{besieged by}} the melancholy of loneliness, the {{perfection}} of the silver-gowned Gertie. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> <b>He</b> thought of Bone Stillman.|$|R
60|$|This {{prospect}} {{seemed to}} set John's mind {{more than ever}} on Helen, as if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over her brother's conduct with her, and was imagining her sentiments on it.|$|R
6000|$|After the coffee, Mrs. Phillips {{proposed}} their adjourning to the [...] "drawing- room" [...] {{the other}} side of the folding doors, which had been left open. Phillips asked her to leave Joan and himself where they were. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. <b>He</b> promised not to bore her for more than ten minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had {{to have a}} {{large piece}} of silver tube let into his throat, and if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> he puts his finger on it. It makes him so interesting, I think. You feel he's sincere somehow. A most charming man in every way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone {{down to the}} Palace," [...] {{the other}} young man, whose name was Ansell, replied; [...] "telephoned for the first thing this morning. Ghastly habit William has of getting up at seven o'clock and {{suddenly}} remembering that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> diplomacy. The Chief will be furious all day now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? She {{is almost}} a woman, and she is older than her years. Look at them now. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> seriously, and she is teasing him all the time. She has the {{instinct}} of her sex. She will conceal what she feels until the--psychological moment. But she does feel--she begins to understand. I am sure of it. Watch them!" ...|$|E
50|$|On March 28, the Rangers were in Florida for an {{exhibition}} game with the Minnesota Twins. An hour before the first pitch, Randle walked up to Rangers manager Frank Lucchesi during batting practice and said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. Words were exchanged, and Randle punched Lucchesi, who was still in street clothes, in the face.|$|R
60|$|Her words fell on Leonard like a cold douche. Here had he {{been talking}} about his love for her, and yet she ignored the whole thing, and asked him what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was in the}} drawing-room after lunch, {{and that}} guy Lord Wisbeach {{came in and said}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> mother privately. Mother sent me out of the room, so of course I listened at the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's what I think. I'm sick of this place, Izzy. I'm sick of dancing. I'm sick of New York. I'm sick of everything. I'm {{going back}} to the country. I thought I had got the pigs and {{chickens}} clear out of my system, but I hadn't. I've suspected it for a long, long time, and tonight I know it. Tell the boss, with my love, that I'm sorry, but it had to be done. And if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> back, he must do it by letter: Mrs John Tyson, Rodney, Maine, is the address.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You noticed that? He {{wanted to}} talk about his crime with me. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it with any one who will listen to him. He is {{consumed}} with an undying pity for the man he slew. That is the first thing, the only thing, in his mind. If he could, I believe he would give his life for the life he took at any moment. But you cannot recreate one life by destroying another. There is no human means of ascertaining justice, but we can always do mercy with divine omniscience." [...] As he spoke the sun pierced the edge of the eastern horizon, and lit up the marble walls and roofs of the Regionic capital which we were approaching.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{admitted}} Charles, [...] "I do {{not know}} that he ever does, in a general way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly. His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation, and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were in the other room. 'Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms." ...|$|E
50|$|Tak {{meets the}} Giant Misunderstanding and needed {{help with the}} rift. The Giant thought <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Rick. Tak {{repeated}} the Rick question to the juju to unlock the rift. When he said goodbye, the Giant sang a song.|$|R
5000|$|Winter {{was taken}} to a patrol wagon {{at the back of the}} White House, which instead took him to the nearest police station, and then to the Washington Asylum. He {{answered}} all the officers' questions, except that he refused to specify what it was <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the president about, stating only [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see the president, I must see him." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} the young Frenchman put his mug down and leaned with both elbows upon the rough deal table, because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> confidentially with his friend, {{and there was}} never any knowing what prying ears might be about.|$|R
60|$|Today is a gray day, {{and the sun}} as I write {{is hidden}} in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is gray except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the gray sea, into which the sandpoints stretch like gray figures. The sea is {{tumbling}} in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a gray mist. All vastness, the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, {{and there is a}} 'brool' over the sea that sounds like some passage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem 'men like trees walking'. The fishing boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a little}} awkwardness in {{dispersing}} after lunch. Mr. Pope, his heart warmed by the champagne and mellowed by a subsequent excellent cigar, wanted very much to crack {{what he called a}} [...] "postprandial jest" [...] or so with the great humorist, while Theodore also, deeply impressed with the discovery that there was more in Mr. Magnet than he had supposed, displayed a strong disposition to attach himself more closely than he had hitherto done to this remarkable person, and study his quiet but enormous possibilities with greater attention. Mrs. Pope with a still alertness did her best to get people adjusted, but Syd and Rom had conceived a base and unnatural desire to subjugate the affections of the youngest waiter, and wouldn't listen to her proposal that they should take Theodore away into the town; Mr. Wintersloan displayed extraordinary cunning and resource in evading a tête-à-tête with Mr. Pope that would have released Mr. Magnet. Now Mrs. Pope came to think of it, Mr. Wintersloan never had had the delights of a good talk with Mr. Pope, he knew practically nothing about the East Purblow experiment except for what Mr. Magnet might have retailed to him, and she was very greatly puzzled to account for his almost manifest reluctance to go into things thoroughly. Daffy remained on hand, available but useless, and Mrs. Pope, smiling at the landscape and a prey to Management within, was suddenly inspired to take her eldest daughter into her confidence. [...] "Daffy," [...] she said, with a guileful finger extended and pointing to the lower sky as though she was pointing out the less obvious and more atmospheric beauties of Surrey, [...] "get Theodore away from Mr. Magnet if you can. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Marjorie." ...|$|E
50|$|Back on Alpha, Koenig orders Carter {{to return}} to Moonbase and in an {{agitated}} tone tells Kano <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him.|$|E
2500|$|Local social {{services}} and the national regulator had received various warnings but the mistreatment continued. One senior nurse three times contacted the national regulator saying <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "abuse" [...] – but heard nothing back. The hospital was shut down.|$|R
50|$|At {{the police}} station, {{the police are}} {{questioning}} Tomonari. He reveals that he wasn't approaching Rachel but instead <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Richard for his help. He is innocent {{and the reason why}} he had the knife in his chest pocket is for his own protection.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit {{down there}} and eat," [...] {{commanded}} her husband {{and pointed to a}} chair. Kiddy Leech dropped into it and was given a fair supper, for which, it must be confessed, he had little relish. Several times he acted as if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> but as often changed his mind.|$|R
5000|$|After {{being arrested}} for not paying his child support, Sanford Prince (Tim Hopper) is in FBI custody. Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) tells his boss, Agent Frank Gaad (Richard Thomas), {{that they should}} leave Sanford locked up until <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Matt {{talks to}} his wife about {{the last couple of}} days that they had together. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their issues, but overhears her {{thinking}} that [...] "he knows" [...] something that she hasn't shared. Suspecting something, he leaves quickly for work, not allowing himself to find out what was in her mind.|$|E
50|$|Candice arrives {{back at her}} apartment, {{where she}} finds Dick waiting. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the {{potential}} relationships between the students, and tries to convince Candice {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and any of the other students. While he is there, the DJ from the studio, Bob, phones Candice and updates her on the murder at the academy.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must tell}} us about your adventures," [...] Evelyn said, as they got up, but when they went on the terrace Jim {{followed}} Carrie. Although <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Evelyn, Carrie must not feel neglected. She gave him a rather curious smile when he stopped by the stone bench she occupied.|$|R
25|$|While {{he was in}} the Nice prison, Calderone became {{convinced}} {{that he was about to}} be killed by other Sicilian inmates. Suddenly, he began screaming for a prison guard and demanded to see the head of the prison. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> judge Giovanni Falcone. Calderone was moved to an insane asylum for his own protection.|$|R
60|$|Rob {{followed}} the girl {{out into the}} yard, and threw himself on the grass at her feet, perfectly unconscious {{of the fact that}} this attitude was exceedingly graceful and becoming to them both. He did it because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, and the grass was cool and easy; there wasn't any other chair, anyway.|$|R
