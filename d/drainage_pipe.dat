Investigating Kittel's disappearance, Mulder predicts that another seed will be found. They have Marcus Duff (Carl Lumbly), a social worker who is helping Aboah apply for citizenship, cross-reference the names from the flight with those applying for permanent residency or a work visa. This leads them to Aboah, who runs when they try to question him and is discovered after squeezing himself into a <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe.</b> Aboah appears to have no symptoms of disease when he is analyzed at a local medical center, but Scully plans to examine him more.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E

The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E

25|$|The city of Asheville {{is home to}} a Duke Energy Progress {{coal power}} plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is {{designated}} as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA. In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life. In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved. Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe</b> under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured Feb 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.|$|E

2500|$|Paintball {{is played}} at both {{commercial}} venues, which require paid admission, and private land; {{both of which}} may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context. [...] Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers {{are little more than}} air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe.</b> The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as [...] "can" [...] and [...] "snake" [...] bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe).</b> Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.|$|E
2500|$|If {{clogging}} occurs, it {{is usually}} the result of an attempt to flush unsuitable items, or too much toilet paper. Flushing of large amounts of hair should also be avoided. However, clogging can occur spontaneously due to limescale fouling of the drain pipe, or by overloading the stool capacity of the toilet. Stool capacity varies among toilet designs and is based {{on the size of the}} <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe,</b> the capacity of the water tank, the velocity of a flush, and the method by which the water attempts to vacate the bowl of its contents. The size and consistency of the stool is also a contributing, but hard-to-predict factor.|$|E
40|$|A {{decrease}} in discharge capacity of storm-water <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> {{is the result}} of the so-called hydraulic deterioration which reduces the cross sectional area of pipes and increases the pipe roughness. Hydraulic deterioration is caused by tree root intrusion, sediment accumulation, and encrustation, and is affected by many influential factors such as pipe size and pipe location. Predicting hydraulic deterioration is important for effective management of <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes.</b> An ordered probit deterioration model (OPDM) and a probabilistic neural network deterioration model (PNNDM) were developed in this study using the influential factors as model inputs and the hydraulic condition as model output. Their predictive performances were compared against each other using a case study from Melbourne, Australia with a sample of 417 storm-water <b>drainage</b> <b>pipes</b> subjected to closed circuit television inspection. The results show that the PNNDM is more suitable for predicting the hydraulic deterioration and outperforms the OPDM. Several input factors such as pipe size and pipe age are found significant to the hydraulic deterioration. ...|$|R

2500|$|Speedball {{is played}} {{in an open}} field that could be {{compared}} to a soccer field, it is flat {{with a minimum of}} natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic <b>drainage</b> <b>pipe,</b> which offered a more variable field layout and some [...] "give" [...] to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric [...] "bunkers" [...] were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as [...] "snake" [...] and [...] "can" [...] bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more [...] "High Tech" [...] in a sense that they are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).|$|E
