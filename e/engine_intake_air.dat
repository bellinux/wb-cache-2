Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's power lever than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall warning horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the diesel engine {{performance}} and drivability have significantly improved with the latest technologic developments. Nevertheless, one of the disadvantageous of diesel engines {{is related to the}} difficulties for starting at cold conditions, particularly in the conditions where the ambient temperature is near or below 0 ºC. Additionally, the harmful exhaust emissions are also at significantly important levels during the cold start conditions. Most of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from diesel engines are produced during the engine warm-up period.   In order to improve cold start characteristics of diesel engines, many measures have been proposed, such as glow plugs and air heaters in air intake lines. In this study, in order to increase the cold start performance and improve the exhaust emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine, phase change materials (PCMs) have been used. PCMs have high heats of fusion and they can absorb latent energy before melting. During the phase change, temperature of PCMs remains nearly constant. In this study, a PCMs was used with the 45 - 51 ºC melting temperature band in a heat exchanger. Hot water from an external source was circulated in the exchanger to carry out the experiments in the same conditions and was used as heat source in order to melt the PCMs. <b>Engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> has been passed through the exchanger before engine intake manifold.   During the engine cooling period, the PCM in the produced heat exchanger have increased the cooling time period of <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> An experimental setup has been established to observe the cold start characteristics of the two cylinder diesel engine with and without using the produced exchanger. Temperature measurements from different points, CO exhaust emissions, engine speed and in cylinder pressure measurements have been used to evaluate the contribution of exchanger and increasing the intake air temperature by using the PCMs. The experiments have been carried out at different PCMs and ambient temperatures. The increase in the temperature of intake air at low ambient temperatures assists the engine cold start performance, decreases the starting time of engine and improves the engine exhaust emissions characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Lean NOx Trap (LNT) {{catalysts}} {{are capable}} of reducing NOx in lean exhaust from diesel engines. NOx is stored on the catalyst during lean operation; then, under rich exhaust conditions, the NOx is released from and reduced by the catalyst. The process of NOx release and reduction is called regeneration. One method of obtaining the rich conditions for regeneration is to inject additional fuel into the engine cylinders while throttling the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> flow to effectively run the engine at rich air:fuel ratios; this method is called “in-cylinder” regeneration. In-cylinder regeneration of LNT catalysts has been demonstrated and is a candidate emission control technique for commercialization of light-duty diesel vehicles to meet future emission regulations. In the study presented here, a 1. 7 -liter diesel engine with a LNT catalyst system {{was used to evaluate}} in-cylinder regeneration techniques. Characterization of the exhaust reductant chemistry during in-cylinder regeneration was performed. The effects of various injection strategies and fuels and the resulting exhaust chemistry on the performance of the LNT catalyst were analyzed. In addition, exhaust species measurement of NOx and select reductants were performed inside of the catalyst cells with a capillary-based mass spectrometry technique. The effect of various injection parameters on exhaust chemistry species and LNT performance are discussed. Results indicate that fuel chemistry does affect engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) species, but not engine-out carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen (H 2) generation. Higher engine-out CO and H 2 correlate to improved NOx reduction, irrespective of HCs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{is aimed}} at {{investigating}} the performance and emission characteristics of a Dual fuel engine operated with Diesel as primary fuel and ignition source and LPG as secondary fuel with EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) system. In dual fuel operation, much of the energy released comes from the combustion of the gaseous fuel, while {{only a small amount}} of diesel fuel provides ignition through timed cylinder injection. The effects of Diesel and LPG substitution ratios, engine speed, and load on the equivalent brake specific fuel consumption and gaseous emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides are examined for LPG-diesel fuel operation and then compared with the original diesel operation. The concept recirculation of the exhaust gases (EGR), re-burning a part of the exhaust gases is being widely used in many practical situations. The results show that, over a wide range of operating conditions (engine speed, load), the dual fuel engine clearly shows the benefits of reduced NOX emissions. However, under low loads, the results indicate high CO and HC emissions and a higher BSFC when compared to those of the corresponding diesel engine. The LPG addition has been premixed with the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> after the pilot injection of the Diesel in small percentages, in order to improve the engine combustion and to reduce pollutant emissions during the mixing-controlled combustion phase.

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} largely {{proposed}} as a possible fuel for internal combustion engines. The main advantage of burning hydrogen {{is the absence of}} carbon-based tailpipe emissions. Hydrogen’s wide flammability also offers the advantage of very lean combustion and higher engine efficiency than conventional carbon-based fuels. In order to avoid abnormal combustion modes like pre-ignition and backfiring, as well as air displacement from hydrogen’s large injected volume per cycle, direct injection of hydrogen after intake valve closure is the preferred mixture preparation method for hydrogen engines. The current work focused on computational studies of hydrogen injection and mixture formation for direct-injection spark-ignition engines. Hydrogen conditions at the injector’s nozzle exit are typically sonic. Initially the characteristics of under-expanded sonic hydrogen jets were investigated in a quiescent environment using both Reynolds-Averaged NavierStokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques. Various injection conditions were studied, including a reference case from the literature. Different nozzle geometries were investigated, including a straight nozzle with fixed cross section and a stepped nozzle design. LES captured details of the expansion shocks better than RANS and demonstrated several aspects of hydrogen’s injection and mixing. Incylinder simulations were also performed with a side 6 -hole injector using 70 and 100 bar injection pressure. Injection timing was set to just after inlet valve closure with duration of 6 μs and 8 μs, leading to global air-to-fuel equivalence ratios  typically in the region of 0. 2 – 0. 4. The <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure was set to 1. 5 bar absolute to mimic boosted operation. It was observed that hydrogen jet wall impingement was always prominent. Comparison with non-fuelled engine conditions demonstrated the degree of momentum exchange between in-cylinder hydrogen injection and air motion. LES highlighted details of hydrogen’s spatial distribution throughout the injection duration and up to ignition timing. Higher peak velocities were predicted by LES, especially on the tumble plane. With the employed injection strategy, the areas closer to the cylinder wall were richer in fuel than the centre of the chamber close to the end of compressio...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} turbocharging single cylinder four stroke internal combustion engines, a model used to evaluate it, an experimental setup used to test it, and {{the findings of this}} experiment. A turbocharged engine has better fuel economy, cost efficiency, and power density than an equivalently sized, naturally aspirated engine. Most multi-cylinder diesel engines are turbocharged for this reason. However, due to the timing mismatch between the exhaust stroke, when the turbocharger is powered, and the intake stroke, when the <b>engine</b> <b>intakes</b> <b>air,</b> turbocharging is not used in commercial single cylinder engines. Single cylinder engines are ubiquitous in developing world off grid power applications such as tractors, generators, and water pumps due to their low cost. Turbocharging these engines could give users a lower cost and more fuel efficient engine. The proposed solution is to add an air capacitor, {{in the form of a}} large volume intake manifold, in between the turbocharger compressor and the <b>engine</b> <b>intake</b> to smooth out the flow. by Michael Rafael Buchman.
