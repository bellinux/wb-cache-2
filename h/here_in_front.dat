The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? It's right <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me.'

500|$|After {{entering}} {{service the}} F-111 proved highly successful. Although it never saw combat, the F-111C was the fastest, longest range combat aircraft in Southeast Asia. Aviation historian Alan Stephens {{has written that}} they were [...] "the preeminent weapons system in the Asia-Pacific region" [...] throughout their service and provided Australia with [...] "a genuine, independent strike capability". Stewart Wilson, in his book Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service, described the F-111C as [...] "an unqualified success..., providing Australia with a potent strike capability in an aircraft which, a quarter of century after its first flight remains second to none." [...] Former Indonesian defense minister Benny Murdani told his counterpart Kim Beazley that when others became upset with Australia during cabinet meetings, Murdani told them [...] "Do you realise the Australians have a bomber that can put a bomb through that window on to the table <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of us?" ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, the NHL and NHLPA honoured Näslund with a tribute and {{ceremonial}} puck drop prior to a game held in Stockholm, Sweden, between the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets. Several months later, the Canucks retired his number 19 jersey prior to a home game against the Tampa Bay Lightning on 11 December 2010. Attending the on-ice ceremony were his wife, three children, parents and sister, as well as former Canucks teammates, coaches and executives. The night included a video tribute highlighting his hockey career, speeches from team personalities and gift presentations from the organization. In honour of Näslund and his wife's past philanthropy in the Vancouver community, the team also announced the establishment of a sports equipment centre for underprivileged children. [...] Prior to the jersey raising, Näslund thanked those involved in his career. Reflecting on his career, he commented, [...] "Young hockey players from northern Sweden never dream of a night like this...To go from sitting up in the press box as a healthy scratch to be standing <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of you is quite amazing." [...] By having his jersey retired, he became the third player in team history to receive the honour, after Stan Smyl and Trevor Linden.|$|E
500|$|On 15 November the {{commander}} of Desert Mounted Corps, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, issued orders for the Yeomanry Mounted Division (Major General G. de S. Barrow) and the Anzac Mounted Division (Major General E. W. C. Chaytor) to continue the advance on Ramleh and Lud about [...] from Junction Station. On {{the same day the}} Yeomanry Mounted Division reached the Jerusalem road after a cavalry charge by the 6th Mounted Brigade (Brigadier General C. A. C. Godwin) at Abu Shusheh. This charge has been described as even more daring than that at Mughar Ridge, owing to the rocky nature of the ground over which the horsemen attacked. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (Brigadier General W. Meldrum) secured the left flank of the EEF by occupying Jaffa on 16 November. This city was captured {{as a result of the}} victory at Ayun Kara two days earlier, which forced the Ottoman Eighth Army to withdraw over the Nahr el Auja, which enters the sea [...] north-north-east of Jaffa. The Eighth Army's withdrawal placed them to the north of the Ottoman Seventh Army and opened up that army's right flank to attack. As a result, the Seventh Army was forced to move further away from the coastal sector into the Judean Hills. <b>Here,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Jerusalem, Ottoman infantry units created a defensive screen.|$|E

2500|$|Following the 2003 and 2008 elections, {{which both}} {{required}} multiple ballots, {{some in the}} Czech political community expressed dissatisfaction with this method of election. In 2008, Martin Bursík, leader of the Czech Green Party, said of the 2008 vote, [...] "We are sitting <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the public somewhat muddied by backstage horse-trading, poorly concealed meetings with lobbyists and intrigue." [...] There were calls to adopt a system with a direct election, in which the public {{would be involved in}} the voting. However, opponents of this plan pointed out that the presidency had always been determined by indirect vote, going back through several predecessor states to the presidency of Tomáš Masaryk. Charles University political scientist Zdeněk Zbořil suggested that direct voting could result in a president and prime minister who were hostile to each other's goals, leading to deadlock. A system of direct elections was supported by figures including Jiří Čunek (Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party) and Jiří Paroubek (Czech Social Democratic Party), whereas the ruling Civic Democratic Party, under both President Václav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, was more skeptical. Topolánek commented that it was an advantage that [...] "our presidential elections are not preceded by some campaign, that is unavoidable in a direct election and causes rifts among citizens". Using Poland as an unfavourable example, he said that [...] "when someone talks about how our method of selecting the head of state is undignified, he should first weigh the consequences of a direct vote".|$|E

Glacial catastrophes, snowstorm episodes, glittering auroral effects, Polaris in the zenith, Franklin underfoot,--the category of his commonplaces was wonderful.

It is what the French call a je ne sais quoi, a something insaisissable, a sort of nuance, not amounting of course to a lueur, but still,--how shall one put it,--SOMETHING.|$|E

50|$|Nonetheless, to the {{citizens}} of this 4th-arrondissement neighborhood, the Place Saint-Paul is a real place near the Saint-Paul metro station and the Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis church. <b>Here,</b> almost <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the church’s north-facing doors, the Rue Saint-Antoine meets the Rue de Rivoli at a narrow angle, forming a triangular island {{to the west of the}} intersection where there are trees, benches, kiosks, an entrance to the Saint-Paul metro station, a carousel for children, etc. Unofficially, this sliver of ground in the middle of traffic is the Place Saint-Paul, but most local people will tell you that the Place Saint-Paul extends a few tens of metres into the neighboring streets as well.|$|R

The Danish archers, assisted by their comrades, had scrambled up on to the outer bank and kept up a heavy fire on the defenders of the wall.
