5|$|In the 1840s, {{a serial}} format {{known as the}} roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most {{acclaimed}} expression of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's supremacy, and prove himself the most capable <b>feuilleton</b> author in France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in Le Constitutionnel {{at the end of}} 1846, then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and {{sleeping in a}} stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school in his native village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a <b>feuilleton</b> (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj Literary Society, at the time the city's only Romanian-speaking literary body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. He soon became a correspondent of Răvașul, a Cluj-based newspaper, signing his first pieces there with the pen name Alfius, then as Agarbi or Potcoavă ("Horseshoe").|$|E
25|$|That October, {{when the}} {{government}} fell to a PNL one led by Sturdza, Rosetti was fired according to a tradition that a change in power brought about a wholesale replacement of civil servants with supporters of the new leadership. By then, his Urdești project had proved a failure, with Rosetti losing most of his investment to declining grain prices. Without a stable domicile, Rosetti lived with his Bogdan in-laws in Grădinți, then at a retreat in Agapia, while his sons were studying in Iași and Bucharest. It was here that he began work on his first historical novel, Cu paloșul ("With the Longsword"), fictionalizing the life and adventures of Bogdan I. It first appeared as a <b>feuilleton</b> in the Conservative daily Epoca.|$|E

500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La Vieille Fille (The Old Maid), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted {{to show the world}} that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality <b>feuilleton</b> were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". He tried again in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
2500|$|Nolte is {{best known}} for his role in {{launching}} the Historikerstreit ("Historians' Dispute") of 1986 and 1987. On 6 June 1986 Nolte published a [...] <b>feuilleton</b> opinion piece entitled Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will: Eine Rede, die geschrieben, aber nicht mehr gehalten werden konnte ("The Past That Will Not Pass: A Speech That Could Be Written but Not Delivered") in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. His <b>feuilleton</b> was a distillation of ideas he had first introduced in lectures delivered in 1976 and in 1980. Earlier in 1986, Nolte had planned to deliver a speech before the Frankfurt Römerberg Conversations (an annual gathering of intellectuals), but he had claimed that the organizers of the event withdrew their invitation. In response, an editor and co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Joachim Fest, allowed Nolte to have his speech printed as a <b>feuilleton</b> in his newspaper. One of Nolte's leading critics, British historian Richard J. Evans, claims that the organizers of the Römerberg Conversations did not withdraw their invitation, and that Nolte had just refused to attend.|$|E
2500|$|After a brief legal {{career in}} the University of Vienna and Salzburg, he devoted himself to journalism and literature, working as a {{journalist}} for a Viennese newspaper and a correspondent for Neue Freie Presse, in Paris, occasionally making special trips to London and Istanbul. [...] He later became literary editor of Neue Freie Presse, and wrote several comedies and dramas for the Viennese stage. [...] His early work did not focus on Jewish life. [...] It was of the <b>feuilleton</b> order, descriptive rather than political.|$|E

2500|$|Nolte {{began his}} <b>feuilleton</b> by {{remarking}} {{that it was}} necessary in his opinion to draw a [...] "line under the German past". Nolte argued that the memory of the Nazi era was [...] "a bugaboo, as a past that in the process of establishing itself in the present or that is suspended above the present like an executioner's sword". Nolte complained that excessive present-day interest in the Nazi period had the effect of drawing [...] "attention away from the pressing questions of the present—for example, the question of [...] "unborn life" [...] or the presence of genocide yesterday in Vietnam and today in Afghanistan".|$|E
2500|$|Nolte often {{contributes}} <b>Feuilleton</b> (opinion pieces) to German newspapers such as Die Welt and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He {{has often}} been described {{as one of the}} [...] "most brooding, German thinkers about history". [...] The historical consciousness and self-understanding of the Germans form a major theme of his essays. Nolte called the Federal Republic [...] "a state born of contemporary history, a product of catastrophe erected to overcome catastrophe" [...] In a <b>Feuilleton</b> piece published in Die Welt entitled “Auschwitz als Argument in der Geschichtstheorie” (Auschwitz as An Argument in Historical Theory) on 2 January 1999, Nolte criticized his old enemy Richard J. Evans’s book In The Defence of History, on the grounds that aspects of the Holocaust are open to revision, and that therefore Evans’s attacks on Nolte during the Historikerstreit were unwarranted. Specifically, citing the American political scientist Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, Nolte argued that the effectiveness of the gas chambers as killing instruments was exaggerated, that more Jews were killed by mass shooting than by mass gassing, that the number of people killed at Auschwitz was overestimated after 1945 (the Soviets initially exaggerated the death toll at 4 million where the consensus today is 1.1 million), that Binjamin Wilkomirski's memoir of Auschwitz was a forgery and that accordingly the history of the Holocaust is open to reinterpretation. In October 1999, Evans stated in response that he agreed with Nolte on these points, but argued that this form of argument was an attempt by Nolte to avoid responding to his criticism of him during the Historikerstreit.|$|E
2500|$|While in prison, Keil first {{developed}} {{the idea for}} the publication which was to bring him fame and outlive him by many years. He envisioned an illustrated weekly that would provide [...] "intellectual exercise and education as entertainment" [...] and serve as a [...] "people's encyclopedia" [...] covering a wide range of interests. Each edition would contain features by famous writers, essays on German and foreign customs, articles on science and nature, a section on human health, and a <b>feuilleton</b> of non-political news, art, and literary criticism. In particular, he would direct these more subtle liberal ideals of enlightenment at the German middle and lower classes. Its development became the forerunner of the modern glossy print magazines we know today [...] {{and one of the most}} influential publications of the 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the common}} trend, Biblioteka started its own section for humorous {{sketches}} and feuilletons, and in 1861 Pisemsky debuted there – first as [...] "State councilor Salatushka", then as Nikita Bezrylov. The latter's first <b>feuilleton,</b> {{published in the}} December issue and making fun of liberal trends and views, made quite a stir. In May 1862 Iskra magazine {{came up with a}} scathing retort, calling the unknown author 'dumb and ignorant', 'having by nature a very limited mind' and accusing the editor of Biblioteka of providing space for 'reactionaries'. Pisemsky, in a rather reserved way, blamed Iskra for trying to [...] "soil his honest name", but then Nikita Bezrylov came up with a reply of his own which was quite a match for the Iskra article in terms of outright rudeness. Iskra editors Viktor Kurochkin and N.A. Stepanov {{went so far as to}} challenge Pisemsky to a duel, but the latter refused. The Russky Mir newspaper defended Pisemsky and published a letter of protest, signed by 30 authors. This, in its own turn, provoked Sovremennik to come up with a letter denouncing Pisemsky and signed, among others, by its leaders Nikolay Nekrasov, Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Ivan Panaev.|$|E
2500|$|In particular, {{controversy}} {{centered on}} an argument of Nolte's 1985 essay “Between Myth and Revisionism” {{from the book}} Aspects of the Third Reich, first published in German as [...] "Die negative Lebendigkeit des Dritten Reiches" [...] ("The Negative Vitality of the Third Reich") as an opinion piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 24 July 1980, but which did not attract widespread attention until 1986 when Jürgen Habermas criticized the essay in a <b>feuilleton</b> piece. Nolte had delivered a lecture at the Siemens-Stiftung in 1980, and excerpts from his speech {{were published in the}} Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung without attracting controversy. In his essay, Nolte argued that if the PLO were to destroy Israel, then the subsequent history written in the new Palestinian state would portray the former Israeli state in the blackest of colors with no references to any of the positive features of the defunct state. In Nolte’s opinion, a similar situation of history written only by the victors exists in regards to the history of Nazi Germany. Many historians, such as British historian Richard J. Evans, have asserted that, based on this statement, Nolte appears to believe that the only reason why Nazism is regarded as evil is because Germany lost World War II, with no regard for the Holocaust. [...] In a review which appeared in the Historische Zeitschrift journal on 2 April 1986 Klaus Hildebrand called Nolte’s essay [...] "Between Myth and Revisionism" [...] “trailblazing”.

He carried his disinterested civility further; and, from some quarter, procured me a chair. Once and again, I {{have found that the}} most cross-grained are by no means the worst of mankind; nor the humblest in station, the least polished in feeling. This man, in his courtesy, seemed to find nothing strange in my being here alone; only a reason for extending to me, as far as he could, a retiring, yet efficient attention. Having secured me a place and a seat, he withdrew without asking a question, without obtruding a remark, without adding a superfluous word.

6000|$|The great renewed resonance--renewed by the {{incredible}} {{luck of the}} play--was always in his ears {{without so much as}} a conscious turn of his head to listen; so that the queer world of his fame was not the mere usual field of the Anglo-Saxon boom, but positively the bottom of the whole theatric sea, unplumbed source of the wave that had borne him in the course of a year or two over German, French, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian foot-lights. Paris itself really appeared for the hour the centre of his cyclone, with reports and [...] "returns," [...] to say nothing of agents and emissaries, converging from the minor capitals; though his impatience was scarce the less keen to get back to London, where his work had had no such critical excoriation to survive, no such lesson of anguish to learn, as it had received at the hand of supreme authority, of that French authority which was in such a matter the only one to be artistically reckoned with.

6000|$|It was his {{occasional}} custom--and a very laudable, acceptable custom, too--to arrive of an evening, always à l'improviste, unannounced, {{burst in}} on the silent hour of study, establish a sudden despotism over us and our occupations, cause books to be put away, work-bags to be brought out, and, drawing forth a single thick volume, or a handful of pamphlets, substitute for the besotted [...] "lecture pieuse," [...] drawled by a sleepy pupil, some tragedy made grand by grand reading, ardent by fiery action--some drama, whereof, for my part, I rarely studied the intrinsic merit; for M. Emanuel made it a vessel for an outpouring, and filled it with his native verve and passion like a cup with a vital brewage. Or else he would flash through our conventual darkness a reflex of a brighter world, show us {{a glimpse of the}} current literature of the day, read us passages from some enchanting tale, or the last witty <b>feuilleton</b> which had awakened laughter in the saloons of Paris; taking care always to expunge, with the severest hand, whether from tragedy, melodrama, tale, or essay, whatever passage, phrase, or word, could be deemed unsuited to an audience of [...] "jeunes filles." [...] I noticed more than once, that where retrenchment without substitute would have left unmeaning vacancy, or introduced weakness, he could, and did, improvise whole paragraphs, no less vigorous than irreproachable; the dialogue--the description--he engrafted was often far better than that he pruned away.|$|E

6000|$|Gringoire is a play very {{different}} from M. De Banville's other dramas, {{and it is not}} included in the pretty volume of [...] "Comedies" [...] which closes the Lemerre series of his poems. The poet has often declared, with an iteration which has been parodied by M. Richepin, that [...] "comedy is the child of the ode," [...] and that a drama without the [...] "lyric" [...] element is scarcely a drama at all. While comedy retains either the choral ode in its strict form, or its representative in the shape of lyric enthusiasm (le lyrisme), comedy is complete and living. Gringoire, to our mind, has plenty of lyric enthusiasm; but M. De Banville seems to be of a different opinion. His republished [...] "Comedies" [...] are more remote from experience than Gringoire, his characters are ideal creatures, familiar types of the stage, like Scapin and [...] "le beau Leandre," [...] or ethereal persons, or figures of old mythology, like Diana in Diane au Bois, and Deidamia in the piece which shows Achilles among women. M. De Banville's dramas have scarcely prose enough in them to suit the modern taste. They are masques for the delicate diversion of an hour, and it is not in the nature of things that they should rival the success of blatant buffooneries. His earliest pieces--Le <b>Feuilleton</b> d'Aristophane (acted at the Odeon, Dec. 26th, 1852), and Le Cousin du Roi (Odeon, April 4th, 1857)--were written in collaboration with Philoxene Boyer, a generous but indiscreet patron of singers.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was in the}} Duchess's court a {{young fellow}} from the South of France, whose friends had sent him to faire son droit at Paris, where he {{had gone through the}} usual course of {{pleasure}} and studies of the young inhabitants of the Latin Quarter. He had at one time exalted republican opinions, and had fired his shot with distinction at St. Meri. He was a poet of some little note--a book of his lyrics, Les Rales d'un Asphyxie, having made a sensation {{at the time of their}} appearance. He drank great quantities of absinthe of a morning; smoked incessantly; played roulette whenever he could get a few pieces; contributed to a small journal, and was especially great in his hatred of l'infame Angleterre. Delenda est Carthago was tattooed beneath his shirt-sleeves. Fifine and Clarisse, young milliners of the students' district, had punctured this terrible motto on his manly right arm. Le leopard, emblem of England, was his aversion; he shook his fist at the caged monster in the Garden of Plants. He desired to have [...] "Here lies an enemy of England" [...] engraved upon his early tomb. He was skilled at billiards and dominoes, adroit in the use of arms, of unquestionable courage and fierceness. Mr. Jones of England was afraid of M. de Castillonnes, and cowered before his scowls and sarcasms. Captain Blackball, the other English aide-de-camp of the Duchesse d'Ivry, a warrior of undoubted courage, who had been [...] "on the ground" [...] more than once, gave him a wide berth, and wondered what the little beggar meant when he used to say, [...] "Since the days of the Prince Noir, monsieur, my family has been at feud with l'Angleterre!" [...] His family were grocers at Bordeaux, and his father's name was M. Cabasse. He had married a noble in the revolutionary times; and the son at Paris himself himself Victor Cabasse de Castillonnes; then Victor C. de Castillonnes; then M. de Castillonnes. One of the followers of the Black Prince had insulted a lady of the house of Castillonnes, when the English were lords of Guienne; hence our friend's wrath against the Leopard. He had written, and afterwards dramatised a terrific legend describing the circumstances, and the punishment of the Briton by a knight of the Castillonnes family. A more awful coward never existed in a melodrama than that felon English knight. His blanche-fille, of course, died of hopeless love for the conquering Frenchman, her father's murderer. The paper in which the <b>feuilleton</b> appeared died at the sixth number of the story. The theatre of the Boulevard refused the drama; so the author's rage against l'infame Albion was yet unappeased. On beholding Miss Newcome, Victor had fancied a resemblance between her and Agnes de Calverley, the blanche Miss of his novel and drama, and cast an eye of favour upon the young creature. He even composed verses in her honour (for I presume that the [...] "Miss Betti" [...] and the Princess Crimhilde of the poems which he subsequently published, were no other than Miss Newcome, and the Duchess, her rival). He had been one of the lucky gentlemen who had danced with Ethel on the previous evening. On the occasion of the ball, he came to her with a highflown compliment, and a request to be once more allowed to waltz with her--a request to which he expected a favourable answer, thinking, no doubt, that his wit, his powers of conversation, and the amour qui flambait dans son regard, had had their effect upon the charming Meess. Perhaps he had a copy of the very verses in his breast-pocket, with which he intended to complete his work of fascination. For her sake alone, he had been heard to say that he would enter into a truce with England, and forget the hereditary wrongs of his race.|$|E
6000|$|The 'Siècle' has for a <b>feuilleton</b> a new {{romance of}} Soulié's, called 'Saturnin Fichet,' {{which is really}} not good, and {{tiresome}} to boot. Robert and I began by each of us reading it, but after a little while he left me alone, being certain that no good could come of such a work. So, of course, ever since, I have been exclaiming and exclaiming as to the wonderful improvement and increasing beauty and glory of it, just to justify myself, and to make him sorry for not having persevered! The truth is, however, that but for obstinacy I should give up too. Deplorably dull the story is, {{and there is a}} crowd of people each more indifferent than each, to you; the pith of the plot being (very characteristically) that the hero has somebody exactly like him. To the reader, it's all one in every sense--who's who, and what's what. Robert is a warm admirer of Balzac and has read most of his books, but certainly--oh certainly--he does not in a general way appreciate our French people quite with our warmth; he takes too high a standard, I tell him, and won't listen to a story for a story's sake. I can bear to be amused, you know without a strong pull on my admiration. So we have great wars sometimes, and I put up Dumas' flag, or Soulié's, or Eugène Sue's (yet he was properly possessed by the 'Mystères de Paris') and carry it till my arms ache. The plays and vaudevilles he knows far more of than I do, and always maintains they are the happiest growth of the French school--setting aside the masters, observe--for Balzac and George Sand hold all their honours; and, before your letter came, he had told me about the 'Kean' and the other dramas. Then we read together the other day the 'Rouge et Noir,' that powerful book of Stendhal's (Beyle), and he thought it very striking, and observed--what I had thought from the first and again and again--that it was exactly like Balzac in the raw, in the material and undeveloped conception. What a book it is really, and so full of pain and bitterness, and the gall of iniquity! The new Dumas I shall see in time, perhaps, and it is curious that Robert had just been telling me the very story you speak of in your letter, from the 'Causes Célèbres.' I never read it--the more shame! Dearest friend, all this talk of French books and no talk about you--the most shame! You don't tell me enough of yourself, and I want to hear, because (besides the usual course of reasons) Mr. Chorley spoke of you as if you were not as cheerful as usual; do tell me. Ah! if you fancy that I do not love you as near, through being so far, you are unjust to me as you never were before. For myself, the brightness round me has had a cloud on it lately by an illness of poor Wilson's.... She would not go to Dr. Cook till I was terrified one night, while she was undressing me, by her sinking down on the sofa in a shivering fit. Oh, so frightened I was, and Robert ran out for a physician; and I could have shivered too, with the fright. But she is convalescent now, thank God! and in the meanwhile I have acquired a heap of practical philosophy, and have learnt how it is possible (in certain conditions of the human frame) to comb out and twist up one's own hair, and lace one's very own stays, and cause hooks and eyes to meet behind one's very own back, besides making toast and water for Wilson--which last miracle, it is only just to say, was considerably assisted by Robert's counsels 'not quite to set fire to the bread' while one was toasting it. He was the best and kindest all that time, as even he could be, and carried the kettle when it was too heavy for me, and helped me with heart and head. Mr. Chorley could not have praised him too much, be very sure. I, who always rather appreciated him, do set down the thoughts I had as merely unjust things; he exceeds them all, indeed. Yes, Mr. Chorley has been very kind to us. I had a kind note myself from him a few days since, and do you know that we have a sort of hope of seeing him in Italy this year, with dearest Mr. Kenyon, who has the goodness to crown his goodness by a 'dream' of coming to see us? We leave Pisa in April (did I tell you that?) and pass through Florence towards the north of Italy--to Venice, for instance. In the way of writing, I have not done much yet--just finished my rough sketch of an anti-slavery ballad and sent it off to America, where nobody will print it, I am certain, because I could not help making it bitter. If they do print it, I shall thank them more boldly in earnest than I fancy now. Tell me of Mary Howitt's new collection of ballads--are they good? I warmly wish that Mr. Chorley may succeed with his play; but how can Miss Cushman promise a hundred nights for an untried work?... Perhaps you may find the two last numbers of the 'Bells and Pomegranates' less obscure--it seems so to me. Flush has grown an absolute monarch and barks one distracted when he wants a door opened. Robert spoils him, I think. Do think of me as your ever affectionate and grateful ...|$|E
