25|$|It is because, {{a nation}} which shared blood and history is clear, and <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> body can't be another's, {{the reason that}} a certain nation can't become another {{is the same as}} {{brothers}} living in the same house. If two gather and become one, one would be higher and the other lower, so it becomes a basic problem that one orders from above, and the other obeys from below.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different. I was like, [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm {{going to do}} this, I'm going to do that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And I was like [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E
500|$|... "Hey You!" [...] {{was written}} by Gwen Stefani and Kanal, with its {{production}} being handled by Matthew Wilder. The single is produced in D major, with Stefani's vocals ranging from A3–C5, layered {{with the use of}} a piano and guitars. It is a psychedelic rock and alternative rock track, with a genre similar to No Doubt's signature ska punk style. Its lyrics detail a [...] "cynical" [...] female protagonist hoping to get married. Kenneth Partridge, who wrote for both Billboard and The A.V. Club, stated that it has [...] "a neo-psychedelic '60s vibe that wouldn't have sounded out of place on a Bangles record". He went on to discuss the lyrics as [...] "a jaded Gwen gives some tough love to a girl dreaming of a white wedding" [...] in the lines [...] "You're <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> Ken and Barbie doll / Your name will never change". Mike Boehm, writing for the Los Angeles Times, stated that the [...] "canny arangement of Stefani's multitracked voice provide a poppy lift" [...] while Dumont, Kanal, and Young [...] "keep slickness at bay".|$|E
5000|$|Known for his prodigious {{memory that}} allowed him to attend classes without taking notes, in 1930 Handlin entered Brooklyn College at age 15, graduating in 1934, then earning a M.A. from Harvard University in 1935, after which he won a Frederick Sheldon Fellowship for {{research}} in Europe. [...] "I dont know why, Dr. Handlin joked in a 1952 Boston Globe interview. [...] "I guess they <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> face. Traveling in England, Ireland, Italy, and France, he began assembling material that would become his first book Bostons Immigrants, 1790-1865 (1941).|$|R

5000|$|Lisa Donahue, {{the winner}} of Big Brother 3 (U.S.) had once commented in the show, [...] "I can orgasm just from my navel being touched the right way" [...] and later in an {{interview}} had said,"Many ask if I can really orgasm with my navel..well, no I can't....I <b>just</b> really <b>like</b> <b>my</b> navel played with!!".|$|R
500|$|Auditioning actors with no {{theatrical}} experience {{were required}} to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Mays auditioned with the song [...] "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" [...] from The Rocky Horror Show, while Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang [...] "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" [...] of REO Speedwagon's [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling"." [...] Monteith has deemed his casting [...] "spot on" [...] as: [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> character. I've never trained or had any lessons. I can just do it – with some adjustments, obviously." [...] McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously {{been part of the}} group Not Like Them. He auditioned with the song [...] "Let It Be" [...] and tested alongside Colfer and Ushkowitz. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: [...] "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R Even the musical theater stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it." [...] Lynch was originally intended to be a guest star, but became a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through.|$|E
2500|$|Almost as a {{reaction}} to the seemingly endless studio sessions surrounding God's Foot, Hatfield recorded the album Bed in 1998 in six days, about which she says on her website: [...] "It sounds as raw as I felt. It has no pretty sheen. The mistakes and unattractive parts were left in, not erased. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> career. Just like life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Listed as a 6'5" [...] forward/center in 2000, Turner was a 26-year-old rookie with Dungannon. At first, Turner didn't {{know what}} to make of Ireland. He was struck by the locals' {{hospitality}} and intrigued by the country's history, but he was initially unimpressed by the amenities and customs. Turner explained, [...] "I was still on my spoiled American high horse. 'The locker rooms are too small. I’ve got to carry my own bag. We don't practise enough. They want me to coach the local kids when I just want to play.' But when I went back to America for the Christmas break, I realised that I had to take my blinders off or I'd end up <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> friends at home, doing nothing or working in a job they hated." [...] He came to embrace the lifestyle and it showed on and off the court. However, while he was considered 'prolific' and made a significant contribution every game, he often lacked support in offensive situations. In a 92–74 loss to Tralee Tigers in January 2001, Turner had a 49-point effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{she were}} well enough I'd move her," [...] said the woodcutter, [...] "as we can't move them, I suppose. I'd <b>just</b> <b>like</b> to get <b>my</b> chopper into them and feel 'em come {{crashing}} down." ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked quite gay over it, and laughed. [...] "It's nothing," [...] he said, {{grinning}} horribly. [...] "It's a good symptom. I felt <b>just</b> <b>like</b> that myself, <b>my</b> dear fellow, when I {{was beginning}} to recover." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nordeman wrote all ten {{songs from}} the album, with half of it also {{crediting}} Mark Hammond as a co-writer. Nordeman described the album's styles as [...] "piano-based thoughtful, edgy pop." [...] Despite winning the songwriting competition with her song [...] "Why", Nordeman decided not to include it in Wide Eyed, saying, [...] "I <b>just</b> felt <b>like</b> <b>my</b> writing was growing and stretching in new directions, and I was kind of exploring new musical identities. It sounded <b>like</b> <b>my</b> older writing, instead of the directions I was moving towards." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rory Joseph Hennessy, {{portrayed by}} Martin Spanjers, is Cate and Paul's son and their {{youngest}} child. He constantly tattles on his sisters, getting twisted pleasure out of it, as per his remark {{when he had}} stirred the pot to his liking: [...] "This is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> birthday!" [...] Usually he waits until his sisters already commit an infraction, then he tattles to see his father explode. Rory is his father's favorite, being the boy. He becomes involved in money-making schemes with C.J. He is commonly seen playing {{in the living room}} and mentions wanting a monkey, which he once had by trading some of his father's baseball cards; the monkey was later traded for a guitar, which was short-lived, as Rory annoyed the family with it. He also delights in showing his friends the private aspects of his sister Bridget's life, mentioning once that his friends looted Bridget's underwear drawer. Rory was hit hard by Paul's death and ended up punching a hole in his wall out of anger, cutting his hand. He covered for it saying he burnt it taking a casserole out of the oven. After he enters high school, Rory matures, leaving C.J. to be the er of the family. However, Rory still had his moments.|$|E

5000|$|The lead vocal was sung by Brian Wilson {{who thought}} his {{performance}} was inadequate, explaining, [...] "Vocally, I thought I sounded {{a little bit}} weird in my head. That's the one cut off the album I didn't really like that much. But, you know, it's okay, it's {{not a case of}} liking or not liking it; it was an appropriate song, a very, very positive song. I <b>just</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>my</b> voice on that particular song." ...|$|R
500|$|Three {{members of}} the cast {{had never been in}} a film before: Ed Sanders was cast as Toby, Jayne Wisener as Johanna, and Jamie Campbell Bower, who auditioned, and after four days got the part of Anthony said [...] "I think I weed myself. I was out {{shopping}} at the time and I got this call on my mobile. I was <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'OH <b>MY</b> GOD!' Honestly, I was like a little girl running around this shop like oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god." ...|$|R
5000|$|The doctor said, 'OK, let's try {{a little}} current now, and <b>just</b> <b>like</b> that, all these muscles that had been at war with each other {{suddenly}} were at peace.

6000|$|... "I'm {{looking at}} the great big globe, that Uncle Joe said I might touch," [...] said Lucy. [...] "Here are all the names <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> lesson-book at home: Europe, Africa, and America." ...|$|E
6000|$|Out went Tom. Mrs. Brown {{had been}} up, and seen him {{seemingly}} sleeping; then had heard him run downstairs hurriedly. He passed {{her in the}} passage, looking very wild.

6000|$|... "That was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> father," [...] Cuthbert said, admiringly, [...] "he {{always thought}} {{a great deal}} of his county, and I can quite {{understand}} his acting as he did. Well, they were ten pound shares, I think, so it is only five hundred gone at the worst." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, <b>my</b> mind is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> that, and <b>my</b> mind isn't very {{different}} from yours--and so our minds are <b>just</b> <b>like</b> that bird. We pass by what would be of inestimable value to us, and pack our memories with the most trivial odds and ends that never by any chance; under any circumstances whatsoever, could be of the slightest use to any one.|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't know! I {{got sick}} of the songs. When I would play them onstage, I was <b>just</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh <b>my</b> gosh, I can't play these anymore.' And I have to wonder, was that album really who I was? Was I just experimenting with sounds? I think I wanted to try {{something}} more R&B, but when I tried that, it wasn't really me. And so with this album Demi, I'm so excited to play new music rather than getting tired of the songs".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, girl, are you happy?" [...] The girl {{stopped and}} tried to {{disengage}} her arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face. Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm. [...] "When the unhappy meet, they walk together. Come on! You are <b>just</b> a little <b>like</b> <b>my</b> wife. Will you have a drink?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's him, right enough, dear," [...] she said. [...] "I {{could tell}} him among a thousand. Why, the Moore hand alone would be quite enough to know him by.

6000|$|... "I didn't say so--it was Dermot!" [...] {{said the}} naughty child, {{with a little}} arch pout; [...] "he says it is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> uncle to be taken with a little worship from--well, he is your nephew, Lucy, so I will be politer than Dermot, who does rage because he says Mr. Alison has not even sense {{to see that he}} is dressed in his cousin's plumes." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album is}} named Walk with Me {{as a tribute}} to the journey which she has taken over the course of her career: [...] "I <b>just</b> feel <b>like</b> <b>my</b> life and my career has been a journey and I’ve always felt that I’ve been lucky enough to have people just be there for me. It’s also an {{invitation}} for anyone who has never bought a Jamelia record to have a listen to it." [...] And most of all she failed in bear grills and doesn't stop talking about her kids ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' {{said the}} dealer, 'be it so. You are an old {{customer}} after all; and if, as you say, {{you have the}} chance of a good marriage, far be it from me to be an obstacle.

5000|$|... "The flames, {{sometimes}} {{as high as}} 20 metres ... were so bright {{that there was no}} need for my family to switch on any lighting in the evening for months. <b>Just</b> <b>like</b> many of <b>my</b> fellow villagers, I moved my bed in an effort to hide myself away from the light pollution, or I would never be able to sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here they are, your honour. They are <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> own. Loose coats, rough breeches, white {{stockings}} and buckled shoes, and soft hats with wide brims. I {{thought that you}} would pass better, like that, {{than in any other}} way; for if you were dressed up as citizens, your tongues might betray you, for somehow they don't speak English as we do; and whenever I open my mouth, they discover that I am an Irishman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Inez hates him," [...] Gerald Burke said. [...] "It is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> ill luck, {{that instead}} of being drowned {{as most of the}} others were, he has had the luck to get safely back again. However, he is still ill, and likely to be so for some time. He was not so {{accustomed}} to starving as some of us, and he suffered accordingly. He is down at his estates near Seville." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gladys is <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> own child," [...] she continued, {{turning away}} {{her face with}} the pretense of forcing a {{protruding}} Indian basket into the trunk. [...] "We are so disappointed to miss the matinée," [...] she said, with her face still in profile. [...] "Sid begged to stay until to-morrow, just to see Mariposilla dance, but I persuaded him {{that it would be}} brutal to neglect Gladys one moment longer than the necessary time for our miserable journey." ...|$|E
