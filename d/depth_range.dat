5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend <b>depth</b> <b>range,</b> and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{specimens}} of the dwarf sawtail catshark have been collected, {{and a lack}} of data has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list this species as Data Deficient.

25|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} Springer's sawtail {{catshark}} under Data Deficient, {{as there is}} little information on fishery activities within its geographic and <b>depth</b> <b>range.</b> Given its restricted range, it may be negatively affected by any expansion of deepwater fisheries in the region. It is occasionally caught in bottom trawls.|$|E
25|$|Deep {{open circuit}} {{technical}} dives {{may require a}} combination of bottom gas, travel gas and two or more different decompression gases, which poses {{a challenge to the}} diver of how to carry them all and use them correctly, as misuse of a gas in an inappropriate <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> can lead to hypoxia or oxygen toxicity, and will also affect decompression obligations.|$|E
25|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{currently}} lacks sufficient {{information to}} assess the conservation status of the yellow shovelnose stingaree. The species faces little fishing pressure, as the <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> it occupies lies largely between the operating depths of coastal prawn fisheries and the small-scale Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery. It would potentially benefit from {{the implementation of the}} 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E

25|$|Darwin {{predicted}} that underneath each lagoon {{would be a}} bed rock base, {{the remains of the}} original volcano. Subsequent drilling proved this correct. Darwin's theory followed from his understanding that coral polyps thrive in the clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited <b>depth</b> <b>range,</b> starting just below low tide. Where the level of the underlying earth allows, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef.|$|E
25|$|The species prefers silty {{and muddy}} {{substrates}} in the deeper water of bays, but also inhabits deep sandy areas, with {{a study by}} Burchmore et al. suggesting a seasonal move between these two substrates in Botany Bay, New South Wales. They are frequently found in the mouths of rivers, estuaries, coastal lakes and mangrove creeks. It is known from a <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> of 0 to 50 m. The juveniles are most abundant in estuaries and shallow water during the summer months, where they occupy sand and seagrass beds before moving into deeper water as they mature.|$|E
25|$|After {{working out}} various {{logistical}} and engineering {{problems related to}} the development of a more sophisticated drilling rig, drilling to bedrock at Dye 3 began in the summer of 1979 using a new Danish electro-mechanical ice drill yielding a 10.2cm diameter core. From July to August 1979 using ISTUK, 273 m of core was removed. At the end of the 1980 field season ISTUK had gnawed down to 901 m. In 1981 at a depth of 1785 m dust and conductivity measurements indicated the beginning of ice from the last glaciation. Coring continued and on August 10, 1981, bedrock was reached at a depth of 2038 m. The <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> for the Danish drill was 80–2038 m.|$|E

25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E

500|$|Over a <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> {{known as}} the brittle ice zone, bubbles of air are trapped in the ice under great pressure. [...] When the core is brought to the surface, the bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds the tensile {{strength}} of the ice, resulting in cracks and spall.

Off West Africa, it occurs at depths of , where the temperature is 1116°C (5261°F), the salinity is 36 ppt, and the dissolved oxygen level is 1.81 ml/l.

500|$|Surface {{displacement}} {{during the}} earthquake {{was measured using}} SAR interferometry. The computed area of uplift is elongated W-E, with a maximum value of about [...] centered over {{the eastern end of}} the Latif anticline. A smaller area of subsidence was observed to the south of the uplifted area, and the lack of a sharp boundary between the two suggests that the fault does not come to the surface. The pattern of displacement is consistent with a north-dipping fault rupturing between about [...] and [...] in depth, which also provides a good match to the results of seismic modeling using body waves, although a SSE-dipping plane remains possible. This <b>depth</b> <b>range</b> strongly suggests that the fault affected {{the lower part of the}} sedimentary cover, while not ruling out some basement involvement. The mismatch between the orientation of the fault planes that caused the earthquake and the observed surface folds suggests that deformation at these two levels is decoupled by the presence of a detachment, possibly within marl layers.|$|E
