5|$|Research is {{important}} in 4X games because technological progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or <b>greater</b> <b>numbers,</b> with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, Mandela {{had become}} a Class A prisoner, which allowed him <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> of visits and letters. He corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu. That year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled to London, but {{remained}} unpublished at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and his LLB study privileges were revoked for four years. Instead, he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities permitted him to resume his LLB degree studies in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009 a {{trial was}} {{undertaken}} {{to turn off}} traffic lights in Portishead. It was conducted in association with North Somerset Council, Martin Cassini and Colin Buchanan.

The Spitfire was built in many variants, using several wing configurations, and was produced in <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> than any other British aircraft. It was also the only British fighter to be in continuous production throughout the war. The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts; about 54 remain airworthy, while many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world.|$|E

Most Southern Rhodesian servicewomen served domestically within these organisations, while some went to East Africa with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry.|$|E

Estimates of Indonesian deaths in fighting range from 45,000 to 100,000 and civilian dead exceeded 25,000 {{and may have been}} as high as 100,000. A total of 1,200 British soldiers were killed or went missing in Java and Sumatra in 1945 and 1946, most of them Indian soldiers. More than 5,000 Dutch soldiers lost their lives in Indonesia between 1945 and 1949. Many Japanese died; in Bandung alone, 1,057 died, only half of whom died in actual combat, the rest killed in rampages by Indonesians. Seven million people were displaced on Java and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused {{more and more on}} the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in <b>greater</b> <b>numbers.</b> In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in <b>greater</b> <b>numbers.</b> Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in <b>greater</b> <b>numbers.</b> During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people {{in the windows of}} nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E
5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E

5|$|The T-26 {{tank was}} a Soviet light {{infantry}} tank used during many conflicts of the 1930s and in World War II. It was a {{development of the}} British Vickers 6-Ton tank {{and was one of}} the most successful tank designs of the 1930s until its light armour became vulnerable to newer anti-tank guns. It was produced in <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> than any other tank of the period, with more than 11,000 units manufactured. During the 1930s, the USSR developed 53 variants of the T-26, including flame-throwing tanks, combat engineer vehicles, remotely controlled tanks, self-propelled guns, artillery tractors, and armoured carriers. Twenty-three of these were series-produced, others were experimental models.|$|E
5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> of barbarian-born troops than {{the army of}} the Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's effectiveness and was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. As discussed above, proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in mind that probably about three-quarters of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born. This section considers proposition (2).|$|E
5|$|The role of cavalry in {{the late}} army {{does not appear to}} have been greatly {{enhanced}} as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2ndcentury and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. However, the cavalry of the Late Roman army was endowed with <b>greater</b> <b>numbers</b> of specialised units, such as extra-heavy shock cavalry (cataphractii and clibanarii) and mounted archers. During the later 4thcentury, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence.|$|E
