In that year the M-X project was begun, {{which resulted in the}} development of the LGM-118 Peacekeeper. The Peacekeeper entered service in the mid-1980s and served until 2005; the Minuteman III is still in service, and has outlasted both of its planned replacements.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila melanogaster, the zebrafish, the chicken and the house mouse, serve {{a major role in}} science as {{experimental}} models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.|$|E
5|$|As China {{entered the}} early modern period, the I Ching took on renewed {{relevance}} in both Confucian and Daoist study. The Kangxi Emperor was especially fond of the I Ching and ordered new interpretations of it.

5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, Burston visited South East Asia Command, {{and then}} {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, where he ratified {{a series of}} agreements on the exchange of information regarding the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> drugs, and for the funding of research scholarships by the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Corporation of New York. He was returning to Australia when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Research {{organizations}} {{include the}} International Rice Research Institute, an international independent {{research and training}} organization established in 1960 with headquarters in Los Baños, Laguna, focusing on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> rice varieties and rice crop management techniques to help farmers in the country improve their lives. The Philippines bought its first satellite in 1996. In 2016, the Philippines first micro-satellite, Diwata-1 was launched aboard the US Cygnus spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Sabermetrics {{refers to}} the field of {{baseball}} statistical study and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).|$|E
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about six years to bloom.|$|E
5|$|Stanley also planned {{extensions}} of the existing Underground Group's lines into new, undeveloped districts beyond the central area to encourage the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> suburbs and new commuter traffic. The first of the extensions, the Bakerloo line to Queen's Park and Watford Junction, opened between 1915 and 1917. The other expansion plans were postponed during World War I.|$|E

50|$|Cyprodenate (Actebral) is a {{stimulant}} drug. It {{was used}} for counteracting the effects of benzodiazepine tranquillizer drugs before the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> antidotes such as flumazenil.

5|$|The Atharvaveda credits {{him of the}} {{invention}} of ploughing and thus, agriculture. He is also described as one who flattened the Earth's rocky surface, thus encouraging agriculture, cattle-breeding, commerce and <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cities on earth. In a hymn in Rigveda, Prithu {{is described as a}} rishi (seer). D. R.

5|$|Yet if the Benedictine reforms {{dominate}} the sources from this period, their wider impact {{should not be}} overstressed: large areas of England were affected only minimally, if at all.
