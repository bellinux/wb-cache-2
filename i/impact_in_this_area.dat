It discusses the main approaches to and diagnoses of problem estates, including the failure of the welfare state, the absence of enterprise, the failure of housing management, ‘housing is not enough’ and ‘effort fragmentation’, and provides an evaluation of the impacts of the main programmes, based mainly on the results of official evaluations. The paper notes the difficulties in making assessments of <b>impacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> due to data shortcomings, but concludes that over 20 years of policies and programmes did not resolve the complex problems of these estates, nor reposition council-built estates {{from the bottom of the}} residential hierarchy. It suggests the reason for this failure was partly that the macro-economic climate and other government policies were countervailing, but also that policy lacked both clear goals and a good understanding of the problems to be faced. It also notes that housing improvements were often compromised by the failure to deal with wider problems. The paper argues that recent policy shows more promise, and seeks to better integrate mainstream spending programmes with area initiatives, although there is little evidence yet on how this is really working...|$|R

40|$|This {{briefing}} paper summarises {{the findings}} from research carried out by Ecorys (formerly ECOTEC) and Loughborough University. The study set out to examine children and young people's roles in planning, design and regeneration in the UK and internationally; to map and assess different models of practice, and to locate these practices within wider debates about children's participation and citizenship. It also aimed to review the methods used to measure <b>impact</b> and outcomes <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area.</b> The work was carried out between June 2010 and January 2011, and funded through the 2010 - 11 Round of the Ecorys Research Programme 1. The methodology comprised a review of UK and international research literature, adopting the principles of a Rapid Evidence Assessment (REA) 2; an analysis of selected UK policy and strategy documents, and {{a small number of}} exploratory stakeholder interviews. The research team was supported by an Advisory Group with representatives from policy and academia. The report concludes that the spatial aspects of children's participation crosscut the wider participation agenda, but have too often been overlooked within a service-driven approach to policymaking. There is evidence from research and practice that children and young people can play a significant role within planning and regeneration processes, with potential benefits at individual, peer group and community levels. A stronger evidence base is clearly needed to understand the longer-term <b>impacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area.</b> The recent change in government and emerging policies present both opportunities and challenges for children and young people's participation within the UK. There has been a renewed focus on citizenship of sorts, whilst the Localism agenda and Big Society place an emphasis on municipal leadership, which is a characteristic feature of many rights-based programmes worldwide. However, public sector funding cuts, coupled with the dismantlement of the national planning framework arguably run the risk of leaving children more vulnerable to exclusion from local planning decisions that affect their lives. The authors argue that developing a more outward-facing approach, and engaging with the various transnational networks of good practice that have been established around the CRC agenda should be a priority...|$|R

Two landscape units (LU) were outlined adjacent to a more than 50 -year-old artificial reservoir, of which one (LU 1) had a low and the second (LU 2) a high human impact. In total, we found 20 plant species. Only two species were common to UP 1 and UP 2. The species diversity in LU 1 (n= 18) was greater than in LU 2 (n= 4), and plant distribution more even. Phosphorus, potassium, organic matter, calcium, and magnesium contents were lower in LU 2.

40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} {{studies of}} tree {{growth in the}} Iberian Peninsula reported contrasting positive and negative effects of temperature in Mediterranean angiosperms and conifers. Here we review the different hypotheses that may explain these trends and propose that the observed contrasting responses of tree growth to temperature <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region could {{be associated with a}} continuum of trait differences between angiosperms and conifers. Angiosperm and conifer trees differ in the effects of phenology in their productivity, in their growth allometry, and in their sensitivity to competition. Moreover, angiosperms and conifers significantly differ in hydraulic safety margins, sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), xylem recovery capacity or the rate of carbon transfer. These differences could be explained by key features of the xylem such as non-structural carbohydrate content (NSC), wood parenchymal fraction or wood capacitance. We suggest that the reviewed trait differences define two contrasting ecophysiological strategies that may determine qualitatively different growth responses to increased temperature and drought. Improved reciprocal common garden experiments along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients would be key to quantify the relative importance of the different hypotheses reviewed. Finally, we show that warming <b>impacts</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> occur <b>in</b> an ecological context characterized by the advance of forest succession and increased dominance of angiosperm trees over extensive <b>areas.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> context, we examined the empirical relationships between the responses of tree growth to temperature and hydraulic safety margins in angiosperm and coniferous trees.

40|$|For {{users to}} be able to compare {{performance}} of different switches, {{it is important to have}} a common set of metrics. Examples of several such metrics and their measurements are presented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> paper. These measurements and metrics have <b>impacted</b> standardization efforts <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area.</b> The key distinguishing feature of our effort is its emphasis on frame-level metrics (rather than cell-level metrics of the past). <b>In</b> particular, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> paper, we present definitions, methodologies, and measured results for frame latency, throughput, and maximum frame burst size (MFBS). 1...|$|R
50|$|Solutions {{to reduce}} the effect of motion and weather are {{addressed}} in the design, which must be capable of withstanding - and even reducing - the <b>impact</b> of waves. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> technological development has been mainly evolutionary rather than revolutionary, leveraging and adapting technologies that are currently applied to offshore oil production or onshore liquefaction. For example, traditional LNG loading arms have been adapted to enable LNG transfers in open water, and hose-based solutions for both side-by-side transfers in calmer seas and tandem transfers in rougher conditions are nearing fruition.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{report on the}} results of a study of the {{application}} of advanced digital data acquisition technology to the problem of <b>impact</b> damage <b>in</b> composites. <b>This</b> <b>area</b> was chosen for the study because of the importance of developing better damage characterization methods and the limited scope of the damage itself. Low energy impacts on composite specimens typically produce very small indentations at the impact site and internal delaminations at the interfaces between lamina. Thus, one can very accurately set the ultrasonic time gates for imaging the delaminations on a layer-by-layer basis...|$|R
