40|$|International audienceA {{statistical}} analysis is conducted on sequential (10 - 12) -(10 - 12) <b>double</b> extension <b>twinning</b> in a Mg AZ 31 alloy obtained after two mutually perpendicular successive compressions. Indeed, primary twins form {{during the first}} compression, which produce secondary twins during the second compression. Here, ``sequential double twinning'' is adopted to describe this twinning mechanism, which is different from classic <b>double</b> <b>twinning</b> obtained during monotonic loading. <b>Double</b> extension <b>twins,</b> no matter sequential or classic ones, can be classified into Groups I-IV according to their misorientations {{with respect to the}} parent grain. In the present study, the majority of the sequential <b>double</b> extension <b>twins</b> have relatively high Schmid factors (SFs) and a misorientation of 60 degrees with respect to the parent grain (Group III). However, the classical SF based analysis fails to explain why secondary twin variants in Group III are preferred over their nearest orientated neighbors in Group IV, since their SF differences are negligible. Therefore, a static double inclusion model is developed to analytically compute the elastic energy in a final configuration of sequential <b>double</b> <b>twinning.</b> The model well explains the predominance of secondary twins in Group III by a noticeable greater decrease of free energy after secondary twinning...|$|R

40|$|Segregation at {{a triple}} {{junction}} of grain boundaries {{has not been}} explained much because {{the structure of a}} triple junction is very complicated. The present paper describes Monte Carlo simulations by which Y segregation was investigated at a triple junction of a { 101 ¯ 1 }–{ 101 ¯ 2 } <b>double</b> <b>twin</b> in Mg. Y atoms segregated at the extension sites in the { 101 ¯ 1 } and { 101 ¯ 2 } twin boundaries. However, they were not necessarily more segregated at the triple junction of the <b>double</b> <b>twin,</b> although the free volumes at the extension sites of the triple junction were larger on average than those of the other boundaries. Thus, the Y segregation behavior at the triple junction cannot be explained only by the free volume. The anisotropic factor of the atomic Voronoi polyhedron was developed to explain the Y segregation behavior at the triple junction. In addition, the shortest interatomic distance and coordination number affected Y segregation at the triple junction. Also, segregation at the triple junction strongly depended on the Y concentration, which resulted from variations in the local atomic configuration. Thus, the Y segregation behavior at the triple junction was complicated, in contrast to those at twin boundaries, even when the size effect was predominant...|$|E

To investigate deformation behavior of magnesium single crystals by non-basal slips and twins, c-axis compression and a-axis tension tests were performed {{in the range of}} 77 K- 573 K. The crystals were yielded by second order pyramidal slip, and the yield stress shows anomalous temperature dependence (increased with increasing temperature) between 203 K and 293 K. Yield stress of c-axis compression was bigger than that of a-axis tensile.

40|$|The {{formability}} {{and mechanical}} properties of Mg alloys are {{strongly related to}} the crystallographic basal texture. Deformation twins form extensively after mechanical processing. Recrystallized grains originating from twins usually randomize the texture and therefore weaken the strong deformed texture.

This work shows that the recrystallization volume fraction formed within twins has been completely underestimated. Specifically, recrystallized grains originating from <b>double</b> <b>twins</b> make the main contribution to texture modification, which contrasts to the opposite view that has been reported in the past decades.

40|$|A calorimetric {{method for}} the study of solid-vapor {{interactions}} is described. In one calorimetric chamber a vapor evaporates; in a second calorimetric chamber the vapor is absorbed by a sample. The two chambers are connected by a tube and form part of a <b>double</b> <b>twin</b> microcalorimeter. As vapor is sorbed by the sample the vapor pressure in the sorption chamber will increase from a low value to near saturation. The flow rate of the vapor is governed by diffusion through the tube between the vessels. From the thermal power measured in the vaporization calorimeter it is possible to evaluate the sorption isotherm, and using information from both calorimeters the heat of sorption may be calculated as a function of equilibrium vapor pressure. By conducting experiments with different sized samples it is also possible to study the kinetics of the sorption process.

The ad hoc performed theoretical analysis and atomic simulations allow to interpret the objects as 10 ¯ 12 - 10 ¯ 12 double twins formed by the simultaneous action of two twinning shears with completely re-twinned volume of primary twin.

40|$|The inlet vortex {{phenomenon}} was experimentally {{investigated in}} a water tunnel, using hydrogen bubble flow visualization techniques. Several inlet ambient flow combinations were studied, including an inlet and ground plane configuration in a known shear {{as well as an}} irrotational flow, and a <b>double</b> (<b>twin)</b> inlet configuration in an irrotational flow. This latter situation created a boundary layer free analogue of the ground plane and enabled investigation of inlet vortex formation in flow essentially free of ambient vorticity. The three dimensional inlet flow field and the vortex formation mechanisms were determined by marking material lines and observing their path and deformation as they are convected from a far upstream location into the inlet. Two basic mechanisms of inlet vortex generation were found. For flows possessing a vertical component of ambient vorticity, the amplification of this vorticity as the vortex lines are stretched and drawn into the inlet results in the formation of an inlet vortex. However, an inlet vortex does not require the presence of ambient vorticity to form. It can also be created in an irrotational flow, with an inlet in crosswind. In this situation, it is accompanied by a variation in circulation along the axial length of the inlet. The ratio of inlet velocity to upstream velocity is an important parameter in determining the generation of an inlet vortex for both mechanisms.

The nanocrystals were formed after heat treatment at high temperature of a sputtered 10 nm thick silicon rich oxide on 3 nm SiO$_ 2 $ layer made by Rapid Thermal Oxidation (RTO) of silicon. Nanocrystals precipitate when the excess silicon concentration exceeds 50 area %. Below this percentage amorphous silicon nanoclusters were found. In-situ heat treatment of the samples in the TEM showed that the crystallization requires a temperature above 800 $^o$C. The nanocrystals precipitate in a 4 nm band, 5 nm from the Si substrate and 4 nm from the SiO$_ 2 $ sample surface. The silicon nucleates where the excess Si concentration is the highest. The top surface has less excess Si due to reaction with oxygen from the ambient during annealing. The SiO$_ 2 $-RTO layer is more Si rich due to Si diffusion from the SiO$_ 2 $-Si layer into RTO.

40|$|In this review, we {{summarize}} {{a series}} of experimental studies of the swelling of zwitterionic lamellar phospholipid and phospholipid-cholesterol systems using a novel <b>double</b> <b>twin</b> calorimeter. With this method, one can obtain simultaneous measures of the partial molar free energy and the partial molar enthalpy, and the experimental studies thus provide a complete thermodynamic characterization of the isothermal swelling process. A major finding is that the swelling of lamellar zwitterionic phospholipid systems at higher water contents (> 4 water molecules per lipid) is endothermic. The enthalpy has the opposite sign relative to the free energy, thus demonstrating that the swelling process is entropy driven. The water uptake also triggers a transition from a gel to a liquid crystalline state showing that, at given water content, the swelling pressure is much higher in the liquid crystal than in the gel. When cholesterol {{is added to the}} system the liquid ordered phase is formed at all available water contents. In this phase the swelling pressure varies smoothly and takes relatively low values at water contents below two per phospholipid, while it is substantially higher than in the gel phase at higher water contents. Together, these data demonstrate that the swelling pressure is sensitive to the phase state of the lipids. We also describe {{a series of}} studies that demonstrate that the addition of a second polar solute to the phospholipid-water system has a remarkably small effect on the swelling behavior when analyzed with respect to solvent volume. The reviewed experimental studies provide a thermodynamic characterization of the swelling of lamellar zwitterionic phospholipid systems that should be encompassed in the mechanistic molecular interpretation of the "hydration force. ...|$|E

The results show nucleation sites, such as <b>double</b> <b>twins,</b> can weaken the deformed texture {{and for the}} first time provide direct evidence that recrystallised grains originating from <b>double</b> <b>twins</b> can form the rare earth texture during annealing. Precipitation and recrystallisation occurred concurrently during most of the annealing period, with precipitates forming preferentially along prior grain and twin boundaries.
