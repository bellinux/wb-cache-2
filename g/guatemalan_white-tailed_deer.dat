40|$|Cattle {{persistently}} infected (PI) with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus in {{the family}} Flaviviridae, are {{an important source of}} viral transmission to susceptible hosts. Persistent BVDV infections have been identified in <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus), the most abundant free-ranging ruminant in North America. As PI deer shed BVDV similarly to PI cattle, maintenance of BVDV within <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> populations may be possible. To date, intraspecific transmission of BVDV in <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> has not been evaluated, which prompted this study. Six pregnant <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> were captured in the first trimester of pregnancy and cohabitated with a PI <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Cohabitation with the PI deer resulted in BVDV infection in all does, as indicated by seroconversion.

We collected hunter-harvest data for 1, 731 <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> from DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa from 2003 to 2010. We used linear mixed-effects models and information theoretic methods to estimate effects of density of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> and proportion of total landcover area converted from cropland to cool- or warm-season grassland on body mass of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Density of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge ranged from 36. 5 to 50. 6 deer/km 2, {{and the proportion of}} landcover at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge that remained cropland each year ranged from 14. 9 to 23. 2 %. Body mass was inversely related to population density (21. 4 kg/ 5. 5 deer/km 2) and proportion of cropland (21. 3 kg/ 3. 1 % conversion of total land area from cropland to grassland). We used auxiliary harvest data collected at Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge to validate our models and found our models performed well.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{reviewed}} the literature reporting negative or {{positive effects on}} vegetation of herbivory by caribou/reindeer, moose, and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> {{in light of the}} hypothesis of exploitation ecosystems (EEH), which predicts that most of the negative impacts will occur in areas where wolves were extirpated. We were able to list 197 plant taxa negatively affected by the three cervid species, as opposed to 24 that benefited from their herbivory. The plant taxa negatively affected by caribou/reindeer (19), moose (37), and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (141) comprised 5 %, 9 %, and 11 % of vascular plants present in their respective ranges. Each cervid affected mostly species eaten during the growing season: lichens and woody species for caribou/reindeer, woody species and aquatics for moose, and herbs and woody species for <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> <b>White-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> were the only deer reported to feed on threatened or endangered plants. Studies related to damage caused by caribou/reindeer were scarce and often concerned lichens. Most reports for moose and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> came from areas where wolves were absent or rare. Among the three cervids, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> might damage the most vegetation because of its smaller size and preference for herbs...|$|R
5000|$|M. bovis {{infections in}} cattle herds in the United States is not common. M. bovis is endemic in <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus) {{in the northeastern}} portion of Michigan and {{northern}} Minnesota, and sporadic import of the disease from Mexico. Only the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> has been confirmed as a maintenance host in the Michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis, although other mammals such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and coyotes (Canis latrans) can serve as spill-over and dead-end hosts. [...] The fact that <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> are a maintenance host for M. bovis remains a significant barrier to the US nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock. In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters harvested approximately 489,922 <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> in attempts to control the disease spread. These hunters purchased more than 1.5 million deer harvest tags. The economic value of deer hunting to Michigan’s economy in the drive to eradicate TB is substantial.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. By direct sequence analysis of the mammalian zinc-finger Y (Zfy) gene, interspecific and intraspecific variations were documented in a Y-chromosomal locus in North American deer. The evolutionary history of paternal lineages was distinctly different from maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). It was hypothesized that introgressive hybridization resulted in the introduction of mtDNA from <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus) into the mule deer (O. hemionus) population, but this introgression did not involve the nuclear Ychromosomes. Sequence divergences of Zfy for <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer,</b> mule deer, and black-tailed deer (also 0. hemionus) were consistent with traditional taxonomy with black-tailed and mule deer being more closely related to each other than either is to <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Conversely, mule <b>deer</b> and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> share mtDNA haplotypes that are quite distinct from that of black-tailed deer. Sequence data (Zfy) were used to determine a diagnostic restriction site which could distinguish between the Y-chromosomes of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> and mule deer. The restriction enzyme MseI created restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) which were assayed to determine-nine paternal origin. Two individuals from within the Trans-Pecos contact zone were diagnosed as hybrids. Additionally, an offspring derived from the controlled mating of a female mule deer and a male <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> possessed the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> RFLP pattern as expected...|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b sequences identified four major mtDNA genotype assemblages among populations of Odocoileus in western North America. These assemblages correspond to northwestern black-tailed deer, southwestern mule deer, northwestern mule <b>deer,</b> and southwestern <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Approximate times ofthe divergence of these assemblages, calculated {{on the basis}} of pairwise nucleotide sequence divergence estimates, were used to construct a model of Odocoileus evolution in western North America. According to this model, black-tailed deer represent the ancestral Odocoileus mtDNA lineage. Mule <b>deer</b> and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> diverged more recently in palaeontologicai history. The southwestern <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> mtDNA genotype assemblage is more closely related to the mule deer mtDNA assemblages than it is to the southeastern <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> lineage. This suggests that the southwestern <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> mtDNA lineage may have been effectively replaced by mule deer mtDNA through relatively recent hybridization between the two species. [...] Microgeographic {{analysis of}} deer from southern Alberta revealed a considerable degree of geographic structuring of mtDNA sequence genotypes, as did qualitative analysis of the geographic distribution of mule <b>deer</b> and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> mtDNA genotypes in California and Alberta.

50|$|Central American <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> prefer {{tropical}} and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, seasonal mixed deciduous forests, savanna, {{and adjacent}} wetland habitats over dense tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. South American subspecies of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> live in {{two types of}} environments. The first type, similar to the Central American deer, consists of savannas, dry deciduous forests, and riparian corridors that cover much of Venezuela and eastern Colombia. The other type is the higher elevation mountain grassland/mixed forest ecozones in the Andes Mountains, from Venezuela to Peru. The Andean <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> seem to retain gray coats due to the colder weather at high altitudes, whereas the lowland savanna forms retain the reddish brown coats.

50|$|Although {{most often}} thought of as forest animals {{depending}} on relatively small openings and edges, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> can equally adapt themselves to life in more open prairie, savanna woodlands, and sage communities as in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico.

Also, a noticeable difference exists in size {{between male and female}} deer of the savannas. The Texas <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (O. v. texanus), of the prairies and oak savannas of Texas and parts of Mexico, are the largest savanna-adapted deer in the Southwest, with impressive antlers that might rival deer found in Canada and the northern United States.

40|$|Current {{research}} {{is necessary to}} focus management of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus virginianus) in the agricultural Midwest, especially given the novel presence of chronic wasting disease in the region. My objectives were to: 1) examine the potential effects of weather and row-crop harvest on daily harvest of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> by archery, and individual hunter variables (e. g., age, weapon preference, preference of hunting method) on individual hunter efficiency and success in 2 regions of Illinois (i. e., east-central and southern Illinois); 2) estimate <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> densities using direct (i. e., spotlighting deer from road transects) and indirect (i. e., counting pellet groups on randomly-placed transects) techniques across 3 study areas in the midwestern U. S.; 3) quantify sex, age, and season-specific survival and dispersal rates of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> in east-central Illinois; and 4) assess habitat selection of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> {{during the summer months}} in east-central Illinois. Knowledge of factors affecting hunter efficiency and success is vital given current trends in hunter attitudes and behaviors that are leading to a reduction in the efficacy of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> hunting as a population management tool nationwide. Numerous techniques of density estimation for <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> have been developed, including aerial surveys, mark-recapture or resight methods, pellet counts, and thermal infrared imaging surveys. Distance sampling has shown great potential for estimating <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> density at a reduced cost relative to traditional survey techniques and may be useful within the agriculturally-dominated Midwest. Survival and dispersal rates are pertinent model parameters when examining chronic wasting disease (CWD) geographic spread. Structural changes in agricultural landscapes are frequent (i. e., temporally) and ecologically abrupt (i. e., spatially) due to crop harvest and rotation and human development. Providing sex-specific data on site selection would benefit agencies and private land owners by allowing compartmental focus for selective management strategies for either male or female <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer.</b> Following the 2006 hunting season, I queried <b>white-tailed</b> <b>deer</b> hunters regarding factors potentially affecting hunter efficiency and success in east-central and southern Illinois using a mail-in survey (n = 2, 000).
