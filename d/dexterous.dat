We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the <b>dexterous</b> application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
5|$|Stricken {{from the}} naval {{register}} on 2 August 1947, the ship remained as a training vessel until August 1951, {{when she was}} sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. After preparing from 5 to 18 September, São Paulo was given an eight-man caretaker crew and taken under tow by two tugs, <b>Dexterous</b> and Bustler, in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to Greenock and the breakers. When north of the Azores in early November, the two lines snapped during a strong storm. American B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and British planes were launched to scour the Atlantic for the missing ship. The ship was reported as found on the 15th, but this proved to be false. The search was ended on 10 December without finding São Paulo or her crew.|$|E

25|$|The new pope, Pius III, {{supported}} Cesare Borgia and reconfirmed him as Gonfalonier; {{but after}} a brief pontificate of twenty-six days he died. Borgia's deadly enemy, Giuliano Della Rovere, then succeeded by <b>dexterous</b> diplomacy in tricking the weakened Cesare Borgia into supporting him by offering him money and continued papal backing for Borgia policies in the Romagna; promises which he disregarded upon election. He was elected as Pope Julius II to the papal dignity by the near-unanimous vote of the cardinals. Realizing his mistake by then, Cesare tried to correct the situation to his favour, but Pope Julius II made sure of its failure at every turn.|$|E
25|$|Opposable thumbs {{are shared}} by some primates, {{including}} most catarrhines. The climbing and suspensory behaviour in orthograde apes, such as chimpanzees, has resulted in elongated hands while the thumb has remained short. As a result, these primates are unable to perform the pad-to-pad grip associated with opposability. However, in pronograde monkeys such as baboons, an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle has led to reduced digit length and thus hand proportions {{similar to those of}} humans. Consequently, these primates have <b>dexterous</b> hands and are able to grasp objects using a pad-to-pad grip. It can thus be difficult to identify hand adaptations to manipulation-related tasks based solely on thumb proportions.|$|E
25|$|Discovery {{carried the}} {{humanoid}} robot Robonaut2 (also known as R2) to the International Space Station (ISS). The microgravity conditions aboard {{the space station}} provide an ideal opportunity for robots like R2 to work with astronauts. Although the robot's primary initial task is teaching engineers how <b>dexterous</b> robots behave in space, it may eventually, through upgrades and advancements, assist spacewalking astronauts to perform scientific work once it has been verified as functional on the space station. It was the first humanoid robot in space, and was stowed on board the Leonardo PMM. Once Robonaut2 was unpacked, it began initial operation inside the Destiny module for operational testing, but over time, both its location and its applications could expand.|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} low weight {{and the fact}} that they had only one control wire per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes {{involving}} movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a [...] "bobbing" [...] action to simulate motion. Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with New Scientist, director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets [...] "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)."

With Richie assumed to have joined the Witness Protection Program, Ralph unofficially usurps control over the Aprile crew, proving to be an exceptionally <b>dexterous</b> earner for the crew. While Ralph's competitive merit would seemingly have him next in line to ascend to capo, his insubordination inclines Tony not to promote him and instead gives the promotion to the unqualified, but complacent, Gigi Cestone, causing much resentment and tension between him and Ralph.

[...] The painting won a prize at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867. At the same time, there were also critical voices; in particular, some American Pre-Raphaelites found his brushwork wanting. One such critic complained {{that it would have been}} better [...] "if the marks of the brush had, by <b>dexterous</b> handling, been made to stand for scrap and fissure, crag and cranny, but as it is, we have only too little geology and too much bristle." ...|$|E
500|$|P.N.03 is {{a science}} fiction-themed third-person shooter, {{released}} in Japan on March 27, 2003. The game features a <b>dexterous</b> protagonist named Vanessa Z. Schneider who battles an army of maverick robots. The game earned the name Jaguar during development due to Vanessa's fluid motions and agility. Acting as director, Mikami attempted to differentiate it from Devil May Cry by adding defensive and evasive maneuvers. This desire, combined with the limited development time, also led to the replacement of Vanessa's guns with energy bolts. Upon its release, reviewers criticized the game's short length and sluggish controls, with an average score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic. Mikami was unsatisfied with the finished product, stating {{he had hoped to}} put [...] "a lot more" [...] time into its development. P.N.03 was the only game of the five that remained a GameCube exclusive.|$|E

The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka thought there were few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design a future that was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and <b>dexterous</b> to reach places where people were trapped.|$|E
500|$|Big Boi's {{lyrics are}} playful and irreverent, with clever wordplay and boasts, while {{incorporating}} non-sequiturs, pop culture references, and tongue-twisters. His rhymes are delivered through a fast, versatile flow and <b>dexterous</b> cadence. Rolling Stones Christian Hoard describes his flow as [...] "inimitably slick and speedy". Amos Barshad of New York notes his lyrics as [...] "playful, but his flow is stern and unpredictable". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker describes the album's mood as [...] "decidedly upbeat" [...] and writes of Big Boi's rapping, [...] "The musical DNA of Sir Lucious {{lies in a}} simple strategy that Big Boi has used for years: he often raps in double time, {{no matter what the}} tempo of the song is. This means that even the slower songs [...] don’t drag—Big Boi uses the space in the beat to provide another rhythm with his words". Frere-Jones describes him as [...] "simultaneously forceful and careful" [...] with his lyrics and compares his rapping technique to [...] "the clatter of a machine, like a lawnmower, where secondary rhythms whisper underneath the main beat [...] Big Boi is never laid-back when he raps: he defines wide-awake".|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. BET writer Dominique Zonyeé {{spoke on the}} track, calling it a [...] "high energy, boastful song in which Azealia struts her stuff while reminding you that competitors have nothing on her". Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound thought that the song had [...] "the potential to a true club banger". Vanyaland writer Michael Marotta described the track as [...] "brooding and menacing", going on to describe Banks' delivery, [...] "Banks slices through her verses {{in a way that}} recalls the magic she first flashed on the still-lethal 2011 track '212'". In a positive review, Chris Thomas from HipHopWired complimented the track, writing [...] "The Harlem native waxes poetics with a <b>dexterous</b> flow. Her rhymes are laden with braggadocios lines about her boss status". In a mixed review, Kevipod from Direct Lyrics complimented the song's instrumental, but was critical of Banks' vocals, writing [...] "'Heavy Metal and Reflective' possesses a hard-hitting, menacing beat courtesy of Lil Internet and a lot of stale rapping by Azealia", while also commenting on the need for a more mainstream song from Banks' [...] "if she really wants to put her career together again". Robbie Daw from Idolator panned the track, describing the song as [...] "trap-lite trash", recommending that Banks spends more time [...] "actually focus on not making shit music".|$|E

The early buzz about B {{was that he was}} making outsider art and England is probably the closest he comes to that standard. He has ideas about what the creation of spoken word poetry and ambient music entails but it's quite clear he hasn’t taken a ton of time to study those forms." [...] David Morris of Tiny Mix Tapes said that although the album is [...] "conceptually daring" [...] and a showcase for Lil B's [...] "poetic, philosophical streak", he called the musical backing [...] "utter garbage" [...] and [...] "pure, unstructured noodling". Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be [...] "left-field and trendy" [...] on Lil B's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press. The Quietus praised the album as [...] "baffling, flawed but utterly engrossing", and said Lil B's flow is [...] "more measured but no less <b>dexterous</b> than his contemporaries, and the pace of his eloquent, brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien, frosted glass synth sounds and syrupy electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here. Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant, a man whose inner filter has been disabled, creating something which may polarise but which is, at least, utterly distinctive." [...] Daniel Levin Becker wrote in Dusted that, despite its unconventionality, the album is [...] "irredeemably bad".|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{opened to}} mixed reception, the {{consensus}} generally being {{that it was}} a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. Variety called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily <b>dexterous</b> and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the [...] "monstrous" [...] house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had [...] "major shortcomings" [...] in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cited The Haunting as [...] "one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced" [...] but surmised that [...] "there is really no point to it". Writing in The Atlantic magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film [...] "moderately elegant and literate and expensive", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being [...] "feeble [...] cowardly-comic". She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, [...] "It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at The Haunting were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was happening all along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical." ...|$|E
