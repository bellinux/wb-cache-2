[...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago".

Foster recalled the first time Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg contacting him for a dinner with the singer: [...] "When Madonna first called, I was a little surprised—my music isn't really hip enough for her—but I guess her camp thought we should meet, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Liz Rosenberg, the PR maven who has been with Madonna from the beginning." [...] Not long after the dinner, Madonna and Foster began the recording session in his Malibu studio. During the album conception, Madonna was also asked by her Bedtime Stories producer Nellee Hooper to collaborate with British trip hop group Massive Attack for a Marvin Gaye tribute album. Previously, the band had offered the collaboration to several artists, including Chaka Khan who rejected it. Madonna and Massive Attack covered Gaye's 1976 hit [...] "I Want You", which finished among the {{new material}} for Something to Remember and was also included on the [...] released by Motown Records.|$|E

And so it got a lot of attention. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used.

2500|$|One out {{of twenty}} to twenty-five stories {{received}} each week by 20th Century Fox in 1988, the original screenplay for Alien Nation was submitted as a spec–script to producer Gale Anne Hurd. The agency representing the storyline asked the production staff {{to view it}} {{as quickly as possible}} due to it being submitted to other film studios as well. Both Hurd and her director of development Ellen Collett had the same initial response, seeing the script as a real page-turner. According to Hurd, what really interested her about the film's story was the whole approach to the immigrant setting and the extrapolation of that to a science fiction setting. The genre of science fiction in regards to representing aliens, tends to usually be in the form of one or two beings as shown on network series' like Star Trek. Typically, large numbers of stand-ins were not common in film since the Planet of the Apes picture twenty years earlier. Working with co-producer Richard Kobritz, Hurd secured funding from Fox Studios and began casting an experienced makeup team for the creation of the alien society. Later, Hurd contacted cinematographer Adam Greenberg at his home in Israel to work on the production. Caught by surprise, Greenberg recalled, [...] "I was vacationing on the Dead Sea in a kibbutz (it was 125 degrees) and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Gale. That was the last thing to expect there, ..." [...] Though mostly an action picture, Alien Nation was somewhat of a throwback to other similar genre films such as Planet of the Apes [...] and Silent Running. The alien Newcomers are relegated to a second-class status. Like other minorities, they live in their own neighborhoods, frequent their own clubs and develop their own underground. Following the murder of a policeman, a human must partner up with an alien to solve the murder. Their uneasy alliance creates a social mistrust, dealing with issues such as prejudice and racism. By the end of the saga, the two completely different humanoids have combined their talents and overcome their social barriers to complete their task.|$|E
