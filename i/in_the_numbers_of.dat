5|$|Saudi Arabia {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} and most undeveloped {{countries}} in the world when oil was discovered in the late 1930s. The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit its vast oil reserves. As a result, in the years after World War II there was a growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by Western oil companies, many of whom worked for ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company). A much greater increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the 1973 oil crisis. Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and unskilled workers, principally Palestinians, Egyptians, Yemenis and others from Arab countries, but also Indians and Pakistanis, leading to a doubling of the Saudi population by 1985. Beginning in the early 1980s, South and East Asian countries, such as Thailand, Philippines and South Korea, increasingly provided migrant workers.|$|E

Overall we observed that there exist similar patterns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authors as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers <b>in</b> a component in both journals and conferences, which shows the moderate increase over 2001 - 2010. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> experimental results show that there is a marginal deviation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers <b>in</b> component, which ranges from 2.93 to 3.63 on average. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authors <b>in</b> component shows a bigger deviation than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers whose range is from 4.21 to 7.06 on average.

5|$|Reckless {{hunting and}} loss of habitat {{as a result of}} human {{settlement}} have led to significant decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. Natural calamities, like drought, are also major threats. While populations have declined in northern Cameroon due to degradation of floodplains through the construction of upstream dams, their habitat has been destroyed in Chad and Tanzania due to expansion of agriculture and settlement. Several deaths occur due to roadkill and drowning as well. During the dry season, bohor reedbuck are hunted with dogs and nets in Uganda. Reedbuck with the largest horns are prized by hunters.|$|E
5|$|While {{some species}} of procellariid have populations that {{number in the}} millions, many species are much less common and several are {{threatened}} with extinction.

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of}} the entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

5|$|In medieval Scotland {{education}} {{was dominated by}} the Church and largely aimed at the training and education of clerics. In the later medieval period {{there was a general}} increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> educational institutions as well as increasing use by the laity. These included private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, song schools attached to most major churches and an increasing number of grammar schools, particularly in the expanding burghs. These were almost exclusively aimed at boys, {{but by the end of}} the 15th century Edinburgh also had schools for girls. The growing emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools. All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite, with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.|$|E
5|$|One {{factor that}} reduces the chances of re-discovering the white-eyed martin is the drastic decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> {{swallows}} wintering at Bueng Boraphet, its only known site, from {{the hundreds of thousands}} reported around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980–1981. It is not certain whether this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to persecution. Other potential causes for the species' decline include the disturbance of riverine sand bars, the construction of dams which flood the area upstream and alter the downstream hydrology, deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture. Very few swallows now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. Bueng Boraphet has been declared a non-hunting area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. Past surveys include several at Bueng Boraphet, a 1969 survey of the Nan Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos. A possible unverified sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} how changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions from waiting lists and changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to <b>the</b> lists {{are related to}} list size and waiting times, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of local waiting list initiatives. DESIGN [...] Review of national and Körner statistics. SETTING [...] England (1987 - 94) and districts of the former Oxford region (1987 - 91). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Correlation <b>of</b> quarterly changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions from waiting lists in England with changes in total list size, <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> patients waiting one to two, or over two years, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to <b>the</b> lists; examination of changes in waiting list statistics for individual district specialties in one region in relation to funding for waiting list initiatives. RESULTS [...] Nationally, changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions to hospital from lists closely correlated with changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to lists (r = 0. 84; P < 0. 01). After adjusting for changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to lists, changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions correlated inversely with changes in list size (r = - 0. 62; P < 0. 001). Decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients waiting from {{one to two years}} were significantly associated with increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions (r = - 0. 52; P < 0. 01); locally, only six of 44 waiting list initiatives were followed by an increase in admissions and a fall in list size, although a further 11 were followed by a fall in list size without a corresponding increase in admissions. CONCLUSIONS [...] An increase in admissions improved waiting times but did not reduce list size because additions to the list tended to increase at the same time. The appropriateness of waiting list initiatives as a method of funding elective surgery should be reviewed...|$|R

5|$|The Welsh slate {{industry}} {{was essentially a}} Welsh-speaking industry. Most of the workforce in the main slate-producing areas of North Wales were drawn from the local area, with little immigration from outside Wales.

The caban, the cabin where the quarrymen gathered for their lunch break, was often the scene of wide-ranging discussions, which were often formally minuted. A surviving set of minutes from a caban at the Llechwedd mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog for 1908–10 records discussions on Church Disestablishment, tariff reform and other political topics. Eisteddfodau were held, poetry composed and discussed and most of the larger quarries had their own band, with the Oakley band particularly famous.

5|$|To date, little {{scientific}} data {{is available to}} assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations. Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates. Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to the decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> birds in urban areas, although the importance of this effect remains controversial. In the wild, the introduction of feral cats during human settlement can threaten native species with extinction. In many cases, controlling or eliminating the populations of non-native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals. However, the ecological role of introduced cats can be more complicated. For example, cats can control the numbers of rats, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing mesopredators.|$|E
5|$|Bizen Province {{became an}} early center of iron {{production}} and swordmaking {{because of the}} proximity to the continent. Conditions for sword production were ideal: good iron sand; charcoal and water were readily available; and the San'yōdō road ran right through the province. Bizen {{has been the only}} province to produce swords continuously from the Heian to the Edo period. In kotō times, a large number of skilled swordsmiths lived along the lower reaches of the Yoshii river around Osafune making it the largest center of sword production in Japan. Bizen province not only dominated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> blades produced but also in quality; and Bizen swords have long been celebrated for excellent swordsmanship. The peak of the Bizen tradition, marked by a gorgeous and luxurious style, was reached in the mid-Kamakura period. Later, in the 13th century, the Ichimonji and Osafune schools, the mainstream schools of Bizen Province, maintained the Heian style of the Ko-Bizen, the oldest school in Bizen province. After the 13th century, swords became wider and the point (kissaki) longer, most likely {{as a response to the}} thick armour of the invading Mongols. Mass production due to heavy demand for swords from the early 15th to the 16th century led to a lower quality of blades. The Bizen tradition is associated with a deep koshi-zori, a standard mihaba, bigger kasane with medium kissaki. The jihada is itame-hada often accompanied by utsuri. The hamon is chōji midare in nioi deki.|$|E
