50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} preparation is to roast a joint of pork from the breast or neck without removing the rind. So as to obtain crispy crackling, a sharp knife {{should be used to}} cut the skin through to the meat in narrow strips. The skin is rubbed with salt, pepper is added, while bay leaves and optionally cloves are inserted into the cuts. The joint is then roasted in a hot oven. The dish is accompanied by both boiled potatoes and caramelized potatoes (brunede kartofler). These are specially prepared by melting sugar in a <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> strong heat, adding a clump of butter, and allowing a portion of small round peeled potatoes (available in cans) to bathe in the mixture until they become richly browned or caramelized. Red cabbage (rødkål), which can be bought in a jar or a can, is always included too. If the cabbage is prepared from scratch, sliced apples are often added. Many Danes consider the traditional recipe to be the one described by Frk. Jensen in her 1901 cookbook.|$|R

2500|$|Shrove Tuesday {{was once}} known as a [...] "half-holiday" [...] in Britain. It started at 11:00am with the ringing of a church bell. On Pancake Day, [...] "pancake races" [...] are held in villages and towns across the United Kingdom. The {{tradition}} {{is said to have}} originated in 1445 when a housewife from Olney, Buckinghamshire, was so busy making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for the service. She raced out of the house to church while still carrying her <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> and pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning. The pancake race remains a relatively common festive tradition in the UK, especially England. Participants with <b>frying</b> <b>pans</b> race through the streets tossing pancakes into the air and catching them in the pan while running. The pancake race at Olney traditionally has women contestants who carry a <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> and race <b>over</b> a 415-yard course to the finishing line. The rules are strict: contestants must toss the pancake at the start and the finish, and wear a scarf and apron.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kwara State Nigeria, to assess the level of mechanization of cassava processing. Data was collected using multi-stage sampling technique randomly selecting one hundred and twenty (120) processing centres from two ADP agricultural zones in Kwara State. A structured interview schedule was used as an instrument to elicit information on types and number of processing machines available to processors, gender of operators, source of power and type of prime mover, mode of operation and constraints to mechanization of cassava processing. The data collected was analyzed using simple descriptive statistics like mean, percentages and cross tabulations. Chi-square (X 2) analysis was used to test the independence of machine operators against sex (gender). The major constraints to mechanization of cassava processing were identified, rated on a 4 points Likert-Type scale and ranked to determine their severity. The results showed that the level of mechanization of cassava processing in Kwara State is generally low, with the most commonly available processing equipment as the peeling tool (common knife), the grater and local <b>frying</b> <b>pans.</b> <b>Over</b> 70 % of the processing equipment are manually operated, while electricity accounted for only about 0. 5 %. The chi-square test for the processing equipment versus the sex of the operator revealed that gender (sex) is dependent on processing machine at 1 % level of significance. The ‘very severe’ constraints to mechanization of cassava processing are lack of credit, scarcity of spare parts and lack of electricity, while Poor quality of fabrication materials and Inappropriate processing equipment are considered ‘Not severe’. The study recommended appropriate government policies aimed at reducing interest rates, encouraging research and development and provision of massive rural infrastructures...|$|R

5000|$|Different {{kinds of}} corn {{were used to}} make farina bòna, most coming from the plateau regions (Locarno or Ticino in general). There are some testimonies about small amounts of corn {{cultivated}} in the valley. The inhabitants used to toast the grain in the mills, in a special <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> placed <b>over</b> the fire. The toasting process was different in each region. In Vergeletto, Nunzia would toast the corn until {{about a third of}} the grain had popped, and got a “crest” (thus it takes the name ghèl - galli in Italian, [...] "chickens" [...] in English). On the other hand, the last miller of Loco, Remigio Meletta, used to discard carefully every popped grain. It's possible that this selection was due to the difficulty in milling this kind of grain with a too heterogeneous consistency.During the milling, which was the final part of the process, the miller had to grind the grain very finely to be able to obtain, as Schira says, a flour with consistency comparable to a silk thread. That was possible only with the use of smooth, regular, ungrooved millstones, as it is possible to see in the crumbling mills of Vergeletto or among the millstones in the Museum of Onsernone.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the degree of degradation of the soybean oil used in frying processes. The quality of the oil during the frying process was evaluated by means of physical-chemical analyses, such: conjugated dienes (%) and TBA index (mmoles g(- 1)), and determination of total polar compounds (%). It was observed that the values of conjugated dienes increasing significantly with time until 1. 87 % after 15 hours for <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> I and 1. 76 % after 22. 5 hours for <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> II. The TBA indexes reached at the end the frying process values of 0. 0265 and 0. 0210 mmoles g(- 1) for <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> I and II, respectively. The percentages of total polar compounds have shown an increase of six and eight times in relation to the original sample starting from 5. 9 % and 3. 7 % and reaching values of 36. 8 % and 29. 2 %, for <b>fry</b> <b>pan</b> I and II, after 15 and 22. 5 hours of heating, respectively. It has been concluded that the alterations of the soybean oil increased as the time of frying increased, for both <b>fry</b> <b>pans.</b> The oil used in <b>fry</b> <b>pan</b> I showed greater alteration than the that observed in the oil used in <b>fry</b> <b>pan</b> II, in spite of the time of heating being shorter.
