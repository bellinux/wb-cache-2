40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{wideband}} <b>dual</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antenna</b> is designed, manufactured and measured. Slot coupled patch antenna structure is considered {{in order to}} achieve the wideband characteristic. Although rectangular shaped slot coupled patch antennas are widely used in most of the applications, their utilization in <b>dual</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antenna</b> structures is not feasible due to space limitation. For a rectangular slot, the parameter that effects the amount of coupling is the slot length. On the other hand when a H-shaped slot is considered, both the length of the center arm and the length of the side legs determine the coupling efficiency. This flexibility about the optimization parameters of the H-shaped slot makes it possible to position the two coupling slots within the boundaries of the patch antenna.

40|$|RFID is a fast {{emerging}} {{automatic identification}} system. Its bigger data density, better security, high speed {{and the fact}} that it does not need mechanical contact or line of sight communication have made it preferable to many other identification systems such as bar code, optical character recognition, biometric identification and smart cards. Nevertheless, this fast growing technology faces some difficulties in keeping tags simple and low cost while keeping efficient and reliable communication. This thesis is among the solutions that are proposed to fulfill this goal. So far, readers usually have either linearly or circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>antennas</b> and most tags are linearly polarized. Linearly <b>polarized</b> reader <b>antennas</b> are highly sensitive to the orientation of tags. In addition, circularly <b>polarized</b> reader <b>antennas</b> have fields that rotate across a plane and thus have only 50 % polarization matching with tags. Accordingly, a <b>dual</b> linearly <b>polarized</b> patch <b>antenna</b> is proposed, implemented and tested as a solution to reduce the power loss caused by an arbitrary orientation of RFID tags.

The proposed antenna rejects the wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) signals and work properly in the entire remaining ultra-wideband. Two antennas are designed for two different frequency bands of ultra wideband and both antennas together produce the entire ultra wideband with notch at 5 - 6 GHz band. The antennas are fed by a 50 coaxial probe and the entire design is optimized using CST Microwave Studio. The bandwidth of 3. 1 - 5 GHz is achieved by the optimized design of Antenna- 1 and the bandwidth of 6 - 10. 6 GHz is achieved by the optimized design of Antenna- 2. The bandwidth of the optimized combined antenna is 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz with elimination of the 5 - 6 GHz band. Both antennas are simulated, developed and measured.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} base station antennas and the {{environment}} they work in. Polarization diversity, dual band operation, and adaptive antenna systems are discussed with emphasis on how antennas for these applications should be designed. We compare the polarization diversity performance {{of different types of}} <b>dual</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antenna</b> elements. The scalar product of the far-field of the diversity channels is seen to be the key property of such antennas. Aperture coupled patches are seen to be superior to crossed dipoles because they provide more similar vertical and horizontal polarization patterns. Measurements of radio propagation using a dual band base station antenna are presented. We show that a dual band antenna may provide similar coverage for 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, but with a fixed offset. This indicates that the same cell planning may be used for the two frequency bands. The spatio-temporal properties of a suburban and an urban radio channel are investigated using a <b>dual</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antenna</b> array and a measurement bandwidth of 150 MHz. We use the measurement data to simulate adaptive up- and down-link beamforming. Antenna element designs for dual polarization and dual band operation are presented. We also present dual polarized array designs for adaptive and multibeam applications. The array for adaptive antenna applications is evaluated by considering the error in direction-of-arrival estimation caused by its non-ideal characteristics. We analyze an infinite planar array of rectangular patches in an arbitrarily composed multilayer media. A two-dimensional moment method is used together with a genetic algorithm to optimize the cross-section of dual polarized base station antennas with respect to the radiation pattern.

40|$|Abstract â€” The {{capacity}} of the popular GSM network is limited by co-channel interference (CCI) rather than noise. Nowadays, some solutions such as a receiver with multiple antennas (MIMO) or a receiver with single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) have been applied to cancel the CCI {{as well as to}} improve the network capacity. According to this paper, a novel receiver system with only one dual-polarized antenna is introduced. The proposed system has some dominant characteristics than above systems. Actually, it has lower cost and volume than a MIMO system, whereas its performance is better than that of a SAIC system due to the additional polarization diversity. Due to two different polarized branches this receiver overcomes the limitations of cost and size as a drawback of a multi-antenna receiver. Furthermore, it also offers additional polarization diversity gain, i. e., it provides better performance than a SAIC system.

40|$|Problem Statement: In MIMO system, {{capacity}} mainly {{depends on}} the channel and the antenna characteristics. The capacity can be improved by proper design of antenna elements and choosing appropriate array configuration and the directive elements give more capacity than omni directional elements. The <b>dual</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antennas</b> are better than single <b>polarized</b> <b>antennas</b> as the former can provide two information channels. The mutual coupling also changes the capacity considerably. When the spacing between the elements is less than 0. 5 &# 955;, the effect of mutual coupling is more. Approach: This study analyzes the capacity of Echelon, H-shaped; V-shaped free standing dipoles and printed dipole arrays of a MIMO system. The channel model for multi-polarized antennas {{is used in the}} simulations. The mutual coupling between the dipoles of different orientations is also included to make simulation more realistic.
