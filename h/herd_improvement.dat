40|$|Livestock is {{important}} in many organic farming systems, {{and it is an}} explicit goal to ensure high levels of animal health and welfare (AHW) through good management. This will lead to reduced medicine use and better quality of animal products. In two EU network projects NAHWOA & SAFO it was concluded that this is not guaranteed merely by following organic standards. Both networks recommended implementation of individual animal health plans to stimulate organic farmers to improve AHW. These plans should include a systematic evaluation of AHW and be implemented through dialogue with each farmer in order to identify goals and plan improvements. 15 research institutions in 8 European countries are involved in the proposed project with the main objective to minimise medicine use in organic dairy herds through active and well planned AHW promotion and disease prevention. The project consists of 5 work packages, 4 of which comprise research activities building on current research projects, new applications across borders, exchange of knowledge, results and conclusions between participating countries, and adopting them to widely different contexts. International and national workshops facilitate this exchange. Focus areas are animal health planning, AHW assessment using animal based parameters and development of advisory systems and farmer groups.

A total of 46, 242 monthly records of Holstein and Jersey (59 and 41 % of the total records, respectively) cows from 2009 to 2012 were analyzed using multiple correspondence, factor, and cluster analyses. Lactose content was observed to correlate with somatic cell count and parity, whereas the evaluated breeds, {{as well as the}} production and concentrations of fat and protein in the milk, were not associated with the lactose content. The cows were categorized into three groups, the first consisting of cows of both breeds with low lactose content (4. 19), high somatic cell score (5. 82), and higher parity (2. 50), contrasting with two other groups each with mean values characteristic for Holstein and Jersey breeds, respectively. Analysis of cows without subclinical mastitis (< 200, 000 somatic cells ml- 1) revealed that the relationship of parity with lactose level was independent of the effect of somatic cells. Lactose contents less than 4. 4 % were observed in autumn. Overall, the present study suggests that the lactose content of milk is influenced by somatic cell count and parity and that it varies seasonally; however, it is not related to breed, milk yield, milk fat content, or milk protein level...|$|R

Culling decisions have an important influence on the economic performance of the dairy but are often made in a nonprogrammed fashion and based partly on the intuition of the decision maker. The computer technology that is available for dairy herd management has made feasible the use of economic models to support culling decisions. Financial components— including profit, cash flow, and risk—are major economic factors affecting culling decisions. Culling strategies are further influenced by short-term fluctuations in cow numbers {{as well as by}} planned herd expansion. Changes in herd size affect the opportunity cost for postponed replacement and may alter the relevance of optimization strategies that assume a fixed <b>herd</b> size. <b>Improvements</b> in model components related to biological factors affecting future cow performance, including milk production, reproductive status, and mastitis, appear to offer the greatest economic potential for enhancing culling decision support systems.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in embryology and related research offer considerable possibilities to accelerate genetic improvement in cattle breeding. Such progress includes optimization and standardization of laboratory embryo production (in vitro fertilization; IVF), {{introduction of a}} highly efficient method for cryopreservation (vitrification), and dramatic improvement in the efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning) in terms of required effort, cost and overall outcome. Handmade cloning (HMC), a simplified version of somatic cell nuclear transfer, offers the potential for relatively easy and low cost production of clones. A potentially modified method of vitrification used at a centrally located laboratory facility could result in cloned offspring that are economically competitive with elite animals produced by more traditional means.

30|$|As in many {{developing}} countries, agro-pastoralism is the major form of livelihood for rural communities in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan. Although livestock rearing {{is part and parcel}} of rural Bhutanese agricultural system, Bhutan also has a high percentage of natural forest cover that supports a diversity of endangered wild predators. The loss of cattle to these predators is an on-going source of conflict between predators, farmers, and wildlife managers. Despite awareness of predation losses, there has been no empirical assessment of livestock herding practices in Bhutan in terms of livestock vulnerability to predation. We conducted a questionnaire and a field survey in three districts of western Bhutan to assess current livestock herding practices with regard to predation vulnerability. We interviewed farmers using a semi-structured questionnaire to determine their livestock herding practices and losses. We also traversed human trails in the nearby forests and took note of livestock encountered to gain further insights into herding dynamics. Generally, livestock were more vulnerable to predation when released into the forests without accompanying herders. Seasonally, livestock were more vulnerable during summer and early autumn, which coincided with the peak farming period during which animals are typically released into forests with minimal care. Our study underscores the importance of livestock herding with accompanying herders to minimize predation losses and highlights the challenges posed by farm labour shortage in rural areas. We recommend developing a comprehensive livestock management policy that includes elaborate provisions on reducing livestock losses through livestock <b>herd</b> management, stock <b>improvement,</b> fodder development, pasture development, and sustainable livestock insurance schemes.|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of dairy farming in Japan can best seen {{by looking at}} the increase in the average size of dairy <b>herds</b> and the <b>improvement</b> of milk yield per cow. These indexes are at the same level of EU countries and approaching those of the USA. This rapid development has resulted in debt accumulation in Hokkaido and raised the environ-mental issue of manure management. The proper processing of dairy farm manure would solve the water pollution problem and provide a source of organic fertilizer for upland farming. To turn this environmental negative into a positive requires the cooperation of dairy and upland farmers and financial incentives from the government. To secure management stability and environmentally friendly dairy farming, a price policy for processed milk and a direct payment system to farmers are necessary. The basic premise of the price policy is that it will allow the level of milk prices to gradually reach that of advanced dairy farming countries without depleting resources, over-loading the environment with cow waste, resorting to low wages, or the need for low land rents. The original intent of the direct payment system was to supplement incomes due to declining milk prices. To improve the system the government must increase the amount of money allocated for payments and make the system more flexible. Direct payments should reward farmers who increase the planted area of forage per cow, because this will decrease the environmental load and reduce water pollution. Moreover, the system should reward upland farmers who prove that they use manure as fertilizer...|$|R

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is just one component of BRD complex. Because BRD is moderately heritable, {{it may be possible}} to reduce the incidence of BRD through genetic selection. The objectives of this study were to determine the heritability and associative genetic relationships among immune system traits (i. e., cortisol, total IgG, IgG isotypes, and IL- 8) in cattle monitored for BRD incidence. At an average of 83 d after weaning (219 d age and mean = 221. 7 kg [SD 4. 34]), crossbred Bos taurus steer calves (n = 2, 869) were received at a commercial feedlot in southeastern Colorado over a 2 -yr period. At receiving, jugular blood samples were collected at 212 (yr 1) and 226 d (yr 2) of age for immune trait analyses. The BRD phenotype was defined as a binomial variable (0 = no and 1 = yes) and compared with immune system traits measured at receiving (prior to illness onset). An animal identified as BRD positive exhibited ? 2 clinical signs (i. e., eye or nasal discharge, cough, lethargy, rapid breathing, acute interstitial pneumonia, or acute upper respiratory syndrome and/or a rectal temperature > 39. 7 °C). Heritability and genetic correlation estimates for categorical variable BRD, cortisol, IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, and IL- 8 were estimated from a sire model using ASREML. Heritability estimates were low to moderate for BRD (0. 17 ± 0. 08), cortisol (0. 13 ± 0. 05), IgG (0. 15 ± 0. 05), IgG 1 (0. 11 ± 0. 05), IgG 2 (0. 24 ± 0. 06), and IL- 8 (0. 30 ± 0. 06).

40|$|Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) {{since its}} {{appearance}} in Europe {{in the early}} 1990 &# 8217;s has resulted in tremendous economic losses. Under field conditions vaccination {{is one of the}} most efficient strategies for the prevention and control of PRRS. The aim of this study is to perform the PRRSV vaccinology regarding current status of commercial vaccines in Europe. There are two types of PRRSV commercial available vaccines in Europe: Killed Virus (KV) or inactivated vaccines and Modified-Live Virus (MLV) or attenuated vaccines. EU KV commercial vaccines provide limited efficacy due to the weak stimulation of the immune system and no effective induction of neutralizing antibodies. However, KV vaccines can induce a strong Cell Mediated Immune (CMI) response. One the other hand, commercial EU MLV vaccines provide effective strain-specific protection, only partial protection against genetically heterologous PRRSV and elicit relatively late humoral and CMI responses which lead to delayed protection. In Europe, the KV vaccination prove to reduce the negative effects of PRRSV in breeding herds, improving their reproductive performance, e. g., increase of farrowing rate and number of live or weaned pigs, reduction of premature farrowing rate, abortion rate and number of mummified and stillborn piglets. The use of commercial MLV vaccines in PRRSV-infected breeding <b>herds</b> leads to <b>improvement</b> of: (a) reproductive performance e. g., reduction of the abortion and return to oestrus rate and increase of the farrowing rate and number of weaners, (b) the viraemic status, morbidity and mortality rate of piglets and (c) the growth performance of vaccinated pigs. In conclusion, nowadays the use of MLV or KV vaccines in Europe is the most economical tool to control the economic losses of PRRSV infection.

40|$|The goal of most beef {{production}} systems {{is to increase}} or at least maintain profitability. Producers can attempt to increase profitability {{in a variety of}} ways that might include reducing feed costs, changing their marketing program, or perhaps by changing the performance of their <b>herd</b> through genetic <b>improvement.</b> Focusing on this latter option, there are two primary genetic tools available: selection and mating where selection refers to the selection of breeding animals and mating includes which females are mated to which bulls, for example, crossbreeding systems. This paper focuses on the former, the selection of the appropriate animals for a production system with the goal to improve profitability. The best tool available for making selection decisions is expected progeny differences (EPD). Over the years the number of EPD available to guide producers in making selection decisions has grown from 5 to over 15 in most cases. Simply put, the amount of information that the breeder must sift through to try to make a good selection decision has become overwhelming. The producer must determine which EPD have the greatest influence on their income and their expenses, and by how much—a daunting task. Historically this task has depended on the “intuition” and experience of the breeder. For instance, they know that selection for heavier weaning weight will increase the weight of calves sold at weaning, but that blind selection for weaning weight will also increase calving difficulty and if replacements are kept, likely increase cow size and feed costs. Breeders have been performing a balancing act with little concrete information on how important each of those traits is to their profitability. Fortunately, there are several tools that have recently become available to ease the process of combining the costs and the revenues of beef production with EPD to make selection decisions that will produce progeny which are more profitable...|$|R

In order to further evaluate the usefulness of molecular testing, a nested PCR was also assessed. Results M. paratuberculosis was isolated and cultured from 23 faecal samples (7. 9 %) on solid medium. From a molecular perspective, 105 faecal samples (36 %) were PCR positive for MAP specific DNA. A complete correlation (100 %) was observed between the results of both molecular targets (IS 900 and ISMAP 02). Sensitivity was increased by ~ 10 % with the inclusion of a nested PCR for ISMAP 02 (29 further samples were positive). When culturing and PCR were retrospectively compared, every culture positive faecal sample also yielded a PCR positive result for both targets. Alternatively, however not every PCR positive sample (n = 105, 36 %) produced a corresponding culture isolate. Interestingly though when analysed collectively at the herd level, the correlation between culture and PCR results was 100 % (ie every herd which recorded at least 1 early PCR +ve result later yielded culture positive samples within that herd). Conclusion PCR on bovine faecal samples is a fast reliable test and should be applied routinely when screening for MAP within herds suspected of paratuberculosis. Nested PCR increases the threshold limit of detection for MAP DNA by approximately 10 % but proved to be problematic in this study. Although slow and impractical, culturing is still regarded as one of the most reliable methods for detecting MAP among infected cattle. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the epidemiology of respiratory diseases in pig herds in GB {{and their impact on}} pig morbidity and mortality. The role of management, characteristics of the herd, presence of multiple pathogens and control and elimination strategies were considered. Questionnaires were completed by veterinarians that attended 116 pig herds in GB. Pathogens were clustered on individual farms, suggesting similar risk factors for infection / persistence. Management factors were investigated for their association with the within and between-herd variability in pig antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in 103 pig herds. Factors that were important included close proximity to other pig herds, having > 250 sows and not isolating purchased stock or not isolating for long enough. Considering the possible fade out of PRRSV, the within-herd transmission dynamics were investigated using a mathematical model. There was a high frequency of fade out in breeding pigs before virus reached young stock and increased persistence in young stock, in large herds, herds with increased contact between age groups and herds that had frequent re-introduction of virus. Results provided evidence for apparent erratic behaviour of PRRSV within and between herds. Mathematical models were also used to investigate the range of impacts of PRRSV on disease in a herd and to test strategies for control and elimination. PRRSV was difficult to eliminate without targeting both rearing pigs and sows. Rapid vaccination of sows once there was an increase in preweaning still births reduced the spread of virus to rearing pigs. Results highlighted that in areas of GB where the density of pigs is low {{it might be possible to}} control PRRSV through elimination. In larger herds in pig dense regions elimination might be difficult and control might give more stability. The long-term benefits of elimination will depend on (re) -introduction of virus from within and outside the <b>herd</b> but significant <b>improvements</b> in production might not be observed unless several respiratory pathogens are eliminated from a herd. ...|$|R
