25|$|Following their {{defeat in}} the Spanish Civil War in early 1939, about half a million Spanish Republicans fled to France to escape {{imprisonment}} or execution. On {{the north side of}} the Pyrenees, such refugees were confined in internment camps such as Camp Gurs and Camp Vernet. Although over half of these had been repatriated to Spain (or elsewhere) by the time Pétain proclaimed the Vichy Régime in 1940, the 120,000 to 150,000 who remained became political prisoners, and the <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the Service du Travail Obligatoire, the Compagnies de Travailleurs Étrangers (Companies of Foreign Workers) or CTE, began to pursue them for slave labour. The CTE permitted prisoners to leave the internment camps if they agreed to work in German factories, but as many as 60,000 Republicans recruited for the labour service managed to escape and join the French Résistance. Thousands of suspected anti-fascist Republicans were deported to German concentration camps instead, however. Most were sent to Mauthausen where, of the 10,000 Spaniards registered, only 2,000 survived the war.|$|E

The Federal Circuit has recently clarified {{the applicability of the}} doctrine of <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalents</b> in likelihood of confusion cases, stating that [...] "When it is unlikely that an American buyer will translate the foreign mark and will take it as it is, then the doctrine of <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalents</b> will not be applied". The court noted that [...] "the doctrine of <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalents</b> is not an absolute rule and should be viewed merely as a guideline". Instead [...] "he doctrine should be applied only when {{it is likely that the}} ordinary American purchaser would [...] "stop and translate [...] into its English equivalent".

500|$|Generally, {{admission}} into {{a graduate}} degree program at Harvard Extension School requires a minimum of an accredited bachelor's degree (or <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalent),</b> as well as completion of three pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher and a minimum of 3.0 overall GPA. One of the three pre-admission courses must be the [...] "Proseminar" [...] course for the intended area of study, which is akin to a traditional research methods course, and prior to registering for a proseminar students must pass a qualification test to assess graduate-level critical reading and writing skills. Certain disciplines have other specified pre-admission coursework, while some have specific coursework that is required before submitting a master's thesis proposal (e.g. biology and psychology fields must take a specific graduate statistics course). [...] Students who meet these criteria are then eligible to submit an application for admission into the graduate degree programs.|$|E

2500|$|Where a word is {{a foreign}} {{transliteration}} of an English mark, the TTAB has held {{that there is}} nothing to translate, and the doctrine of <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalents</b> is not invoked.

Green Spot also owned a mark in Chinese characters for which the first sets of characters were transliterations of [...] "vi" [...] and [...] "ta" [...] with no meaning in Chinese, while the third, 奶 (nai) was the Chinese word for [...] "milk". Green Spot argued that its senior Chinese character mark was the equivalent of Vitamilk, and that Green Spot's ownership of the senior mark gave it the right to own the equivalent English mark. The TTAB refused to apply the doctrine of <b>foreign</b> <b>equivalents,</b> because the transliterations of [...] "vi" [...] and [...] "ta" [...] had no actual translation from Chinese to English.|$|R
