60|$|Involuntarily <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> chair back, as I {{looked from}} the boards {{at which he}} pointed to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{influential}} friends, Mr. Sherwin, in many directions--there are appointments, good appointments, {{which would}} be open to me, if <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> interests. I might provide in this way against the chance of failure." ...|$|E
6000|$|Plunging and labouring on in {{a tide of}} visions, [...] Dolorous and dear, Forward <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> way as amid waste waters [...] Stretching around, Through whose eddies there glimmered the customed {{landscape}} [...] Yonder and near, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am grieved {{it should}} have so chanced, mother," [...] replied the youth, [...] "and much did I value the token, as coming from you. For what remains, I trust to win gold enough, when <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>my</b> way in the world; and till then, beads of black oak, or a rosary of nuts, must serve the turn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd whistle myself, if <b>I</b> could <b>push</b> <b>my</b> lips together," [...] remarked Jack. [...] "I fear, dear father, that in {{some respects}} I am sadly lacking." ...|$|R
60|$|With that <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> back <b>my</b> chair, got up {{from the}} table, and made him a bow. And the captain, at last seeing my drift, did the same.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> {{chair back}} creakingly. This ancient {{landlubber}} was becoming as great an affliction as any cross-bowed mariner. He shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes, overturned my inkstand, {{and went on}} with his insufferable nonsense.|$|E
6000|$|... "The bar was crowded. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> way to {{the counter}} and flung the goose down in front of me. The men nearest stopped talking to look at it; and a young fellow {{standing}} next to me said-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{sat with}} it in my hand {{for a moment or}} so before I opened it, hesitating as one hesitates before a door that may reveal a {{dramatic}} situation. Then <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> chair a little back from the table and ripped the envelope.|$|E
5000|$|... "I usually {{got scared}} easily, {{but this time}} <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> through <b>my</b> own ideas for the first time. I could take a big step in 2004 and love the person I became." [...] - Koda Kumi.|$|R
6000|$|It is no good, dear, {{gentleness}} and forbearance, I [...] endured too long. <b>I</b> have <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> {{hands in}} the dark soil, under the [...] flower of my soul And the gentle leaves, and have felt where the roots [...] are strong Fixed in the darkness, grappling for the deep soil's [...] little control.|$|R
60|$|In {{the conduct}} of an invented story there are, no doubt, certain proprieties to be {{observed}} {{for the sake of}} clearness and effect. A man of imagination, however inexperienced in the art of narrative, has his instinct to guide him in the choice of his words, and {{in the development of the}} action. A grain of talent excuses many mistakes. But this is not a work of imagination; I have no talent; my excuse for this undertaking lies not in its art, but in its artlessness. Aware of my limitations and strong in the sincerity of my purpose, I would not try (were I able) to invent anything. <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>my</b> scruples so far that I would not even invent a transition.|$|R
6000|$|... 'After some days, or so {{it seemed}} to me, I was placed on the ground near a thick hedge, and when I heard my captor snoring beside me I {{resolved}} to make my escape. So <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> way among the thorns as well as I could, and walked on steadily for about an hour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, just to {{have fun}} with myself; to sneer at the coward flesh, so to speak. I used to long for dangers, and when they came upon me I would jeer at and revile the quaking I could not repress. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> {{shrinking}} body into peril and exulted in the punishment it received." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> boat {{between the}} rocks towards the island. Bright and burning though the beams {{of the sun}} were, here seemed {{everlasting}} shadow. And though at my gradual intrusion, at splash or grating of keel, the startled cormorant cried in the air, and with one cry woke many, yet here too seemed perpetual stillness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> back <b>my</b> {{chair and}} rose. The {{conversation}} {{was taking a}} turn that was too unhealthy to be pursued {{within the walls of}} the Palais Mazarin, where there existed, albeit the law books made no reference to it, the heinous crime of lèse-Eminence--a crime for which more men had been broken than it pleases me to dwell on.|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{were a lot}} {{of things}} that upset me [...] [...] [...] I wanted to believe in my own style that had taken so long to find. No matter what other people said, I didn't want to give up [...] [...] [...] I usually got scared easily, but <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> through <b>my</b> own ideas for the first time." [...] - Koda Kumi ...|$|R
60|$|But dispelling these dismal {{reflections}} {{as well as}} <b>I</b> could, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> on <b>my</b> way, till I got to Chapel-street, which I crossed; and then, {{going under}} a cloister-like arch of stone, whose gloom and narrowness delighted me, and filled my Yankee soul with romantic thoughts of old Abbeys and Minsters, I emerged into the fine quadrangle of the Merchants' Exchange.|$|R
6000|$|I {{wrote my}} cheque at a desk, and I declare I {{could never have}} {{recognised}} my signature. Jim was gone in a moment; Trent had vanished even earlier; only Bellairs remained, exchanging insults with the auctioneer; and, behold! as <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> {{way out of the}} exchange, who should run full tilt into my arms but the messenger boy! ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{plucking}} up {{heart of}} grace, I crossed my cutlass on my chest, and reposing {{my hand on}} the hilt, addressed their High Mightinesses thus. [...] "Men of Mardi, I come from the sun. When this morning it rose and touched the wave, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> shallop from its golden beach, and hither sailed before its level rays. I am Taji." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said I, though I was not. [...] "It was {{the impulse}} of the moment." [...] I felt sick with {{exertion}} and excitement. Turning, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> {{way out of}} the crowding Beast People and went on alone up the slope towards the higher part of the headland. Under the shouted directions of Moreau I heard the three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the victim down towards the water.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was nothing}} in her smile that was leading, and <b>I</b> did not <b>push</b> <b>my</b> inquiry, {{especially}} as Alderling did not seem disposed to assist. [...] "Well," [...] I said, [...] "I suppose you will forgive to science my feeling that your situation is most suggestive." ...|$|R
60|$|Again, <b>I</b> must <b>push</b> <b>my</b> method {{beyond that}} of Dr. Munro, by {{considering}} the subject of Magic, in relation to perforated and other stones, whether inscribed with designs, or uninscribed. Among the disputed objects are many such stones, and it is legitimate for me to prove, not only that they occur in many sites of ancient life, but that their magical uses are still recognised, or were very recently recognised in the British Folk- lore of to-day.|$|R
40|$|Good {{citation}} requires {{critical analysis}} because well-supposed legal analysis requires a layered {{understanding of how}} legal authority {{may be used in}} different ways. Simultaneously, it demands good judgment in making the best decisions about how to introduce and employ the relevant cases on a particular case. Teaching how to cite legal authorities includes framing because all legal authorities are potential tools for argument. In deciding whether and how to deploy cases, statutes, and other forms of legal authority, advocates must resolve two interrelated questions in rapid sequence: 1. Can I frame or characterize the authority in question in a particular (strategically advantageous) manner within the bounds of the law? 2. Should <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>my</b> interpretation and use of this authority as far as I might, or will doing so strain my credibility more than it will strengthen my position? Once law students recognize that citing cases and statutes can be part of an exciting array of strategic considerations and not solely a dry exercise in tedious obligation, they can also understand the stakes involved in citing them appropriately and correctly...|$|R
6000|$|At last I saw a chance, {{and crowded}} {{in for the}} hole; {{and in order to}} be {{beforehand}} with a big man who just then came in, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> gun violently through the hole; upon which the hook-nosed man cried out, thinking I was going to shoot him. But at last he took the gun, turned it end for end, clicked the trigger three times, and then said, [...] "one dollar." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{secret was}} out, and I {{wondered}} no more. At once {{the stream and}} wet bars of sand took on a different color. I removed my boots, and waded out to a little bar. The sand seemed quite firm, but water oozed out around my feet; and when I stepped, the whole bar shook like jelly. <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> foot through the crust, and the cold, wet sand took hold, and tried to suck me down.|$|E
60|$|I {{understood}} {{well enough}} that all their conversations {{must have been}} referred mentally to that dead man who had brought them together. That was unavoidable. But {{it was in the}} living man that she was interested. That was unavoidable too, I suppose. And as <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> inquiries I discovered that he had disclosed himself to her as a by no means conventional revolutionist, contemptuous of catchwords, of theories, of men too. I was rather pleased at that--but I was a little puzzled.|$|E
5000|$|Lyrically, {{the first}} verse {{begins with the}} lines [...] "Yeah man made power / Stood like a tower / Higher, higher, hello! / And the higher you go / you feel lower, Oh! / I {{was close to the}} edge / staying under cover / staying under cover / And with my nose to the ground / I found my sound" [...] and ends with [...] "Got myself an {{interview}} tomorrow / got myself a jacket for a dolla / ... /I don't wanna live for tomorrow / <b>I</b> <b>push</b> <b>my</b> luck today / I throw this shit in your face when I see ya / Cause I got something to say /" [...] before repeating in the chorus [...] "I was born free." [...] She references Utopia, Ethiopia and Slovakia in the song's second verse. The song's coda sees the songwriter turn the scrutiny on herself, stating [...] "I Don't wanna talk about money, 'cos I got it / I Don't wanna talk about hoochies, 'cos I been it / And I don't wanna be fake, but you can do it." ...|$|R
30|$|Firefighters {{reported}} discomfort from ill-fitting {{face masks}} {{when they were}} worn with the helmet as such: “When I have my mask on, <b>I</b> can’t <b>push</b> <b>my</b> helmet down where its comfortable so I feel like it’s sitting up higher on my head and I have to crank my chin strap down {{to keep it from}} falling off and it just doesn’t marry up well on my face, and it’s probably because my face is smaller (Site # 2).” Some firefighters also reported the itchiness of the hood, especially when it is wet.|$|R
60|$|My warning {{went for}} nothing! My {{confession}} was too exciting {{to be kept}} a secret, and soon several of mother's most intimate friends had heard of my expedition, and in their minds, as in hers, my early marriage was assured. Did not the proof of it lie {{in the fact that}} <b>I</b> was <b>pushing</b> <b>my</b> building with desperate haste? Was this not done in order to make room for my bride?--No other reason was sufficient to account for the astounding improvements which I had planned, and which were going forward with magical rapidity.|$|R
60|$|I heard its cry of {{pain from}} afar, and instinctively hastened my steps. Three {{or four times}} I heard it again, and at each call I ran faster, till, breathless, I arrived upon the scene, {{the opening of a}} narrow court, leading out of a by-street. At first I saw nothing but the backs of a small mob of urchins. Then from the centre of them came another wailing appeal for help, and without waiting for any invitation, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> way into the group.|$|E
6000|$|I {{snatched}} {{the key of}} his portmanteau out of his hand, {{and gave it to}} our man--who undertook to submit it to the customhouse examination, and to bring it to my lodging afterwards. Holding Oscar fast by the arm, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> way through the crowd in the room, got outside, and hailed a cab at the dock gates. The people about, noticing my agitation, said to each other compassionately, [...] "It's the blue man's mother!" [...] Idiots! They might have seen, I think, that I was only old enough to be his elder sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "False? Nay, dear heart, I saw it all, and thou wast beside thyself {{and knew}} not rightly what happened. Even {{a minute later}} thou laidst in my arms like a dead white swan, and <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>my</b> way through the soldiers, and past the other Augustas who cowered in the tribune, {{screaming}} and wringing their hands. Two of thy slaves were luckily close at hand. Together we carried thee down to thy litter and bore thee safely home for which to-morrow I will offer special sacrifice to Minerva who protected thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|Luckily, his wretched shanty {{was some}} six miles nearer than mine {{or he would}} have died. Leaving him safe in his den, <b>I</b> <b>pushed</b> on toward <b>my</b> own claim, {{in the teeth of}} a terrific gale, the cold growing each moment more intense. [...] "The sunset regions" [...] at that moment did not provoke me to song.|$|R
60|$|I am at work again--on a book. Not with a {{great deal}} of spirit, but with enough--yes, plenty. And <b>I</b> am <b>pushing</b> <b>my</b> {{publishing}} house. It has turned the corner after cleaning $50,000 a year for three consecutive years, and piling every cent of it into one book--Library of American Literature--and from next January onward it will resume dividends. But I've got to earn $50,000 for it between now and then--which I will do if I keep my health. This additional capital is needed for that same book, because its prosperity is growing so great and exacting.|$|R
5000|$|Recalling his {{approach}} to the Largo shows with Chicago Tribune music editor Lou Carlozo, Brion said: [...] "I taught my hands to follow whatever was coming into my head—and wherever my consciousness would go, <b>I</b> had to <b>push</b> <b>my</b> hands to follow. And at some level, {{you just had to}} abandon any concern about how you’d look. Performing without a set list: That was special." ...|$|R
