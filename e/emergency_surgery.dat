5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if <b>emergency</b> <b>surgery</b> is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
40|$|Hospitals aim {{to deliver}} the highest quality of care. One key {{priority}} is to schedule <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> as quickly as possible, because postponing them generally increases a patient’s risk of complications and even death. In this paper, we consider the case that <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> are scheduled {{in one of the}} elective Operating Rooms (ORs). In this situation, emergency patients are operated once an going elective surgery has finished. We denote these completion times of the elective surgeries by ‘break-in-moments’ (BIMs). The waiting time for <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> can be reduced by spreading these BIMs as evenly as possible over the day. This can be achieved by sequencing the surgeries in their assigned OR, such that the maximum interval between two consecutive BIMs is minimized. In this paper, we discuss several exact and heuristic solution methods for this new type of scheduling problem. However, in practice, <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> arising throughout the day and the uncertainty of the durations of elective surgeries, may disrupt the initial schedule. As a result, the completion times of the elective surgeries, and therefore, the BIMs change, leading also to a change of the maximum distance between two BIMs. To estimate this effect and investigate the robustness of the created schedules, we conduct a simulation study. Computational results show that the best approaches reduce the waiting time of <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> by approximately 10 %...|$|R

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> are {{serviced}} by three main forms of capacity: dedicated operating room time reserved for <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries,</b> alternative (on call) capacity, and lastly, canceling of elective surgeries. The {{objective of this}} research is to model capacity implications of meeting wait time targets for multiple priority levels in the context of <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Initial attempts to solve the capacity evaluation problem were made using a non-linear optimisation model, however, this model was intractable. A simulation model was then used to examine the trade-off between additional dedicated operating room capacity (and consequent idle capacity) versus increased re-scheduling of elective surgeries while keeping reserved time for <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> low. Considered performance measures include utilization of operating room time, elective re-scheduling, and wait times by priority class. Finally, the instantaneous utilization of different types of downstream beds is determined to aid in capacity planning. The greatest number of patients seen within their respective wait time targets is achieved by a combination of additional on call capacity and a variation of the rule allowing low priority patients to utilize on call capacity. This also maintains lower cancelations of elective surgeries than the current situation. Although simulation does not provide an optimum solution it enables a comparison of different scenarios. This simulation model can determine appropriate capacity levels for servicing emergency patients of different priorities with different wait time targets...|$|R

50|$|To examine {{scheduling}} challenges, consider {{three possible}} surgical scenarios: elective (e.g. cosmetic procedures, stable situations not increasing in severity), imminent (e.g. inflamed gall bladder removal, potential for worsening harm if situations not surgically corrected,) and <b>emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> (e.g. burst appendix, {{situations in which}} death or disability is possible or likely). The majority of operative time {{is a combination of}} elective and imminent surgeries. Albeit a smaller percentage, emergency surgical cases must always be handled promptly in order to ensure patient safety. <b>Emergency</b> <b>surgeries</b> are often unforeseeable and present a scheduling challenge as a result. Therefore, from a management perspective, one must use the elective and imminent surgical cases as a guideline for pre-determining operative schedules, while allowing flexibility for the emergency situations that indubitably arise.|$|R

When his parents {{find out about the}} fight and that he is gay, they throw Chris out and he stays with Summer. She later breaks down and reveals that she is struggling with his sexuality. Chris reassures her that it is not her fault he is gay and their friendship becomes stronger. Chris befriends Natasha and helps her and Summer to make up when they fall out. After receiving lower grades than expected, Chris reconsiders attending university. He gets a job at Fitzgerald Motors, upsetting his father, George, who wants him to go to university. To keep George happy, Chris begins attending TAFE. A customer, Warren Burrell, makes derogatory comments about gay people and makes Chris feel uncomfortable.
