The CAM software takes the 3D model created in the CAD system and uses a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine (typically a vertical machining center) to cut out the 2D pieces from, in the example above, a sheet of aluminum. This process can eliminate waste as well as decrease machining time and machine down time. The pieces cut from the sheets of aluminum then are assembled by a worker using a TIG (Tungsten Inert <b>Gas)</b> <b>welder.</b>|$|E
40|$|A new {{generation}} of arc welder has recently become widely available at a price which is within reach of most amateurs and part-time mechanics, known as the MIG welder (metal-arc inert <b>gas</b> <b>welder).</b> In MIG welding the arc is ensheathed in a stream of inert gas which prevents the molten metal from oxidising. The stream of gas changes {{the character of the}} emitted radiation, and it is possible that this type of welder poses a greater threat to sight than previously recognised. Radiation in the ultraviolet range emitted by arc welders is absorbed by the unprotected cornea and lens, giving rise to a keratoconjunctivitis, or 'arc-eye,' which, though intensely painful, is not considered a threat to sight. Radiation in the visible and near infrared spectrum, however, penetrates the eye to be absorbed by the retina and may cause thermal or photochemical damage which may be permanent and sight-threatening. Retinal injuries resulting from exposure to ordinary electric welding arcs have been reported, but such injuries are uncommon. Two cases of retinal burns resulting from exposure to MIG welder emissions which presented on consecutive days to the Leicester Royal Infirmary are presented. This is the first report of such injuries relating specifically to MIG welding...|$|E

Ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) samples were collected according to OSHA ID- 214 method and NIOSH analytical method 6014, respectively. Direct reading instruments were used for sampling of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). A semi-quantitative method was used for risk assessment. Exposure to O 3, NO 2, CO, and CO 2 ranged 0 - 0. 0371, 0. 01 - 0. 58, 0. 375 - 4. 33, and 89. 5 - 1395. 44 ppm, respectively. Among welders, Back weld group had the maximum exposure to O 3, CO, CO 2, while the maximum exposure to NO 2 was seen for Filling group and then for Back weld group. Although average exposure values were significantly lower than Threshold Limit Values-Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA) (p< 0. 05), the results of risk assessment showed that, control approaches should be applied for welders specially in Full pass, Filling, Filling cap, and Back weld groups due to their medium (M) and high (H) rank of risk...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize personal exposures to welding-related metals and <b>gases</b> for production <b>welders</b> and non-welders in a large manufacturing facility. Welding fume metals and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) were sampled for thirty-eight workers. Personal exposure air samples for welding fume metals were collected on 37 mm open face cassettes and nitrogen dioxide and ozone exposure samples were collected with diffusive passive samplers. Samples were analyzed for metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and welding fume metal exposure concentrations were defined as the sum of welding-related metals mass per volume of air sampled. Welding fume metal exposures were highly variable among similar types of welding while NO 2 and O 3 exposure were less variable. Welding fume metal exposures were significantly higher 474 µg/m 3 for welders than non-welders 60 µg/m 3 (p= 0. 001). Welders were exposed to higher concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 than non-welders but the differences were not statistically significant. Welding fume metal exposure concentrations for <b>welders</b> performing <b>gas</b> metal arc welding (GMAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) were higher than <b>welders</b> performing <b>gas</b> tungsten arc welding (GTAW).

40|$|Abstract: Occupational Exposure to Manganesecontaining Welding Fumes and Pulmonary Function Indices among Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Welders: Hamid HASSANI, et al. Department of Occupational Health Engineering, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran—Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate manganese (Mn) -containing welding fumes’ exposure, assess urinary Mn as a biomarker for Mn exposure and investigate the correlation of Mn in air, total fumes and urinary Mn with pulmonary function indices in 118 welders and 37 unexposed controls from two regions in Iran, Assaluyeh and Borujen. Methods: Air samples were collected on mixed cellulose ester membrane filters in personal air samplers and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (NIOSH Method 7300). For all participants, urine samples were collected during the entire work shift, and Mn in urine was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy according to NIOSH Method 8310. Spirometric measurements were also done for participants. Results: The maximum exposures to airborne Mn and t o t a l f u m e s w e r e 0. 3 0 4 ± 0. 2 5 6 m g / m 3 a n d 21. 52 ± 9. 40 mg/m 3, respectively. The urine Mn levels in the various groups ranged between 0. 77 to 7. 58 μg/l. The correlation between airborne Mn and urinary Mn was significant for total whole participants. Some values of spirometric indices were statistically lower in welders rather than controls. Conclusions: Our results indicate that many welders have been exposed to higher concentrations of Mn-containing welding fumes. Urinary Mn {{can be used as a}} biomarker for Mn exposure. There were weak inverse correlations between Mn-containing welding fumes and pulmonary function indices, and the inverse correlation between urinary Mn with forced vital capacities (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) was significant.

40|$|Welding is {{a common}} {{industrial}} process used to join metals and generates complex aerosols of potentially hazardous metal fumes and <b>gases.</b> Most long-time <b>welders</b> experience some type of respiratory disorder during their time of employment. The use of animal models {{and the ability to}} control the welding fume exposure in toxicology studies have been helpful in developing {{a better understanding of how}} welding fumes affect health. There are no studies that have performed a side-by-side comparison of the pulmonary responses from an animal toxicology welding fume study with the lung responses associated with chronic exposure to welding fume by a career welder. In this study, post-mortem lung tissue was donated from a long-time welder with a well-characterized work background and a history of extensive welding fume exposure. To simulate a long-term welding exposure in an animal model, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated once a week for 28 weeks by intratracheal instillation with 2 mg of a stainless steel, hard-surfacing welding fume. Lung tissues from the welder and the welding fume-treated rats were examined by light and electron microscopy. Pathological analysis of lung tissue collected from the welder demonstrated inflammatory cell influx and significant pulmonary injury. The poor and deteriorating lung condition observed in the welder examined in this study was likely due to exposure to very high levels of potentially toxic metal fumes and gases for a significant number of years due to work in confined spaces. The lung toxicity profile for the rats treated with welding fume was similar. For tissue samples from both the welder and treated rats, welding particle accumulations deposited and persisted in lung structures and were easily visualized using light microscopic techniques. Agglomerates of deposited welding particles mostly were observed within lung cells, particularly alveolar macrophages. Analysis of individual particles within the agglomerates showed that these particles were metal complexes with iron, chromium, and nickel being the most common metals present. In conclusion, long-term exposure to specific welding fume can lead to serious chronic lung disease characterized by significant particle deposition and persistence as demonstrated in both a human case study and rat model. Not only were the lung responses similar in the human and rat lungs, as evidenced by inflammatory cell influx and pulmonary disease, but the composition of individual welding particles and agglomerations in situ was comparable.

40|$|A técnica de soldagem apresenta vantagem de união de partes metálicas que permite melhora na adaptação e uniformidade na distribuição das forças mastigatórias, minimizando falhas no tratamento reabilitador. O objetivo foi avaliar a resistência {{flexural}} entre três métodos de soldagem diferentes: Chama Direta a maçarico, método TIG - Tungstênio gás inerte (Soldadora NTY - Kernit, Brasil) e o método de solda a Laser (Soldadora Desktop - Dentaurum, Alemanha) comparando a um grupo controle (Monobloco). Os espécimes cilíndricos foram obtidos a partir de canais de cera pré-fabricados com 3 mm de diâmetro e 30 mm de comprimento, fundidos em liga de Ni-Cr e seccionados transversalmente, formando os grupos T 1 e L 1. Depois da secção, dez espécimes dos grupos L e T receberam chanfros em 45 ° para preenchimento, formando os grupos (L 2 e T 2). As extremidades foram unidas com resina acrílica obedecendo a uma distância pré-determinada, de 0, 3 mm para o grupo chama direta, 0, 1 mm para o grupo TIG e juntas do tipo topo a topo para o grupo laser. Os corpos foram incluídos e soldados de acordo com a proposição. Após a soldagem os corpos de prova foram torneados e levados ao teste de flexão. Os dados foram submetidos aos testes estatísticos (ANOVA e Student-Newman-Keuls - p < 0, 05) para comparações múltiplas. De acordo com os resultados (MPa) o grupo M (1796, 55) obteve o maior valor, seguindo pelo grupo C(1370, 56), ficando o grupo T 1 (990, 84) com o valor menor. Não houve diferença estatística entre os grupos soldados, existindo somente diferença entre os grupos de teste para o grupo controle em monobloco. No entanto podemos afirmar que o preenchimento parece influenciar discretamente os resultados da resistência flexural no grupo TIG. Conclui-se que o método TIG produz resultado semelhante ao laser e a chama direta, o que é clínica e operacionalmente importante. The {{welding technique}} presents advantage of union of metallic parts that improves the adaptation and appropriate {{distribution of the}} bite forces, minimizing flaws in the dental prostheses. The objective was to evaluate the flexural strength in different welding methods: Brazing; Laser (Welder Desktop - Dentaurum, Germany) and Tungsten inert <b>gas</b> - TIG (<b>Welder</b> NTY - Kernit, Brazil), comparing to a control group (non-welded). The cylindrical specimens were obtained from prefabricated wax conduits with 3 mm of diameter and 30 mm of length, melted in Ni-Cr alloys and split up transversally, forming the groups T 1 and L 1. After of the section the groups L and T received slices in 45 ° for fulfill, forming the groups (L 2 and T 2). The extremities were united with acrylic resin obeying a predetermined distance, from 0, 3 mm to the brazing group, 0, 1 mm to the TIG group, and in the laser group there wasnt́ any space between the extremities of jointing. The specimes were included and welding {{in agreement with the}} proposition, turned and conducted to the flexion test.

According to the results (MPa) the control group (1796, 55) obtained the largest average value, followed by the brazing group (1370, 56), being the group T 1 (990, 84) with the smallest value. In terms of statistics {{there was no difference between}} the groups with welding, existing only difference among the tested groups for the control group. However, we can affirm that the completion seems to influence the results of the resistance flexural discreetly in the TIG group.
