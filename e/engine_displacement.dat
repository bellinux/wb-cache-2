5|$|Toyota also {{manufactures}} {{and markets}} the Aurion {{in parts of}} East and Southeast Asia, where it is marketed under the Toyota Camry branding. This model gets a redesigned grille and is marketed under different trim levels to their Australasian counterparts. Although these vary from country to country, the range consists of the following models in some markets: 2.0 E, 2.0 G, 2.4 E, 2.4 G, 2.4 Sportivo, 2.4 V, 3.5 V, and 3.5 Q. The decimal in the nomenclature denotes the <b>engine</b> <b>displacement,</b> with the letter representing the level of luxury.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{production}} models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative {{status in the}} Lexus model range (ranking), and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> in liters multiplied {{by a factor of}} one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport' (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV. On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).|$|E
25|$|The Mk I Escort {{was sold}} in Japan, {{imported}} from the United Kingdom by Kintetsu Motors and was available with the 1.3 L engine in GT trim, and was sold alongside the Ford Cortina and the Ford Capri. Sales were helped {{by the fact that}} this generation Escort complied with Japanese government dimension regulations concerning vehicle dimensions and <b>engine</b> <b>displacement.</b> Only the four-door saloon was offered, and this was the only generation available to Japanese buyers. The <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> contributed to a lower annual road tax obligation to Japanese buyers which helped sales.|$|E

5000|$|The {{number on}} the top line begins with a [...] "0" [...] through [...] "9" [...] to {{indicate}} the series, followed by additional numbers for specific vehicle classification. Additional criteria include a numerical representation signifying length, width and height of the vehicle. Broadly speaking, passenger automobiles with <b>engine</b> <b>displacements</b> at or smaller than 2000 cc receive 5-series plates, while passenger automobiles with <b>engine</b> <b>displacements</b> larger than [...] or more receive 3-series license plates.|$|R
5000|$|... "Stroke length", the {{distance}} travelled by the piston in each cycle. The stroke length- along with bore diameter- determines the <b>engine's</b> <b>displacement.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2007, the MotoGP {{class had}} its maximum <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> {{capacity}} reduced to 800cc {{for a minimum}} of five years. For the 2012 season the capacity has increased again to 1,000cc.|$|E
25|$|Launched while Japan {{was in a}} {{recession}} following the 1991 collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, this generation Taurus was exported to Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called Autorama (a joint venture with Mazda), where the sedan and wagon versions with right-hand driving positions until 1997. To Japanese buyers, it {{was regarded as a}} luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> exceeded Japanese Government regulations, and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes. The <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> also put operating costs for Japanese owners in a higher annual road tax obligation.|$|E
25|$|The other chassis {{models were}} renamed too, so the Scania-Vabis B56/B76 became the Scania B80/B110 and the BF56/BF76 became BF80/BF110. The {{numbers in the}} new model designations {{were based on the}} <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> (8 and 11 litre), a scheme that Scania used for almost 40 years.|$|E

25|$|Toyota {{states that}} it filed 1000 patents during the {{development}} of the XW30 Prius. The concept of the powertrain largely carried over from the previous XW20 model, although the <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> was increased to 1.8 litres and the transaxle was changed to the THS III. Disc brakes replaced the North American model's rear drum brakes.|$|E
25|$|This sedan was {{designed}} to be compliant with the Japanese Government's dimension regulations passed in 1950. The <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> was also kept below the 1000cc designation to reduce the annual road tax obligation. Nissan did have an engineering relationship with the Austin Motor Company, and this generation does share some appearance similarities to the Mini, introduced in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Pit bikes {{also have}} their own {{separate}} competitions held with classes generally corresponding to wheel size. This is a notable difference from Motocross and Supercross competition, where classes are separated by <b>engine</b> <b>displacement.</b> Pit bike racing {{is a relatively new}} niche of motocross, and as such, there is no official governing body similar to the AMA.|$|E
50|$|The Suzuki T {{series was}} a series of {{motorcycle}} manufactured by Suzuki that ran from approximately 1963 through 1977 in various <b>engine</b> <b>displacements</b> between 90 and 500 cc.|$|R
50|$|However due to {{the large}} <b>engine</b> <b>displacements,</b> the Avancier was {{considered}} as a mid-size in Japan instead of a wagon, the dimensions also contribute to such classification by Japan.|$|R
25|$|Due to low <b>engine</b> <b>displacements</b> (100cc200cc), {{and high}} power-to-mass ratios, {{motorcycles}} offer good fuel economy. Under conditions of fuel scarcity like 1950s Britain and modern developing nations, motorcycles claim large {{shares of the}} vehicle market.|$|R
25|$|Motorcycles {{and motor}} scooters are {{chargeable}} for VRT {{by reference to}} the <b>engine</b> <b>displacement,</b> {{at a rate of}} €2 per cc for the first 350cc and €1 per cc thereafter. There is a reduction depending on the age of the vehicle, from 10% after three months to 100% (completely remitted) for vehicles over 30 years old.|$|E
25|$|After Clymer's {{death in}} 1970 his widow sold the alleged Indian {{trademark}} to Los Angeles attorney Alan Newman, {{who continued to}} import minicycles made by ItalJet, and later manufactured in a wholly owned assembly plant located in Taipei (Taiwan). Several models with <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> between 50cc and 175cc were produced, mostly fitted with Italian two-stroke engines made either by Italjet or Franco Morini.|$|E
25|$|The tax {{for private}} cars first {{registered}} from July 2008 is calculated {{on the basis}} of carbon dioxide emissions; for cars registered before that, the rate depends on <b>engine</b> <b>displacement.</b> Goods vehicle tax rates are determined based on gross vehicle weight, the tax for buses is {{based on the number of}} seats, and flat rates apply to other types of vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Although Ashok Leyland had {{originally}} announced two different engine types (CNG and diesel), STiLE was manufactured only with diesel engines. STiLE had three variants: LE, LS and LX. All three variants had same <b>engine</b> <b>displacement,</b> bhp and specifications except for seating capacity (LE had 8 seats whereas other two variants had option between 7 and 8 seats) and alloy wheels given {{as an option}} with LS and LX variants.|$|E
25|$|The Honda S2000 is a {{roadster}} {{that was}} manufactured by Japanese company Honda from 1999 to 2009. First shown {{as a concept}} car at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, the production version was launched in April 1999 to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary. The S2000 is named for its <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> of twoliters, carrying on {{in the tradition of}} the S500, S600, and S800 roadsters of the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In Aug 2015, Mahindra & Mahindra {{announced}} TUV300 and the microsite for {{the vehicle}} went live the same month. The vehicle was {{officially launched on}} 15 Sep 2015 in Madhya Pradesh. TUV300 is designed by Mahindra Research Valley and is built on the same platform as the Scorpio. TUV300 also carries the same engine as the XUV500 and Scorpio, but the <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> in the TUV300 is lower, resulting in lower engine power and torque.|$|E
50|$|Geartronic {{is offered}} on Volvo {{vehicles}} with <b>engine</b> <b>displacements</b> of 2.0 liters or greater. Geartronic transmissions are manufactured in Japan by Aisin AW. They {{require the use}} of automatic transmission fluid that meets the JWS 3309 specification. The MY2011 6 speed requires AW1.|$|R
50|$|AMG {{variants}} {{are usually}} badged with two numerals, {{as opposed to}} regular Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which have three (e.g., C 63 as opposed to C 350). Traditionally, the two numerical digits signified the <b>engine's</b> <b>displacement</b> size, however, recent models have deviated from such correlation.|$|R
5000|$|Lightweight, {{also called}} entry level, small or {{beginner}} bikes. Some two strokes {{in this class}} have dramatically higher performance than the four strokes, being likened to miniature superbikes.

25|$|Vehicles {{installed}} {{with the}} 3.5 V6 were longer, while the wheelbase remained unchanged {{for the regular}} versions. As this generation was Mitsubishi's flagship limousine, the bodystyle that was compliant with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> was no longer offered. The suspension was upgraded to MacPherson struts for the front suspension, and the rear suspension used a multilink approach. Much of the technology installed in this generation Debonair was shared with the Mitsubishi GTO.|$|E
25|$|Within a few years, {{a dizzying}} {{assortment}} of technologies {{were being used}} by hundreds of producers all over the western world. Steam, electricity, and petrol/gasoline-powered automobiles competed for decades, with petrol/gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Dual- and even quad-engine cars were designed, and <b>engine</b> <b>displacement</b> ranged {{to more than a}} dozen litres. Many modern advances, including gas/electric hybrids, multi-valve engines, overhead camshafts, and four-wheel drive, were attempted, and discarded at this time.|$|E
