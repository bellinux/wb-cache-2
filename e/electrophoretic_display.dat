25|$|This used tiny microcapsules {{filled with}} {{electrically}} charged white particles suspended in a colored oil. In early versions, the underlying circuitry controlled whether the white particles {{were at the}} top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>display</b> technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} implementation of an <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>display,</b> titanium dioxide (titania) particles approximately one micrometer in diameter are dispersed in a hydrocarbon oil. [...] A dark-colored dye is also {{added to the}} oil, along with surfactants and charging agents that cause the particles to take on an electric charge. [...] This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 micrometres. [...] When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate electrophoretically to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles. [...] When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index titania particles. [...] When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye. [...] If the rear electrode is divided {{into a number of}} small picture elements (pixels), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electrophoretic</b> <b>displays</b> {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} attention recently due to its low cost, low weight, low power consumption and reliability. Based on these characteristics, they are going to replace the conventional paper. <b>Electrophoretic</b> <b>displays</b> are called non- emitting displays based on light particle suspensions. They behave as motion of charged particles in a dielectric fluid towards the electrodes with the opposite charge. Electrical and optical properties of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>displays</b> suspension composition are dependent on the electronic ink that is called E- ink. Thus, key factors in determining image quality depended on electrophoretic particle properties. Enhancing the great image quality for accurate image control and faster response to the voltage applied is dependent on the very small particle size, narrow size distribution and high surface charge of particles. So a lot of research has been done on the modification of particles, surface morphology, surface charge and their stability in media. Therefore, this article reviews the studies of these topics...|$|R
40|$|Power {{is a key}} {{constraint}} in {{the implementation}} of pervasive displays. This work takes the approach of eliminating bat-teries on a display platform through the combination of two trending technologies: Bistable <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>displays,</b> and ambient radio energy harvesting. An <b>electrophoretic</b> (E-ink, E-paper) <b>display</b> is used as part of a sensing, computation, and communication platform. The platform takes advan-tage of the non-volatile nature of <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>displays</b> to enable extremely low power operation, making possible the use of ambient radio frequency energy as a power source to enable battery-free operation and long lifetime. A local user interface, onboard physical sensors, and radio link allow for exciting applications which all require no battery replace-ment or maintenance. 1...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1990s {{another type}} of {{electronic}} ink based on a microencapsulated <b>electrophoretic</b> <b>display</b> was conceived and prototyped {{by a team of}} undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. [...] J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. [...] “It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 mm), quite distinct from the [...] molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.” ...|$|E

50|$|Static flat-panel {{displays}} rely on materials whose color {{states are}} bistable.

40|$|Abstract—Electrophoretic display (EPD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} technologies used in electronic paper. EPDs have good paper-like readability in ambient sunlight, and their bistability characteristics allow them to use very little power. To understand the physical mechanism at work in EPDs in terms of optical phenomena and current responses, we investigated EPD charging behavior using a transient current, an intermediate-state current, a discharge current, and a current bump. After establishing the microcup EPD model, we developed recommendations for a shortened transition time. As our experiments show, the method can reduce the transition time by 20 %.
