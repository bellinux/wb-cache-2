40|$|Introduction: Abutment screw {{loosening}} {{has been}} considered as a common complication of implant-supported dental prostheses. This problem is more important in cement-retained implant restorations due to their invisible position of the screw <b>access</b> <b>opening.</b> Case Report: This report describes a modified retrievability method for cement-retained implant restorations {{in the event of}} abutment screw loosening. The screw <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> was marked with ceramic stain and its porcelain surface was treated using hydrofluoric acid (HF), silane, and adhesive to bond to composite resin. Discussion: The present modified technique facilitates screw <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> and improves the bond between the porcelain and composite resin...|$|R

Justification: NLJREG- 1433 SR 3. 6. 4. 1. 3 has been modified to only require one secondary containment access door per <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> to be closed. This {{is consistent with}} the intent of NUREG- 1434 (BWR/ 6 STS) since the BWRI 6 secondary containment design only includes one door per <b>access</b> <b>opening.</b> The BWR/ 2 - 5 designs normally include two doors per <b>access</b> <b>opening.</b> Verifying tat one door in each <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> is closed ensures that the infiltration of outside air of such a magnitude as to prevent maintaining the desired negative pressure does not occur. The Bases is modified to include a bracketed insert to provide additional description for those plants, which have airlocks with multiple inner or outer doors. The Bases will also be modified to state that the normal condition of the plant is to keep both doors closed, except during entry and exit or when maintenance is being performed on the access. The Bases description is consistent with flx BWR/ 2 - 5 practice. NUREG- 1434 SR 3. 6. 4. 1. 3 has also been modified to allow the one door option, similar to that described above fo...|$|R

40|$|In {{databases}} {{that are}} used for internal operations the data are not organized according to <b>external</b> <b>access</b> criteria. When collaboration with external customers is required the common tools of authentication, authorization, and secure transmission are inadequate to protect against release of inappropriate data. The approach used in the TIHI/SAW projects at Stanford adds a release filter. Such a release filter can be awkward and costly. By driving the filtering primitives through simple rules we allow a security officer to manage the institution policy and balance manual effort and complexity. A byproduct of the approach is a lowered dependence on perfect data management. 1. Introduction There are data sources that are primarily intended for <b>external</b> <b>access,</b> such as public web pages, reports, bibliographies, etc. These are organized according to <b>external</b> <b>access</b> criteria.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a memory}} {{efficient}} Fine Grain Scalability (FGS) coefficient encoding method is proposed {{to reduce the}} <b>external</b> memory <b>access</b> requirement. In the H. 264 /AVC Scalable Video Extension, the FGS coefficients encoding is frame based. However, the frame based mechanism results in the difficulty of hardware implementation due to large internal memory requirements and <b>external</b> memory <b>accesses.</b> Therefore, a non-uniform memory size design which can achieve low <b>external</b> memory <b>access</b> is proposed to realize the macroblock based FGS coefficients encoding. Compared to previous work, our proposed method can save at least 38 KB <b>external</b> memory <b>accesses</b> per frame in average. I...|$|R
