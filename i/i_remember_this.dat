25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas {{entitled}} Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes! I {{remember}} this!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Twenty {{barrels of}} apples, Spiers & Pond. Fifty hams to Coswell's. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this.</b> But what--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes;--to be sure. But there's {{nobody here}} that signifies. How well <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> room;--and the old tower out there. It isn't changed a bit!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{the same}} blood, do you think, sir? <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>this</b> when Mr. Powis {{mentioned}} his father's name, and intended to question cousin Jack on the subject." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> will <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> {{night for}} all the weird things that went with it ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Silent" [...] is {{the first}} single from Gerald Walker's <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> When <b>This</b> All Meant Something....|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> good fellow," [...] {{the earl}} said. [...] "He {{is not one}} easily forgotten, for 'tis seldom one sees so stout a man-at-arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, lawyer, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> {{and other}} things. For instance, that I have the {{safe-conduct}} of the Empress under an oath sworn on the Cross of the Christ she worships. For instance, also, that I have three hundred comrades waiting my safe return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Signore, the same. None other {{bears the}} title now, {{for the old}} line, they say, is drawing to an end. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> same baron, when he was as ready to launch his boat into a troubled lake, as any in Switzerland--" ...|$|E
60|$|The Names {{of those}} English Gentlemen {{who lost their}} Lives, as <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> in <b>this</b> Engagement.|$|R
60|$|JOANNA. <b>I</b> can't <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> man's name; but I am sure {{it begins}} with L.|$|R
60|$|Captain Panke faced us. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>this</b> {{was only}} play, and caught myself {{wondering}} with what keener agony comes the real defeat.|$|R
6000|$|... "My son's are men: one {{follows the}} {{profession}} of arms, one has embraced the ecclesiastical state; my daughter is herself a mother. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> was your birthday; I have made myself a little fete in celebrating it, after how many years of absence, of silence! Comtesse De Florac. (Nee L. de Blois.)" ...|$|E
6000|$|Many Coups looked keenly at Elsie. [...] "My {{eyes are}} old and poor," [...] he slowly said. [...] "But now <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>This</b> {{young woman was}} at the agency last year," [...] and he put up his hand, which was small and graceful even yet--the hand of an artist. [...] "I make {{pictures}} also," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{remember}} about the Eclipse Mine," [...] he said. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> Arnold Baxter, too. He {{was a bad}} one, and if I and some others had our say he would have dangled from a tree for his stealings, for, you see, we didn't have no jails in those days, and stealing was a capital crime." ...|$|E
60|$|Such {{are some}} of the things that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> about <b>this</b> journey, but to tell truth I paid little {{attention}} to them and many others.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning the album's title, bassist Tina Weymouth {{was quoted}} in an 1979 {{interview}} with Creem magazine:When we were making <b>this</b> album <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>this</b> stupid discussion we had about titles for the last album," [...] Tina smirked. [...] "At that time I said, 'What are we gonna call an album that's just about buildings and food?' And Chris said, 'You call it more songs about buildings and food.' ...|$|R
60|$|I winced as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>this</b> {{was exactly}} what I myself had wanted. “Already?” I cried {{with a sort of}} sense that my friend had fled to me for protection.|$|R
60|$|Although <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> {{conversation}} now, my {{head was}} in confusion at the time, and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me. With the same kind intention, manifestly, he often spoke to me of indifferent things, while his face was busy with the one object {{that we had in}} view. He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the garden-gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "But why did I disturb {{you from}} your sleep, Egyptian? Oh! <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> <b>This</b> dwarf {{says that he has}} seen the fairest woman in the whole world, and the most learned, some lady of Egypt, but that he does not know her name, that you alone know her name. I {{disturbed}} you that you might tell it to me but if you have forgotten it, {{you can go back to}} your bed and rest there till it returns to you. There are plenty of boats in the river, Egyptian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What care I what {{he remembers}} {{or what he}} forgets!" [...] she said, turning upon poor Mackinnon indignantly. [...] "You men grovel so in your ideas--" [...] "And yet," [...] as Mackinnon said afterwards, [...] "she had been telling me that I was a fool {{for the last three}} weeks."--"You men grovel so in your ideas, that you cannot {{understand}} the feelings of a true-hearted woman. What can his forgetfulness or his remembrance be to me? Must not <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> insult? Is it possible that I should forget it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{rather a}} good memory," [...] replied Lothair; [...] "and {{it is not}} {{wonderful}} that <b>I</b> should <b>remember</b> <b>this,</b> {{for it is the}} only present that ever was made me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> after <b>this,</b> a {{pause in}} the conversation, during which she seemed {{struggling}} with thoughts and emotions; and, for my part, I was unable to utter a word, or ask a question.|$|R
60|$|Again I had no {{questions}} to ask, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>this</b> nurse {{was a person}} who for a long while had been employed by Sir John Bell, and one over whom he very probably had some hold.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{mother was}} up-stairs with father; and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain's return, when the parlour door opened, {{and a man}} stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand; and, though he wore a cutlass, {{he did not look}} much like a fighter. I had always my eye open for {{seafaring}} men, with one leg or two, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too.|$|E
60|$|Now for the pictures. I {{take another}} sheet {{and begin to}} jot notes for them when my {{imagination}} serves: I will run through the book, writing when I have an idea. There, I have jotted enough to give the artist a notion. Of course, I don't do more than contribute ideas, but I {{will be happy to}} help in any and every way. I may as well add another idea; when the artist finds nothing much to illustrate, a good drawing of any OBJECT mentioned in the text, were it only a loaf of bread or a candlestick, is a most delightful thing to a young child. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> keenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{are friends}} for?" [...] asked Miss Lucretia, patting her hand. [...] "If you had known how I wished to see you, Cynthia, and I thought a little trip {{would be good}} for such a provincial Bostonian as I am. Dear, dear, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> house. It used to belong to Gabriel Post in my time, and right across from it was the Social Library, where I have spent so many {{pleasant}} hours with your mother. And this is Ephraim Prescott. I thought it was, when I saw him sitting in the front row, and I think he must have been very lonesome there at one time." ...|$|E
6000|$|He helped Norcross mount his horse, {{and as he}} put {{the lead}} rope into Berrie's hand, he said: with much feeling: [...] "Good luck to you. <b>I</b> shall <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> night {{all the rest of}} my life." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat up in}} bed, appalled. I {{dared not}} call aloud or ring for Jane to come to me. But if I'd seen a ghost, it could hardly have {{affected}} me more profoundly than this ghost of my own dead life thus brought suddenly back to me. Gazing away across some illimitable vista of dim years, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>this</b> one scene as something that once occurred, long ago, to my very self, in my own experience. Then came a vast gulf, an unbridged abyss: and after that, with a vividness as of yesterday, the murder.|$|R
50|$|All {{musicians who}} worked with Ernest Element agree {{that he was a}} great artist.... But most of all <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> what <b>this</b> man showed me without effort - the supreme value of selflessness in art. This is what made him great".|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning we moved on, well refreshed and in good spirits. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> day with peculiar pleasure, because it saw our road restored to us. Yes, we found our road again, and in quite an extraordinary way. We had plodded along some two hours and a half, when we came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high. I {{did not need to}} be instructed by a mule this time. I was already beginning to know more than any mule in the Expedition. I at once put in a blast of dynamite, and lifted that rock out of the way. But to my surprise and mortification, I found that there had been a chalet on top of it.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the next}} year I worked as few have done, and when I struck a balance {{at the end of}} it, I found that on the most {{conservative}} estimate I was the owner of {{a million and a half}} in hard cash, or its equivalent. I was so tired out that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> discovery did not excite me at all. I felt utterly weary of all wealth-hunting and of the City and its ways. Moreover my old fastidiousness and lack of perseverance re-asserted themselves. I reflected, rather late in the day perhaps, on the ruin that this speculation was bringing to thousands, of which some lamentable instances had recently come to my notice, and once more considered whether it were a suitable career for an upright man. I had wealth; why should I not take it and enjoy life? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 128. Now had I an evidence, 'as I thought, of my salvation' from heaven, {{with many}} golden seals thereon, all hanging in my sight; now could <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> manifestation {{and the other}} {{discovery}} of grace, with comfort; and should often long and desire that the last day were come, that I might for ever be inflamed with the sight, and joy, and communion with him whose head was crowned with thorns, whose face was spit on, and body broken, and soul made an offering for my sins: for whereas, before, I lay continually trembling {{at the mouth of}} hell, now methought I was got so far therefrom that I could not, when I looked back, scarce discern it; and, oh! thought I, that I were fourscore years old now, that I might die quickly, that my soul might be gone to rest.[32] ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010 Gerald Walker {{released}} his second official mixtape, <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> When <b>This</b> All Meant Something.... The mixtape consist of fifteen original tracks including three hidden bonus songs featuring production from, Symbolyc One, producer of Kanye West's 2010 single Power.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>this</b> man had had {{the audacity}} to {{complain}} of our gardener's obstinacy, my tongue itched to [...] "go on" [...] in other words than my mistress's. This time, however, my Christianity held firm. I proceeded steadily with her ladyship's letter: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{discretion}} itself," [...] Delora said. [...] "Some day <b>I</b> will <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> {{as a joke}} against you. Have {{you been}} reading Gaboriau, my young friend, or his English disciples? This is your own city--London--the most law-abiding place on God's earth." ...|$|R
