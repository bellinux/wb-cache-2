6000|$|When {{a man is}} honoured by such {{a request}} as that which reached me from the {{authorities}} of your institution some time ago, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that occurs to him is that which occurred {{to those who were}} bidden to the feast in the Gospel--to begin to make an excuse; and probably all the excuses suggested on that famous occasion crop up in his mind one after the other, including his [...] "having married a wife," [...] as reasons for not doing what he is asked to do. But, in my own case, and on this particular occasion, there were other difficulties of a sort peculiar to the time, and more or less personal to myself; because I felt that, if I came amongst you, I should be expected, and, indeed, morally compelled, to speak upon the subject of Scientific Education. And then there arose in my mind the recollection of a fact, which probably no one here but myself remembers; namely, that some fourteen years ago I was the guest of a citizen of yours, who bears the honoured name of Rathbone, at a very charming and pleasant dinner given by the Philomathic Society; and I there and then, and in this very city, made a speech upon the topic of Scientific Education. Under these circumstances, you see, one runs two dangers--the first, of repeating one's self, although I may fairly hope that everybody has forgotten the fact I have just now mentioned, except myself; and the second, and even greater difficulty, is the danger of saying something different from what one said before, because then, however forgotten your previous speech may be, somebody finds out its existence, and there goes on that process so hateful to members of Parliament, which may be denoted by the term [...] "Hansardisation." [...] Under these circumstances, I {{came to the conclusion that}} the best thing I could do was to take the bull by the horns, and to [...] "Hansardise" [...] myself,--to put before you, in the briefest possible way, the three or four propositions which I endeavoured to support on the occasion of the speech to which I have referred; and then to ask myself, supposing you were asking me, whether I had anything to retract, or to modify, in them, in virtue of the increased experience, and, let us charitably hope, the increased wisdom of an added fourteen years.|$|E

Id like to say, first, it is not vocational education. Many people think that that is what it is; its not trade training for workers. Thats entirely separate, should supplement workers education and go along with it. But it is not the same thing. Workers education is a specialized branch of adult education. It covers in general the economic and labor problems related to the experience of industrial workers, office workers, farmers, anything that touches the economic field. It is also and usually supplemented with much work in English, with elementary science, social psychology, with history, with a background of life in the United States. It touches: employers problems, trade union problems, the worker in the community as citizen, the governments relation to industry and to the labor movement." ...|$|E

5000|$|All {{records for}} Tiffany Studios were lost after it {{closed in the}} early 1930s. It was only through the {{combined}} efforts of Martin Eidelberg (professor emeritus of art history at Rutgers University), Nina Gray (another independent scholar and former curator at the New-York Historical Society), and Margaret K. Hofer (curator of decorative arts, New-York Historical Society), that the involvement of Clara Driscoll and other [...] "Tiffany Girls" [...] in designing Tiffany lamps was widely publicized. However, a book published in 2002 entitled Tiffany Desk Treasures, by George A. Kemeny and Donald Miller, had already named Clara Driscoll as the designer of Tiffany's signature Dragonfly lampshade, {{as well as a}} significant contributor to Tiffany Glass—four years before Eidelberg and Gray went public with their discovery in 2006. The book also cited Driscoll as being one of the highest-paid women of her time, earning $10,000 per year.While doing research for a book on Tiffany at the Queens Historical Society, Gray found the historically valuable letters written by Driscoll to her mother and sisters during the time she was employed at Tiffany. The New York Times quoted Gray as saying: [...] "They brought out two books and several boxes, all letters, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I read was about how she had designed a daffodil lamp. And I started squealing. At the top it said something like ‘Noon at Tiffany’s,’ so it was during her lunch hour. What do you do with something like that?”Martin Eidelberg had independently seen the correspondence when he was approached by a descendent of Clara Driscoll after a lecture. The two historians compared notes after they crossed paths at Kent State University, where they were both tracking down more of Driscoll's correspondence. Their conclusion was beyond doubt. It was Clara Driscoll and the [...] "Tiffany Girls" [...] who had created many of the Tiffany lamps originally attributed to Louis Comfort Tiffany and his staff of male designers.|$|E

She briefly stayed at the Nashoba Commune, a utopian settlement for ex-slaves which Wright had set up in Tennessee, where she was dismayed by the primitive conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Refn {{has spoken}} about {{characterization}} in his films: I've always liked characters {{that because of}} the circumstances, have to transform themselves, and in the end, it's inevitable that what they end up becoming is what they were meant to be. Take, for example, Pusher II, which is a movie about a son by Mads Mikkelsen who all his life wants his father's love, but realizes he needs to kill him to free the sins of the father from him. What plants the seed for him is realizing he has his own child, and the responsibility of that suddenly forces him to take action. And it's a happy ending, even though it's a dark ending, but for the character, it is what he was meant to become. It's almost like he achieved his true meaning. And Drive is similar in the sense that The Driver was meant to become a superhero, and he's denied all these things—relationships, companionship. And why would he be denied that? It was because he was meant for something greater. [...] Refn prefers to shoot his films in chronological order: [...] "I read that John Cassavetes had done it on some of his films, so I thought, 'That's a pretty cool approach.' And after I did it on my first movie, I felt, 'How can you do a movie any other way?' It's like a painting—you paint the movie as you go along, and I like the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how it's going to turn out." [...] Refn spoke more about shooting in chronological order in September 2011, in reference to Drive: It's always difficult with production. All my films previous to Drive had been shot in what I call 100-percent almost-chronological order. Where Drive is like 80 percent. The reason why it didn't go 100 was that I just simply couldn't afford the last remaining pieces. I could afford what I call [...] "the emotional chronological order". So nobody would die or leave the movie {{in the middle of their}} shooting schedule. It would always be the end. So there was a build-up as much as possible. [...] On his approach to working with actors, Refn has said: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I ask any actor is what they would like to do, which sometimes can frighten people or can be looked upon as, 'Oh, you don't know what you want.' But I try to draw the actor in—to force them in, in some cases, because a lot of actors don't want to discuss things or go in deep; they just want to come and do the work, play their part and walk away. But for me, it doesn't work like that. You've got to get absorbed and dirty, and a way to do that is to ask the actor what they would like to do. It also forces them to be more truthful. [...] Refn's color blindness has influenced his style: [...] "I can't see mid-colors. That's why all my films are very contrasted, if it were anything else I couldn't see it." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{latter part}} of the {{activity}} was a well grounded part in which students used all of the data, but for a smaller area of the globe.

I believe this to be true mainly because of the spatial difficulties students exhibit at this age. Therefore, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> part needs to be scaffolded to promote less frustration among students. ...|$|R
