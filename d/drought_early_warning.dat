40|$|Drought {{assessment}} {{is essential for}} coping with frequent droughts nowadays. Owing to the large spatio-temporal variations in hydrometeorology in most regions in China, it is very necessary to use a physically-based hydrological model to produce rational spatial and temporal distributions of hydro-meteorological variables for drought assessment. In this study, the large-scale distributed hydrological model Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) was coupled with a modified standardized runoff index (SRI) for drought assessment in the Weihe River basin, northwest China. The result indicates that the coupled model is capable of reasonably reproducing the spatial distribution of drought occurrence. It reflected the spatial heterogeneity of regional drought and improved the physical mechanism of SRI.

Both the literature review and the survey reveal that impact monitoring does exist but has rarely been systematized. Efforts to test drought indicators have mostly focused on agricultural drought. Our review points to a current trend towards the design and use of composite indicators, but with limited evaluation of the links between indicators and drought impacts. Overall, we find that much progress has been made both in research and practice on drought indicators, but monitoring and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems are not yet strongly linked with the assessment of wider impacts on the environment and society.

40|$|Effective <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> {{systems are}} an {{integral}} part of efforts worldwide to improve drought preparedness. Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is your assessment of the current status of <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems? 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems? 3. How can <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems as a first step in evaluating the status of early warning systems. Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public. Leadership for <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems is provided principally by meteorological or agricultural services. In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions.

It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence.

Droughts {{typically}} evolve slowly, but have the potential to cover very large areas compared to hazards like hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, which have a much smaller geographic footprint. The U. S. took first steps in 2006 toward developing coordinated and integrated DEWS through the creation of the National Integrated Drought Information System, or NIDIS. More recently, the National Drought Mitigation Center ([URL] has been working with NIDIS and other international parties (WMO, GEO, United Nations, etc.) with a goal of developing a virtual and comprehensive global <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system (GEWS). The NDMC’s mission is to work to reduce societal vulnerability to drought by helping decision makers at all levels to: implement <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, understand and prevent drought impacts and increase long-term resilience to drought through proactive planning. The NDMC is a national center founded in 1995 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

40|$|<b>Drought</b> {{monitoring}} and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> {{is an important}} measure to enhance resilience towards drought. While there are numerous operational systems using different drought indicators, {{there is no consensus}} on which indicator best represents drought impact occurrence for any given sector. Furthermore, thresholds are widely applied in these indicators but, to date, little empirical evidence exists as to which indicator thresholds trigger impacts on society, the economy, and ecosystems. The main obstacle for evaluating commonly used drought indicators is a lack of information on drought impacts. Our aim was therefore to exploit text-based data from the European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII) to identify indicators that are meaningful for region-, sector-, and season-specific impact occurrence, and to empirically determine indicator thresholds. In addition, we tested the predictability of impact occurrence based on the best-performing indicators. To achieve these aims we applied a correlation analysis and an ensemble regression tree approach, using Germany and the UK (the most data-rich countries in the EDII) as test beds. As candidate indicators we chose two meteorological indicators (Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI, and Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index, SPEI) and two hydrological indicators (streamflow and groundwater level percentiles). The analysis revealed that accumulation periods of SPI and SPEI best linked to impact occurrence are longer for the UK compared with Germany, but there is variability within each country, among impact categories and, to some degree, seasons. The median of regression tree splitting values, which we regard as estimates of thresholds of impact occurrence, was around − 1 for SPI and SPEI in the UK; distinct differences between northern/northeastern vs. southern/central regions were found for Germany. Predictions with the ensemble regression tree approach yielded reasonable results for regions with good impact data coverage. The predictions also provided insights into the EDII, in particular highlighting drought events where missing impact reports may reflect a lack of recording rather than true absence of impacts. Overall, the presented quantitative framework proved to be a useful tool for evaluating drought indicators, and to model impact occurrence. In summary, this study demonstrates the information gain for <b>drought</b> {{monitoring and}} <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> through impact data collection and analysis. It highlights the important role that quantitative analysis with impact data can have in providing "ground truth" for drought indicators, alongside more traditional stakeholder-led approaches...|$|R

These life-saving responses are increas-ingly important: In 2006, one out of eight people {{did not have enough}} food to eat and 22 million more people became sufficiently undernourished to require intervention, prompting 22 countries to provide $ 6. 5 bil-lion in food aid. Since their inception in the mid- 1980 s, the combination of monitoring and mitigation systems has dramatically reduced the number of famines caused by biophysical hazards, such as floods, drought, and pests, that destroy food crops [Murphy and McAfee, 2005]. Yet despite this notable achievement, many countries, mostly in Africa, face chronic and increas-ing food insecurity. The motivation is strong therefore to increase the effectiveness of food aid, and to ensure that the assistance arrives suffi-ciently early to ward off human and eco-nomic catastrophe. Remote sensing infor-mation that is properly interpreted reduces the influence of politics in determining the amount and location of aid delivered, ensuring that the aid goes only where it is needed.

40|$|Drought {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on civilization throughout history in terms of reductions in agricultural productivity, potable water supply, and economic activity, and in extreme cases this has led to famine. Every continent has semiarid areas, which are especially vulnerable to drought. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has noted that average annual river runoff and water availability are projected to decrease by 10 %– 13 % over some dry and semiarid regions in mid and low latitudes, increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of drought, along with its associated impacts. The sheer magnitude of the problem demands efforts to reduce vulnerability to drought by moving away from the reactive, crisis management approach of the past toward a more proactive, risk management approach that is centered on reducing vulnerability to drought as much as possible while providing early warning of evolving drought conditions and possible impacts. Many countries, unfortunately, do not have adequate resources to provide early warning, but require outside support to provide the necessary early warning information for risk management. Furthermore, in an interconnected world, the need for information at global scale is crucial for understanding the prospect of declines in agricultural productivity and associated impacts on food prices, food security, and potential for civil conflict. This paper highlights the recent progress made toward a Global <b>Drought</b> <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> Monitoring Framework (GDEWF), an underlying partnership and framework, along with its Global <b>Drought</b> <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> System (GDEWS), which is its interoperable information system, and the organizations that have begun working together to make it a reality. The GDEWF aims to improve existing regional and national drought monitoring and forecasting capabilities by adding a global component, facilitating continental monitoring and forecasting (where lacking), and improving these tools at various scales, thereby increasing the capacity of national and regional institutions that lack <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems or complementing existing ones.

40|$|Drought {{indicators}} {{are used as}} triggers for action {{and so are the}} foundation of <b>drought</b> monitoring and <b>early</b> <b>warning.</b> The computation of drought indicators like the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized streamflow index (SSI) require a statistical probability distribution to be fitted to the observed data. Both precipitation and streamflow have a lower bound at zero, and their empirical distributions tend to have positive skewness. For deriving the SPI, the Gamma distribution has therefore often been a natural choice. The concept of the SSI is newer and there is no consensus regarding distribution. In the present study, twelve different probability distributions are fitted to streamflow and catchment average precipitation for four durations (1, 3, 6, and 12 months), for 121 catchments throughout the United Kingdom. The more flexible three- and four-parameter distributions generally do not have a lower bound at zero, and hence may attach some probability to values below zero. As a result, there is a censoring of the possible values of the calculated SPIs and SSIs. This can be avoided by using one of the bounded distributions, such as the reasonably flexible three-parameter Tweedie distribution, which has a lower bound (and potentially mass) at zero. The Tweedie distribution has only recently been applied to precipitation data, and only for a few sites. We find it fits both precipitation and streamflow data nearly as well as the best of the traditionally used three-parameter distributions, and should improve the accuracy of drought indices used for monitoring and <b>early</b> <b>warning...</b>|$|R

This paper highlights {{the need for a}} Global <b>Drought</b> <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> System (GDEWS), the elements that constitute its underlying framework (GDEWF) and the recent progress made towards its development. Many countries lack drought monitoring systems, as well as the capacity to respond via appropriate political, institutional and technological frameworks, and these have inhibited the development of integrated drought management plans or early warning systems. The GDEWS will provide a source of drought tools and products via the GDEWF for countries and regions to develop tailored <b>drought</b> <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems for their own users. A key goal of a GDEWS is to maximize the lead time for early warning, allowing drought managers and disaster coordinators more time to put mitigation measures in place to reduce the vulnerability to drought. To address this, the GDEWF will take both a top-down approach to provide global real-time drought monitoring and seasonal forecasting, and a bottom-up approach that builds upon existing national and regional systems to provide continental to global coverage. A number of challenges must be overcome, however, before a GDEWS can become a reality, including the lack of in-situ measurement networks and modest seasonal forecast skill in many regions, and the lack of infrastructure to translate data into useable information.

The newly built short-term/long-term CDI comprehensively considered three natural forms of drought (meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural) by selection of different variables that are related to each drought type. The short-term/long-term CDI was developed using the Principle Component Analysis of related drought components. The thresholds of the short-term/long-term CDI were determined according to frequency statistics of different drought indices. Finally, the feasibility of the two CDI was investigated against the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, and the historical drought records. The results revealed that the short-term/long-term CDI could capture the onset, severity, and persistence of drought events very well with the former being better at identifying the dynamic evolution of drought condition and the latter better at judging the changing trend of drought over a long time period...|$|R
40|$|Drought is {{a natural}} hazard that is often {{referred}} to as a creeping phenomenon. <b>Drought</b> monitoring and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> is very essential in identifying climate and water supply trends and thus to detect the probability of occurrence and the anticipated severity of drought. This paper reviews the literature on developing a methodology to assess drought severity, monitor and prediction of droughts in the future. Thirty (30) meteorological stations across Victoria, Australia were selected. Drought Indices (DIs) have been commonly used to quantify drought conditions and meteorological drought indices were considered for further analysis based on literature for this study. Several regionalisation techniques such as Cluster Analysis, Discriminant Analysis and Andrews’ curve will be applied in order to cluster each region with the similar drought characteristics. Catchment physiographical characteristics such as mean annual precipitation, mean seasonal precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and Standardised Precipitation Index values. Drought severity – duration - frequency curves for each region will be developed in order to provide information in a manner that is suitable for different drought affected groups. The best drought forecasting tool applicable to Victoria will be selected to forecast short and long term drought conditions. In addition, a method of parameter updating based on real time will be also developed...|$|R
40|$|Droughts {{have severe}} impacts on societies, economies, {{agriculture}} and ecosystems and forward planning {{is critical for}} managing the impacts of <b>drought,</b> since <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> enables stakeholders to curb demand and to effectively manage diminishing water resources. Improved forecasts on drought management (monthly to seasonal) and planning timescales (seasonal to decadal) would be exceptionally valuable for effective drought management and for minimising the negative impacts of droughts. This paper presents an agent-based microsimulation model which has been developed to estimate {{the results of a}} range of scenarios of domestic demand under drought conditions. The model is intended to enable water resource management practitioners to assess the likely impact of potential interventions in particular catchment areas or water resource zones. The model is intended to be driven by seasonal forecasts of potential future hydrological droughts based on novel climate and groundwater models. However the current version of the model is driven by reconstructed seasonal drought histories for three UK catchment areas from 1994 to 2012. This provides a framework of five drought phases (Normal, Developing, Drought, Severe Drought, Recovering) which are mapped to policy driven interventions such as increased provision of water efficiency technologies, media messaging and ultimately temporary water use bans. The model draws on a range of evidence from the water resource management, economic, behavioural and social science literatures to embed a ‘Water Cultures’ framework into a microsimulation model. The paper will present the model logic and the results of baseline projections under ‘all normal’ conditions together with the results of a sensitivity analysis. We will then present the results of running the model over the 1994 - 2012 reconstructed drought histories to demonstrate the potential value of the model in supporting cost-benefit analysis of specific interventions. We will conclude by discussing future directions for the work. <br/...|$|R
