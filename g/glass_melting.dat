40|$|A {{method for}} the {{prediction}} of gas evolution from a <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> during fining processes has been described. This procedure {{is based on the}} assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium conditions between the species in the <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> and co-existing gas phases. The method has been applied to estimate (a) the onset temperature of fining and (b) the evolution of different gases from <b>glass</b> <b>melts.</b> Both are strongly dependent on water concentration in the melt, the temperature, and the content of fining agent (sulfates). Expressions for foam bubble lifetimes have been presented, and a combination of these equations with gas evolution rates has been used in a foam formation model. This model calculates the number of bubble layers on top of <b>glass</b> <b>melts</b> during secondary foaming (foam formation during fining). A key parameter for foam stability and the foam layer thickness is the mobility of the surfaces of the lamellae of the bubbles in the foam layers.

25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during <b>glass</b> <b>melting</b> should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E

Corrosion of the molybdenum electrode in <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> without AC load is higher by one order of magnitude if antimony oxides are present. The corrosion continues to increase if sulfate is present in addition to antimony oxides. Isolated antimony droplets largely occur on the electrode-glass melt interface, and numerous droplets are also dissipated in the surrounding glass if only antimony oxides {{are present in the}} <b>glass</b> <b>melt.</b> A comparatively continuous layer of antimony occurs on the interface if SO 3 is also present, antimony being always in contact with molybdenum sulfide. Almost no antimony droplets are dissipated in the <b>glass</b> <b>melt.</b> The total amount of precipitated antimony also increases. The presence of sulfide on the interface likely facilitates antimony precipitation. The reaction of molybdenum with antimony oxides is inhibited in sites covered by an antimony layer. The composition of sulfide layers formed at 1400 °C approximates that of Mo 2 S 3. At 1100 °C, the sulfide composition approximates that of MoS 4. Corrosion multiplies in the <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> without additions through the effect of AC current, most molybdenum being separated in the form of metallic particles. Corrosion also increases in the <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> containing antimony oxides. This is due to increased corrosion in the neighborhood of the separated antimony droplets.

Reduction of volatilization to lower dust and heavy metal emissions, to minimize the refractory attack by the aggressive volatile components, and to limit depletion of volatile glass components at the <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> surface is of great technological importance.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The {{electromagnetic}} {{flow control}} of fluids with high electrical conductivity like liquid metals {{has been investigated}} so far and is well established in industrial processes. The application of electromagnetic (Lorentz) forces in fluids with a low electrical conductivity such as <b>glass</b> <b>melts</b> is a comparably new topic. The Lorentz force in <b>glass</b> <b>melts</b> can be generated by the interaction of an imposed electrical current and an external magnetic field. Basically, the Lorentz force {{can be used to}} regulate the mass flow rate in a duct or a pipe or to improve the mixing. This theoretical work addresses both applications in <b>glass</b> <b>melts</b> and focuses on the consideration of the temperature-dependent viscosity and electrical conductivity. In the first main part of the thesis the pipe flow of <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> is studied on the basis of an one-dimensional analytical model. The flow is influenced by Lorentz force and gravity as well as temperature variation due to wall heat loss, electrical heating, advection, and heat diffusion. For high and very low driving forces the mean velocity is found to be proportional to the forces as known from laminar pipe flow with constant material properties. In between these two regimes, however, a new flow regime is identified. If there are no heat losses through the wall, the mean velocity is proportional to the square root of the driving force. In the presence of wall heat loss the solution for the steady flow is even found to be non-unique, and to involve bifurcations. This nonlinear behavior is shown to be a result of the closed-loop interaction between the velocity, temperature, and temperature-dependent material properties. The results of the analytical model are validated by two-dimensional axisymmetric numerical simulations. The non-unique flow characteristic could be observed in a simple non-magnetic experiment. In the second main part of the thesis three-dimensional numerical simulations of <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> in a small scale crucible heated by two rod electrodes are presented. The Lorentz force leads to an overall increase of the kinetic energy and, if it is the dominating driving force, the mean velocity is found to be an almost linear function of the Lorentz force. The transition from a buoyancy dominated flow regime to a Lorentz force dominated one and vice versa is characterized by a hysteresis. One obtains two steady solutions for one set of parameters depending on the starting conditions of the steady calculations. The threedimensional problem is then reduced to an one-dimensional set of algebraic equations describing steady buoyancy driven laminar flow of <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> in a closed loop under the influence of a localized Lorentz force. The loop is a highly simplified representation of a closed streamline in <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> flow in the small scale crucible or a real furnace. The model reveals the role of temperature-dependent viscosity and conductivity in <b>glass</b> <b>melt</b> flows in a pure form that is not visible in full numerical simulations. Finally, the results obtained with the different approaches are compared with each other...|$|R
