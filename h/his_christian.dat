5|$|Bohemond {{concluded}} {{an alliance}} with Gumushtekin, atabeg of Aleppo, against Saladin, the Ayyubid ruler of Egypt and Syria, in May 1176. On Bohemond's demand, Gumushtekin released <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> prisoners, including Bohemond's stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon.

5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, executions by {{elephants}} {{were used by}} several West Asian imperial powers, including the Byzantine, Sassanid, Seljuq and Timurid empires. When the Sassanid king Khosrau II, who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, {{the daughter of the}} Christian Arab Na'aman, Na'aman refused to permit <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> daughter to enter the harem of a Zoroastrian; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.|$|E
5|$|Following his baptism, Edwin's Northumbrian priests {{were in a}} {{position}} to be able to suppress pagan practices in Eorpwald's kingdom and convert the East Anglians. The conversion had the general political benefit of bringing the entire eastern seaboard from Northumbria to Kent, with the exception of Essex, under the dominion of Edwin and <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> allies.|$|E
5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr., January 15, 1929– April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist {{minister}} and activist {{who became the}} most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement.

5|$|Nigerian guerrillas {{arrive at}} a small village, grab a young boy named Yemi and try {{to force him to}} shoot an old man. The boy hesitates and his older brother, Eko, takes the gun and shoots the man himself, thus saving his brother from the act. The guerrillas are pleased with this, and force him to join their group, tearing <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> cross from his neck, which is then taken by Yemi.|$|E
5|$|Primus, who {{is married}} and has three children, is known for <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> charity work. He is {{involved}} in the Christian charity 'Faith & Football' and walked the Great Wall of China to raise £100,000 for their cause.

In 2007, he released his autobiography, titled Transformed, which details his conversion to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to question <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien's {{portrayal}} of goblins in The Hobbit was particularly influenced by George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin. However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole {{thinking on the}} role of fantasy within <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> faith.|$|E
5|$|After Arghun's death, he was {{followed}} {{in rapid succession}} by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam {{when he took the}} throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} over the clan's origins, Samuel undoubtedly descended from a distinguished family, since an unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} marriage {{to a member of}} the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still debate whether Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, he must have been born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. <b>His</b> <b>Christian</b> credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E

5|$|Hulagu Khan, a {{grandson}} of Genghis Khan, was an avowed shamanist, but was nevertheless very tolerant of Christianity. His mother Sorghaghtani Beki, his favorite wife Doquz Khatun, {{and several of}} his closest collaborators were Nestorian Christians. One of his most important generals, Kitbuqa, was a Nestorian Christian of the Naiman tribe. Military collaboration between the Mongols and their Christian vassals became substantial in 1258–1260. Hulagu's army, with the forces of <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> subjects Bohemond VI of Antioch, Hethum I of Armenia, and the Christian Georgians, effectively destroyed two of the most powerful Muslim dynasties of the era: the Abbasids in Baghdad and the Ayyubids in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Eorpwald's life or of his short reign, as little {{documentary}} evidence about the East Anglian kingdom has survived. The primary source for Eorpwald is the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the 8th century. Soon after becoming king, Eorpwald received Christian teaching and was baptised in 627 or 632. Soon after his conversion {{he was killed by}} Ricberht, a pagan noble, who may have succeeded him and ruled for three years. The motive for Eorpwald's assassination was probably political as well as religious. He was the first early English king to suffer death as a consequence of <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> faith and was subsequently venerated by the Church as a saint and martyr.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} the pope is {{verified}} by the Cardinal Camerlengo, or Chamberlain, who traditionally performed the task by calling out <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> (not papal) name {{three times in the}} presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, and of the Cleric Prelates, Secretary and Chancellor of the Apostolic Camera. The Cardinal Camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman worn by the pope; the ring, along with the papal seal, is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals. The tradition originated to avoid forgery of documents, but today merely is a symbol of the end of the pope's reign.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Cairo in April 1999, Bok {{was directed to}} Sacred Heart Catholic Church. This church was well known among the Dinka in Khartoum {{as a place of}} refuge in Cairo. While staying at Sacred Heart, Bok began to learn some English and made important contacts among the Dinka population of Cairo. He also began practicing <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> faith without fear of reprisal. He eventually moved out of the church compound and into an apartment with other Dinka who were also seeking UN refugee status in order to leave Africa for the United States, Great Britain or Australia.|$|E
5|$|Vytautas became duke of Hrodna and Podlaskie; Jogaila known now by <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> name Władysław II (Władysław II Jagiełło) {{designated}} {{his brother}} Skirgaila regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila, who also ruled Vytautas' patrimony in Trakai, was disliked by the Lithuanian nobility. Vytautas, {{on the other}} hand, became increasingly popular; Władysław II began {{to see him as}} a rival. Vytautas was supported by Lithuanians who resented the Polish interpretation of the recent Union of Krewo. These Lithuanians wished to maintain distinct legal structures and reserve official posts for Lithuanians. The Lithuanian elites also resented the changes in government that king Władysław II implemented there.|$|E
5|$|Although further persecutionary edicts followed, {{compelling}} {{the arrest}} of the Christian clergy and universal acts of sacrifice, the persecutionary edicts were ultimately unsuccessful; most Christians escaped punishment, and pagans too were generally unsympathetic to the persecution. The martyrs' sufferings strengthened the resolve of their fellow Christians. Constantius and Maximian did not apply the later persecutionary edicts, and left the Christians of the West unharmed. Galerius rescinded the edict in 311, announcing that the persecution had failed to bring Christians back to traditional religion. The temporary apostasy of some Christians, and the surrendering of scriptures, during the persecution {{played a major role}} in the subsequent Donatist controversy. Within twenty-five years of the persecution's inauguration, the Christian Emperor Constantine would rule the empire alone. He would reverse the consequences of the edicts, and return all confiscated property to Christians. Under Constantine's rule, Christianity would become the empire's preferred religion. Diocletian was demonized by <b>his</b> <b>Christian</b> successors: Lactantius intimated that Diocletian's ascendancy heralded the apocalypse, and in Serbian mythology, Diocletian is remembered as Dukljan, the adversary of God.|$|E
