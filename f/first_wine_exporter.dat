40|$|China {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} wine markets in the world. Wine businesses from major wine-producing countries have been focusing on this market. New Zealand, as the fastest growing wine producer in the New World countries, has targeted East Asia, especially China, as an export destination. However, the market share and reputation of New Zealand wines has not been very high and many New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> have neither understood the Chinese market very well, nor successfully set up their export business there. The findings of this study will inform current and potential <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> from New Zealand of effective market entry procedures. A qualitative methodology was employed to identify the key elements of exporting New Zealand wine to China. Fourteen businesses, including eleven New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> and three China-based wine import distributors were interviewed. The data was analysed using qualitative data methods. The study found that New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> have used four market entry modes, chosen according to the different characteristics of their businesses: indirect exporting, direct exporting, joint venture, and acquisition. This study also identified key elements in successfully exporting New Zealand wine to China, including the selection of market entry modes, distribution channels, and suitable importer/distributors, the initial organisation of the wine export process, and the development of business relationships. Challenges to this success have also been identified, such as the current Chinese preference for red wines, the small scale of the New Zealand wine industry, the orientation towards short-term profit by Chinese traders, and identifying suitable business partners. Recommendations are also made for the development of successful export business by New Zealand wine producers in the future. Key words: market entry, wine export, China wine market...|$|R

This paper is a summary of the research developed during 2004 - 2006 at the UPM with Argentinean exporters. The selection of UK market was due to the high degree of competition between international wines: European, American, Australian and others. Secondary information was collected from EU and Argentina publication and data bases. Primary information was obtained through face to face interviews with the main stakeholders and <b>wine</b> <b>exporter</b> entrepreneurs. UK <b>wine</b> market {{is one of the more}} competitive in the world and the main destinations of Argentinean exports. The presentation describes the strengths and weaknesses of the more significant <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> with a SWOT matrix analysis. Argentina has comparative advantages in wine production but the main problem is the wine network exporting performance. The challenge is how to design adequate strategies, involving public and private national resources and get adequate quota market in the coming future. Some specific recommendations are related to: Firms and country commercial brands, relationship exporters-UK retailers, trade brands shared by producers and commercial agents, promotion and publicity of Argentinean wines in UK. Other scenarios of future development are the improvement of firm strategic alliances, rising added value in the <b>wine</b> chain for <b>exporters</b> and communication programs with UK society.

Each case study discusses how companies, associations, and governments at various levels have addressed market failures and facilitated the provision of public goods necessary for each activity. The case studies additionally profile first movers in each activity and describe the positive externalities they provide to imitators, particularly diffusion of export knowledge. Also included are counterfactual cases of a less successful firm or activity (an unsuccessful <b>wine</b> <b>exporter,</b> other types of berries, and commodity pork production rather than custom cuts, respectively) and a discussion of policy implications. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: There {{has been}} no {{significant}} research undertaken in the Japanese market on wine knowledge level and its relationship with brand loyalty and preference for specific country-of-origin (COO) wine brands. This exploratory study seeks to investigate these aspects and how wine knowledge is acquired and used in buying decisions. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A highly structured, self-administered questionnaire in the Japanese language was used to collect data over a three-week period. Data include consumers from six of the eight major regional divisions across Japan. The sample population was female-weighted with moderate levels of education and medium income. A ten-item objective wine knowledge scale was developed to measure consumers’ knowledge levels and to {{form the basis for}} segmentation. FINDINGS: Japanese wine consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge were shown to use more intrinsic cues than extrinsic cues in their purchase decisions, with the importance attributed to intrinsic cues increasing as objective knowledge increases. The study showed consumers with higher levels of objective knowledge do not use the COO cue more than consumers with lower knowledge. Wine consumers view taste, variety and price as the most important buying cues and are influenced by the recommendations of people around them. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This research provided insights into the Japanese wine market {{and the nature of the}} Japanese wine consumer. It is recommended that <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> focus greater marketing efforts on Japanese women, including greater wine education. ORIGINIALITY/VALUE: This study is of value to academic researchers, wine educators, industry practitioners such as restaurant owners/sommeliers and <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> alike, as it provides insights into the direction and extent of COO preferences and hence wine (country) brand loyalty. It has a specific focus on wine knowledge and the educational aspect thereof highlighting how this can be used for the benefit of stakeholders. Johan Bruwer and Courtney Bulle...|$|R
