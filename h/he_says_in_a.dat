25|$|In August 1703, {{he again}} {{settled in the}} Netherlands, in the air of which he seems, like Locke, to have had great faith. At Rotterdam he lived, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> letter to his steward Wheelock, {{at the rate of}} less than £200 a year, and yet had much to dispose of and spend beyond {{convenient}} living. He returned to England, much improved in health, in August 1704. Although he had received immediate benefit from his stay abroad, he was showing symptoms of consumption, and gradually became a confirmed invalid. His occupations were now almost exclusively literary, and from this time forward he was engaged in writing, completing or revising the treatises which were afterwards included in the Characteristics. He continued, however, to take a warm interest in politics, both home and foreign, and especially in the war against France, of which he was an enthusiastic supporter.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Randi {{offered to}} have DuBois tested for his One Million Dollar Challenge. [...] According to Randi, DuBois {{declined}} his {{invitation to the}} challenge. In 2011, the JREF again issued the million dollar challenge to James Van Praagh, Allison DuBois, Sylvia Browne, Carla Baron, John Edward, and others to prove their abilities in controlled experiments, commenting, [...] "James Van Praagh and Allison DuBois have turned the huckster art of 'cold reading' into a multi-million-dollar industry, preying on families' deepest fears and regrets," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> statement announcing the challenge. [...] "They should be embarrassed by the transparent performances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filippo {{sees them}} in the {{distance}} and, believing she is avoiding him, confronts her. He questions her, regarding her as unfaithful: [...] "I can see your guilty thoughts", <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> duet, he admits that his jealousy {{is due to the}} power she has, but confronts her with proof of her support for her subjects' protests by producing some secret papers stolen from her apartment. She responds that she will listen to the peoples' complaints and confronts him: Se amar non puoi, rispettami / [...] "If you cannot love me, respect me! At least leave my honour intact!" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview: “We have a rich {{tradition}} of PaaNans and Koothars going around places singing and creating poetry in the Sangam period. I am just a modern day PaaNan {{who goes to}} places, meets people, talks to them and tells their stories.” ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} to a journal as, {{we can only}} minimize but never eradicate crime {{no matter how many}} new laws are enacted unless people and the society mindset changes to respect the laws. The laws are not able to be effective as value for obedience, honesty and principles are getting diminished.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding his style, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview, [...] "(After reading Borges and Shankaracharya) I {{find that}} <b>a</b> writer lives <b>in</b> the 25th {{hour of the}} watch. This is not {{independent}} of the 24 hours (of a day). It's (about) residing in the absent. When you do so, you participate in all other presences of the cosmos." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gloria in Excelsis. Toward {{the end of}} the Kyrie, {{the sacred}} ministers walk (still staying in a line) {{to the center of the}} altar. If they have been sitting, all rise, save the celebrant, who waits until his biretta has been {{collected}} by the deacon. The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low voice the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may go down and sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie. (Note: The Gloria is omitted from Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, as well as from ferias outside Christmastide, Epiphanytide, and Paschaltide.) ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{believes}} that global health must be prioritized by Member States and that countries must {{be clear about}} their ambitions. [...] "We are too conservative in our global health standards," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview. [...] "A child born in Tanzania {{should have the same}} chance of survival and for living a healthy life as <b>a</b> child born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> developed country." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{short stories}} are noted for their modern story-telling style <b>in</b> Tamil. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview: “As a storyteller, it’s vital that I observe people, their mannerisms and keep myself aware of present trends…” and “…I keep myself {{surrounded}} by youngsters who I {{learn a lot}} from. I think it is such company that keeps me revitalised to write more and more stories.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Unnatural Axe's 1978 song [...] "They Saved Hitler's Brain" [...] was {{singer and}} guitarist Richie Parsons' {{homage to the}} film. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} with Boston Groupie News, [...] " [...] I saw the last 5 minutes of this B movie that was funny as hell.

6000|$|... "No, Braid-Beard. But {{by way of}} {{apologizing for}} the unusual {{rigidity}} of his style in that chapter, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> note, that it was written upon a straight-backed settle, when he was ill of a lumbago, and a crick in the neck." ...|$|E

50|$|As for Ghani Khan, he was {{initially}} influenced by his father’s political struggles and thus {{worked for the}} independence of the Pashtuns ruled by British India. However, he later came to disagree with his father’s ideologies (he stopped supporting the idea of non-violent resistance, seeing that it was not beneficial to the Pashtuns). <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview, that <b>he</b> left his father’s political movement of non-violence, called “Khudai Khidmatgar” (“God’s Soldiers”) because of some of the movement’s motives that he disagreed with.|$|R

6000|$|In {{connexion}} {{with this}} defect in imagination {{is the lack}} of natural imagery in Dryden's poetry. Wordsworth, indeed, greatly overcharges the case, when <b>he</b> <b>says</b> (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> letter to Scott), [...] "that {{there is not a single}} image from nature in the whole body of his poetry." [...] We have this minute taken up the [...] "Hind and the Panther," [...] and find two images from nature in one page:-- ...|$|E

He announces his resolve not to take orders; and 'as for the Law, I have neither strength of mind, purse, or constitution, to engage in that pursuit.'[32] ...|$|E

6000|$|See {{also his}} rhym'd letters to Robert Graham invoking patronage; [...] "one stronghold," [...] Lord Glencairn, being dead, now these appeals to [...] "Fintra, my other stay," [...] (with in one letter a copious shower of vituperation generally.) In his {{collected}} poems {{there is no}} particular unity, nothing that can be called a leading theory, no unmistakable spine or skeleton. Perhaps, indeed, their very desultoriness is the charm of his songs: [...] "I take up one or another," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> letter to Thompson, [...] "just as the bee of the moment buzzes in my bonnet-lug." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tasso {{could not}} always conceal his {{contempt}} of his imprisoner from the ducal servants. Alfonso excelled the grandiloquent poet {{himself in his}} love of pomp and worship; and as he had no particular merits to warrant it, his victim bantered his love of titles. <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> letter to the duke's steward, [...] "If it is {{the pleasure of the}} Most Serene Signor Duke, Most Clement and Most Invincible, to keep me in prison, may I beg that he will have the goodness to return certain little things of mine, which his Most Invincible, Most Clement, and Most Serene Highness has so often promised me.[14] ...|$|E
