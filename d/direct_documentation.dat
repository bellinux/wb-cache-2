50|$|Using {{ecological}} indicators is {{a pragmatic}} approach since <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> {{of changes in}} ecosystems as related to management measures, is cost and time intensive. For example, it would be expensive and time-consuming to count every bird, plant and animal in a newly restored wetland {{to see if the}} restoration was a success. Instead a few indicator species can be monitored to determine success of the restoration.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, it is {{believed}} that he returned to Spain after his stay in Italy and brought the influence of Italian Renaissance painting back to his country and it impacted his work in Castile. There is no <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> of Berruguete making a trip to Italy or residing there. A major difference in the work of Petrus spagnuolus is that the paintings in Italy were executed in oil while Pedro Berruguete’s are completed in tempera grassa.|$|E

50|$|Salem's {{last name}} {{may have been}} given to him by his {{original}} owner Belknap, who may have chosen the name after Salem, Massachusetts, where he once lived. It has also been suggested that Salem chose his last name after being freed, and that it may be a form of Saleem, an Arabic word for peace. This has led some historians to suggest that Salem may have been Muslim, although there is no <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> of his religious views.|$|E
50|$|Droeshout was {{a member}} of a Flemish family of {{engravers}} who had migrated to England to avoid persecution for their Protestant beliefs. His father, Michael Droeshout, was a well established engraver, and his older brother, John, was also a member of the profession. His mother, Dominique Verrike, was his father's second wife. His uncle, also called Martin Droeshout (1560s- c. 1642), was an established painter. No <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> survives about the life of Droeshout beyond the record of his baptism.|$|E

He weighs up how much of her he recognises in the images he comes across. He evaluates the versions of her that are portrayed and deduces that "none seem to be really 'right':" neither as photographic performances nor as existing recurrences of "the beloved face" that he carries in his psyche. He talks about trying to find her, and achieves only part satisfaction in pinpointing fragments in each image that seem to depict parts of the mother he knows. He concludes that by being partially true, the total representation in each image is false. He suggests that the physical details and <b>direct</b> <b>documentations</b> of his mother's physical self, do not contain the sense of her, as he knows her...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} focused {{mainly on the}} {{verification}} of methods and on the standardized operating procedures, which are required in the conditions of accreditation. The main purpose of this thesis was {{a contribution to the}} elaboration of the laboratory manual and the preparation of the <b>directed</b> <b>documentation,</b> mainly the elaboration of the standardized operating procedures and the verification of methods for the hematological department. The thesis is divided into the theoretical and the practical part. The theoretical part presents the laboratory and the accreditation process which the Department of the Clinical Biochemistry and Hematology is preparing for. Furthermore, it describes various analyzers from the hematological section of the laboratory and the most frequently executed methods. We created the standardized operating procedures for these methods, verified them and created the verification protocols.

50|$|It {{was first}} assumed that Antonio Valdés, priest of Sicuani, {{was the author}} of Ollantay. English {{historian}} Clements R. Markham proposed this in the 19th century, and many others assumed it to be correct, including Dr. Raúl Porras Barrenechea. However, this theory of authorship has two major shortcomings: (1) there is no <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> indicating such an origin; (2) Valdés is not known to have written any other piece of literature or any other historical work. It seems more likely that this priest's contribution was limited to simply copying decaying manuscripts that he encountered in La Paz or other cities.|$|E
50|$|By the 1970s artists, {{seeking more}} control over their work but also the display and distribution, turned to mass media, new {{technology}} and communication technologies. Video, photography and audio became the media of choice for artists with a feminist practice. In particular, women artists utilized performance and technology to both engage the viewer but also as a form of <b>direct</b> <b>documentation,</b> often utilizing the artist's body. Birthday Suit - with scars and defects is an important early example of feminist video art., Steele's approach to identity is both matter-of-fact but also fictionalized, employing irony and as an extension of conceptual art, practices of directness and banal bluntness.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{findings}} indicate that the empire was situated in present-day Moravia, Lower Austria and Slovenia. According to Slovak historian Richard Marsina, {{it is unlikely that}} the center of Samo's tribal union was in the territory of present-day Slovakia. The settlements of the later Moravian and Nitrian principalities (see Great Moravia) are often identical with those from the time of Samo's Empire. Since we have no <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> about the Slavonic tribes, their names, or their political organization between the 6th and 7th centuries, nor any concrete records from the following 150 years, there is no historical evidence of any connection between Samo's kingdom and the ethnogenesis of the Slovaks.|$|E

50|$|Resemblances {{between two}} or more {{languages}} (whether in typology or in vocabulary) can be due to genetic relation (descent from a common ancestor language), to borrowing between languages, to retention of features when a population adopts a new language, or simply to chance. When little or no <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> of ancestor languages is available, determining whether a similarity is genetic or areal can be difficult. Edward Sapir notably used evidence of contact and diffusion as a negative tool for genetic reconstruction, treating it as a subject {{in its own right}} only {{at the end of his}} career (e.g., for the influence of Tibetan on Tocharian).|$|E
5000|$|It {{seems that}} the khan had been {{originally}} built as halls and rooms surrounding an internal courtyard, without {{the northern part of}} the northern wing. In the year 1674 it is mentioned that there was an engraving in the gate. Nothing remains of it. It seems that between this date and the Near East earthquake of 1759, an addition to the northern wing was built. This addition, whose arches are in an east-west orientation, different from the rest of the building’s arches. There is no <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> about the building of this addition, and certainly no information about the date it was built. But there are several architectural clues which indicate that this is an add-on: The change of the orientation of the arches, openings in the original structure which had been walled-in by the new addition, the different nature of the building, and the construction of the second storey exactly above this area are all evidence that this is a later addition.|$|E
5000|$|None, however, {{had been}} {{verified}} by <b>direct</b> <b>documentation</b> until 1982 when Ken Simpendorfer, a Special Projects Officer for the Forests Commission, Victoria, directed {{a search of}} official Victorian archives. It unearthed a forgotten report {{from more than a}} century earlier, one that had not been referred to in other accounts of the species up to that time. It was written on 21 February 1872, by the Inspector of State Forests, William Ferguson, and was addressed to the Assistant Commissioner of Lands and Surveys, Clement Hodgkinson. Ferguson had been instructed to explore and inspect the watershed of the Watts River and reported trees in great number and exceptional size in areas where loggers had not yet reached. He wrote: [...] "In one instance I measured with a tape line one huge specimen that lay prostrate across a tributary of the Watts, and found it to be 435 ft from its root to the top of its trunk. At 5 feet from the ground it measures 18 feet in diameter, and at the extreme end where it has broken in its fall, it is 3 feet in diameter. This tree has been much burnt by fire, and I fully believe that before it fell it must have been more than 500 ft high. As it now lies, it forms a complete bridge across a deep ravine." ...|$|E
