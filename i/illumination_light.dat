25|$|Aurobindo {{asserted}} that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, <b>illumination,</b> <b>light,</b> joy, expansion, power, {{and freedom from}} normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.|$|E

Notice how color {{from the red}} wall and green wall (not visible) reflects onto other surfaces in the scene. Also notable is the caustic projected onto the red wall from light passing through the glass sphere.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{limitation}} of critical illumination is {{the formation of}} an image of the light source in the specimen image plane. Köhler illumination addresses this by ensuring the image of the light source is perfectly defocused in the sample plane and its conjugate image planes. In a ray diagram of the <b>illumination</b> <b>light</b> path this {{can be seen as the}} image-forming rays passing parallel through the sample.|$|E
50|$|The {{light from}} the SLD passes through an optical {{isolator}} and subsequently a polarization controller.

A second polarization controller is similarly used to control the polarization of the light passing through the reference path.|$|E
50|$|In addition, as both {{green and}} red {{fluorescence}} of Kaede are excited by blue light at 480 nm for observation, this light will not induce photoconversion. Therefore, <b>illumination</b> <b>lights</b> for observation and photoconversion can be separated completely.|$|R

50|$|Once it {{is known}} what the {{scattered}} wavefront of the object looks like or how it may be computed, it must be fixed on a spatial light modulator (SLM), abusing this term to include not only LCD displays or similar devices, but also films and masks. Basically, there are different types of SLMs available: Pure phase modulators (retarding the illuminating wave), pure amplitude modulators (blocking the <b>illumination</b> <b>light),</b> polarization modulators (influencing the polarization state of light) and SLMs which have the capability of combined phase/amplitude modulation.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional {{traffic signal}} lighting, still common in some areas, {{utilizes}} a standard light bulb. Typically, a 67, 69, or 115 watt medium-base (household lamp in the US) light bulb provides the <b>illumination.</b> <b>Light</b> then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl, and {{out through a}} polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern. Crouse-Hinds is one notable company for this practice.

The motivation for their development was that in the Tandem-Scanning-Microscope only a fraction of 10−7 of the <b>illumination</b> <b>light</b> participates in generating the image in the eye piece.

Its location along the Brda river provides an opening to the Mill Island. The building, with its three connecting circles, affords optimal conditions for the realization of opera, operetta, ballet and musicals.

50|$|Ultrasound {{detectors}} {{have been}} developed that collect bandwidths of 10-200 MHz or wider, which allows unprecedented mesoscopy at tissue depths of 0.1-1 cm with resolution that can exceed 10 microns even at depths of several millimeters. <b>Illumination</b> <b>light</b> is typically unfocused and selected from the visible and near-IR regions of the spectrum. Images are generated using computed tomography. Such mesoscopy can analyze morphology and biological processes such as inflammation in greater detail than macroscopy, revealing, for example, microvasculature networks in skin and epithelial tissues or the microenvironment within a tumor. Regions of interest are approximately 50 mm3, and resolution of 5-30 microns is typical.|$|E

5000|$|However, Kabbalah {{limits the}} effect of Yeridat ha-dorot only to Nigleh. In contrast, the [...] "Concealed" [...] ("Nistar") aspects of Torah, {{embodied}} in Jewish mysticism, are identified with an opposite process of successively higher articulations of mystical thought as the process of history unfolds. The reasoning for this derives from the notion that Jewish mysticism progresses instead from successive new Divine revelations to supreme mystics, {{as the only way}} to deepen its conceptual structures. This paradoxical dialectic relates in Kabbalistic terminology to descending immanent [...] "Vessels", and successively higher transcendent [...] "Lights" [...] through the history of Creation. In Jewish thought, deepening Talmudic and Rationalist enquiry broadens the physical application of Torah (vessels), while deepening Jewish mysticism draws down higher levels of <b>illumination</b> (<b>light).</b>|$|E
50|$|Photoechoes show an ultra-wide {{frequency}} profile, {{which is}} determined by the pulse width of the illuminating pulse {{and the size of the}} object. Ultimately, though, the frequencies that can be collected and processed for image reconstruction are determined by the ultrasound detector. Macroscopic MSOT typically uses detectors operating in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 MHz, allowing imaging depths of approximately 1-5 cm and resolution of 0.1-1 mm. <b>Illumination</b> <b>light</b> wavelengths are typically chosen from the near-IR region of the spectrum and spread over the sample to allow deep penetration. Images are then generated using computed tomography. Such macroscopy is useful for animal and human imaging to analyze tissue anatomy, physiology and response to drugs.

50|$|The {{polarization}} of the input beam (assumed to be collimated and monochromatic) can be chosen freely (linear, circular, or elliptic). Furthermore, a constant or Gaussian shaped input beam intensity profile can be assumed. On {{its way from}} the objective to the focus, the <b>illumination</b> <b>light</b> passes through up to three stratified optical layers, which allows the simulation of an immersion oil/air (layer 1) objective that focusses light through a glass cover slip (layer 2) into the sample medium (layer 3). Each layer is characterized by its (constant) refractive index and thickness. PSF Lab can also simulate microscope objectives that are corrected for certain refractive indices and cover slip thicknesses (design parameters). Thus, any deviations from the ideal imaging conditions for which the objective was designed for are properly taken into account.|$|E
50|$|Stanford University Computer Graphics Laboratory has {{developed}} a light field microscope using a microlens array {{similar to the one}} used in the light field camera developed by the lab. The prototype is built around a Nikon Eclipse transmitted light microscope/wide-field fluorescence microscope and standard CCD cameras. Light field capturing ability is obtained by a module containing a microlens array and other optical components placed in the light path between the objective lens and camera, with the final multifocused image rendered using deconvolution. A later version of the prototype added a light field illumination system consisting of a video projector (allowing computational control of illumination) and a second microlens array in the <b>illumination</b> <b>light</b> path of the microscope. The addition of a light field illumination system both allowed for additional types of illumination (such as oblique illumination and quasi-dark-field) and correction for optical aberrations.|$|E
50|$|The {{specimen}} is illuminated {{with light}} of a specific wavelength (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths (i.e., of a different color than the absorbed light). The <b>illumination</b> <b>light</b> is separated from the much weaker emitted fluorescence {{through the use of}} a spectral emission filter. Typical components of a fluorescence microscope are a light source (xenon arc lamp or mercury-vapor lamp are common; more advanced forms are high-power LEDs and lasers), the excitation filter, the dichroic mirror (or dichroic beamsplitter), and the emission filter (see figure below). The filters and the dichroic beamsplitter are chosen to match the spectral excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorophore used to label the specimen. In this manner, the distribution of a single fluorophore (color) is imaged at a time. Multi-color images of several types of fluorophores must be composed by combining several single-color images.|$|E
