This paper looks at a specific operation that has been abandoned for thirty years. The method of evaluation, while applying the basic fundamentals of nuclear criticality safety, is different in approach from the industry standard nuclear criticality evaluation due to the circumstances. Unknown quantities and enrichments of fissile material were left in the process equipment.

This research is to study and focused on implementation on safety management at factory, in term of safety measure apply by employer at his/her factory in Shah Alam industrial area. This study shall include literature review, followed with observation on case study, distribution questionnaire to selected employees, and through interview session with factory’s safety officer who involved in safety implementation at factory. The aim of this research is first, to highlight on the implementation of safety management in factories at Shah Alam. This study also will focus on the guidelines provided by Factory and Machineries Act, 1967. To achieve this aim, several objectives have determined and will be analyzed after study has been conducted. Lastly, safety management is applying at factory by rules and regulation, monitoring and control, safe work practise and safety policy.
