The approach taken {{is to look}} at the present from the perspective of Tinbergen, Haavelmo, and Keynes. It is argued that probability modeling has been in retreat at central banks and elsewhere. New computational methods, though, are making Bayesian analysis of previously intractable problems possible, and at the same time appreciation of the clarity with which Bayesian <b>data</b> <b>analyis</b> integrates with decison-making is spreading...|$|R
40|$|We {{tackle the}} problem of {{integration}} {{in the context of}} <b>data</b> <b>analyis.</b> Integration in <b>data</b> analysis often means correlating observations from different parts of the data. That is, we often have two (or more) parts of the data, and the goal is to relate observations in one part to observations in the others. For instance, we would like to relate gene expression to pathway/network or clinical data. In this abstract, we propose predictive clustering trees as a data analysis tool for the joint analysis of different types of data. The approach seems to be particularly well-suited for relating gene expression to other types of data. Predictive clustering is a hybrid clustering/classification scheme [Blockeel et al., 1998]. Clustering aims at finding groups of observations that maximize intra-group similarity, but also inter-group dissimilarity. Classification, in contrast, aims at finding a mapping from instances to class labels. Many machine learning learning algorithms do not only find such mappings, but also provide a description of the classes. Predictive clustering is now defined as a hybrid approach that finds groups of observations as well as their mapping plus a description simultaneously. So, the task is to find groups in an unsupervised fashion, such that future data points can automatically be assigned to the clusters based on generated cluster descriptions. One can easily solve {{the problem of}} predictive clustering by first clustering and then classifying, for instance, by unpruned decision trees. However, in predictive clustering, the construction of clusters and their descriptio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{investigate}} techniques {{to minimize the}} energy consumed by a secure wireless session without compromising {{the security of the}} session. While it has been shown in [8] that compressing the session negotiation messages, the protocol header, and the data reduces the energy consumed by a secure session [8], in this paper we show that matching the block size of compression to the data cache size of the device is important. We also investigate the choice of a bulk encryption algorithm (3 DES vs. AES) and a key exchange protocol (Diffie-Hellman vs. RSA) based on the energy consumed by a secure session. These techniques yield energy savings of 1. 3 x <b>during</b> <b>data</b> transmission and 1. 2 x <b>during</b> <b>data</b> reception beyond that obtained by techniques in [8].

Non-invasive methods for assessing the physiological responses to workload may provide information on physiological markers leading to increased risk of WMSDs. The following study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using thermography to quantify differences in thermal readings of participants during and following a data entry task and assess the repeatability of thermal readings.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -Sociology, Humboldt State University, 2007 Cohousing {{originated}} in Denmark in the 1960 s and, after much success, spread to North America in the 1980 s. In the United States, the 1980 s marked {{a period of}} ever-increasing suburbanization. With this shift in neighborhood organization came a related perceived loss of community. Some people who felt alienated from their neighbors and unsatisfied with typical housing opportunities turned to cohousing. These people hoped to find solutions to ???community lost??? by living in cohousing developments whose aims included creating safe ???fifties style??? neighborhoods that promoted the well-being of residents through shared common spaces and community decision making. This research is an ethnographic study of a cohousing community, referred to in this paper as Emerald Hills, established in 1998 {{in a small town}} in Northern California. I entered the setting in Spring 2005 and exited the community at the end of the year. In addition to participant observation at community meals and meetings, I completed fifteen one-on-one semi-structured interviews. In those interviews, I encouraged participants to speak about their cohousing expectations and experiences and questioned them about relationships with others in the community and the emotional aspects of their experiences. I used NVivo qualitative <b>data</b> <b>analyis</b> software to analyze field notes and interview transcriptions and reviewed the data looking for common themes and coded accordingly. To analyze the data, I relied on the existing literature on cohousing, well-being, social interaction, social support, individualism and expectations. Participants developed a sense of well-being at Emerald Hills through regular community meals, community projects, shared political outlooks, friendships with neighbors, a good environment for raising children and other resources from those relationships. Conversely, conflicts over money, the absence of mediation and consensus training, the lack of a unifying vision statement, individualism and disagreement about expectations for relationships among community members negatively affected the well-being of residents of Emerald Hills. However, those community members with lower expectations prior to moving into cohousing expressed a greater sense of well-being from living in Emerald Hills...|$|R

(3) {{the positive and negative}} effect of the facebook on the learning achievement aming the eleventh grade students of cookery class of SMK N 3 Wonosari. The design of the research was ex post facto. The independent variable was the activity of making access to facebook and the dependent variable was the students' learning achievement. The research was conducted in SMK Negeri 3 Wonosari, particularly in the cookery competence class of eleventh grade from March to June 2012. The subject of the research was the eleventh grade student of cookery program which consisted of 34 students. The data was obtained from the survey and the documentation of the test score. The normality and linearity tests were used for <b>data</b> <b>analyis.</b> Product moment correlation was also used. Based on the research it was concluded that 1) descriptive result indicated that all students of eleventh grade of cookery program had facebook. Concerning the access activity among the students, it was indicated that those who had occasional access was 26 respondents (76, 5 %). 2) The learning achievement among the eleventh grade students of cookery program of SMK N 3 Wonosari indicated that all students had excellent learning achievement (100 %). The students had the grade between 75. 2 and 89, 9 which included into the scoring requirement of the SMK assessment issued by the Education Ministry 3) There was no effect of facebook access activity on the learning achieveent among the eleventh grade students of cookery class of SMK Negeri 3 Wonosari, which was proved with the rcount of facebook access of 0. 191 with the significance of 0. 280...|$|R

The GPR survey {{was carried out}} along eight parallel traverses each 500  m long and trending in approximately E-W direction using an USA manufactured GSSI SIR System- 300 equipment. The survey was done using a 200  MHz monostatic shielded antenna oriented parallel to the survey direction (parallel-broadside) in continuous collection mode. The antenna was preset with three gain points {{in order to improve}} the scans <b>during</b> <b>data</b> acquisition while 33 scans per meter were taken (representing 3  cm station spacing) with a sampling window of 400  ns with offset of + 25  ns.
