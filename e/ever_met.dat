5|$|Arguing for {{the defence}} was lawyer Jagmal Singh. He {{asserted}} {{that there was}} no evidence against the accused and that it was all contrived by the media, no evidence that the khap panchayat <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> to discuss the fate of the couple, and no evidence indicating that Manoj and Babli were dead. The cremated bodies recovered from the canal were never confirmed to be those of Manoj and Babli.|$|E
5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini {{offered to}} meet with Aldisio – who had been {{appointed}} High Commissioner in August 1944 – to solve the island’s grain problem, implying he {{had the power to}} do so. There is no evidence that Aldisio and Vizzini <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> to discuss the issue. Aldiso did, however, invite , a fellow Christian Democrat and Mafia member befriended by Vizzini, to secret gatherings with Christian Democrats. The meetings were seen as a first step in a government alliance with the Mafia. Aldisio’s appointment was perceived by Mafia chieftains as a first indication of the government’s determination to subdue the separatist movement. They were now forced to reconsider their support.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|William Crabtree (1610–1644) was a cloth {{merchant}} from Broughton Spout, a hamlet in {{the township}} of Broughton near Manchester, {{which is now}} part of Salford. The son of John Crabtree, a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means, and Isabel Crabtree (née Pendleton), he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester– probably the forerunner of Manchester Grammar School, which was then situated between the Collegiate Church and what is now Chetham's School of Music. He worked in Manchester, married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy. He carefully measured the movements of the planets, undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables with improved accuracy. He maintained an active correspondence, much of it now lost, with Horrocks, two other young astronomers– William Gascoigne and Christopher Towneley– and Samuel Foster, Professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London and alumnus of Emmanuel College. It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly, and, because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler, referred to themselves, along with William Gascoigne, as nos Keplari (we Keplarians).|$|E

60|$|This man, indeed, is {{the only}} {{tradesman}} that <b>ever</b> I <b>met</b> with, that set up and broke before his shop was open; others I have indeed known make very quick work of it.|$|R
5|$|On Stevie's birthday, Naz {{arranges}} {{a dinner}} party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says {{it is the last}} card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has <b>ever</b> <b>met,</b> and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E

25|$|Curtis {{was related}} to Hart Crane, the American poet. Though {{it is unclear whether}} Curtis and Crane <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> or corresponded, they became stepbrothers when Curtis’ father, Charles E. Curtis, married Crane’s mother.|$|E
25|$|Welsh {{grew up in}} {{the same}} Washington D.C. neighborhood, Southwest, as another Russian immigrant, Asa Yoelson. Asa grew up and changed his name to Al Jolson and became a legendary singer. It's not on record if the two <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Welch and Jolson however favor one another when photos are studied.|$|E
25|$|The best theologian he <b>ever</b> <b>met,</b> {{he used to}} say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having {{recognized}} him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull {{him out of the}} bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.|$|E
5000|$|The ClipBandits, {{known as}} [...] "the first Internet band," [...] collaborated without <b>ever</b> having <b>met</b> each other, were {{featured}} on ABC World News, Good Morning America and ultimately met and {{performed on the}} Tyra Banks Show.|$|R

25|$|Cowdery met Joseph Smith on April 5, 1829—a {{year and}} a day before the {{official}} founding of the church—and heard from him how he had received golden plates containing ancient Native American writings. Cowdery told Smith {{that he had seen}} the golden plates in a vision before the two <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stallard had {{the most}} {{abrasive}} nature that I have <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He could never believe {{that he could have}} a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E
25|$|Wordsworth Donisthorpe who {{was also}} from Leeds, filmed the second oldest {{surviving}} film. It is not known if he and Louis Le Prince <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> but they both had a strong connection to the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society. Donisthorpe's patent for a camera to capture the moving image pre dated Le Prince's by twelve years.|$|E
6000|$|HON. Yes, very well, said he. He was a {{man that}} had {{the root of the}} matter in him; but {{he was one of the}} most {{troublesome}} pilgrims that <b>ever</b> I <b>met</b> with in all my days.[210] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's been a lady at {{our place}} to-day, Miss Dorrit,' Plornish growled, 'and another one {{along with her}} as is a old wixen if <b>ever</b> I <b>met</b> with such. The way she snapped a person's head off, dear me!' ...|$|R

25|$|Christopher Hitchens {{referred}} to Francis Collins as a 'Great American' {{and stated that}} Collins {{was one of the}} most devout believers he had <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He further stated that Collins was sequencing the genome of the cancer that would ultimately claim Hitchens's life, and that their friendship despite their differing opinion on religion was an example of the greatest armed truce in modern times.|$|E
25|$|Coffey also {{dismissed}} {{the notion that}} he ever received information about Kelli Ryan or her case in advance or that he <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> with A's Eric Leven. This runs contrary to Leven working alongside Coffey in several episodes and also is contrary to interviews given by Coffey where he clearly states that he meets with producers to learn and strategize about how to proceed with walkthroughs.|$|E
