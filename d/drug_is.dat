40|$|ABSTRACT : Labelling <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} issue nowadays {{in a modern}} society. Although it is generally believed that legal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> good <b>drugs</b> and illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> bad <b>drugs,</b> it <b>is</b> evident that some people do not aware about {{the side effects of}} drugs used. Therefore, a key contention of this philosophical essay is that explores harms minimisation policy, discuss whether legal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> good <b>drugs</b> and illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> bad <b>drugs</b> and explores relation of drugs misuse in a psychiatric nursing setting and dual diagnosis. Key words: Legal, good drugs, illegal, bad drugs. <br /...|$|R
5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name {{can be broken down}} into ada-lim-u-mab. Therefore, the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> a human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, it would have been adalumab.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|No <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} {{approved for}} the treatment of smallpox. However, antiviral treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug cidofovir might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered intravenously, however, and may cause serious kidney toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Anti-epileptic <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} used to combat ADNFLE. These <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{discussed in the}} main epilepsy article.|$|R
50|$|Street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} abused <b>drugs</b> that <b>are</b> bought illegally {{and have}} many nicknames. Examples of street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> heroin, marijuana and its psychoactive ingredient of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cocaine.|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Use {{of generic}} <b>drugs,</b> which <b>are</b> bioequivalent to brand-name <b>drugs,</b> <b>is</b> now a common practice. However, {{there is still}} concern among {{patients}} and physicians that brand-name <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> more efficient than generic drugs (1).|$|R
5|$|The <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> marketed under many {{brand and}} generic names {{including}} Aldocumar, Anasmol, Anticoag, Befarin, Cavamed, Cicoxil, Circuvit, Cofarin, Coumadin, Coumadine, Cumar, Farin, Foley, Haemofarin, Jantoven, Kovar, Lawarin, Maforan, Marevan, Marfarin, Marivanil, Martefarin, Morfarin, Orfarin, Panwarfin, Scheme, Simarc, Varfarin, Varfarins, Varfine, Waran, Warcok, Warf, Warfareks, Warfarin, Warfarina, Warfarine, Warfarinum, Warfen, Warfin, Warik, Warin, Warlin, and Zyfarin.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase and blocks cellular respiration.|$|E
30|$|During {{the study}} period, 140 <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> analyzed; those <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> taken by 20 Caucasian {{patients}} (seven drugs/patient) {{admitted to the}} orthopedic surgery unit.|$|R
40|$|One or more <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> {{detected}} in 81 percent of 440 male drivers, aged 15 - 34, killed in motor vehicle crashes in California; {{two or more}} <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> {{detected in}} 43 percent. Alcohol, the most frequently found <b>drug,</b> <b>was</b> detected in 70 percent of the drivers, marijuana in 37 percent, and cocaine in 11 percent. Each of 24 other <b>drugs</b> <b>was</b> detected in fewer than 5 percent. Except for alcohol, <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> infrequently found alone; typically, they were found in combination with high blood alcohol concentrations. The causal role of <b>drugs</b> in crashes <b>was</b> assessed by comparing drivers with and without drugs {{in terms of their}} responsibility for the crash. Alcohol was associated with increased crash responsibility; the role of other <b>drugs</b> could not <b>be</b> adequately determined...|$|R
5000|$|Club drugs, {{also called}} rave drugs, or party <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a loosely defined {{category}} of recreational <b>drugs</b> which <b>are</b> associated with discothèques in the 1970s and nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music parties, and raves in the 1980s to the 2010s. Unlike many other categories, such as opiates, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a [...] "category of convenience", in which <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> included {{due to the}} locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while {{under the influence of}} the <b>drugs.</b> Club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> generally used by teens and young adults. This group of <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> also called [...] "designer drugs", as most are synthesized in chemical lab (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, LSD) rather than being sourced from plants (as with marijuana, which comes from the cannabis plant).|$|R
5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas liposome refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> encapsulated in solution inside the liposome then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{descriptive study}} {{was carried out}} among patients admitted in cardiology department from 1 st January to 31 st March 2011 in Sir Salimullah Medical College & Mitford Hospital, Dhaka to see the patterns of prescriptions and use of drug by using WHO core drug use indicators and some additional indices. A total of 300 patients were included in this study. The average number of <b>drugs</b> per encounter <b>was</b> 8. 8 and 11. 43 % <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> prescribed by generic name. Percentage of encounters with cardiovascular <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> 64 %,other <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> 36 % and 25 % injection were prescribed. 70. 45 % <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> prescribed from EDL of Bangladesh, the availability of copy of essential <b>drug</b> list <b>was</b> present and availability of key <b>drugs</b> <b>was</b> 74 %.

5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> working.|$|E

Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Though Karnas initially refuses {{to believe that the}} young man is Jameson, Picard shows him the images of his reverse aging {{over the last few days}} after which Jameson reveals a scar on his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago. Karnas prepares to fire on Jameson to get his revenge, but decides to get his revenge by watching Jameson suffer and die horribly from the drug instead. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E
