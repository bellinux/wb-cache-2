50|$|Local rearrangements affect {{specific}} loci only. Such rearrangements, for instance, {{help create}} genes that produce a great variation of immunoglobulins in vertebrates. During life, organisms {{have contact with}} a large number of antigens. Which means that the immune system needs to synthesize a wide range of antibodies. Each immunoglobulin is a tetramer consisting of four polypeptides connected by disulfide bridges. They form two long heavy chains and  two short light chains. But vertebrate genome does not code entire genes of heavy and light immunoglobulins, only gene segments. Segments of heavy chain are located on chromosome 14, they include 11 constant gene segments (CH), that are preceded by 123-129 variable segments (VH), 27 <b>diversity</b> <b>gene</b> segments (DH) and 9 joining segments (JH), coding different versions of components V, D, J. Loci of light chains on chromosome 2 (locus κ) and chromosome 22 (locus λ) have similar structure, but they do not contain D segments. At the early stage of lymphocyte B development, loci of immunoglobulins are rearranged. During rearrangement, segment VH on heavy chain locus is connected with one DH segment, then V-D group is combined with JH segment. Eventually, exon with open reading frame coding segments: VH, DH, JH of immunoglobulin. Through RNA splicing during transcription, this exon becomes connected to exon for CH segment. Complementary mRNA of heavy chain can be translated into immunoglobulin specific only for one lymphocyte.|$|E
50|$|Extensive upland {{areas of}} the Australian Wet Tropics, such as the Atherton Tableland, were cleared for farming, largely between 1940 and 1990, leaving many {{scattered}} pockets of rainforest surrounded by open pasture. The Prickly Skink is abundant throughout this area has become a research subject for studies {{on the effect of}} habitat fragmentation on genetic <b>diversity,</b> <b>gene</b> flow and adaptation in a rainforest dependent species. A 1993 phylogeographic study by Moritz and co-authors using allozyme electrophoresis and restriction mapping of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes found distinct genetic lineages in populations from the northern and southern wet tropics. These areas are currently connected by a ribbon of rainforest habitat, around 15 km wide, known as the Black Mountain Corridor or BMC, but historical climate modeling suggest that rainforests in the northern and southern wet tropics were separated by around 50 km of dry habitats in this area during Pleistocene glacial climate periods. However, the deep divergence between these lineages suggests much longer genetic isolation, with an estimated separation time of over five million years, and these populations may represent different species. Further study of mtDNA and allozyme variation from sites around the Atherton Tablelands (within the Southern Lineage) revealed additional phylogeographic structure, with a divergence between populations around the Bellenden Ker / Wooroonooran Range, east of the Atherton Tableland, and those in the central and southern tablelands. The late-Pleistocene divergence between these lineages (>0.5% across the mtDNA genome) is an order of magnitude less than that between the Northern and Southern Wet Tropics but is indicative of emergence from separate glacial refugia. The larger Wooroonooran refugium maintained higher diversity through the glacial period than the southern Tableland refugium and this natural historical difference in genetic diversity is much greater than any more recent, human induced, effects of forest clearing and fragmentation. More detailed study of genetic variation in populations from the Atherton tableland, using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite loci, revealed a slight reduction in allelic diversity and in the pattern of isolation by distance among populations. Also, Sumner found relatedness among males within fragments was lower in isolated forest fragments than within continuous forests, possibly reflecting greater dispersal within fragments due to lower habitat quality. However, these relatively slight differences show the difficulty of detecting effects of recent habitat fragmentation in a species with relatively low local population size and limited dispersal. Sumner and co-authors did find other ecological effects of fragmentation; skink abundance was higher in continuous forest sites than in fragments, and was lower in small habitat patches than in large patches, and on average, skinks from fragments were smaller than those from continuous forests. Estimates of population density and dispersal distances from capture-recapture methods and from genetic data are broadly consistent, with a density varying from 65 - 136 individuals per ha, and a dispersal distance of 404 - 843 m2, respectively. Genetic estimates of relatedness among individuals found under the same log revealed that juveniles tend to stay with their parents for 1-2 years and subsequently disperse to other logs, with marked individuals observed 0 - 80 m away from their initial capture site over three years.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} {{and maintenance of}} controlled auxin gradients within plant tissues are essential for a multitude of developmental processes. Auxin gradient formation is co-ordinated via local biosynthesis and transport.
