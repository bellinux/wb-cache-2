50|$|A denim skirt, {{sometimes}} referred to as a 'jean skirt' or 'jeans skirt', is a skirt made of denim, the same material as blue jeans. Denim skirts {{come in a variety of}} styles and lengths to suit different populations and occasions. For example, full-length denim skirts are commonly worn by women whose religious beliefs prohibit them from wearing trousers, including Orthodox Jews, some Muslims, Mennonites, and Pentecostals, among others. Shorter skirts made of denim are commonly worn by teenagers and young adults. Some are modeled after an exact style of jeans, with a front fly, belt loops, and back pockets. Others are constructed more like other types of skirts, with a column of front button, closures on the side or back, or <b>elastic</b> <b>waists.</b> Like jeans, denim skirts vary in shades of blue, ranging from very pale to very dark, or occasionally in other colors.|$|R

60|$|Between {{his work}} for Stoller and what {{sometimes}} seemed the obstructiveness of General Triscoe, Burnamy was not very much with Miss Triscoe. He was not devout, but he went every Sunday to the pretty English church on the hill, where he contributed beyond his means to {{the support of the}} English clergy on the Continent, for the sake of looking at her back hair during the service, and losing himself in the graceful lines which defined, the girl's figure from the slant of her flowery hat {{to the point where the}} pewtop crossed her <b>elastic</b> <b>waist.</b> One happy morning the general did not come to church, and he had the fortune to walk home with her to her pension, where she lingered with him a moment, and almost made him believe she might be going to ask him to come in.|$|E
6000|$|All these things, fits included, are now obsolete. The men shave {{a line in}} {{the hair}} like a fillet round the skull, and what is left is coiffe au coup de vent. The head-dress is a cap, a straw hat, a billy cock, or a tall silk [...] "chimney pot," [...] the latter {{denoting}} a chief; he also sports in full dress a broad coat, ending in a loin cloth of satin stripe or some finer stuff, about six feet long by four and a half broad; it is secured by a kerchief or an <b>elastic</b> <b>waist</b> belt; during work it is tucked up, but on ceremonial occasions it must trail upon the ground. The lieges wear European shirts, stuffed into a waist-cloth of cheaper material, calico or domestics; This Tángá, or kilt, is, in fact, an article of general wear, and it would be an airy, comfortable, and wholesome travelling costume if the material were flannel.

5000|$|The term [...] "windpants" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "splash pants" [...] or [...] "overtrousers") {{describes}} pants {{made out of}} synthetic material with an <b>elastic</b> around the <b>waist.</b> They are usually light and serve to shield the wearer from wind, and sometimes also mud and water. Windpants are almost always made out of polyester or nylon. They are also sometimes worn as an outside layer on top of other clothing, and often have zippers on each ankle {{so that they can}} be pulled over footwear. Some windpants have zippers that run the full length of the leg so the pants can be simply unzipped entirely. A 2012 study demonstrated that adding windbreaker pants and jackets offers a lightweight but effective means of delaying hypothermia if the user is outside walking and encounters unexpected low temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|Another of his memorable {{moments in}} that tournament was the goal he scored against Brazil in the semi-final. Italy were awarded a penalty after Silvio Piola, the team's new center forward, was chopped {{down in the}} box by [...] "the Divine Master", Domingos da Guia. The Brazilian goalkeeper Walter, who was famous for hypnotizing his opponents and for saving {{penalties}} back in Brazil, arrogantly claimed he was certain he would save the shot. Meazza made no fuss, but as he stepped up to take the kick, his shorts fell down because the <b>elastic</b> around the <b>waist</b> had earlier been pulled and ripped by a defender. Meazza, without letting this stress him, pulled up his shorts {{with one hand and}} shot past the confused Walter, who was still busy laughing. His celebrating team-mates surrounded him until a new pair of shorts were produced. The goal sent Italy into their second consecutive World Cup final. It was his last goal for Italy.|$|R
5000|$|Slips {{fall into}} two major categories. A full slip is hung from the {{shoulders}} by straps that extend down {{to the top of}} the breast area. Full slips come in a variety of lengths; some extend down to the upper thigh, some to just above the knees, or just below the knees, while others go down to just above the ankles. A waist slip, sometimes referred to as a [...] "half slip", is held on to the body around the waist by means of an <b>elastic</b> waistband. The <b>waist</b> slip is also available in the same lengths as the aforementioned full slip. Waist slips that extend down to just above the ankle are often called [...] "formal", or [...] "maxi" [...] slips. [...] "Mini slips" [...] are yet another size option for waist slips. They were first introduced in the 1960s to wear under a mini skirt. American Maid manufactured waist slips that had vents and a rear zipper in addition to the elastic waistband. These slips were made of 50% nylon and 50% dacron polyester. As an alternative to the full slip, a waist slip with a matching camisole can be worn. There is also a type of [...] "slip" [...] designed to be worn under pants known as [...] "pettipants". In addition to pants, a pettipant may also be worn under a dress or skirt, and like slips, they are mainly made of nylon.|$|R

50|$|The {{name was}} popularized by the 1956 movie Baby Doll, {{starring}} Carroll Baker {{in the title}} role as a 19-year-old nymphet. This {{marked the beginning of the}} enduring popularity of the style for adults. Baby Doll pajamas in the 1950s through the 1960s consisted of a top and a loose fitting short bloomer bottom with elasticized waist and legs. In the 1970s through the 1990s, the bloomer bottom was replaced by closer fitting briefs with <b>elastic</b> <b>waist</b> and legs. The most recent versions of baby doll pajamas have eliminated the elastic on the legs, the bottoms being either shorts or tap pants.|$|E
50|$|Boardshorts do {{not have}} an <b>elastic</b> <b>waist</b> like many swim shorts do; instead they have a more rigid {{waistband}} which opens at the front, often with a velcro fly. The waistband is also held together at the front with a lace-up tie. This double fail-safe system is {{in order to ensure that}} the shorts cannot be pulled off the body by the force of the wave when a surfer is tumbled under water during a wipeout. Another common feature of authentic surfing boardshort design is a very small pocket sealed with velcro and vented with a grommet. This is designed to be a secure place to carry a car key, house key, or hotel key card while in the water. Boardshorts traditionally have no lining, unlike traditional swim shorts.|$|E

5000|$|Due to actual, waistline-reducing, steel bone corsets {{no longer}} being as common {{as they used to}} be in the Victorian and Edwardian era, modern day shapewear as well as fashionable {{lingerie}} such as [...] "fajas" [...] (rubber cinchers), bustiers and basques are purposefully marketed as [...] "corsets".

50|$|The current {{traditions of}} Özdere's {{permanent}} population {{may have been}} derived {{in part from the}} culture of nomadic Ottoman settlers of the town of Kesri, as reflected in the continued use of traditional attire, marriage customs, and the cuisine traceable to that period.

Blouses are generally worn with short sleeves, matched with wide and baggy side-sewn pants made from thin fabrics.

We found that sensor location, type of activity, and their interaction-effect affected sensor output. The most lateral positions on the waist belt were the least sensitive for interference. The effect of mounting was explored, by making two subjects repeat the experimental protocol with sensors more loosely fitted to the elastic belt. The loose fit resulted in lower sensor output, except for the deskwork protocol, where output was higher. In order to increase the reliability and to reduce the variability of sensor output, researchers should place activity sensors on the most lateral position of a participant’s waist belt. If the sensor hampers free movement, it may be positioned slightly more forward on the belt. Finally, sensors should be fitted tightly to the body...|$|E
