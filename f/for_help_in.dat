5|$|An avid {{conservationist}} and hunter, Burnham {{supported the}} early conservation programs {{of his friends}} Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa {{with the goal of}} finding large animals such as Giant Eland, hippopotamus, zebra, and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture to ask <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.|$|E
5|$|Asipatravana/Asipatrakanana (forest of sword leaves): The Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana reserve this {{hell for}} a person who digresses from the {{religious}} teachings of the Vedas and indulges in heresy. The Vishnu Purana states that wanton tree-felling leads to this hell. Yamadutas beat them with whips {{as they try to}} run away in the forest where palm trees have swords as leaves. Afflicted with injury of whips and swords, they faint and cry out <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> vain.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the {{neighboring}} and more populous Massachusetts Bay Colony had been established. Bradford appealed to {{leaders of the}} colony in Boston <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> reclaiming the trading post, but the Bay Colony refused. The incident was indicative of the rivalry which persisted between Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies. In 1691, the two colonies merged to become the royal Province of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film {{directed}} and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. The film {{is based on}} the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. His primary crime was check fraud; he became so experienced that the FBI eventually turned to him <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> catching other checking forgers. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, with Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|FBI Agent Jerry Lamana, Fox Mulder's former partner, {{approaches}} him and Dana Scully <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> investigating Drake's murder. On {{their way}} up to Drake's office, the agents' elevator stalls, causing Scully to call the front desk for help; as she identifies herself, the COS records her contact information. While examining the crime scene, the agents meet Claude Peterson, Eurisko's building systems engineer. Later, Lamana steals Mulder's profile of the supposed killer and presents it under his name; an outraged Mulder confronts him afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In desperation, Mary {{decides to}} tell the truth to Gopalam and Ammi. To save their jobs, Rao makes up a far-fetched story that Mary is possessed by the soul of a Christian woman named after the mother of Jesus. Gopalam lies that he will marry Sita off to Rao. Raju, like Gopalam, is unaware of Rao's deception. In love with Sita, he wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> {{teaching}} music (which ends in disaster). At the end of their first month at the school, Rao and Mary receive their salaries and Mary repays her debt.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{newspapers}} criticized Missouri for the Haun's Mill massacre and the state's {{expulsion of}} the Latter Day Saints. Illinois accepted Mormon refugees who gathered {{along the banks}} of the Mississippi River, where Smith purchased high-priced, swampy woodland in the hamlet of Commerce. Smith also attempted to portray the Latter Day Saints as an oppressed minority, and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> obtaining reparations. During the summer of 1839, while Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic, Smith sent Brigham Young and other apostles to missions in Europe, where they made numerous converts, many of them poor factory workers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, as General William C. Westmoreland {{learned of}} the North Vietnamese attack on Lang Vei and Lownd’s refusal to send a relief force, he ordered the U.S. Marines to supply enough {{helicopters}} to airlift a 50-man strike force {{with the aim of}} rescuing the survivors. Subsequently, Colonel Jonathan F. Ladd—commanding officer of the 5th Special Forces Group — and Major General Norman J. Anderson, commander of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing — were directed to formulate a rescue plan. While Willoughby and his men waited <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> the command bunker, Ashley and his Laotian contingent cautiously entered the Special Forces Camp.|$|E

5|$|Over time Mavor was to {{some extent}} able to reverse the {{negative}} perceptions of Amazing among established authors, but she was initially forced to work primarily with newer writers. Early discoveries of hers include Michael P. Kube-McDowell, John E. Stith and Richard Paul Russo.

40|$|Ethanol is a biofuel {{that is used}} as a {{replacement}} for approximately 3 % of the fossil-based gasoline consumed in the world today. Most of this biofuel is produced from sugarcane in Brazil and corn in the United States. We present here the rationale for the ethanol program in Brazil, its present 'status' and its perspectives. The environmental benefits of the program, particularly the contribution of ethanol to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, are discussed, as well as the limitations to its expansion.

5|$|Textile {{manufacture}} {{was important}} to the town during the Middle Ages. Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible. Percy and Ernist Petter, who formed Westland Aircraft Works, witnessed some of Stringfellow's demonstrations in Chard and often asked <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> the formation of Westland's first aircraft development factory {{on the outskirts of}} Yeovil. AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the RAeS. James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs. Chard is a key point on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line.|$|E
5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.|$|E
5|$|After Egypt's central {{government}} collapsed {{at the end}} of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.|$|E

5|$|Alexander III's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to adjudicate between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was set up and {{after two years of}} deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in medias res, while Piz (Chris Lowell) and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{are at a}} party, a bloodied Veronica stumbles to Piz’s {{door and}} collapses. The episode flashes back to two days earlier. As the Lilith House celebrates {{the end of the}} Greek system, Logan (Jason Dohring) {{abruptly}} breaks up with Veronica. Weevil helps Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) fix his TV. A man comes into the Dean’s office and implicitly threatens to remove his funding if the Greek system stays closed. The Dean tells Keith (Enrico Colantoni) to track his wife, and Veronica sobs in the shower due to her breakup with Logan. The Dean unexpectedly reinstates the Greek system, to the delight of Dick (Ryan Hansen). The Dean and Veronica spot a classified ad that states that a mysterious person will find his next victim at a party. After receiving an A on her paper, she visits Tim Foyle (James Jordan) and sees an investigation board. Veronica enlists Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Piz, and Mac <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> investigating an upcoming Pi Sig party.|$|E
5|$|By May 1942, Conant {{felt that}} the S-1 Committee had become too unwieldy. It had not met since the March meeting. When he needed expert advice in May, he had called upon a smaller group, and he {{recommended}} that this supervise the OSRD work, mainly the technical and contractual aspects of the project, while the Army handled engineering, construction and site selection. Procurement was an OSRD responsibility, but it could turn to the Army <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>in</b> case of difficulties. Bush obtained the president's approval for this, and on June 19, 1942, he abolished the S-1 Section {{and replaced it with}} the S-1 Executive Committee. Conant was appointed as its chairman, and Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Eger Murphree, and Urey as its other members.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{requirements}} for Knowledge Management is to define and implement mechanisms to build the corporate memory. Traditional systems for maintaining the corporate memory are based on user's intervention to update knowledge.

This article proposes the use of intelligent agents technology to manage knowledge {{in the context of}} software development process, adopting a methodology <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>in</b> the creation and maintenance of a corporate memory and a framework <b>for</b> <b>helping</b> <b>in</b> the construction of agents. The use of intelligent agents technology will allow the collaborative and transparent construction of a corporate memory...|$|R
