5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of <b>Honduras.</b> After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing <b>Honduras</b> from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to <b>Honduras.</b> The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to <b>Honduras,</b> and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Honduras</b> was a {{relatively}} poor province and did not attract the most distinguished conquistadors. Most conquistadors and colonists who ventured to <b>Honduras</b> desired to return quickly to Spain with newly acquired wealth and improved social status, and were therefore looking for immediate enrichment. The progress of conquest {{was based on the}} distribution of encomienda rights and land concessions. Encomienda gave the encomendero (holder of the encomienda) the right to receive tribute and labour from the indigenous inhabitants of a defined area. Up until the middle of the 16th century, the encomendero could assign his own level of tribute and labour to be provided by the natives within his encomienda, which gave rise to much abuse. The encomiendas established in <b>Honduras</b> were small, and did not generate rapid income. Social advancement was gained by overlordship of natives within the encomienda system. In <b>Honduras,</b> the conquistadors gained immediate income by selling natives into slavery on the Caribbean islands and in Panama, and by mining activities. This in turn resulted in a reduction of indigenous population levels in <b>Honduras,</b> with a rapid drop in economic production {{during the first half of}} the 16th century. On the whole, the Spanish colonists were unwilling to invest time and resources into the long-term development of the agricultural production of their encomiendas in <b>Honduras.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of <b>Honduras,</b> and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the <b>Honduras</b> and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of <b>Honduras</b> issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in <b>Honduras</b> 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, the Spanish Crown reorganised {{the area}} of <b>Honduras</b> into the Provincia de Higueras e Cabo de <b>Honduras</b> ("Province of Higueras and Cape of Honduras"). The western portion, from the Golfo Dulce, now in Guatemala, to the Ulúa valley and Naco, was defined as Higueras; the eastern portion was <b>Honduras,</b> {{including}} Trujillo, the Valley of Olancho, and extending as far as Cape Camarón. Although organised as two territories, it effectively comprised one province, {{often referred to as}} Honduras-Higueras. In 1534, Honduras-Higueras was removed from the jurisdiction of New Spain, where it had been since the late 1520s, and returned to that of the audiencia of Santo Domingo.|$|E
5|$|In 1537, Francisco de Montejo was {{appointed}} governor. As {{soon as he}} arrived in <b>Honduras,</b> he cancelled the land distribution carried out by Alvarado. In that year, a great native uprising spread throughout <b>Honduras,</b> led by the Lenca ruler Lempira. Lempira held out for six months at his formidable stronghold at the Peñol de Cerquín ("Rock of Cerquín") before he was killed, during which time the uprising across <b>Honduras</b> threatened {{the existence of the}} Spanish colony. After Lempira's death, Montejo and his captain Alonso de Cáceres rapidly imposed Spanish dominion across most of Honduras; the main phase of the Spanish conquest was complete by 1539, although Olancho and the east were not brought within the Spanish Empire for some decades to come.|$|E

50|$|Less {{than half}} of <b>Honduras's</b> {{cultivable}} land was planted with crops {{as recently as the}} mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and was owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for additional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because much of <b>Honduras's</b> soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in Central America. In addition, by 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been seriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn squatters who planted unsuitable food crops.|$|R

5|$|In March 1524, Gil González Dávila {{became the}} first Spaniard to arrive {{in what is now}} <b>Honduras</b> with the {{intention}} of conquest. He founded the first Spanish port upon the Caribbean coast, Puerto de Caballos, which became an important staging post for later expeditions. The early decades of the Spanish conquest of <b>Honduras</b> were beset by jurisdictional disputes between different Spanish colonies attempting to invade the territory, which resulted in conflict between rival expeditions launched from Mexico, Hispaniola, and Panama. The Spanish territory was reorganised as Higueras in the west, and <b>Honduras</b> in the east. As the Spanish became established throughout Central America, the colony of Honduras-Higueras became involved in territorial disputes with neighbouring colonies in Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.|$|E
5|$|On October31, a {{disaster}} declaration was signed for <b>Honduras</b> {{due to the}} effects from Beta.

Two Fokker F27 aircraft were also supplied to help assist the transportation of relief supplies at a cost of $40,000. The United States Department of Defense sent military personnel to the affected areas from November4–8. During that time, more than 155,000lb (70,306kg) of relief supplies were airlifted to the affected communities. The United States embassy in <b>Honduras</b> also provided a C-12 Huron aircraft to transport 3,000lb (1,360kg) to Puerto Lempira. A total of $500,000 was sent in the form of relief supplies and transport to <b>Honduras</b> from USAID. The Spanish Government offered a C-130 Hercules containing emergency supplies to <b>Honduras.</b> The World Food Programme pre-positioned 509tons (461.7tonnes) of food to be used in temporary shelters and recovery activities.

5|$|The British {{government}} requested for the United States to send {{vessels to}} assist those {{affected by the}} storm. A number of residents of Belize City were left without food and water supplies. The USS Swan (AM-34), stationed at nearby Trujillo, <b>Honduras,</b> was dispatched to send aid to British <b>Honduras.</b> United States President Herbert Hoover ordered the United States Navy and American Red Cross to cooperate in relief efforts. Both agencies and organizations ordered a United States Marine Corps plane from Managua, Nicaragua, to send $2,500worth of medical supplies to affected areas of British <b>Honduras.</b> Throughout the city, relief kitchens were set up. The Government of British <b>Honduras</b> eventually began burning areas with debris and bodies, to prevent spread of disease. Monrad Metzgen, a lieutenant of the British <b>Honduras</b> Defense Force, became responsible for the rescue of persons trapped, feeding those without shelter, and the burial of the deceased.
