5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. <b>Heaving</b> wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the <b>heaving</b> ship.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or <b>heaving</b> gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E

5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and <b>heaving</b> on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a <b>heaving</b> mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E
5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost <b>heaving</b> into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the <b>heaving</b> deck.|$|E
40|$|Suction piles {{are used}} for {{anchoring}} the mooring lines at the seafloor. One of the challenges of their installing is the occurrence of the <b>heave</b> resonance of the pile-cable system and possibly the <b>heave</b> induced pitch resonance during the lowering process. When the <b>heave</b> and/or pitch frequency of the vessel which operates the lowering of the pile matches the <b>heave</b> natural frequency of the pile-cable system, the <b>heave</b> resonance may occur, resulting in large <b>heave</b> oscillations of the pile and thus significantly increasing loads on the lowering cable and lowering devices. Furthermore, the large <b>heave</b> may resonantly induce the pitch of a pile. To predict and possibly mitigate the heave/pitch resonance of the pile-cable system during the lowering process, {{it is crucial to}} under the mechanism of <b>heave</b> induced pitch resonance and estimate the added-mass and damping coefficients of the pile-cable system accurately. The model tests of the forced <b>heave</b> excitation of pile models were first conducted to investigate the added-mass coefficient for a pile model with different opening area ratios at its top cap at the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory of Texas AandM University. In the model tests, it was observed that the resonant <b>heave</b> may occur if the <b>heave</b> excitation frequency matches the related <b>heave</b> natural frequency and the pitch resonance may be induced by the <b>heave</b> resonance. The results of the following theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the <b>heave</b> excitation of the pile-cable system are found to be consistent with the related measurements, which is helpful to further understand the physics of lowering a pile-cable system. The results of this study may be used to determine the magnitudes of total <b>heave</b> added-mass and damping coefficient of a pile and the <b>heave</b> natural frequency of the pile-cable system based upon its main characteristics. The <b>heave</b> induced resonant pitch is found to occur when 1) the pitch natural frequency is roughly equal to one half of the <b>heave</b> natural frequency and 2) the <b>heave</b> excitation frequency is approximately equal to the <b>heave</b> natural frequency. If only one of the two conditions is satisfied, no significant pitch resonance will occur. These results may have important implications to the operation of lowering offshore equipment to the seafloor in deep water...|$|R

These coarse fills have very low water contents, and are located above the groundwater table. In an attempt to explain the unexpected frost <b>heave,</b> it is proposed that cyclic train loads cause the development of excess pore water pressure in the underlying subgrade soil, and hence ‘pump’ up the water table to the frost front, which in turn feeds the formation of ice and results in continuous frost <b>heave.</b> A simple quantitative model is then developed to simulate the pumping-enhanced frost <b>heave.</b> The numerical {{results show that the}} proposed mechanism can indeed provide a rational explanation for the otherwise unexpected frost <b>heave.</b> The engineering implications of this new frost <b>heave</b> mechanism are also discussed, in the context of designing frost <b>heave</b> mitigation measures in seasonally frozen regions...|$|R

40|$|Accurate <b>heave</b> {{measurements}} {{are important in}} the application of marine field to actively compensate for wave motion of a ship. An MTi unit is used to measure the <b>heave</b> motion of the ship in this paper. The primary error of <b>heave</b> measurements come from white noise and constant or slowly varying bias. The process of time integral of acceleration eliminates the white noise and a highpass filter is used to remove the bias. Then the first time integral of acceleration get the <b>heave</b> speed. The bilinear transformation is used to design IIR digital filter based on the conversion of analog prototype filter. Numerical simulation gets a conclusion that the mean absolute errors of <b>heave</b> speed measurements have relation to the cutoff frequencies of the filter.
