Surinder Kumar, the master blender at Amrut Distilleries, says that this allows for [...] "more reflux, more contact time with the copper". The spirit is then distilled again in Scottish-style, but Indian-made, 5,000-litre copper spirit still with a boil ball. This produces spirit between 68% and 70% abv. If the spirit is diluted to 62.8%, each distillation run makes enough to fill 20 barrels. The whisky is aged in a mix of new oak and used Bourbon barrels imported from the United States. The distillery initially tried importing staves to save money, but abandoned the practice due to {{the smell of the}} barrels. It has also used its own rum and brandy barrels to finish its single malts. The Amrut Intermediate Sherry variant is aged in Sherry casks from Spain and Portugal. Amrut Distilleries has a cooperage on site to handle repairs.|$|E

Several rounds of mutagenesis were carried out, mutagen concentration and duration of exposure were adopted as variables. Optimal conditions required to ensure {{the death of the}} yeast cells were achieved during the log phase of cell, at concentration of mutagen 114. 5 â€“ 137. 4 mg/cm 3 and during the mutagenesis duration exposure time 60 min. As a result, several tens of yeast mutants were obtained. Based on testing of fermentation were selected five mutants characterized by a higher volumetric ethanol productivity than the starting strain. The obtained mutants were subjected to the screening test for their resistance to acetic acid. It was found that the mutants showed two times higher resistance to acetic acid than the starting strain...|$|E
40|$|The {{robustness}} {{of industrial}} grain whisky fermentation {{is influenced by}} environmental stresses that affect the performance of <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast,</b> and {{have an effect on}} its sugar usage and ethanol. production. Among changes that occur during ferinentation is an increase in temperature and ethanol concentrations, which both are known to cause a stress response in. yeast. In order to understand the yeast response, I used proteomics technology to quantify levels of identified proteins during industrial fermentations. Increased levels of stress proteins and proteases were among the significant changes in the soluble proteome of <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast,</b> as the fermentations progressed. The proteomic data set was complemented with an expression analysis of-selected yeast genes, which included a detailed analysis of genes and proteins involved in sugar uptake and metabolism. Proteomics technology was also used to study molecular differences in <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast</b> that occurred when changing the volumetric scale from industrial (400, 000 1) to laboratory (0. 5 1), and in a second series of experiments, increasing the yeast pitching rate from 1 g- L to 4 g L. The results showed that up-regulation of proteases was not observed at laboratory scale, and increasing pitching rate led to a significant:increase in. the levels of heat shock proteins during fermentation. The mitochondrial proteome of <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast</b> was also investigated at 30 min and 48 h of laboratory fermentations, leading to quantification of mitochondria-associated proteins that may be important for metabolism and/or yeast survival under fermentative conditions. Gene deletion of the HSP 26 gene in <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast</b> revealed that four copies were present, and ploidy analysis confirmed that <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast</b> indeed is a tetraploid strain. The deletion of the HSP 26 gene did not influence yeast sensitivity against lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol or oxidative stress. Interestingly, prolonged fermentations (> 72 h) with IlHSP 26 mutants showed that ethanol yield was reduced compared to wild type cells. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{transformed}} with a yeast multicopy {{expression vector}} carrying the cDNA for Aspergillus niger secretory beta-galactosidase {{under the control}} of ADH 1 promoter and terminator were studied for their fermentation properties on lactose (V. Kumar, S. Ramakrishnan, T. T. Teeri, J. K. C. Knowles, and B. S. Hartley, Biotechnology 10 : 82 - 85, 1992). Lactose was hydrolyzed extracellularly into glucose and galactose, and both sugars were utilized simultaneously. Diauxic growth patterns were not observed. However, a typical biphasic growth was observed on a mixture of glucose and galactose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with transformants of a haploid S. cerevisiae strain, GRF 167. Polyploid <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast</b> (Mauri) transformants were selected simply {{on the basis of the}} cloned gene expression on X-Gal (5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) plates. Rapid and complete lactose hydrolysis and higher ethanol (0. 31 g/g of sugar) and biomass (0. 24 g/g of sugar) production were observed with <b>distiller's</b> <b>yeast</b> grown under aerobic conditions. A constant proportion (10 %) of the population retained the plasmid throughout the fermentation period (48 h).

40|$|The gene {{copy number}} at the CUP 1 locus and the {{resistance}} level to external copper was directly correlated in five wild-type commercial Saccharomyces strains. An increased copy {{number of the}} CUP 1 gene leads to increased accumulation of chelatin mRNA, which codes for a low-molecular-weight, copper-binding protein. The enhanced production of this rapidly inducible protein mediates resistance of the cell to copper. Industrial yeasts exhibit homologies to the amplified copper resistance repeat unit found in laboratory strains. However, the extent of tandem iteration is strain dependent, and the repetitious unit is either 1. 7 or 1. 5 kilobases in length compared with the 2. 0 -kilobase unit in laboratory strains. Strain 522 (Montrachet) contains two chromosome VIII segments distinguishable by their numbers of repeat units (2 and 11) {{and the size of}} the units (1. 5 and 1. 7 kilobases). <b>Distillers</b> <b>yeast</b> 513 carries a 1. 5 -kilobase repeat unit on each homologous chromosome, although they contain nine and five iterations, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} a voluminous {{literature}} con-cerning the structure and function of various organelles within the yeast cell, general agreement seems to be lacking. Various controversies and disagreements have arisen, due primarily to differing interpretations of light microscopical observations. Many studies {{have been carried out}} on the behavior and structure of these or-ganelles during various phases of developmnent of the yeast cell; however, no detailed studies have been carried out on the internal struicture of ascospores of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A study by ultrathin sectioning and electron microscopy by Agar and Douglas (1957) of resting vegetative cells of S. cerevisiae increased the possibility of resolving some of the disputes apparently caused by the limited resolution of the light microscope. Although their technique was successful for study of the vegetative yeast cell when grown on Lindegren's presporulation nmedium, detailed ob-servations on the internal structure of the yeast ascospore could not be made due to lack of internal differentiation and to disruption durinig the preparative process. In the present investi-gation, suitable methods were devised which made it possible to observe the internal structure of ascospores of S. cerevisiae.

This work has evaluated {{the effect of the}} introduction of cages with cultivation of tilapia fed 0 % (control), 20 %, 40 % and 60 % (groups test) of yeast replacing the traditional sources of diet on weight, survival and feed conversion and also there is no difference between the loss function of Taguchi to the total for the dead fish and discarded and the four balanced rations. The analysis of variance was applied showing that there were no statistical differences (p > 0. 05) between the effects of treatments on the survival and feed conversion, but there was a quadratic effect on weight gain of tilapia (Y = 73. 39 + 0. 173 X â€“ 0. 0034 X 2, R 2 = 0. 9986), concluding that the best level of inclusion of yeast as protein source for juvenile is reversed 25. 44 %. Taguchiâ€™s loss for the cost of production and for the dead fishes in the treatment T 2 = 20 %, T 3 = 40 % and T 4 = 60 % were lower the group control (T 1 = 0 %).

40|$|Whisk(e) y {{is a major}} global {{distilled}} spirit beverage. Whiskies {{are produced}} from cereal starches that are saccharified, fermented and distilled prior to spirit maturation. The strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae employed in whisky fermentations is crucially important {{not only in terms}} of ethanol yields, but also for production of minor yeast metabolites which collectively contribute to development of spirit flavour and aroma characteristics. Distillers must therefore pay very careful attention to the strain of yeast exploited to ensure consistency of fermentation performance and spirit congener profiles. In the Scotch whisky industry, initiatives to address sustainability issues facing the industry (for example, reduced energy and water usage) have resulted in a growing awareness regarding criteria for selecting new distilling yeasts with improved efficiency. For example, there is now a desire for Scotch whisky distilling yeasts to perform under more challenging conditions such as high gravity wort fermentations. This article highlights the important roles of S. cerevisiae strains in whisky production (with particular emphasis on Scotch) and describes key fermentation performance attributes sought in <b>distillerâ€™s</b> <b>yeast,</b> such as high alcohol yields, stress tolerance and desirable congener profiles.
