In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers, with Japanese market vehicles were installed with a NAPS badge on the rear <b>deckled</b> that identified emission control technology having been installed. This process began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978. This meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new crossflow Z engines, based on the L.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} editions, a {{carefully}} handbound edition produced for Dragon Press by Henry Wessels with linen cloth spine with handmade paper-covered boards and endpapers with <b>deckled</b> edge and a trade paperback edition printed by Odyssey Press in New Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|Before the 19th century, the <b>deckle</b> edge was unavoidable, {{a natural}} {{artifact}} of the papermaking {{process in which}} sheets of paper were made individually on a <b>deckle.</b> The <b>deckle</b> could not make a perfect seal against the screen at the edges and the paper slurry would seep under, creating a rough edge to the paper. The <b>deckle</b> edge could be trimmed off, but this extra step would add {{to the cost of}} the book. Beginning in the early 1800s with the invention of the Fourdrinier machine, paper was produced in long rolls and the <b>deckle</b> edge became mostly obsolete; although there was some <b>deckle</b> on the ends of the rolls, it was cut off, and the individual sheets cut out from the roll would have no <b>deckle</b> in any case.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{appearance}} of smooth edges in the 19th century, the <b>deckle</b> edge slowly emerged as a status symbol. Many 19th-century presses advertised {{two versions of the}} same book: one with edges trimmed smooth and a higher-priced <b>deckle</b> version, which suggested the book was made with higher-quality paper, or with more refined methods. This tradition carried forward into the 20th and 21st centuries. [...] modern <b>deckle</b> is produced by a purpose-built machine to give {{the appearance}} of a true <b>deckle</b> edge by cutting a smooth edge into patterns. Many modern readers are unfamiliar with the <b>deckle</b> edge and may see it as a defect; for example, Amazon.com has left notes to buyers that the <b>deckle</b> is not a flaw in the product. A <b>deckle</b> edge is unrelated to the practice of unopened pages, in which a reader must cut open pages with knife.|$|R
50|$|Paper with a {{feathered}} edge {{is described as}} having a <b>deckle</b> edge, {{in contrast to a}} cut edge. Machine-made paper may artificially have its edges produced to resemble a <b>deckle</b> edge.|$|R
50|$|A <b>deckled</b> edge {{is also a}} feathery, {{unfinished}} paper edge. Many fine art works, and hand-made, fine art finished, or digital prints deckle the paper edge. Again, as in book printing, this was once considered an imperfection as the byproduct of hand-made paper-making. Now makers use it to create the appearance of greater value.|$|E
50|$|Van Vechten {{became an}} expert {{in all aspects of}} book-making. She was an {{innovator}} on the technical side of printing, inventing a way to feed <b>deckled</b> paper through the press that would allow for perfectly registered printing {{on both sides of the}} page. This was something that most experts had thought impossible, and her achievement was remarked on in publications around the country.|$|E
5000|$|Hesse’s {{interest}} in latex {{as a medium}} for sculptural forms {{had to do with}} immediacy. Keats states, [...] "immediacy {{may be one of the}} prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex". Hesse’s first two works using latex, Schema and Sequel (1967-68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. [...] "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like <b>deckled</b> paper." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>deckle</b> is a {{removable}} wooden frame or [...] "fence" [...] used in manual papermaking. In a related sense, {{it can also}} mean <b>deckle</b> edge paper—a type of paper with rough edges used in the book trade.|$|R
5000|$|In manual papermaking, a <b>deckle</b> is a {{removable}} wooden frame or [...] "fence" [...] placed into a mould {{to keep the}} paper slurry within bounds and to control {{the size of the}} sheet produced. After the mold is dipped into a vat of paper slurry, excess water is drained off and the <b>deckle</b> is removed and the mold shaken or [...] "couched" [...] to set the fibers of the paper. Some of the paper slurry passes under the <b>deckle</b> and forms an irregular, thin edge.|$|R

5000|$|Most of {{the pages}} were smooth-cut {{on the top and}} bottom edges, and <b>deckled</b> on the outer edge. Some books {{contained}} the note: [...] "This book is standard length, complete and unabridged. Manufactured under wartime conditions in conformity with all government regulations controlling the use of paper and other materials." [...] This explains the yellowed or tanning paper condition, more noticeable in some books than others. Some books were illustrated. Many of the books did not include a publish date. Dust jackets were not included.|$|E

50|$|The only folio set {{produced}} in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, {{and the next}} thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893-1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with <b>deckled</b> edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on Chine-collé. The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, {{as well as the}} necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.|$|E

50|$|In film processing, <b>deckles</b> are die inserts {{that set}} the coating width of a slot die coater or the {{extrusion}} width of an extrusion die. They work by constraining the flow as the material exits the die. Since some materials {{have a tendency to}} neck in or spread out after leaving the die, workers may need to adjust the <b>deckle</b> position to achieve target width.|$|R
5000|$|The Goyard art book {{published}} by Devambez is the reference publication upon Parisian trunk makers. It was dubbed [...] "a luxury bible" [...] by Suzy Menkes {{in the article}} called [...] "A tender Tome of Art and Heart" [...] that she wrote in the New York Times on 15 June 2010. The book had a print run of 233 copies, {{a reference to the}} address of the Goyard historic store that has been located at 233, rue Saint Honoré since 1834. It will never be republished and is visible by appointment only.The Goyard art book pays tribute to the golden days of luxury travelling, from horse carriage to ocean liners. It retraces the history of Goyard and is showcased in a special made-to-order trunk that is altogether a jewel case and a book’s binding (sewing). Each individual purchaser is invited to make their named copy into a unique piece by picking the colour for the trunk canvas, which can also be initialled or adorned with stripes in the shades of their choice. Copies are numbered from 1 to 233, and that number is specified both on the trunk and in the book. The Goyard art book is printed on watermarked <b>deckled</b> vellum paper that was custom-made by Arches, France’s most renowned papermakers. Lead letterpress techniques have been used for the texts. The Goyard art book is featured in the collections of the National Library of France, the Bibliothèque des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and the Kunstbibliothek in Berlin.|$|E

5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the <b>deckle</b> finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|R
