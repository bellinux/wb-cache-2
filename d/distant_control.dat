50|$|In eukaryotes, {{transcription}} {{is regulated}} by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors) {{associated with a}} gene’s promoter and also by <b>distant</b> <b>control</b> sequences including enhancers. Enhancers are non-coding DNA sequences, containing several binding sites {{for a variety of}} transcription factors. They typically recruit transcriptional factors that modulate chromatin structure and directly interact with the transcription machinery placed at the promoter of gene. Enhancers are able to regulate transcription of target genes in a cell type-specific manner, independent of their location or distance from the promoter of genes. Occasionally, they can regulate transcription of genes located in a different chromosome. However, the knowledge about enhancers so far has been limited to studies of a small number of enhancers, as they have been difficult to identify accurately at a genome-wide scale. Moreover, many regulatory elements function only in certain cell types and specific conditions.|$|E

Methods: Sixty-nine cases of ocular adnexal lymphoproliferative disease, seen in a tertiary referral center from 1992 to 2003, {{were included in the}} study. Lesions were classified by using the World Health Organization modification of the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid neoplasms classification. Outcome variables included disease-specific Survival, relapse-free survival, local control, and <b>distant</b> <b>control.</b> Results: Stage IV disease at presentation, aggressive lymphoma histology, the presence of prior or concurrent systemic lymphoma at presentation, and bilateral adnexal disease were significant predictors for reduced disease-specific survival, local control, and <b>distant</b> <b>control.</b> Multivariate analysis found that aggressive histology and bilateral adnexal disease had significantly reduced disease-specific Survival. Conclusions: The typical presentation of adnexal lymphoproliferative disease is with a painless mass, swelling, or proptosis; however, pain and inflammation occurred in 20 % and 30 % of patients, respectively.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and outcome of intensity-modulated arc therapy +/- A cisplatin (IMAT +/- A C) followed by hysterectomy for locally advanced cervical cancer. A total of 30 patients {{were included in the}} study. The primary tumour and PET-positive lymph node(s) received a simultaneous integrated boost. Four weeks after IMAT +/- A C treatment, response was evaluated. Resection consisted of hysterectomy with or without lymphadenectomy. Tumour response, acute and late radiation toxicity, postoperative morbidity and outcome were evaluated. All hysterectomy specimens were macroscopically tumour-free with negative resection margins; pathological complete response was 40 %. In 2 patients, one resected lymph node was positive. There was no excess in postoperative morbidity. Apart from two grade 3 hematologic toxicities, no grade 3 or 4 acute radiation toxicity was observed. No grade 3, 1 grade 4 (4 %) intestinal, and 4 grade 3 (14 %) urinary late toxicities were observed. The 2 -year local and regional control rates were 96 % and 100 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction:Outcomes data {{treating}} {{patients with}} oligometastatic (⩽ 5 metastases) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT) are limited. Methods:Consecutive oligometastatic NSCLC patients were reviewed from a prospective database. Patients were included if all active diseases {{were treated with}} HIGRT. Lesions that had received prior radiation or had radiographic/metabolic resolution after chemotherapy were not treated with HIGRT. Local control of all treated lesions, <b>distant</b> <b>control,</b> progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and control of individual lesions (LeC) were calculated. Results:Twenty-five patients with median of 2 treated oligometastatic lesions were included. Median follow-up was 14 months. Median age was 66 years. Nineteen patients received systemic therapy before HIGRT and 11 had progressive disease after their most recent systemic therapy before HIGRT. Median OS and PFS were 22. 7 and 7. 6 months. The 18 months local control, <b>distant</b> <b>control,</b> OS, and PFS were 66. 1 %, 31. 7 %, 52. 9 %, and 28. 0 %. Greater than two sites treated with HIGRT, nonadenocarcinoma histology, prior systemic therapy, and progression after systemic therapy were associated with worse PFS. Sixty-two individual lesions of median size 2. 7 cm were treated. For extracranial lesions, median total and fraction dose were 50 and 5 Gy. Median standard equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions for extracranial lesions was 64. 6 Gy yielding 18 months LeC of 70. 7 %. Standard equivalent dose ≥ 64. 6 Gy increased LeC (p = 0. 04). Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity. Conclusions:HIGRT for oligometastatic NSCLC provides durable LeC and may provide long-term PFS in some patients. Future HIGRT studies should optimize patient selection and integration with systemic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose/Objective(s) :Regional {{failures}} {{occur in}} up to 15 % of patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I/II lung cancer. This report focuses on {{the management of the}} unique scenario of isolated regional failures. Methods:Patients treated initially with SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy were screened for curative intent treatment of isolated mediastinal failures (IMFs). Local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and <b>distant</b> <b>control</b> were estimated from the date of salvage treatment using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results:Among 160 patients treated from 2002 to 2012, 12 suffered IMF and were amenable to salvage treatment. The median interval between treatments was 16 months (2 – 57 mo). Median salvage dose was 66 Gy (60 – 70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 10 months, the median overall survival was 15 months (95 % confidence interval, 5. 8 – 37 mo). When estimated from original treatment, the median overall survival was 38 months (95 % confidence interval, 17 – 71 mo). No subsequent regional failures occurred. Distant failure was the predominant mode of relapse following salvage for IMF with a 2 -year <b>distant</b> <b>control</b> rate of 38 %. At the time of this analysis, three patients have died without recurrence while four are alive and no evidence of disease. High-grade toxicity was uncommon. Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is first analysis of salvage mediastinal radiation after SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung cancer. Outcomes appear similar to stage III disease at presentation. Distant failures were common, suggesting a role for concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. A standard full course of external beam radiotherapy is advisable in this unique clinical scenario...|$|E

Patients and methods: From April 2006 to December 2011, 68 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated with IMRT and chemotherapy at our hospital. Median radiation doses delivered to gross tumor volume and positive neck nodes were 66 – 70  Gy, 63  Gy to clinical target volume, and 50. 4 – 56  Gy to clinically negative neck. The clinical toxicities, patterns of failures, locoregional <b>control,</b> <b>distant</b> metastasis <b>control,</b> disease-free survival, and overall survival were observed. Results: The median follow-up time was 52. 2  months (range: 11 – 87  months). Epstein–Barr virus infection was positive in 63. 2 % of patients. Overall disease failure developed in 21 patients, of whom 85. 8 % belonged to stage III/IV disease. Among these, there were seven locoregional recurrences, three regional recurrences with distant metastases, and eleven distant metastases. The median interval from the date of diagnosis to failure was 26. 5  months (range: 16 – 50  months). Six of ten (60 %) locoregional recurrences were treated with reirradiation ± concurrent chemotherapy. The 5 -year locoregional <b>control,</b> <b>distant</b> metastasis <b>control,</b> disease-free survival, and overall survival rates of whole cohort were 81. 1 %, 74. 3 %, 60. 1 %, and 73. 4 %, respectively.

Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by IMRT with or without chemotherapy improves the long-term survival of Saudi patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Distant metastasis was the main pattern of treatment failure. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, age, and Epstein–Barr virus status before IMRT were important independent prognostic factors.
