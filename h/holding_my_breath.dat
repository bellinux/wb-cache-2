Human Rights Foundation president Thor Halvorssen said in the article [...] "that Sean Penn would be honored by anyone, let alone the gay community, for having stood by a dictator that put gays into concentration camps is mind-boggling."

"It won't do to run; but you {{can keep}} close at my heels," [...] the captain said as he set off at a walk which fully equaled running, and we {{followed}} very closely, I literally <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as I tried {{to realize that the}} task which had seemed so formidable a few moments previous, had been accomplished with the greatest ease.|$|E
60|$|Gently and reverently I {{lifted her}} in my arms, an {{intoxication}} of holy joy pervading me, and the prayers falling faster from my lips than ever they had done since as a lad I had recited them at my mother's knee. A moment I laid her on the bench, whilst I divested myself of my cloak. Then suddenly I paused, and stood listening, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{place was}} a tiny gorge, with but one entrance, which was hidden behind a barren spur of rock--just a sort of long fissure, jagged and curving, in the rock, like a fault in the stratification.

60|$|There {{was nothing}} to do but to swim for it, which, in that wild confusion, was at the best a matter of but a few moments. <b>Holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and working with my hands, I managed to get off my heavy sea-boots and my jacket. Yet there was very little breath I could catch to hold, and I swiftly {{discovered}} that it was not so much a matter of swimming as of breathing.|$|E

"I snooped around {{through the}} bushes, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> mighty hard, for Mr. Fox {{has a good}} pair of ears, till I was among a lot of {{raspberry}} vines not so very far from the old oak.

A growl, low, angry, vicious followed the echoes of my rifle. Then it seemed he pointed his head toward us and began to run down the slope, looking our way all the time.|$|E

60|$|So, as I was saying, I {{had gone}} down upon one knee, and was just {{reaching}} out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a sight that made me draw back hastily and <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature a way.|$|R

He was speaking in a low voice--there was much noise--I was deeply interested, and straining my ears to catch his words, stretching my neck, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> to hear, unconscious of everything but the fascinating tale.

60|$|<b>Holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> for now was I come to {{the most}} desperate part of my undertaking, I caught {{up one of the}} tapers and set fire to a corner of the sheet.

Then, without waiting for more, I backed swiftly away, watching the progress of the flames as they devoured the paper and presently reached his hand and scorched it.|$|E
60|$|Half-way there I {{stopped short}} and, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> listened intently. The wind had dropped {{and the rain}} had almost ceased, but the night was still as dark as pitch. I listened with {{strained}} ears and beating heart and soon I knew that I had not been mistaken. Coming down the hill between Rothland Wood gate and where I was, along the road by which we had just come, I could hear the faint, but nevertheless unmistakable, sound of light, running footsteps. Turning back, I stole softly down the path {{and stood in the}} middle of the road, waiting.|$|E

So you keep a still head, slow down your breathing. Sometimes I actually <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> so I can be as still and well-balanced as possible.

50|$|I {{resisted}} {{and punched}} {{one of them}} in the face. At this point, they took me and ducked my head into a closed drain full of excrement. They held me under for so long, I was unable to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> any longer, and excrement was inhaled through my nose and seeped into my mouth.During the interrogations, they threatened several times to execute me and to torture and rape my family members as well as imprison them for long terms.|$|R
6000|$|Dreadful suspicions now beset me {{of their}} being able to {{accomplish}} by treachery what they had failed to effect by force. Well as I knew the cottage, I began to doubt whether {{there might not be}} ways of cunningly and silently entering it against which I was not provided. The ticking of the clock annoyed me; the crackling of the fire startled me. I looked out twenty times in a minute into the dark corners of the passage, straining my eyes, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> anticipating the most unlikely events, the most impossible dangers. Had they really gone, or were they still prowling about the house? Oh, what a sum of money I would have given only to have known what they were about in that interval of silence! ...|$|E
6000|$|Not {{that in an}} {{existence}} so passive riddles {{never came}} my way. As one morning I brushed past a bush of lads' love (or maidens' ruin, as some call it), its fragrance sweeping me from top to toe, I stumbled on the carcass of a young mole. Curiosity vanquished the first gulp of horror. <b>Holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> with a stick I slowly edged {{it up in the}} dust and surveyed the white heaving nest of maggots in its belly with a peculiar and absorbed recognition. [...] "Ah, ha!" [...] a voice cried within me, [...] "so this is what is in wait; this is how things are"; and I stooped with lips drawn back over my teeth to examine the stinking mystery more closely. That was a lesson I have never unlearned.|$|E
60|$|After {{an hour of}} it, I was <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> {{against the}} lurches, like a sea-sick man against that {{bottomless}} fall of the ship's bows on the ocean. I had no pain,--only an over whelming exhaustion,--but the joy of her touch and her presence kept me from failing. And though Aunt Lucy dozed, not a wink of sleep did my lady get through all of those weary twelve hours. Always alert was she, solicitous beyond belief, scanning ever the dial of her watch {{to know when to}} give me brandy and physic; or reaching across to feel my temples for the fever. The womanliness of that last motion was a thing for a man to wonder at. But most marvellous of all was the instinct which told her of my chief sickening discomfort,--of the leathery, travelled smell of the carriage. As a relief for this she charged her pocket-napkin with a most delicate perfume, and held it to my face.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} there was a horrible rushing sound in my ears, and I felt that I could <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> no longer when my head rose above the surface. I struck out with a gasp of relief, which was, as it were, echoed close to me. I looked round, as well as {{darkness}} and water would allow, and observed an object floating near me. I pushed towards it, and just as I caught hold, I heard a panting voice exclaim-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Seb. By heaven, you're traitors all, that <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> hands. If death be but {{cessation}} of our thought, Then let me die, for I would think no more.
