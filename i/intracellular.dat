5|$|Potassium {{homeostasis}} {{denotes the}} maintenance of the total body potassium content, plasma potassium level, and the ratio of the <b>intracellular</b> to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), obligatory renal excretion, and shifts between <b>intracellular</b> and extracellular compartments.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{show that}} both the nickel-induced {{activation}} of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes are caused by depletion of <b>intracellular</b> ascorbate. The addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the <b>intracellular</b> ascorbate level and reversed both the metal-induced stabilization of HIF-1- and HIF-1α-dependent gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{protease}} {{targets of}} <b>intracellular</b> inhibitory serpins {{have been difficult}} to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of <b>intracellular</b> serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human <b>intracellular</b> serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are also known to form <b>intracellular</b> {{inclusions}} of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).|$|E
5|$|Congenital endothelial {{dystrophy}} type 2, a rare form of corneal dystrophy, {{is linked}} to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the <b>intracellular</b> concentration of boron.|$|E
5|$|Lactic {{acidosis}} {{is initially}} treated with sodium bicarbonate, although high doses are not recommended, as this may increase <b>intracellular</b> acidosis. Acidosis {{that does not}} respond to administration of sodium bicarbonate may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most <b>intracellular</b> serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the <b>intracellular</b> and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the <b>intracellular</b> heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol or cytoplasmic matrix is {{the liquid}} found inside cells. It {{constitutes}} {{most of the}} <b>intracellular</b> fluid (ICF). It is separated into compartments by membranes. For example, the mitochondrial matrix separates the mitochondrion into many compartments.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} {{microbes}} {{is a critical}} function of phagocytes that is performed either within the phagocyte (<b>intracellular</b> killing) or outside of the phagocyte (extracellular killing).|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP {{is still not}} understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with <b>intracellular</b> calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on <b>intracellular</b> calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} is {{also involved}} in <b>Intracellular</b> antibody-mediated proteolysis of antibody-bound virions. In this neutralisation pathway, TRIM21 (a protein of the tripartite motif family) binds with immunoglobulin G to direct the virion to the proteasome where it is degraded.|$|E
5|$|Toxins of type I {{systems are}} small, {{hydrophobic}} proteins that confer toxicity by damaging cell membranes. Few <b>intracellular</b> targets of type I toxins have been identified, possibly {{due to the}} difficult nature of analysing proteins that are poisonous to their bacterial hosts.|$|E
5|$|Virus-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by two main groups of viruses–DNA and RNA types–both of which are obligatory <b>intracellular</b> parasites.|$|E
5|$|With {{a typical}} <b>intracellular</b> {{concentration}} of 1–10mM, ATP is abundant. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur {{repeatedly in the}} course of aerobic metabolism.|$|E
5|$|With ongoing {{heat and}} compaction, removal of {{moisture}} in the peat and from the <b>intracellular</b> structure of fossilized plants, and removal of molecular water.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in <b>intracellular</b> calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of <b>intracellular</b> proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{exposure}} to ambient Mn air concentrations {{in excess of}} 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased <b>intracellular</b> Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage.|$|E
5|$|The exosome complex (or PM/Scl complex, {{often just}} called the exosome) is a multi-protein <b>intracellular</b> complex capable of {{degrading}} {{various types of}} RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea, while in bacteria a simpler complex called the degradosome carries out similar functions.|$|E
25|$|Digitalis, {{displaces}} magnesium {{into the}} cell. Digitalis causes an increased <b>intracellular</b> concentration of sodium, {{which in turn}} increases <b>intracellular</b> calcium by passively decreasing {{the action of the}} sodium-calcium exchanger in the sarcolemma. The increased <b>intracellular</b> calcium gives a positive inotropic effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to eukaryotes, the <b>intracellular</b> {{features of the}} bacterial cell are extremely simple. Bacteria do not contain organelles {{in the same sense}} as eukaryotes. Instead, the chromosome and perhaps ribosomes are the only easily observable <b>intracellular</b> structures found in all bacteria. There do exist, however, specialized groups of bacteria that contain more complex <b>intracellular</b> structures, some of which are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|With {{enzyme-linked}} receptors, the <b>intracellular</b> domain has enzymatic activity. Often, this is {{tyrosine kinase}} activity. The enzymatic activity {{can also be}} due to an enzyme associated with the <b>intracellular</b> domain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intracellular</b> {{signaling}} proteins: these {{pass the}} signal to the organelles of the cell. Binding of the signal molecule to the receptor protein will activate <b>intracellular</b> signaling proteins that initiate a signaling cascade.|$|E
25|$|Naringenin {{has been}} shown to block the {{assembly}} of <b>intracellular</b> infectious viral particles without affecting <b>intracellular</b> levels of the viral RNA or protein. Although the research is relatively new, naringenin may offer new insight into HCV therapeutic target.|$|E
25|$|Maturation of {{the notch}} {{receptor}} involves cleavage at the prospective extracellular side during <b>intracellular</b> trafficking in the Golgi complex. This {{results in a}} bipartite protein, composed of a large extracellular domain linked to the smaller transmembrane and <b>intracellular</b> domain. Binding of ligand promotes two proteolytic processing events; {{as a result of}} proteolysis, the <b>intracellular</b> domain is liberated and can enter the nucleus to engage other DNA-binding proteins and regulate gene expression.|$|E
25|$|While {{not typical}} of all {{bacteria}} some microbes contain <b>intracellular</b> membranes {{in addition to}} (or as extensions of) their cytoplasmic membranes. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Examples of bacteria containing <b>intracellular</b> membranes are phototrophs, nitrifying bacteria and methane-oxidising bacteria. <b>Intracellular</b> membranes are also found in bacteria belonging to the poorly studied Planctomycetes group, although these membranes more closely resemble organellar membranes in eukaryotes and are currently of unknown function. Chromatophores are <b>intracellular</b> membranes found in phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intracellular</b> {{bacteria}} need {{to enter}} host cells (cells of the infected organism) {{in order to}} replicate and propagate infection. Many species of Shigella (causes bacillary dysentery), Salmonella (typhoid fever), Mycobacterium (leprosy and tuberculosis) and Listeria (listeriosis), to name but a few, are <b>intracellular.</b>|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{is needed}} for the {{adequate}} function of the Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in cardiac myocytes, the muscles cells of the heart. A lack of magnesium inhibits reuptake of potassium, causing a decrease in <b>intracellular</b> potassium. This decrease in <b>intracellular</b> potassium results in a tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Each {{isometric}} monomer is structurally {{organized into}} 8 distinct domains consists of; a leucine-rich repeat domain (L1, residues 1-157), a cysteine-rich region (CR, residues 158-310), an additional leucine rich repeat domain (L2, residues 311-470), three fibronectin type III domains; FnIII-1 (residues 471-595), FnIII-2 (residues 596-808) and FnIII-3 (residues 809-906). Additionally, an insert domain (ID, residues 638-756) resides within FnIII-2, containing the α/β furin cleavage site, from which proteolysis results in both IDα and IDβ domains. Within the β-chain, downstream of the FnIII-3 domain lies a transmembrane helix (TH) and <b>intracellular</b> juxtamembrane (JM) region, just upstream of the <b>intracellular</b> tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic domain, responsible for subsequent <b>intracellular</b> signaling pathways.|$|E
25|$|The noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway regulates <b>intracellular</b> calcium levels. Again Wnt binds and {{activates}} to Frizzled. In {{this case}} however activated Frizzled causes a coupled G-protein to activate a phospholipase (PLC), which interacts with and splits PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 can then bind to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum to release <b>intracellular</b> calcium stores, to induce calcium-dependent gene expression.|$|E
25|$|An {{increased}} <b>intracellular</b> ATP:ADP ratio {{closes the}} ATP-sensitive SUR1/Kir6.2 potassium channel (see sulfonylurea receptor). This prevents potassium ions (K+) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, {{leading to a}} buildup of <b>intracellular</b> potassium ions. As a result, {{the inside of the}} cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane.|$|E
25|$|Stimulative regulative G-protein is a G-protein {{linked to}} stimulative hormone {{receptor}} (Rs), and its α subunit upon activation could stimulate {{the activity of}} an enzyme or other <b>intracellular</b> metabolism. On the contrary, inhibitory regulative G-protein is linked to an inhibitory hormone receptor, and its α subunit upon activation could inhibit the activity of an enzyme or other <b>intracellular</b> metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Receptors can {{be roughly}} {{divided into two}} major classes: <b>intracellular</b> and {{extracellular}} receptors.|$|E
25|$|Signal Transduction Core, {{to assist}} {{research}} involving <b>intracellular</b> Ca2+ measurements and protein-protein interactions.|$|E
25|$|CRK, {{a protein}} {{involved}} in <b>intracellular</b> signal pathways involved in regulating cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration and invasion.|$|E
25|$|Calcium-activated {{potassium}} channels: This {{family of}} channels is activated by <b>intracellular</b> Ca2+ and contains 8 members.|$|E
25|$|In the inside-out method, a {{patch of}} the {{membrane}} {{is attached to the}} patch pipette, detached {{from the rest of the}} cell, and the cytosolic surface of the membrane is exposed to the external media, or bath. One advantage of this method is that the experimenter has access to the <b>intracellular</b> surface of the membrane via the bath and can change the chemical composition of what the surface of the membrane is exposed to. This is useful when an experimenter wishes to manipulate the environment at the <b>intracellular</b> surface of single ion channels. For example, channels that are activated by <b>intracellular</b> ligands can then be studied through a range of ligand concentrations.|$|E
