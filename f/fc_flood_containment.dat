Flooding is the most simple broadcast algorithm, but it wastes {{a lot of energy}} and bandwidth, as flooding leads to many redundant radio transmissions. An optimization to flooding is to contain it, once the resource has been found. In this paper, we compare the impact on the latency and power consumption of four competing approaches for <b>flooding</b> <b>containment.</b> The results show that stopping ongoing broadcasts can achieve promising performance increases over other flooding base techniques, when applied in large scale MANETs with scarce power resources.

The Proposed Action would increase the <b>flood</b> <b>containment</b> capacity of the Main and North Floodways Levee System by raising elevation {{of a number of}} levee segments for improved flood protection. Fill material would be added to the existing levee to bring height to its original design specifications, or to meet a 2 -foot freeboard design criterion. Typical height increases in improvement areas would be less than 1 foot and would not require expansion of the existing levee footprint. In some locations, up to 2 feet of fill material would be placed on top of the levee, extending levee footprint up to a maximum of 12 feet form the current toe of the levee. This expansion would take place along the approximately 20 feet service corridor currently utilized for levee maintenance, inside the maintained floodway, and entirely within the flood control project right-of-way. In some instances, adjustment in levee slope would be made to eliminate the need for levee footprint expansion, when required due to engineering considerations or for protection of biological or cultural resources.

The collapse of the flood berm allowed flood waters to surround the auxiliary and containment buildings at the plant, and also forced the temporary transfer of power from the external electricity grid to backup electrical generators. It was reported more than 2 ft of water rushed in around buildings and electrical transformers. Backup generators were then used to ensure the facility maintained electrical power for cooling. The rupturing of the flood berm also resulted in approximately 100 gal of petroleum being released into the river as many fuel containers were washed out. The fuel/oil containers were staged around the facility to supply fuel for pumps which remove water within the <b>flood</b> <b>containment</b> barriers. The rubber berm was a secondary measure not mandated by the NRC and {{was put in place}} by OPPD to provide additional room for work immediately outside the reactor buildings. According to the NRC, the water-filled berm [...] "protects several pieces of equipment that have been brought onsite, including an additional emergency diesel generator for supplying AC electrical power, water pumps, firefighting equipment and sandbagging supplies". On July 11 OPPD installed a new 8 ft inflatable berm as a replacement.|$|R

O estabelecimento de critérios que auxiliem a escolha do método geofísico mais adequado para a melhor solução ao problema geológico ou geotécnico colocado, visa, entre outros aspectos, contribuir para a mitigação dos problemas, principalmente ambientais, causados pela atividade antrópica concentrada nestes ambientes e ampliar o conhecimento geológico básico, propiciando deste modo intervenções sustentadas nestes complexos ambientes. Geophysical methods {{consist of}} a series of investigation tools with specific features that are critical to the study of water-covered areas, since these environments cannot be reached with conventional methods. However, sometimes these applications fail to provide the expected results. The objective {{of this study is to}} discuss and assess the applicability of geophysical methods by focusing on seismic methods in studies conducted in shallow water-covered areas: inner continental shelves, coastal areas, rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Criteria to help to select the most appropriate geophysical method to solve geological or geotechnical issues must be established to minimize problems, particularly environmental problems caused by concentrated anthropic activity, and to expand basic geological knowledge to allow for sustained interventions in these complex environments. This study is based on extensive bibliographic research and on several projects developed by IPT (Institute for Technological Research of São Paulo State) and by IOUSP (Oceanography Institute of the University of São Paulo), in addition to partnerships with private companies and other institutes in Brazil that address this field of knowledge. The focus on shallow waters was driven by the lack of systematic data and the demand for geological and geotechnical knowledge in these areas, due to the concentration, in these sectors, of the main economic activities of our current society: projects to build or reassess port dimensions, installation of moles, ducts, marinas, bridges, tunnels, fishing activities, beach regeneration, mineral prospecting, waterways, dredging, installation of reservoirs for water storage or <b>flood</b> <b>containment,</b> and reservoir silting. In any of these topics, basic geological knowledge of the bottom and subbottom of water-covered areas is essential to ensure the ventures success. Considering this, geophysical methods, particularly seismic ones, are investigation tools that effectively contribute to generate new information, and are the only set of tools available to quickly and objectively provide enough data to improve the geological understanding of the area under investigation. The result of this study includes a discussion on the feasibility of the methodologies recommended, based on an extensive survey conducted in 2005 / 2006 on the availability of geophysical equipment in research institutes and private companies in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{low-cost}} approach for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (<b>FC)</b> drying and <b>flooding</b> diagnosis based on power converter ripple is presented, suitable {{to be implemented}} in commercial applications. If proper signal processing algorithms are employed, the high-frequency ripple inherently produced by switch-mode converters allows one to monitor the FC ohmic resistance, {{which is a good}} indicator for membrane drying, while an ad hoc switching control of the converter allows one to monitor also the low-frequency impedance, which is an indicator for cell flooding. This technique is tested with a dc/dc boost converter directly connected to a single cell, discussing how different FC operation modes (such as constant current or constant voltage) may affect the sensitivity required to the diagnostic algorithm to correctly recognize drying and flooding occurrences...|$|R

Representative SPAR models, one PWR and one BWR, were reviewed against Capability Category I of the ASME PRA standard. Capability Category I {{was selected as the}} basis for review due to the specific uses/applications of the SPAR models. The BWR SPAR model was reviewed against 331 ASME PRA Standard Supporting Requirements; however, based on the Capability Category I level of review and the absence of internal <b>flooding</b> and <b>containment</b> performance (LERF) logic only 216 requirements were determined to be applicable. Based on the review, the BWR SPAR model met 139 of the 216 supporting requirements. The review also generated 200 findings or suggestions. Of these 200 findings and suggestions 142 were findings and 58 were suggestions. The PWR SPAR model was also evaluated against the same 331 ASME PRA Standard Supporting Requirements. Of these requirements only 215 were deemed appropriate for the review (for the same reason as noted for the BWR). The PWR review determined that 125 of the 215 supporting requirements met Capability Category I or greater. The review identified 101 findings or suggestions (76 findings and 25 suggestions). These findings or suggestions were developed to identify areas where SPAR models could be enhanced. A process to prioritize and incorporate the findings/suggestions supporting requirements into the SPAR models is being developed. The prioritization process focuses on those findings that will enhance the accuracy, completeness and usability of the SPAR models...|$|R

40|$|Following a loss-of-coolant {{accident}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) plant, the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) will supply water to the reactor vessel to reflood, and thereby cool the reactor core. The core flooding rate is governed by the capability of the ECCS water to displace the steam generated in the reactor vessel during the core reflooding period. For PWR plants, {{there is a direct}} depend-ence of core <b>flooding</b> rate on <b>containment</b> pressure; i. e., the core flooding rate will increase with increasing containment pressure. Therefore, as part of the overall evaluation of ECCS performance, the CSB reviews analyses of the minimum containment pressure that could exist during the period of time until the core is reflooded following a loss-of-coolant accident to confirm the validity of the containment pressure used in ECCS performance capability studies. The CSB reviews the assumptions made regarding the operation of engineered safety feature heat removal systems; the effectiveness of Structural heat sinks within the containment to remove energy from the containment atmosphere, and other heat removal processes, such as steam in the containment mixing with ECCS water spilling from the break in the reactor coolant system; {{and in the case of}} ice condenser containments, mixing with water from melted ice that drains into the lower containment volume. The review is done for all PWR containment types, i. e., dry, subatmospheric, and ice condenser containments. The CSB will coordinate the review with the Reactor Systems Branch (RSB), which is responsible for determining the acceptability of the mass and energy release data used in the minimum containment pressure analysis (see SRP Section 6. 3).
