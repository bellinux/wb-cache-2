30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{assessments}} of the impacts of climate change on water resources depend on the PET methods applied (Arnell 1999; Bae et al. 2011; Kay and <b>Davies</b> <b>2008).</b> The assessment of evaporative demand trends depends on factors such as wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and air temperature. Precise analysis of atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) requires average air temperature (Milly and Dunne 2011), amount of solar radiation (Wild 2009), vapor pressure (Willett et al. 2008) and changes in wind speed (McVicar et al. 2012).

Explicit use of deductive silogism method (<b>Davies,</b> <b>2008)</b> for composing grammatically and inferentially good essays as well as the CAAM method for making argumentative maps, were used in this intervention. Both method showed to be effective to teach students how to compose sound argumentative essays. Mapping arguments helps students to visualize their reasoning line and to detect easier, among other things, co-premisas or co-reasons (broader explanations and explicit inferences) and evidence (support reasons for other reasons) needed in their argumentation...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{resurgence}} of interest in clinical supervision in health and human services. A range of new opportunities for supervision education has developed in response to this trend. This poster presentation identifies critical issues for consideration in teaching and learning about supervision practice within a multi-disciplinary learning programme. It is important to maintain strong awareness of the ethical, cultural and social dimensions of supervisory contexts. This poster presentation draws on a completed qualitative research project, Beddoe & <b>Davys</b> (<b>2008)</b> and <b>Davys</b> and Beddoe (<b>2008),</b> and suggests a case for interprofessional learning (IPL) for supervision education. It was found that the interprofessional learning environment deepened the exploration and level of understanding about supervision and encouraged participants to question taken-for-granted professional assumptions. The identification of difference between participants, rather than impeding learning, was seen to enhance the breadth of learning and participants were challenged to clarify ideas and language. Learning together, working with stories from practice, deepens and strengthens supervision practice, which in turn may enhance teamwork in health and social care by both confirmation of similarities and understanding of difference...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{human rights}} {{education}} (HRE) has been increasingly {{employed as a}} core component of peace education programming in societies enduring or recovering from conflict.

Bar-Tal & Rosen, 2009; Hicks, 1997) and even explicitly to curb extremism (<b>Davies,</b> <b>2008).</b> Yet an {{aim of this study}} is to problematize this increasingly prevalent use of HRE, arguing that such ‘coexistence ’ (Bajaj, 2011) programmes are often too narrow in their understanding of the drivers of conflict – focused largely on addressing interpersonal animosity with insufficient regard for broader structural inequities. If a HRE programme is built around such a limited understanding of conflict – one that may often be sharply incongruous with participants ’ own lived experience – the programme may alienate, or even antagonize, teachers and learners.

30|$|Considerations {{over whether}} {{pastoralism}} {{is compatible with}} conservation are not new, particularly in East Africa where pastoralists have long coexisted with wildlife (Homewood and Rodgers 1984; Prins 1992; Reid et al. 2009; Butt and Turner 2012; Homewood et al. 2012). Most scholars contend that mobile pastoralism is an efficient and productive means of managing favourable ecological conditions in drylands (<b>Davies</b> <b>2008)</b> and that pastoralism is not necessarily detrimental to wildlife conservation goals, but rather {{an important component of}} rangeland ecology in areas where wildlife reside (Fratkin 1997). Yet productive mobile pastoralism depends on functional livestock mobility, communal land tenure, and flexible governance systems that support pastoral adaptation strategies. In East Africa, decades of land tenure shifts have meant reduced mobility for pastoralists due to land fragmentation caused by privatization, expanding conservation efforts, and increasing climatic variability, meaning that pastoralists’ needs are being compromised (McCabe 2003; Boone 2005; Galvin 2009; Goldman and Riosmena 2013). As Notenbaert et al. (2012) observe, ‘the policy environment in Eastern Africa has tended to be inappropriate for the proper functioning of the positive relationship between pastoralism and biodiversity conservation’ (p. 9).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{recovery}} analysis for a standard compressed sensing algorithm, Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) (Blumensath and <b>Davies,</b> <b>2008),</b> which considers the fixed {{points of the}} algorithm. In the context of arbitrary measurement matrices, we derive a sufficient condition for convergence of IHT to a fixed point and {{a necessary condition for}} the existence of fixed points. These conditions allow us to perform a sparse signal recovery analysis in the deterministic noiseless case by implying that the original sparse signal is the unique fixed point and limit point of IHT, {{and in the case of}} Gaussian measurement matrices and noise by generating a bound on the approximation error of the IHT limit as a multiple of the noise level. By generalizing the notion of fixed points, we extend our analysis to the variable stepsize Normalised IHT (N-IHT) (Blumensath and Davies, 2010). For both stepsize schemes, we obtain asymptotic phase transitions in a proportional-dimensional framework, quantifying the sparsity/undersampling trade-off for which recovery is guaranteed. Exploiting the reasonable average-case assumption that the underlying signal and measurement matrix are independent, comparison with previous results within this framework shows a substantial quantitative improvement...|$|E

30|$|The {{underlying}} {{reasons for}} the differences in development between the transitional programmes are likely diverse in nature. The timing of the test, for example, {{was not at the}} end of an intervention but at the end of the entire course. By this time, the competencies acquired by many of the participants could already have begun to diminish. Moreover, developmental-psychological factors could also affect the ability of the participants to perform adequately on the assessments. Other reasons could possibly be traced back to the Rasch-based approach, which assumes that competencies develop homogeneously. Accordingly, to better integrate heterogeneity into the model, the measurement model approach of the general diagnostic model (von <b>Davier</b> <b>2008)</b> could potentially be used. By replacing the continuous variable with discrete linear combinations in this approach, multiple latent competency group-specific developments could be modelled (von Davier et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Regression-based {{data mining}} techniques, such as {{stepwise}} regression, {{are often used}} by econometricians in situations where specifying a single hypothesis is not desirable, often {{because the number of}} possible explanatory variables is too large or because not enough is known about the subject to construct a theory driven hypothesis. While such methods can be extremely helpful, they are highly susceptible to generating spurious results. <b>Davies</b> (<b>2008)</b> proposes a data mining technique called Estimated Exhaustive Regression (EER) which, he shows, can effectively differentiate between deterministic and spurious factors within data sets where varying degrees of multicollinearity are present. A critical step of EER is the calculation of the cross-model chi-square test statistic; however, it can be reasonably argued that this test statistic is not actually from a chi-square distribution. The purpose of this research is to (1) redefine the cross-model test statistic, (2) use simulation to show that the redefined test statistic is standard normally distributed, and (3) show that EER is less susceptible to generating spurious results than stepwise regression. The results of the analysis show that EER {{has the potential to be}} a very useful too...|$|E
40|$|Although {{anti-discrimination}} {{laws have}} supported much social change, {{they have been}} subjected to sustained critique by legal scholars. A significant concern is that the formal ‘same treatment ’ standard promoted by the design of anti-discrimination law is inherently problematic (Graycar & Morgan, 2004) because it gives “apparent legitimacy to outcomes which … in effect embed inequality” (Kerruish & Purdy, 1998, p. 150). In this article, I critique the laws ’ standard of formal equality, first to demonstrate the capacity of its ‘neutral ’ response to reproduce and stabilise dominant privilege. Next, using the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 (NSW) as an example, I argue that the Act’s ‘race-neutral ’ and ‘colour-blind ’ practice of formal equality holds capacity to stabilise and reproduce whiteness. I then argue that substantive equality—advocated by most legal critics as promoting ‘better ’ forms of equality—also holds the capacity to reiterate whiteness as it can be defined through terms and conditions ‘designed for and skewed ’ in favour of ‘the white majority ’ (<b>Davies,</b> <b>2008,</b> p. 317). I conclude that this holds great implications for legal scholarship that remains selectively ‘colour-blind ’ to the significance of racial ‘difference’, and call on mainstream legal scholars to open spaces to interrogate the implications of our raced position as whites (Moreton-Robinson, 2007, p. 85) ...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly, higher {{education}} is being regarded as a service industry and universities are beginning {{to focus more on}} meeting or even exceeding the needs of their students (Davis & Swanson, 2001; DeShields, Kara, & Kaynak, 2005). As a consequence, the evaluation of students ’ satisfaction becomes all the more important to institutions that want to retain current and recruit new students (Helgesen & Nesset, 2007). Research indicates that the recruitment of students is several times more expensive than their retention (Joseph, Yakhou, & Stone, 2005) and so student retention becomes an important management task for universities, which gives rise to increasing emphasis on student satisfaction with the learn-ing experience (Lala & Priluck, 2011). In this regard, Aram-bewela, Hall, and Zuhair (2006) regard student satisfaction as a key strategic variable in maintaining a competitive posi-tion, with long-term benefits arising from student loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and image of the {{higher education}} institution. Consequently, increasing levels of student satis-faction and decreasing sources of dissatisfaction would be beneficial to universities (Douglas, McClelland, & <b>Davies,</b> <b>2008).</b> Finally, Appleton-Knapp and Krentler (2006) suggest that students ’ satisfaction with their educational experiences should be a desired outcome in addition to learning and knowing. Although higher education institutions are beginning to see themselves as part of the service industry, there is a debate on whether students are customers (Desai, Damewood...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} the development of four parallel versions of an English and French vocabulary size test, specifically designed for Dutch-speaking learners in Belgium. Our purpose is to take into account limitations of previous vocabulary size tests. Therefore, we aim to develop meaning-recognition tests which (i) rely on up-to-date frequency list extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA, <b>Davies</b> <b>2008</b> -) and the Frequency Dictionary of French (Lonsdale & Le Bras 2009), (ii) take into account a more adequate representative noun-verb-adjective ratio per frequency band, (iii) pinpoint the vocabulary level of (upper-) intermediate learners in an accurate way by addressing the sampling rate and differentiation within the frequency bands, and (iv) are tailored to the Flemish context by taking into account cognates and loanwords as such test items tend to inflate learners’ vocabulary size (Mizrahi et al., 2014; Schmitt et al. 2013). The analyses demonstrated 1) that the tests are internally consistent; 2) that there is an implicational scale between the frequency bands, and 3) that the four test versions are equivalent. The tests, consisting of 30 items per frequency band, will give a rough estimate of learners’ English and French vocabulary size up to the K 5 level. Unlike the VLT (Schmitt et al., 2001), the tests also differentiate between the K 4 and K 5 frequency bands in addition to the K 2 and K 3 frequency bands. The tests will be used as diagnostic post-entry language tests to determine which students need to do an online vocabulary learning module. status: publishe...|$|E

A great deal of research has explored the range of behaviours used to indicate romantic interest and to promote contact and sexual encounters (deWeerth & Kalma, 1995; Grammer, Honda, Juette, & Schmitt, 1999; Grammer, Kruck, Juette, & Fink, 2000; Greer & Buss, 1994; Jesser, 1978; Moore, 1985, 1995; Moore & Butler, 1989; Muehlenhard, Miller, & Burdick, 1983; Simpson, Gangestad, & Biek, 1993; Walsh & Hewitt, 1985). Research has also investigated the variety of ways that people engage in the ritual of flirting, {{with the use of}} verbal and non-verbal communication (Abrahams, 1994; McCormick & Jones, 1989; Moore, 1995), the motivations underpinning flirtatious communication (Henningsen, Braz & <b>Davies,</b> <b>2008)</b> and the use of flirting strategies (Hall, Carter, Cody & Albright, 2010). Strong links have also been demonstrated with attachment theory (Brumbaugh & Fraley, 2006; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007) and love styles (Hazen & Shaver, 1987; Levy & Davis, 1988). The current study was designed to further investigate individual differences in the communication of romantic intent. We were specifically interested in the relationships between flirting styles, attachment dimensions and love styles. The aim of the current study with a sample of 718 adults was to examine the influence of adult attachment styles (anxious and avoidant), love styles (eros, ludus, storge, pragma, mania and agape), and relationship characteristics (intimacy, passion, commitment) on the flirting strategy (traditional, sincere, polite, physical and playful) used to signal romantic intent. Results indicated individual differences in the use of flirting strategies which varied predictably as a result of attachment style, love style and relationship characteristics. Theoretical implications as well as future directions for research are outlined in relation to the findings...|$|E
