5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and <b>external</b> <b>assessments,</b> and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

On average, over 80% of its students achieve in the top 20% of the state, with a majority gaining an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank of more than 90.|$|E
500|$|All {{subjects}} (with {{the exception}} of CAS) are evaluated using {{both internal and external}} assessors. The externally assessed examinations are given worldwide in May (usually for Northern Hemisphere schools) and in November (usually for Southern Hemisphere schools). Each exam usually consists of two or three papers, generally written on the same or successive weekdays. The different papers may have different forms of questions, or they may focus on different areas of the subject syllabus. For example, in Chemistry SL, paper 1 has multiple choice questions, paper 2 has extended response questions. [...] Paper 3 focuses on the [...] "Option(s)" [...] selected by the teacher and data analysis questions. The grading of all <b>external</b> <b>assessments</b> is done by independent examiners appointed by the IB.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the early}} years of the 2000s (decade), efforts have been {{conducted}} in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the world. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between <b>external</b> <b>assessments,</b> peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of <b>external</b> <b>assessments</b> are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the African Peer Review Mechanism. Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present {{research}} was to examine some factors of teachers’ support to student autonomy in basic and secondary school: job characteristics, teachers’ involvement in preparing students for <b>external</b> <b>assessment</b> of knowledge, and school achievements in <b>external</b> <b>assessment.</b> Additionally, we examined teachers’ gender and educational level as factors of support to student autonomy. In the study 260 teachers (78. 8 % females) participated, among them 144 (55. 4 %) teachers in basic school and 116 (44. 6 %) teachers in secondary school. The results show that there is no relation between perceived autonomy at work and support to student autonomy.. Teachers that prepare their pupils for <b>external</b> <b>assessment</b> score lower on autonomy support. We found no differences in autonomy support with regard to school achievements in external evaluation. Female teachers exhibit a higher level of autonomy suppor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>External</b> <b>assessment</b> is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as a}} neutral activity detached from teaching and learning. Consequently the learning-inducing effect {{of this type of}} assessment receives little attention when the tests are developed. This article reports the findings of a study of the importance attached to an <b>external</b> <b>assessment</b> by 40 teachers and 120 students in their teaching and learning activities respectively. Questionnaires and interviews were used to gather data on the perceived influence of the assessment and the real life experiences of its role in the interaction between the teachers and their students in the classroom. Statistical analyses show that the students have a significantly higher opinion of the learning-inducing effect of the <b>external</b> <b>assessment</b> than the teachers and there are differences {{in the structure of the}} factors that underlie their opinions. Analysis of the interviews confirms that both the teachers and students attach a great deal of importance to the assessment as it influences teaching and learning activities in the classroom. It was concluded that both the teachers and the students attach a great deal of importance to the <b>external</b> <b>assessment,</b> suggesting that more attention needs to be paid to its hidden effect on education when tests are developed for such assessments...|$|R

40|$|Micro-task {{platforms}} provide massively parallel, ondemand labor. However, it can {{be difficult}} to reliably achieve high-quality work because online workers may behave irresponsibly, misunderstand the task, or lack necessary skills. This paper investigates whether timely, taskspecific feedback helps crowd workers learn, persevere, and produce better results. We investigate this question through Shepherd, a feedback system for crowdsourced work. In a between-subjects study with three conditions, crowd workers wrote consumer reviews for six products they own. Participants in the None condition received no immediate feedback, consistent with most current crowdsourcing practices. Participants in the Self-assessment condition judged their own work. Participants in the <b>External</b> <b>assessment</b> condition received expert feedback. Self-assessment alone yielded better overall work than the None condition and helped workers improve over time. <b>External</b> <b>assessment</b> also yielded these benefits. Participants who received <b>external</b> <b>assessment</b> also revised their work more. We conclude by discussing interaction and infrastructure approaches for integrating real-time assessment into online work...|$|R
