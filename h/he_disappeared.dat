5|$|By {{the time}} of the album's release in late August 1994, Edwards was hospitalised at the private Priory Hospital in Roehampton. He rejoined the band to tour during the autumn of 1994. Other band members felt that his {{drinking}} was under control at this point, but his eating continued to be a problem and he continued to self-harm. On 1 February 1995, <b>he</b> <b>disappeared</b> and is presumed to have committed suicide. His car was found close to the Severn Bridge.|$|E
5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before <b>he</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it was near the place he had last seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>disappeared</b> {{from the}} records until found as Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is {{possible}} that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E

Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night <b>he</b> <b>disappeared,</b> Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking the entrance to the secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck.|$|E
5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, <b>he</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt {{on the other side}} of the fence. On another occasion, a migraine headache kept him home from school, but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E
5|$|Black {{began the}} 1946 Cleveland Indians {{season as a}} member of the roster, looking to get playing time in an {{established}} starting rotation. His season began inauspiciously when he was hit on the chin with a ball, causing him to miss a week during spring training. The 1946 season marked the first time that Black did not finish on the major league roster. After pitching in 18 games for the Indians, he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. While with the Brewers, Black failed to win any games, and at one point was suspended after <b>he</b> <b>disappeared</b> during a road trip. At the conclusion of the season, Indians owner Bill Veeck had a talk with Black, who admitted he had a problem with drunkenness. He agreed to spend the winter with Alcoholics Anonymous with Veek's help, and by the time the 1947 Cleveland Indians season began, Black was sober.|$|E

5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; <b>he</b> <b>disappeared</b> on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before <b>he</b> <b>disappeared,</b> as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{moved to}} Thika, where he gained {{employment}} with the engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages {{from a bank}} in Nairobi, 25 miles away. Kenyatta had to leave his job when he again became seriously ill. He stayed {{at the home of}} his friend Charles Kasaja, located at the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission, in order to recuperate. At the time, the British Empire was involved in World War I, and it had recruited many Kikuyu to serve in the British Army. One of those who joined was Kongo, but <b>he</b> <b>disappeared</b> during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like many Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British war effort. Kenyatta had an aunt who had married a Maasai chief and began living with her family. He adopted a number of Maasai customs, and took to wearing the Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt which was known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an {{apartment}} building to discuss {{the circumstances surrounding the}} gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport. They suspect Ramesh is involved since <b>he</b> <b>disappeared</b> right after the incident. They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold. An unsuspecting Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious. Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants. He collects the unconscious Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by strangers. She also discovers that Raju is not just a taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold. Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling, and has since become the target of the criminals. Jayanthi returns to Rekha's home for safety, and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who, in a turn of events, has raised suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard {{suspected}} Martin {{of having}} separately killed two men from south London: financial adviser Timothy MacDowall and accountant William Shackel. In Mexico, Martin had discussed {{with his wife}} about going scuba diving with MacDowall, who was taking scuba lessons while on holiday on an island off Belize. MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 but police could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name. MacDowall {{is believed to have}} been murdered as he slept and his remains thrown into a crocodile-infested river. Martin refused to be interviewed by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which <b>he</b> <b>disappeared.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. <b>He</b> <b>disappeared</b> into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
