25|$|All plywoods bind resin {{and wood}} fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) {{to form a}} {{composite}} material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it perpendicular to the <b>grain</b> <b>direction</b> of the surface ply.|$|E

But as θ approaches 90°, the curvature transforms into a saddle shape. Understanding this, then, the team could carefully control {{the effects of}} anisotropy and break lines of symmetry to create helicoids, ruffled profiles, and more.David Correa et al. is working with wood composite materials that change shape based on their printed <b>grain</b> <b>direction</b> and anisotropic swelling when water is absorbed. This work is 3D printed and studied on the macro scale rather than micro scale, with layer heights at fractions of millimeters rather than microns. The filament used in this research is a wood composite which is 60% co-polyester and 40% cellulose. The co-polyester binds the cellulose together while the cellulose provides the hygroscopic properties to the composite. Two methods {{have been developed for}} this kind of printing. The first method uses only the wood composite material. Designed deformation shape is printed by controlling the grain pattern, grain orientation, print layer thickness, and print layer interaction. In this method, hygroscopic bending occurs perpendicular to the <b>grain</b> <b>direction.</b> The second method uses both the wood composite as well as standard 3D printing plastics. This is an extension of the first method that introduces a separate layer of non-hygroscopic material that will not swell when exposed to water. This idea builds off of previous research of thermal bimetal  properties based on their relative expansion. Hygroscopic bending occurs only within the wood composite layers when prints of this method are exposed to water. Therefore, deformation shape is a product of both the patterning of material layers as well as the grain of the wood composite layers, offering quicker and more severe deformation than wood composite construction alone. Both methods allow their materials to deform when subject to moisture, as well as regain their shape. The quickest method observed for shape change is by fully submerging prints in warm water.|$|E

On the other hand, when the biaxial stress ratio is positive, above-mentioned feature does not occur. Therefore, the first principal stress can be measured based on the grain growth density. The number of grains necessary to measure the biaxial stress is estimated by a statistical approach.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the static behavior of different type of butt joints for application in a timber sofa furniture frame. In timber sofa structure, butt joints are commonly used between plywood and hardwood members but they are normally designed without any regard to the effect of <b>grain</b> <b>directions</b> of the wood members on the joint strength. The focus of the paper is to look at the effect of <b>grain</b> <b>directions</b> on the wooden member properties and on the strength of the butt joint in order to understand the failure mode to establish a more durable and effective sofa butt joint than the one normally used by the manufacturers. Design/methodology/approach - Experiment tests are conducted to determine the mechanical properties of joint members, the maximum load-carrying capacity of the butt joints, and the types of the failure in the joints in relation to different grain orientations under transverse loading conditions. Plywood and hardwood members are used in construction of the joint tests. Four types of butt joints are constructed with different condition of grain orientation, glue, and screw used in the joint members. The specimens are tested by fixing the plywood member and applying a transverse load to the hardwood member to simulate the conditions in the sofa frame. Findings - Result shows that butt joint with vertical grain orientation and joint with two screws and glue have the maximum load-carrying capacity compared to the other three cases and compared to the current joint type used in the existing sofa frame design. Originality/value - The paper is of value to furniture manufacturing industry, in which furniture members and joints are usually over-designed without regard to grain orientations or applying sound engineering techniques...|$|R
5000|$|Flame maple (tiger maple), {{also known}} as flamed maple, curly maple, ripple maple, fiddleback or tiger stripe, is a feature of maple in which {{the growth of the}} wood fibers is {{distorted}} in an undulating chatoyant pattern, producing wavy lines known as [...] "flames".

5000|$|Plywood is a sheet {{material}} manufactured from thin layers or [...] "plies" [...] of wood veneer that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another. It is an engineered wood {{from the family}} of manufactured boards which includes medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and particle board (chipboard). All plywoods bind resin and wood fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) to form a composite material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it perpendicular to the <b>grain</b> <b>direction</b> of the surface ply. Smaller thinner plywoods and lower quality plywoods (see Average-quality plywood photo below and right) may only have their plies (layers) arranged at right angles to each other, though some better quality plywood products will by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.|$|E
