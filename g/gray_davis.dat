In 1999, Governor <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E

50|$|Under the California Constitution, the Governor {{serves a}} {{four-year}} term, {{with a maximum}} limit of two consecutive terms. Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected during the 2003 California recall and served out the remainder of <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis's</b> term; he was eligible to serve until 2011.

25|$|The ballot {{consisted}} of two questions; voters could vote on one or the other, or on both. The first question asked whether <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> should be recalled. It was a simple yes/no question, and if a majority voted no, then the second question would become irrelevant and <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> would remain California governor. If a majority voted yes, then Davis would {{be removed from office}} once the vote was certified, and the second question would determine his successor. Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list of 135 candidates. Voters who voted against recalling <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> could still vote for a candidate to replace him in case the recall vote succeeded. The candidate receiving the most votes (a plurality) would then become the next governor of California. Certification by the Secretary of State of California would require completion within 39 days of the election, and history indicated that it could require that entire time frame to certify the statewide election results. Once the results were certified, a newly elected governor would have to be sworn into office within 10 days.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps the {{heaviest}} point of controversy {{is the question}} of blame for the California electricity crisis.

40|$|Political strategists decide daily how {{to market}} their candidates. Growing {{recognition}} {{of the importance of}} implicit processes (processes occurring outside of awareness) suggests limitations to focus groups and polling, which rely on conscious self-report. Two experi-ments, inspired by national political campaigns, employed Internet-presented subliminal primes to study evaluations of politicians. In Experiment 1, the subliminal word “RATS” increased negative ratings of an unknown politician. In Experiment 2, conducted during former California Governor <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis’s</b> recall referendum, a subliminal photo of Clinton affected ratings of Davis, primarily among Independents. Results showed that subliminal stimuli can affect ratings of well-known as well as unknown politicians. Further, subliminal studies can be conducted in a mass media outlet (the Internet) in real time and supplement voter self-report, supporting the potential utility of implicit measures for campaign decision making...|$|R
25|$|Before the {{successful}} recall of <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis,</b> no California statewide official {{had ever been}} recalled, though there had been 117 previous attempts. Only seven of those even made it onto the ballot, all for state legislators. Every governor since Ronald Reagan in 1968 has been subject to a recall effort, but <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> was the first governor whose opponents gathered the necessary signatures {{to qualify for a}} special election. Davis also faced a recall petition in 1999, but that effort failed to gain enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The 1999 recall effort was prompted by several actions taken by Davis, including his preventing the enactment of Proposition 187 by keeping it from being appealed to the US Supreme Court and his signing of two new highly restrictive gun-control laws. As Davis's recall transpired before he had served half of his term as governor, he remains eligible to serve another term, should he win a future election for the California governor post.|$|E

25|$|The {{effort to}} recall <b>Gray</b> <b>Davis</b> began with Republicans Ted Costa, Mark Abernathy, and Howard Kaloogian, who filed their {{petition}} with the California Secretary of State and started gathering signatures.
