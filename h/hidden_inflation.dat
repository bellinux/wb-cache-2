50|$|By {{the time}} Gorbachev {{ushered in the}} process {{that would lead to}} the {{dismantling}} of the Soviet administrative planned economy through his programs of glasnost (political openness), uskoreniye (speed-up of economic development) and perestroika (political and economic restructuring) announced in 1986, the Soviet economy suffered from both <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> and pervasive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open black market that undermined the official economy. Additionally, the costs of superpower status—the military, space program, subsidies to client states—were out of proportion to the Soviet economy. The new wave of industrialization based upon information technology had left the Soviet Union desperate for Western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing backwardness.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> in Soviet industrial growth statistics between 1928 and 1950 is described. <b>Hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> arose when new products were substituted for old ones. Substitution biases in Soviet and Western growth estimates are compared: {{the extent of}} <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> in the Soviet figures is estimated. The view that all Soviet growth series were exaggerated is qualified; the presumption that the lower a figure, the more reliable it must be is overturned.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the moderating role of {{perceived}} <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> on the relationships between service quality, brand trust and brand loyalty. All data collected from the target population are analyzed through two-step structural equation modeling (SEM) and moderated multiple regression (MMR) to examine the hypotheses. 1, 050 questionnaires are randomly distributed at 21 telecommunication service stores in Taiwan. Findings indicated that service quality has no direct impact on behavioral loyalty but it has a significant indirect impact on behavioral loyalty through brand trust or attitudinal loyalty. Moreover, findings identify perceived <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> as the moderating role in the service quality–brand trust–brand loyalty chain. Besides the need for empirical confirmation of the hypotheses given, finally, there are several practical implications for service marketers and future research directions for scholars...|$|E
40|$|There are <b>hidden</b> observables for <b>inflation,</b> such as {{features}} localized {{in position}} space, {{which do not}} manifest themselves when only one inflation trajectory is considered. To address this issue, we investigate inflation dynamics in a landscape mimicked by a random potential. We calculate the probability for bifurcation of the inflation trajectory in multi-stream inflation. Depending on {{the shape of the}} random bumps and the distance between bumps in the potential, there is a phase transition: {{on one side of the}} critical curve in parameter space isocurvature fluctuation are exponentially amplified and bifurcation becomes very probable. On the other side bifurcation is dominated by a random walk where bifurcations are less likely to happen. Comment: Reference added to match published version in JCA...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{inflation}} will be investigated {{as well as}} supersymmetry breaking {{in the context of}} supergravity, incorporating the target-space duality and the non-perturbative gaugino condensation in the <b>hidden</b> sector. The <b>inflation</b> and supersymmetry breaking occur at once by the interplay between the dilaton field as inflaton and the condensate gauge-singlet field. The model satisfies the slow-roll condition which solves the eta-problem. When the particle rolls down along the minimized trajectry of the potential V(S,Y) at a duality invariant fixed point T= 1, we can obtain the e-fold value ∼ 57. And then the cosmological parameters obtained from our model well match with the recent WMAP data combined with other experiments. This observation is suggesting to consider the string-inspired supergravity as the fundamental of the theory of the evolution of the universe as well as the particle theory.

40|$|This paper reconsiders Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny's {{suggestion}} that a socialist industry will always prefer to cut both price and output {{relative to a}} market [...] clearing equilibrium in order to maximise bribe income. The evidence from recent archival studies of the Soviet economy does not support this conjecture. To understand the evidence we present an analytical framework within which a plan [...] setter and an effort [...] setter interact, subject to a hard resource constraint, to determine real output and <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> simultaneously. We find that managers who use resources gained corruptly were enabled to produce more real output with less <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> and fulfil the plan more honestly as a result. We find clear rationales for plan [...] setters to have tolerated corruption and siphoning while maintaining plan tension, and we associate reduced plan tension in the 1970 s with the spread of disloyal behaviours.

Our results explain rapid Soviet economic growth despite high corruption levels, and why slower economic growth in the 1970 s was accompanied by increased privatization of rents. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors assess {{inflation}} in Czechoslovakia between 1985 and 1991 {{and identify the}} main causes of inflation through a literature survey and empirical studies. The official prices in centrally planned economies were never perceived by central planners to be fully market clearing. Only by coincidence would the overall price level correspond to the level associated with general equilibrium. What is missing in official price indices in centrally planned economies - including {{the consumer price index}} - is suppressed inflation, manifast in queuing for products, forced substitution of demand, and forced savings. Also missing is <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation,</b> associated with practices that disguise price increases behind cosmetic or other change in product quality. The authors argue that inflationary pressures in Czechoslovakia in 1985 - 89 originated mainly in the investment sector. Even though the investment sector was strictly controlled, making it difficult for open inflation to emerge, the scope for inflationary pressures was great in Czechoslovakia. Such pressures arose from a mixture of factors, including poor investment planning, accommodating government finance, and the high priority given to investments and social consumption. For Czechoslovakia, the official price indices show virtually no inflation between 1985 and 1989, when there were long waiting lists for such products as cars and state and cooperative flats. Trends in these price indices do not seem to depend on the method used for constructing them, according to the sensitivity tests conducted by Czechoslovakia's Federal Statistical Office. Obviously, the official price indices failed to capture the full extent of economic disequilibrium in that period. But the extent to which official price indices understated inflationary pressures was not serious in Czechoslovakia, compared with other centrally planned economies. Estimates of <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> for 1985 - 89 range from 0. 5 percent to 2 percent a year in consumer markets and about 3 percent in the industrial sector. Estimates for suppressed inflation were less than 5 percent. The relatively small inflationary gap is indirectly confirmed by the sharp inflation associated with the recent price liberalization that subsided in a relatively short period, and both suppressed and hidden inflations have virtually disappeared. Estimates of <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> were based on benchmark price comparisons between Czechoslovakia and such market economies as Austria. Those for suppressed inflation were based on disequilibrium econometric models of asset holdings and on conjecture tests.

40|$|Recently it {{was shown}} that {{explosive}} growth of the field fluctuations during preheating {{must be accompanied by}} resonant amplification of scalar metric fluctuations, since the two are united by Einstein's equations. This ``metric preheating" pumps the field fluctuations, increasing particle production, and leading to gravitational rescattering effects even at linear order. In multi-field models with strong preheating, metric perturbations become nonlinear, with the strongest amplification on superhorizon scales. This amplification is causal and due to the superhorizon coherence of the inflaton condensate. It leads to resonant growth of entropy perturbations and invalidates use of the linearized Einstein field equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial conditions. This has serious implications for cosmic micrwowave background (CMB) anisotropies and primordial black hole formation. We investigate the (q,k) parameter space in a simple two-field model, and introduce the time to nonlinearity, i. e., the timescale for the breakdown of the validity of the linearized Einstein equations. Mode-mode coupling and turbulence tend to re-establish scale-invariance but these are limited by causality. We discuss ways to escape the above conclusions, including preheating solely to fermions. The exclusion principle damps the amplification of metric perturbations significantly. Finally we rank known classes of inflation from strongest (chaotic and strongly coupled hybrid <b>inflation)</b> to weakest (<b>hidden</b> sector, warm <b>inflation)</b> affected by the resonances...|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has become}} clear that the {{resonant}} amplification of quantum field fluctuations at preheating must be accompanied by resonant amplification of scalar metric perturbations, since the two are united by Einstein's equations. Furthermore, this "metric preheating" enhances particle production and leads to gravitational rescattering effects even at linear order. In multi-field models with strong preheating (q ≫ 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear, with the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k → 0). This amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the inflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy perturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein field equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial conditions. This has serious implications at all scales - from the large-angle cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies to primordial black holes. We investigate the (q,k) parameter space in a two-field model, and introduce the time to nonlinearity, t_nl, as the timescale for the breakdown of the linearized Einstein equations. Backreaction effects are expected to shut down the linear resonances, but cannot remove the existing amplification, which threatens the viability of strong preheating when confronted with the CMB. We discuss ways to escape the above conclusions, including secondary phases of inflation and preheating solely to fermions. Finally we rank known classes of inflation from strongest (chaotic and strongly coupled hybrid <b>inflation)</b> to weakest (<b>hidden</b> sector, warm <b>inflation)</b> in terms of the distortion of the primordial spectrum due to these resonances in preheating.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} macroeconomic and microeconomic policy tools on enterprise activities within an economy {{in the process of}} economic reform. Assuming a dual exchange rate regime and the type of increased enterprise autonomy introduced as components of partial economic reform as in the Soviet Union, policy changes induce shifts in production and hard currency allocation decisions. This paper {{considers the}} implications for: the supply of hard currency to internal auctions or interbank markets; the free internal price of foreign exchange; export volumes; the trade balance; the supply of goods available for internal consumption; and open and <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation.</b> The concentration of market power of producers in domestic industries and the design of currency auctions or interbank markets are key determinants, respectively, of the magnitude and direction of the enterprise responses to policy changes and external shocks. ...|$|E

40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. In Soviet-type economies inflationary pressures, often reduced but not eliminated by central planning, {{take the form}} not only of open officially recorded inflation but also of <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> (i. e. a differential between official price indices and the actual cost of living to consumers) and of repressed inflation (i. e. rising excess demand {{for goods and services}} at the actual prices in the state and non-state sectors). This paper reviews inflationary trends, the persistence of inflationary pressure under central planning and definitional problems for alternative types of inflation. Estimates of <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> in recent literature are reviewed and generally found to understate the price differential in the controlled and uncontrolled markets. The wide divergence between recent estimates of repressed inflation, ranging between near-equilibrium and catastrophic imbalance, is then discussed. By and large excess money holdings in {{the economy as a whole}} (i. e. with reference to the two-tier market for consumption goods) are found to be small, but this is seen as consistent with large-scale imbalance in the state sector. A model is presented illustrating the complexity and time profile of repressed inflation definitions and measurements, due to the difference between the price level which would preserve equilibrium if it had been prevailing for a sufficiently long period, and the price levels (depending on the speed of adjustment) and their time paths which can restore market clearing at single prices starting from a two-tier market in a state of imbalance. Alternative stabilisation paths and their combination are also investigated, using as policy instruments the price level, a liquid wealth tax (or currency conversion) and supply improvements. The costs of hidden and repressed inflation are discussed and found to be greater than the cost of open inflation. In sum, the task of stabilisation in Soviet-type economies is seen as large-scale, time-consuming and complex, and its implementation imperative...|$|E

The results from decomposition suggest that the prime cause of slow economic growth was extremely low or even negative total factor productivity.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{investigating the}} relationship between stock market returns and inflation is long and has produced diverse findings. This thesis examines the nature of stock–inflation relations in Sub-Saharan countries whose stock markets were established before 1992. Evidence in this thesis shows that {{in the short term}} there is a positive relationship between stocks and inflation. Using the Johansen (1988) evidence, a long-run stock–inflation relationship is confirmed only in Nigeria and South Africa, where it is found to be negative. However, accounting for structural breaks provides evidence for a long-run relationship in Botswana, Ghana and Kenya. The evidence of the effects of regimes in the relationship is further supported by a nonparametric cointegration analysis which finds a long-run relation in countries where the Johansen (1988) method had failed. Unexpected inflation is also found to be related to stock returns in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Mauritius, which raises concerns about the use of month-end stock data in analysing this relationship. The thesis confirms the existence of <b>hidden</b> <b>inflation</b> in Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. Imported inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate are found to have useful information about inflation movements in Sub-Saharan Africa.
