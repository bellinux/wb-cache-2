40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "A genuine U. S. passport is a vital document, permitting its owner to travel freely {{in and out of}} the United States, prove U. S. citizenship, obtain further identification documents, and set up bank accounts, among other things. Unfortunately, a terrorist or other criminal could take advantage of these benefits by <b>fraudulently</b> <b>obtaining</b> a <b>genuine</b> U. S. passport from the Department of State (State). There are many ways that malicious individuals could <b>fraudulently</b> <b>obtain</b> a <b>genuine</b> U. S. passport, including stealing an American citizen's identity and counterfeiting or <b>fraudulently</b> <b>obtaining</b> identification or citizenship documents to meet State requirements. GAO was asked to proactively test the effectiveness of State's passport issuance process to determine whether the process is vulnerable to fraud. To do so, GAO designed four test scenarios that simulated the actions of a malicious individual who had access to an American citizen's personal identity information. GAO created counterfeit documents for four fictitious or deceased individuals using off-the-shelf, commercially available hardware, software, and materials. An undercover GAO investigator then applied for passports at three United States Postal Service (USPS) locations and a State-run passport office. ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{confusion}} {{that followed the}} war {{she was able to}} avoid repatriation and <b>obtain</b> <b>genuine</b> identity <b>documents</b> and settled down to live a more or less normal life. When challenged by Lesley that she looks good for a woman of ninety Vavara explains that one day in 1966 she stopped growing old but that she didn't realise she was getting younger for a while, but claims her recollections of that period were hazy, cautioning Lesley 'never do magic on acid'. Admitting only to doing 'odd jobs' in the magical community she derides the suggestion that she is in trouble, observing for a woman who survived the attention of the SS and concentration camp conditions the worst the British prison system has to offer holds no terrors, and that the effort to keep a magical practitioner incarcerated simply isn’t worth the effort, concluding with a gnomic comment If you're afraid of wolves, don't go into the woods.|$|R
30|$|The use of {{fraudulent}} passports {{for identity}} verification represents a significant {{threat to national}} security. Modern passports contain counterfeit prevention measures (e.g., printed patterns visible only under specific artificial illumination) which make any attempts to alter or duplicate the document itself unlikely to go unnoticed. As a result, fraudsters are now known to be focusing on <b>obtaining</b> FOG (<b>fraudulently</b> <b>obtained</b> but <b>genuine)</b> passports. FOG passports are real documents which are wrongly issued to fraudulent applicants, and they arise when a confederate, who holds a genuine passport, submits a renewal application with the photo of a similar looking client. If the mismatch between the renewal image and the image held on file goes undetected, a FOG passport is issued {{which can be used}} illegally by the client individual. In a recent advancement in this approach, criminals are seeking to increase their success rate by submitting a morphed passport photo, an image of the confederate and the client which has been digitally blended together and which retains a likeness of both individuals. Border security agencies have only recently detected the use of passport morphs, and research is required to ensure that the relevant agencies and practitioners stay one step ahead of these criminal attacks. Here we use applied psychological science to quantify morph detection rates, to assess the effectiveness of a morph detection training task, and to evaluate the use of individuals who show a high aptitude on a test of unfamiliar face matching as a potential countermeasure.|$|R
30|$|Our {{reliance}} on passport photos for identity verification {{is critical to}} our border security (see Robertson & Burton, 2016). Advances in passport anti-counterfeit measures (e.g., the use of printed patterns visible only under specific artificial illumination) make traditional fraud attacks (e.g., creating a fake passport or the removal and replacement of the photo) unlikely to go undetected (UK HM Passport Office Report, 2013; UK National Fraud Authority Report, 2011). As a consequence, fraudsters are now attempting to <b>obtain</b> FOG (<b>fraudulently</b> <b>obtained</b> but <b>genuine)</b> passports (ITW Security Division White Paper, 2017; Middleton, 2014). FOG passports are real documents which have been mistakenly issued to fraudulent applicants. Such documents can arise {{through a variety of}} methods, as outlined below, but the most direct route occurs when a confederate, who holds a genuine passport, submits a renewal application with the photo of a similar looking fraudster. If the mismatch between the renewal image and the image held on file goes unnoticed, a FOG passport is issued which can be used illegally by the fraudster. This type of fraud exploits a weakness that results from our {{reliance on}} unfamiliar face matching for identity verification (Jenkins, White, Van Montfort, & Burton, 2011; Kemp, Towell, & Pike, 1997; White, Kemp, Jenkins, Matheson, & Burton, 2014). Extensive research has shown that detecting that two similar looking faces are in fact different people (i.e., detecting fraud) is a challenging task and one which is prone to error (see Bruce et al., 1999; Burton, 2013; Davis & Valentine, 2009; Robertson, Middleton, & Burton, 2015; Young & Burton, 2017). This issue is being exacerbated by recent advances in image manipulation software which allow fraudsters to easily create morphed passport photos.|$|R

Differences between the surface features of a <b>genuine</b> security <b>document</b> and those of a counterfeit one were studied.

Only 2 out of 29 counterfeit documents could not be distinguished from the genuine ones by film distortion analysis. The likelihood ratio of this method in the authentication of <b>genuine</b> <b>documents</b> was 14. 5.
