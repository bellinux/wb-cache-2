5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds, a slender fuselage with high <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio,</b> and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was completely}} smooth, {{with a high}} <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> for low drag at supersonic speeds. The design was developed prior {{to the discovery of}} the area rule, and does not display any of the wasp waisting common to aircraft primarily developed after 1952. The fuselage contours were mainly cylindrical, but blended into the intake starting around the wing root, giving it a rounded, rectangular profile through the middle, before reverting to a pure cylinder shape again at the engine nozzle.|$|E

50|$|Theoretical ideal <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios</b> in subsonic {{aircraft}} are typically found at about 6:1, however {{this may be}} compromised by other design considerations such as seating or freight size requirements. Because a higher fineness fuselage can have reduced tail surfaces, this ideal ratio can practically be increased to 8:1.|$|R
25|$|The Avro 730 {{lacked a}} {{conventional}} canopy {{in order to}} maintain the <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio,</b> the cockpit featured only two small windows facing to the side. On the intended initial development models, a raised canopy would have been present for direct vision; however, production aircraft would have made sole use of an electrically operated retractable periscope in order to provide an external view, including during take-off and landing. As originally envisioned, a crew of three would be carried: pilot, navigator and radar operator. All three were to be contained within the same compartment, which was both pressurised and refrigerated for passenger comfort; lightweight ejection seats were to be provisioned for all crew members. Due to features such as the automatic flight controls and stabilisation systems, the pilot was intended to be capable of supervising some of the aircraft's engineering functions as well, such as the control system, cooling and fuel systems.|$|E

Her stern was lengthened by [...] to improve her <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> and her 16 older boilers were removed and then replaced with 11 oil-fired Kampon Boilers and newer geared turbines. In addition, her bridge was completely reconstructed according to Japan's pagoda mast style of forward superstructure, and catapults were added to support three Nakajima E8N or Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance and spotter floatplanes.|$|E

The air intakes, designed by Ben Rich, were of fixed geometry without inlet cones, since the J65-powered aircraft was incapable of Mach2 performance. They {{were similar to those}} of the F-94 Starfire, being mounted slightly away from the fuselage, with an inner splitter plate for the boundary layer bleed air. The combination of these features provided extremely low drag except at high angle of attack, at which point induced drag became very high.|$|E

2500|$|The Bodensee, {{designed}} by Paul Jaray, had an innovative hull shape of relatively low <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio,</b> (ratio of length to diameter). This was arrived at after wind-tunnel tests {{conducted at the}} University of Göttingen had shown that this would significantly reduce drag. [...] The framework consisted of eleven 17-sided main transverse frames with a secondary ring frame in each bay, connected by longitudinal girders [...] with a stiffening keel. [...] The forward-mounted control car was combined with the passenger accommodation and was constructed {{as an integral part}} of the hull structure rather than being suspended beneath it. [...] Passenger accommodation consisted of five compartments seating four people and a VIP cabin for one. An additional six passengers could be carried on wicker chairs in the gangway between the compartments. A galley and toilets were also fitted. It was powered by four [...] Maybach Mb.IVa engines, two in a centrally mounted aft gondola driving a single [...] diameter two-bladed pusher propeller, the other two in a pair of amidships engine cars mounted either side of the hull.

50|$|At {{supersonic}} speeds, the <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> has {{a significant}} effect on nose cone wave drag, particularly at low ratios; but there is very little additional gain for ratios increasing beyond 5:1. As the <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, the wetted area, and thus the skin friction component of drag, is also going to increase. Therefore, the minimum drag <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> is ultimately going to be a trade-off between the decreasing wave drag and increasing friction drag.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of aircraft with higher <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios</b> also {{introduced a new}} form of instability, inertial coupling. As the engines and cockpit moved away from the aircraft's center of mass, the roll inertia of these masses grew to be able to overwhelm the power of the aerodynamic surfaces. A variety of methods are used to combat this effect, including oversized controls and stability augmentation systems.|$|R
40|$|Cnidarian medusae, {{commonly}} known as jellyfish, represent the earliest known animal taxa to achieve locomotion using muscle power. Propulsion by medusae requires the force of bell contraction to generate forward thrust. However, thrust production is limited in medusae by the primitive structure of their epitheliomuscular cells. This paper demonstrates that constraints in available locomotor muscular force result in a trade-off between high-thrust swimming via jet propulsion and high-efficiency swimming via a combined jet-paddling propulsion. This trade-off {{is reflected in the}} morphological diversity of medusae, which exhibit a range of <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios</b> (i. e. the ratio between bell height and diameter) and small body size in the high-thrust regime, and low <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios</b> and large body size in the high-efficiency regime. A quantitative model of the animal–fluid interactions that dictate this trade-off is developed and validated by comparison with morphological data collected from 660 extant medusan species ranging in size from 300 µm to over 2 m. These results demonstrate a biomechanical basis linking fluid dynamics and the evolution of medusan bell morphology. We believe these to be the organising principles for muscle-driven motility in Cnidaria. ...|$|R
5000|$|More technically, {{the best}} {{possible}} performance for a supersonic design is typified by two [...] "perfect shapes", the Sears-Haack body which is pointed at both ends, or the von Kármán ogive, which has a blunt tail. Examples of the latter design include the Concorde, F-104 Starfighter and XB-70 Valkyrie, although to some degree practically every post-World War II interceptor aircraft featured such a design. Missile designers are even less interested in low-speed performance, and missiles generally have higher <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios</b> than most aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The {{ratio of}} the length of a nose cone {{compared}} to its base diameter is known as the <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio.</b> This is sometimes also called the aspect ratio, though that term is usually applied to wings and fins. <b>Fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> is often applied to the entire vehicle, considering the overall length and diameter.

The results at subsonic speeds indicate similar improvements for the methods investigated over the low order source method. At supersonic speeds, stable and accurate results were obtained with the surface panel methods.

50|$|Most {{aircraft}} have fineness ratios {{significantly greater}} than this, however. This is often due to the competing need to place the tail control surfaces {{at the end of}} a longer moment arm to increase their effectiveness. Reducing the length of the fuselage would require larger controls, which would offset the drag savings from using the ideal <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio.</b> An example of a high-performance design with an imperfect <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio</b> is the Lancair. In other cases, the designer is forced to use a non-ideal design due to outside factors such as seating arrangements or cargo pallet sizes. Modern airliners often have fineness ratios much higher than ideal, a side effect of their cylindrical cross-section which is selected for strength, as well as providing a single width to simplify seating layout.|$|E
50|$|The RSA was long, thin missile with a {{very high}} <b>fineness</b> <b>ratio,</b> similar to modern {{supersonic}} aircraft like the Concorde.

For supersonic (Mach 2. 00) design, a one-parameter family of hyperbolic arcs was used to generate forebody shapes having a favorable pressure gradient over the forebody length.

50|$|Inertia {{coupling}} {{was essentially}} unknown before {{the introduction of}} high-speed jet aircraft. Prior to this time, aircraft tended to be wider than long, and their mass was generally distributed closer {{to the center of}} mass. This was especially true for propeller aircraft, but equally true for early jet fighters as well. It was only when the aircraft began to sacrifice aerodynamic surface area in order to lower drag, and use longer <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios</b> that lowered supersonic drag, that the effect became obvious. In these cases the aircraft was generally much more tail-heavy, allowing its gyroscopic effect to overwhelm the small control surfaces.|$|R
50|$|As an {{aircraft}} approaches {{the speed of}} sound, shock waves form on areas of greater curvature. These shock waves radiate away energy that the engines must supply, energy that does not go into making the aircraft go faster. This {{appears to be a}} new form of drag—referred to as wave drag—which peaks at about three times the drag at speeds even slightly below the critical mach. In order to minimize the wave drag, the curvature of the aircraft should be kept to a minimum, which implies much higher <b>fineness</b> <b>ratios.</b> This is why high-speed aircraft have long pointed noses and tails, and cockpit canopies that are flush to the fuselage line.|$|R

The onset angle depends only on body geometry, longer bodies having lower onset angles. The upper limit, which is about 80 deg at M = 0. 25, decreases with Mach number. The maximum side forces decrease with increasing Mach number, approaching zero within the Mach number range of 0. 8 to 1. 2; within this range, the Mach number at which the forces approach zero varies directly with forebody slenderness...|$|R
