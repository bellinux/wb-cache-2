5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized <b>falsework</b> structures {{in the construction of the}} barrel vaults (see animation below).|$|E
5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly placed brick tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the <b>falsework.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the wooden}} or metal form that {{supported}} the casting of the concrete was elevated, the forms were supported on <b>falsework,</b> in this case using vertical pipe sections, steel beams, and diagonal cables. A wooden deck was then erected atop the <b>falsework</b> to support the lowest forming surface.|$|E

Newspapers {{of that time}} write that once he fell down from <b>falseworks</b> and broke two of his ribs but got up and continued his work.|$|R
25|$|Most modern arch bridges {{are made}} from {{reinforced}} concrete. This type of bridge is suitable where a temporary centring may be erected to support the forms, reinforcing steel, and uncured concrete. When the concrete is sufficiently set the forms and <b>falseworks</b> are then removed. It is also possible to construct a reinforced concrete arch from precast concrete, where the arch is built in two halves which are then leaned against each other.|$|R

25|$|The <b>falsework</b> {{to perform}} this task {{is a pair}} of {{substantial}} truss bridges, prefabricated in segments, with columns and span segments lifted into place by barge cranes. The trusses are supported on foundations consisting of or built atop deeply driven piles.

40|$|Queensland University of Technology Research Week International Conference, QUT Research Week 2005, Brisbane, QLD, 4 - 8 July 2005 The {{planning}} of construction operations {{is a complicated}} activity involving abstraction of construction activities from the drawings, choosing of suitable plants and <b>falseworks,</b> allocation of resources on site, {{planning of}} safe working place for labourers, and the scheduling of activities sequence.

25|$|This type of bridge has cables {{suspended}} between towers, plus vertical suspender cables {{that carry}} {{the weight of}} the deck below, upon which traffic crosses. This arrangement allows the deck to be level or to arc upward for additional clearance. Like other suspension bridge types, this type often is constructed without <b>falsework.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was {{organized}} {{to finance the}} construction. Among the prominent backers was Henry Clay Frick, the coal tycoon and associate of Andrew Carnegie. The Union Bridge Company of Athens, Pennsylvania, which had completed the Michigan Central cantilever bridge at Niagara (see Niagara Cantilever Bridge), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by Charles Macdonald and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction {{was carried out by}} constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on <b>falsework,</b> and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with <b>falsework.</b> The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.|$|E
25|$|Stone, {{brick and}} other such {{materials}} are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. As a result, masonry arch bridges {{are designed to be}} constantly under compression, so far as is possible. Each arch is constructed over a temporary <b>falsework</b> frame, known as a centring. In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone {{in the middle of the}} bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the <b>falsework</b> is removed.|$|E
25|$|The High Bridge of Kentucky by C. Shaler Smith (1877), the Niagara Cantilever Bridge by Charles Conrad Schneider (1883) and the Poughkeepsie Bridge by John Francis O'Rourke and Pomeroy P. Dickinson (1889) {{were all}} {{important}} early {{uses of the}} cantilever design. The Kentucky River Bridge spanned a gorge that was 275 feet (84 meters) deep and took {{full advantage of the}} fact that <b>falsework,</b> or temporary support, is not needed for the main span of a cantilever bridge.|$|E
25|$|As {{a bundle}} is laid down, it was {{initially}} supported by supports {{mounted on the}} catwalk, then both ends were attached and the cable is tensioned at the eastern anchor points. As with a conventional cable suspension span, all of the tensioned bundles were then compressed into a circular shape and protected with a circular wrap of wire. Saddles for suspender cables were added and suspender cables placed and tensioned. The suspender cable tensioning lifted the span from its supporting <b>falsework.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large {{cantilever bridge}}s designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no <b>falsework.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) {{are built}} using pure {{cantilever}} spans from each side, with neither <b>falsework</b> below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a truss arch bridge. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock {{is available to}} support {{the tension in the}} upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Falsework</b> {{centering}} (in British English: arch frame) is fabricated, typically from timbers and boards. Since each arch of a multi-arch bridge will {{impose a}} thrust upon its neighbors, {{it is necessary}} either that all arches of the bridge be raised at the same time, or that very wide piers be used. The thrust from the end arches is taken into the earth by substantial (vertical) footings at the canyon walls, or by large inclined planes forming in a sense ramps to the bridge, which may also be formed of arches.|$|E
25|$|A self-anchored {{suspension}} bridge has some similarity {{in principle to}} the cable-stayed type in that tension forces that prevent the deck from dropping are converted into compression forces vertically in the tower and horizontally along the deck structure. It is also related to the {{suspension bridge}} in having arcuate main cables with suspender cables, although the self-anchored type lacks the heavy cable anchorages of the ordinary suspension bridge. Unlike either a cable-stayed bridge or a suspension bridge, the self-anchored suspension bridge must be supported by <b>falsework</b> during construction {{and so it is}} more expensive to construct.|$|E
25|$|On a {{conventional}} suspension bridge, sections of deck are hung {{in place and}} so immediately tension the suspenders. The proper initial length of each suspender is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment relative positioning and equality of load distribution amongst the several suspenders of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the <b>falsework)</b> and all suspender cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the main cable. A jacking saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single main cable.|$|E
25|$|The Yerba Buena Island Transition Structure (YBITS) is an {{elevated}} roadway that bridges the gap from the SAS span to the Yerba Buena Island tunnel. Much like the Oakland Touchdown {{on the other}} side of the new bridge, this section of the bridge is also an end segment, meaning that the purpose of this segment is to transition portions of the existing bridge to the main spans of the new bridge. The connecting structure transitions the new bridge's side-by-side roadways to the upper and lower decks of the YBI tunnel. In mid-February 2012, the northern structure has been poured and formwork was being removed. In early September 2012, the <b>falsework</b> had been removed, modified, and constructed at the eastbound location with formwork completion now allowing reinforcing and concrete placement.|$|E
25|$|After this, {{a design}} contest {{was held for}} a {{signature}} span (a span with distinctive and dramatic appearance, unique to the site) by the Engineering and Design Advisory Panel (EDAP) of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). A number of innovative proposals were examined until all but four proposals that were submitted by members of EDAP were selected as semi-finalists, and a winner was selected from this group. This posed a serious conflict of interest, {{as members of the}} EDAP who were selecting the bridge design reviewed proposals by their own firms and rejected all proposals that did not have a representative on the EDAP. The design chosen was more expensive than the alternatives, because the primary structure cannot be self-supporting until it is structurally complete. This requires the building of two bridges, the first a <b>falsework</b> to support the final span, which would be removed upon completion of the final span. It has also been criticized as both a less structurally robust design and with less predictable construction costs than other modern spans.|$|E
25|$|In their {{vaulting}} structures, Umayyad period buildings show {{a mixture}} of ancient Roman and Persian architectural traditions. Diaphragm arches with lintelled ceilings made of wood or stone beams, or, alternatively, with barrel vaults, were known in the Levant since the classical and Nabatean period. They were mainly used to cover houses and cisterns. The architectural form of covering diaphragm arches with barrel vaults, however, was likely newly introduced from Iranian architecture, as similar vaulting was not known in Bilad al-Sham {{before the arrival of}} the Umayyads. However, this form was well known in Iran from early Parthian times, as exemplified in the Parthian buildings of Aššur. The earliest known example for barrel vaults resting on diaphragm arches from Umayyad architecture is known from Qasr Harane in Syria. During the early period, the diaphragm arches are built from coarsely cut limestone slabs, without using supporting <b>falsework,</b> which were connected by gypsum mortar. Later-period vaults were erected using pre-formed lateral ribs modelled from gypsum, which served as a temporal formwork to guide and center the vault. These ribs, which were left in the structure afterwards, do not carry any load. The ribs were cast in advance on strips of cloth, the impression of which can still be seen in the ribs today. Similar structures are known from Sasanian architecture, for example from the palace of Firuzabad. Umayyad-period vaults of this type were found in Amman Citadel and in Qasr Amra.|$|E

500|$|The Big Four Bridge {{had one of}} {{the biggest}} bridge {{disasters}} in the United States, occurring on December 15, 1893 when a construction crane was dislodged by a severe wind, causing the <b>falsework</b> support of a truss to be damaged and the truss—with forty-one workers on it—to fall into the Ohio River. Twenty of the workers survived, but twenty-one died. The accident almost cost more lives, as a ferry crossing the Ohio River just barely missed being hit by the truss. Hours later, a span next to the damaged span also fell into the river, but was unoccupied at the time, causing no injuries. As a result, <b>falsework</b> was longitudely reinforced to prevent further occurrences, and also to prevent strong winds from causing similar damage by using special bracing on the bottom frame of the truss. Also, a new rule was enforced: [...] "never trust a bolted joint any longer than is necessary to put a riveted one in place".|$|E
500|$|The {{last of the}} {{historic}} bridges along a former segment of US2 is the structure carrying Ashmun Street (BSI‑75) over the Power Canal in Sault Ste. Marie. Built in 1934, {{it is one of}} only three steel arch bridges in the state. The [...] and [...] structure is described by MDOT as [...] "massive" [...] with an [...] "innovative" [...] construction method: the previous structure was used as a <b>falsework</b> for the current bridge before removal.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{increasing}} weight of the rail traffic, contracts were finalized in June 1928 to build a bigger Big Four Bridge, which opened on June 25, 1929. The new Big Four Bridge {{was built on the}} piers of the old bridge, a [...] "novel building process", as it sped up the time necessary to build the new bridge; the old one served to reinforce the new one as it was being built. The old piers would still be used, but the <b>falsework</b> was entirely removed. During construction, the Big Four Bridge's usual rail traffic was routed over the Kentucky & Indiana Terminal Bridge. The interurbans that used the Big Four Bridge would instead disembark at Sellersburg, Indiana and have the passengers board buses into Louisville {{for the duration of the}} Big Four's reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} and flooding also occurred in China. A station in Jinjiang, Fujian recorded 544mm (21.42in) {{of rain in}} an 18-hour period; {{this was the most}} torrential rainfall event for the city since records began. Heavy rains also fell in Zimao Town, where 334mm (13.15in) of rain was documented in eight hours. Quanzhou City was heavily impacted by the rainfall, and total losses there reached CN¥240million (US$29million). One death resulted in the city. Further south in Heyuan, widespread power outages were caused by torrential rainfall. Winds blew two people off of a high <b>falsework,</b> killing both. The rainfall from Morakot in China somewhat relieved persistent drought conditions in the region. Following the passage of the tropical storm, however, 703cloud seeding missions were carried out in Fujian Province in order to produce enhanced artificial rainfall. This included the deployment of 1,027rockets and 14,700cannonballs containing silver iodide. As a result of these, rainfall totals ranging from [...] over a [...] area were attributed to anthropologically enhanced precipitation. Though not directly related to Morakot, the storm's cyclonic circulation helped in part to produce thick smog and low visibility conditions in parts of Hong Kong.|$|E

2500|$|The common method {{they all}} used was to clad the timber {{centring}} (also known as <b>falsework)</b> with planks, known as [...] "laggings", laid {{parallel with the}} abutments and carefully planed and levelled to approximate closely the required curve of the intrados of the arch. The positions of the courses {{in the vicinity of}} the crown were first marked out at right angles to the faces using long wooden straight-edges, then the remaining courses were marked out in parallel.

5000|$|Over 300,000 {{board feet}} (700 m3) of Douglas fir timber, {{used to build}} a 250-foot (76 m) high <b>falsework</b> to support the arch during construction, was transported from the {{railroad}} terminal in Monterey over the narrow, one-way road to the bridge site. The <b>falsework,</b> built by crews led by E. C. Panton, the general superintendent, and I. O. Jahlstrom, resident engineer of Ward Engineering Co., was difficult to raise, because it was constantly exposed to high winds. Some of the <b>falsework</b> timbers were 10 x 10 in.
