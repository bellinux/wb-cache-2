50|$|Anodopetalum biglandulosum is a Tasmanian {{endemic species}} {{that is a}} common {{component}} of Tasmanian cool temperate rainforests. Tasmanian rainforests are classified along a <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> into three major types: callidendrous, thamnic and implicate rainforests. Callidendrous rainforests are tall, park-like forests with few shrubs in the understory, located on high fertility soils. Thamnic rainforests are well-formed trees, medium in height, with a distinct shrub layer on intermediate fertility soils. Implicate rainforests are low, tangled forests with uneven canopies on infertile soils. Anodopetalum biglandulosum is typically an understory species in thamnic rainforests, {{as well as a}} canopy species in implicate rainforests. This species is present below 1100m altitude in high rainfall areas (in excess of 1750mm) and on poorly drained acid soils in Western and Southern Tasmania. In these locations, Anodopetalum biglandulosum forms a tangle of stems producing its characteristic ‘horizontal’ scrub growth.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} - There is {{increasing}} recognition that plant traits mediate environmental influence on species distribution, justifying non-random community assembly. We studied {{the influence of}} local scale edaphic factors {{on the distribution of}} functional traits in a tropical rainforest of Cameroon with the aim to find correlations between the main edaphic gradient and community functional trait metrics (weighted mean trait, functional divergence and intraspecific variation). Methods - Within the Korup Forest Dynamics Plot (50 ha), we randomly selected 44 quadrats of 0. 04 ha each, collected soils and analysed 11 topography and soil variables. Leaves were harvested from all 98 tree species found in the quadrats to calculate community trait metrics [quadrat-level weighted mean (q(k)) and functional divergence (FDiv(k)) ] for leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf phosphorus (LPC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P ratio). We examined relationships between the main edaphic gradient with q(k), with FDiv(k) and with intraspecific variation and interpreted correlations as the effects of abiotic filtering and competitive interaction. Key results - Soil fertility was the main edaphic gradient and was significantly correlated with q(k) for LPC, LNC and LA and with FDiv(k) for LPC, N: P ratio, LA and SLA, confirming the influence of abiotic filtering and competitive interaction by the soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient,</b> respectively. For a given trait, quadrats were either over-dispersed or under-dispersed, accounting for 7 - 33 % of non-random trait distribution along the soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> Trends in intraspecific traits variation were consistently lower than quadrat-level mean traits along the soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> Conclusions - This study demonstrates the influence of soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> on local scale community trait distribution and its contribution to non-random community assembly...|$|E

To determine the community-level value of traits ('aggregated trait values') for a plant community, a standardized population-centred method exists, but requires substantial manpower and reliable botanical knowledge. We tested an alternative method, the trait transect, using four subalpine pastures in the Beaufortain region (Northern French Alps) selected along a <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> We applied both methods to measure five commonly used 'soft traits' known to be responsive to soil nutrient availability: plant vegetative and reproductive height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter and nitrogen contents. We tested whether the variation of these traits along the gradient detected with the population-centred method was also detected with the trait transect. Both methods detected expected trends in the traits {{in response to the}} <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> The trait transect method was as efficient as the population-centred method and is recommended as an appropriate tool for monitoring ecosystem changes in response to environmental conditions and management, especially in species-rich communities...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} smallholder farmer resource-endowment and soil nutrient management strategies on plant nutrient uptake and growth across soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> under semi-arid conditions. Soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> as influenced by farmers’ resource availability may affect the response of crops to fertilizer addition and therefore productivity. The {{study was conducted in}} Njelele and Nemangwe smallholder areas (450 - 800 mm per annum, unimodal) in north-western Zimbabwe. Soil and maize cobleaf samples were collected from fields of farmers (varying resource endowment) located near to (homefields) and far away (outfields) from the farmers’ homesteads during the 2005 - 6 season. The samples were analysed for selected soil fertility indicators and soil samples were further used to test maize growth response to various nutrient applications under greenhouse conditions. Soil fertility (organic C, total N and available P) significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased from resourceendowed to resource-constrained farmers, and from outfields to homefields, but the latter differences were only significant for available P. Besides resource-endowment and field type, response to nutrient applications also depended on soil texture. In sandy soil, both N and P were limiting to MAIZE growth in outfields while N was most limiting in the homefield. It was concluded that resource-endowment and nutrient resource management strategies employed by farmers result in soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> which affect response of crops to fertilisation and therefore need to be factored in the development of fertiliser recommendations...|$|R

Slow-forming terraces have been widely adopted in the northern highlands of Rwanda to control soil erosion however not much been done to evaluate their efficiency. We hypothesized that slow-forming terraces reduce soil loss and soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> compared with non-conserved land. A field experiment compared the soil erosion rates and <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> of 20 + year old terraces where sole grass strips (Pennisetum purpureum) or grass strips combined with infiltration ditches were used with those of land where no soil conservation technologies were applied. The experiment was conducted in the year 2010 on three landscape positions (Upperslope, Hillslope and Footslope) along a representative toposequence using farmers’ fields where potato and maize were grown in two consecutive cropping seasons. The highest annual soil loss (41. 5 t ha- 1) was recorded with plots receiving no soil conservation practices while the lowest annual soil loss (18 t ha- 1) was recorded with grass strips combined with infiltration ditches. The slow-forming terraces showed a marked “within” spatial difference in both soil quality and crop yield. The soil in {{the lower part of the}} terraces showed as much as 57 % more organic carbon content and 31 % more available phosphorous than the soil in the upper part. Organic carbon (OC) was higher (OC = 2. 1 %) on the upperslope than on hillslope (OC = 1. 9 %). Less than 2. 3 t ha- 1 of the mean potato yield (23 t ha- 1) and only 0. 5 t ha- 1 of the mean maize yield (5 t ha- 1) were recorded on the uppermost third of the terraces on all three landscape positions. The marked soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> indicate that the sustainability of slow-forming terraces is threatened, unless a site-specific fertilizer strategy is developed.

40|$|The {{majority}} of terrestrial plants associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which typically facilitate the uptake of limiting mineral nutrients by plants {{in exchange for}} plant carbon. However, hundreds of non-photosynthetic plant species—mycoheterotrophs—depend entirely on AM fungi for carbon as well as mineral nutrition. Mycoheterotrophs can {{provide insight into the}} operation and regulation of AM fungal relationships, but {{little is known about the}} factors, fungal or otherwise, that affect mycoheterotroph abundance and distribution. In a lowland tropical forest in Panama, we conducted the first systematic investigation into the influence of abiotic factors on the abundance and distribution of mycoheterotrophs, to ask whether the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus altered the occurrence of mycoheterotrophs and their AM fungal partners. Across a natural <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> spanning the isthmus of Panama, and also in a long-term nutrientaddition experiment, mycoheterotrophs were entirely absent when soil exchangeable phosphate concentrations exceeded 2 mg P kg 21. Experimental phosphorus addition reduced the abundance of AM fungi, and also reduced the abundance of the specific AM fungal taxa required by the mycoheterotrophs, suggesting that the phosphorus sensitivity of mycoheterotrophs is underpinned by the phosphorus sensitivity of their AM fungal hosts. The soil phosphorus concentration of 2 mg P kg 21 also corresponds to a marked shift in tree community composition and soil phosphatase activity across the <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient,</b> suggesting that our findings have broad ecological significance...|$|E
40|$|Legume-based {{cropping}} systems {{have the potential}} to improve nitrogen (N) retention and use efficiency in comparison with fertilizer-based systems, yet we lack an ecological understanding of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in these agroecosystems. My research objectives were to investigate: 1) the effects of legumebased management on soil organic matter (SOM) pools; 2) the effects of a SOM-based <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> on BNF; and 3) how plant phenology and species interactions affect BNF across the <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> Research plots were established on grain farm fields in New York in 2004 and 2006. Fields represented a <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> due to soil type and management differences, ranging from exclusive use of Haber-Bosch N to almost exclusive use of legumes. I estimated BNF of soybean (Glycine max), field pea (Pisum sativum), and perennial red clover (Trifolium pratense) using the 15 N natural abundance method. Soil N pools were quantified ranging in microbial accessibility from extremely labile to primarily recalcitrant pools. Legume-based systems had greater quantity and quality of labile SOM pools, compared to fertilizer-based systems. I found weak evidence of soil N availability inhibiting BNF despite a more than 2 -fold range in SOM pools across study sites. This suggests that N mineralization from SOM pools represented a much smaller N flux than N fertilizer levels used in past BNF studies. Complementary, facilitative and competitive interactions influenced BNF in species mixtures. Relay cropping of frost-seeded clover into winter grains increased clover % N from fixation due to the short period of competitive species interactions while retaining high biomass production due to the period of monoculture growth following grain harvest. The longer growth period of perennials may have increased their ability to respond to environmental conditions through feedback mechanisms. Perennial mixtures outyielded their corresponding monocultures and I found evidence for facilitative N transfer from legumes to grasses in perennial, but not annual mixtures. Monoculture red clover biomass yield was more stable across field sites than the other plant treatments. These results suggest that the integration of perennials and species mixtures into rotations could increase BNF inputs while also improving overall agroecosystem N cycling efficiency and yield stability...|$|E
40|$|We {{set out to}} map {{the soil}} organic carbon (SOC) content, as an {{indicator}} of soil fertility, at the village scale, and to relate the SOC content to farm scale management and landscape scale characteristics. Topsoil samples were taken at 100 random locations in the Murewa smallholder farming area in Zimbabwe and analysed for organic carbon. Using digital soil mapping techniques and Landsat TM images we could explain 50 % of the observed SOC variance. The average SOC content was estimated to be 1. 5 %, although the sandy cropping area had a much lower average of 0. 8 % and the red clays and valleys had higher average of 1. 8 %. The SOC variability could not be linked to farm management. No <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> were observed, mostly due to a strong dominance of clay content on the spatial distribution of SOC. Clay content was able to explain 57 % of the SOC variance, while farm area and labour size, typically used for farmer typology, were able to explain only an additional minor part of the SOC variance. This strong landscape scale effect needs to be included in future village-scale studies.

40|$|Variability of soil {{fertility}} {{within and across}} farms poses a major challenge for increasing crop productivity in smallholder systems of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study assessed the effect of farmers’ resource endowment and nutrient management strategies on variability in {{soil fertility}} and plant nutrient uptake between different fields in Gokwe South (average rainfall ~ 650 mm yr– 1; 16. 3 persons km– 2) and Murewa (average rainfall ~ 850 mm yr– 1; 44. 1 persons km– 2) districts, Zimbabwe. In Murewa, resource-endowed farmers applied manure (> 3. 5 t ha– 1 yr– 1) on fields closest to their homesteads (homefields) and none to fields further away (outfields). In Gokwe the manure was not targeted to any particular field, and farmers quickly abandoned outfields and opened up new fields further away from the homestead once fertility had declined, but homefields were continually cultivated. Soil-available phosphorus (P) was more concentrated in homefields (8 – 13 mg kg– 1) of resource-endowed farmers than on outfields and all fields of poor resource farms (2 – 6 mg kg– 1) in Murewa. Soil fertility decreased with increasing distance from the homestead in Murewa, while the reverse trend occurred in Gokwe South, indicating the impact of different soil fertility management strategies on spatial soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients.</b> In both districts, maize nutrient uptake showed deficiency in nitrogen (N) and P, implying that these were the most limiting nutrients.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the pattern of}} floristic similarity {{as a function of}} geographical distances and environmental variability in well-drained uplands (terra firme) in Colombian Amazonia. The study site comprised three National Natural Parks, Tinigua, Chiribiquete, and Amacayacu, located in different geological units that represent a soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> linked to parental materials. Differences in species richness between sites were compared using rarefaction analysis. A clear floristic transition appeared in the east-west direction following a soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> along the first PCoA axis. In multiple regression analyses based on distance matrices, both geographical distances and geology explained 64 percent of the total floristic variation. Geographical distances alone accounted for 12 percent of variation in floristic similarities among plots, while geology alone accounted for 1 percent, and the joint effect of both explained 51 percent of the floristic variation. The species richness trend supports the existence of a latitudinal corridor southward of the geographical Equator in the Amazon basin, where tree diversity reaches the maximum expected values. A coupled effect of stochastic dispersal limitation and habitat specialization would certainly appear to be an appropriate explanation for tree species turnover in terra firme forests in Colombian Amazonia, strongly emphasizing that competition and neutrality must be supplementary rather than mutually exclusive processes. This result pinpoints the effect of dispersal on floral mixing as an ongoing active process for structuring tree communities in NW Amazonia, {{and the size of the}} reserves as a relevant issue to protect rare species from extinction by chance...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that changes in {{community}} composition in mature kauri forests are driven by topographical gradients. The extent to which functional traits influence the patterns detected in these forests has not been well-studied. The overall objective of this thesis was to enhance our understanding of what drives community assembly in these forests by testing the importance of functional traits in mediating the relationship between environmental factors and community composition. Puketī Forest (Northland, New Zealand) was selected as the study site because rapid turnover of species composition occurs over very strong topographic and edaphic gradients. Community composition was determined using forty permanent 400 m² plots that spanned the full gradient in soil properties and topographic variation. Leaf, height and wood traits were measured in thirty of these plots on three individuals (> 10 cm dbh) for each species on each plot. A total of 30 species were studied; the criteria for a species to be included was that the species had to attain a relative abundance of at least 0. 05 within a single plot and occur on at least 10 percent of the forty plots sampled. Fully-expanded, mature, healthy, well-lit leaves were collected from the canopy using a pole pruner, shotgun or slingshot. Cores were collected using an increment borer. The relationships between community-weighted mean traits and environmental gradients were analysed using linear regression. Results showed that there is a continuous compositional change along this environmental gradient and consequently there are few visually abrupt changes that occur between forest types. The exception to this is the kauri-dominated stands that are found in low fertility environments that are present on ridges. Soil variables and topography were found to be correlated, and the environmental variables that explain the majority of the variation in the community composition and functional trait data were soil carbon: nitrogen ratio, total soil phosphorus and soil pH, rather than topography. Trait – environment regressions showed that traits are filtered along the soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> Species that have high SLA, high leaf and litter nitrogen, low leaf thickness, large seeds and low wood densities were found in the more fertile environments, which have a low soil carbon: nitrogen ratio, high total soil phosphorus and a high pH, such as a gully habitat. At the other end of this gradient, species that have low SLA, low leaf and litter nitrogen, high leaf thickness, small seeds and high wood densities were present in less fertile environments, which have a high soil carbon: nitrogen ratio, low total soil phosphorus and a low pH, such as a ridge top habitat. Functional diversity indices indicate that the strength of environmental filtering changes along the soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> These indices show that trait variability does vary along the soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> and that there are different community assembly processes operating in different places. The strength of the soil fertility as an environmental filter is strongest in low fertility soils, as environmental filtering results in convergence towards traits that confer a resource-retaining strategy. Previous studies in kauri forests have shown changes in community composition to be determined by topography. This study has shown that these well-known patterns are driven by the filtering of leaf and wood traits along the topographically-driven soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient...</b>|$|E
40|$|Quantifying {{diversity}} with phylogeny-informed metrics helps {{understand the}} effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (EF). The sign of these effects remains controversial because phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic identity may interactively influence EF. Positive relationships, traditionally attributed to complementarity effects, seem unimportant in natural soil bacterial communities. Negative relationships {{could be attributed to}} fitness differences leading to the overrepresentation of few productive clades, a mechanism recently invoked to assemble soil bacteria communities. We tested in two ecosystems contrasting in terms of environmental heterogeneity whether two metrics of phylogenetic community structure, a simpler measure of phylogenetic diversity (NRI) and a more complex metric incorporating taxonomic identity (PCPS), correctly predict microbially mediated EF. We show that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and EF depends on the taxonomic identity of the main coexisting lineages. Phylogenetic diversity was negatively related to EF in soils where a marked <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> exists and a single and productive clade (Proteobacteria) outcompete other clades in the most fertile plots. However, phylogenetic diversity was unrelated to EF in soils where the <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> is less marked and Proteobacteria coexist with other abundant lineages. Including the taxonomic identity of bacterial lineages in metrics of phylogenetic community structure allows the prediction of EF in both ecosystems.

40|$|Feather mosses utilize {{various sources}} of {{nitrogen}} (N) : they absorb N deposited on leaf tissue, they host N- 2 fixing cyanobacteria, {{and they are}} able to take up N directly from soil. In addition to their importance as primary producers in boreal ecosystems, feather mosses {{play a significant role in}} N cycling. However, estimates of their ability to take up N from soil in situ are scarce. Further, connecting uptake of N from soil with N- 2 fixation could significantly improve our understanding of their role in ecosystem N cycling, but to date this issue has not been addressed. We report results from an uptake experiment in which we tracked C- 13 -carbon (C), N- 15 -alanine and N- 15 -ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) into feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt.) -soil cores taken along natural <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> in Northern Sweden. The varying fertility conditions coincided with a N- 2 fixation gradient in the feather moss. We found that P. schreberi takes up C and N directly from soil. However, the moss did not show a preference for inorganic or organic N sources and only 1. 4 % of the added amino acid appeared to be taken up from soil in an intact form. No differences in uptake of C or N from soil along the <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> were detected. Nitrogen fixation rates in the moss were thus not correlated with C or N-uptake from soil. Nitrogen fixation as well as uptake of C and N from soil seem to be unaffected by C or N availability in the soil, suggesting that the moss can cover its nutrient demand by absorption of throughfall N and via associated N- 2 -fixing cyanobacteria without soil-N supplementation. We suggest further, that the moss can represent a (temporary) N-sink in the boreal forest, and that the moss' mechanism of uptake and release thereby will characterize the ecosystem N cycle.

40|$|Intensification of {{smallholder}} {{agriculture in}} sub-Saharan Africa {{is necessary to}} address rural poverty and natural resource degradation. Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) is a means to enhance crop productivity while maximizing the agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied inputs, and can thus contribute to sustainable intensification. ISFM consists {{of a set of}} best practices, preferably used in combination, including the use of appropriate germplasm, the appropriate use of fertilizer and of organic resources, and good agronomic practices. The large variability in soil fertility conditions within smallholder farms is also recognised within ISFM, including soils with constraints beyond those addressed by fertilizer and organic inputs. The variable biophysical environments that characterize smallholder farming systems have profound effects on crop productivity and AE and targeted application of limited agro-inputs and management practices is necessary to enhance AE. Further, management decisions depend on the farmer's resource endowments and production objectives. In this paper we discuss the "local adaptation" component of ISFM and how this can be conceptualized within an ISFM framework, backstopped by analysis of AE at plot and farm level. At plot level, a set of four constraints to maximum AE is discussed in relation to "local adaptation": soil acidity, secondary nutrient and micro-nutrient (SMN) deficiencies, physical constraints, and drought stress. In each of these cases, examples are presented whereby amendments and/or practices addressing these have a significantly positive impact on fertilizer AE, including mechanistic principles underlying these effects. While the impact of such amendments and/or practices is easily understood for some practices (e. g., the application of SMNs where these are limiting), for others, more complex interactions with fertilizer AE can be identified (e. g., water harvesting under varying rainfall conditions). At farm scale, adjusting fertilizer applications within-farm soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> has the potential to increase AE compared with blanket recommendations, in particular where <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> are strong.

40|$|Strong {{gradients}} of decreasing {{soil fertility}} are found with increasing {{distance from the}} homestead within smallholder African farms, due to differential resource allocation. As nutrient use efficiency varies strongly along these gradients, such heterogeneity must be considered when designing soil management strategies, aimed at an improved overall resource use efficiency at farm scale. Here, we quantify the magnitude and study the origin of farmer-induced, within-farm soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> as affected by biophysical and socio-economic conditions, and investigate farmers¿ perceptions of such heterogeneity. Farm transects, participatory resource flow mapping, farmers¿ classification of land qualities, and soil sampling for both chemical and spectral reflectance analyses were performed across 60 farms in three sub-locations (Emuhaia, Shinyalu, Aludeka) representing the variability found in the highlands of western Kenya. Differences between the various field types of a farm were observed for input use (e. g. 0. 7 ¿ 104 kg N ha¿ 1), food production (e. g. 0. 6 ¿ 2. 9 t DM ha¿ 1), partial C (e. g. ¿ 570 to 1480 kg ha¿ 1) and N (e. g. ¿ 92 to 57 kg ha¿ 1) balances and general soil fertility status, despite strong differences across sub-locations. Concentration of nutrients in the home fields compared with the remote fields were verified for extractable P (e. g. 2. 1 ¿ 19. 8 mg kg¿ 1) and secondarily for exchangeable K (e. g. 0. 14 ¿ 0. 54 cmol(+) kg¿ 1), on average, whereas differences for soil C and N were only important when considering each individual farm separately. Farmers managed their fields according to their perceived land quality, varying the timing and intensity of management practices along soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients.</b> Fields classified by them as poor were planted later (up to 33. 6 days of delay), with sparser crops (ca. 30 % less plants m¿ 2) and had higher weed infestation levels than those classified as fertile, leading to important differences in maize yield (e. g. 0. 9 versus 2. 4 t ha¿ 1). The internal heterogeneity in resource allocation varied also between farms of different social classes, according to their objectives and factor constraints.

We also investigated whether the effects of this conversion depend on the soil fertility and if they affect the species pool at the landscape scale. The study area contained ancient deciduous woodlands mainly consisting of Quercus spp., Fagus sylvatica and Carpinus betulus in the Gaume, an area with a mild temperate climate in southern Belgium. Spruce plantations were established 30 – 50 years ago in this matrix of deciduous woodlands. Differences in overstorey and understorey vegetation, forest floor and soil characteristics between 40 paired plots in spruce plantations and adjacent deciduous forest were compared along a soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> The forest floor mass was higher and the soil pH was lower in spruce plantations. The composition of the understorey vegetation differed between deciduous forest and spruce plantations: the spruce stands contained more light-demanding and acid-tolerant understorey species than the adjacent deciduous stands. The mean understorey species diversity, i. e., the local species diversity in a plot (a-diversity) as well as the total number of species (c-diversity), did not differ significantly between the deciduous and spruce stands. Hence, the differing species composition of the spruce plantations contributes to a larger overall species pool and higher across site b-diversity. Although the differences in the environmental variables within a plot pair increased along the <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient,</b> the differences in understorey vegetation diversity between deciduous and spruce stands showed no relationship with the gradient. Only the difference in Ellenberg indicator value for soil reaction (R) within a pair increased with increasing soil fertility. In line with the abiotic changes, the understorey vegetation composition had shifted towards a more acid-tolerant vegetation type 30 – 50 years after conversion to spruce plantations. The increase in light-demanding species was probably due to a more intensive thinning management in the spruce stands. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Despite their {{economic}} and ecological importance, defense responses of conifers to pests are little understood. In a 3 -year experiment, we monitored systemic fungal (Diplodia pinea) - and insect (Neodiprion sertifer) -induced defense protein activities and total soluble proteins in needles and phloem of Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) across a soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> In both years, total soluble protein content of foliage and phloem declined with increasing fertility across induction treatments, while defensive protein activities generally increased with increasing fertility. In 2005, total soluble protein content in branch phloem was increased by fungal inoculation of the stem. Peroxidase activity was suppressed in needles by insect defoliation in 2006, while polyphenol oxidase activity was systemically induced in branch phloem by insect attack in 2005.

40|$|In {{addition}} to resource competition, allelopathy {{is believed to}} contribute to the invasiveness and impact of several plant invaders of North America. In this study, we examined whether aqueous leaf extracts of Alliaria petiolata and Lonicera maackii, two invaders of deciduous forests in North America, affected growth and reproduction of a target nonmycorrhizal plant and whether effects varied across a soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> While nutrient addition substantially improved the performance of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in field soils in pots in a growth room, addition of A. petiolata extracts to these soils had no significant independent or interactive effects on growth or reproduction. In contrast, addition of L. maackii extracts both directly reduced growth and reproduction of A. thaliana and greatly constrained increases in growth and reproduction of A. thaliana in response to increasing nutrient availability. Use of a nonmycorrhizal target plant revealed that effects of L. maackii were independent of allelopathic effects on mycorrhizae, an effect attributed to A. petiolatain other studies...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{variability}} in crop yields commonly observed in smallholder farms of sub-Saharan Africa is often caused by gradients of declining soil fertility with increasing {{distance from the}} homestead. This heterogeneity means that recommendations based on regional soil surveys are of limited value. The variability in soil qualities within farms must be considered when designing management strategies, and their feasibility analysed by integrating results at the farm livelihood scale. For this purpose, we have developed the model FARMSIM, a dynamic bio-economic model for analysis and exploration of trade-offs in resource and labour allocation in heterogeneous smallholder farms. Focusing on farm-scale strategies, the approach to simulation of soil and crop processes in FARMSIM (the sub-model FIELD) {{is designed to be}} simple, but to keep the necessary degree of complexity to capture heterogeneity in resource use efficiencies. To test our approach, the sub-model FIELD was calibrated against chronosequences of woodland clearance in three agroecological zones of Zimbabwe (with soil textures of 3, 10, 35 % clay), and used to simulate: (i) the creation of soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients,</b> and (ii) different strategies of N, P and manure applications to maize and soyabean rotations in homefields and outfields of smallholder farms on clayey and sandy soils. The results of the simulation of management strategies were tested against on-farm experimental data from Murewa, Zimbabwe. The model produced satisfactory predictions (r 2 : 0. 6 ¿ 0. 9) of long-term changes in soil organic C, of crop responses to N and P and of nutrient use efficiencies across a wide range of yields and different field types. This demonstrated the broad applicability of the model despite the sparse data required for initialisation. However, the model results were less accurate in predicting crop responses to N and P applications in the outfields on sandy soils. Experimental evidence indicated yield limitation by Ca and Zn deficiencies in highly depleted outfields on sandy soils, which were not included mechanistically in the current version of FIELD. Repeated applications of 16 t ha¿ 1 year¿ 1 of manure allowed larger responses to applied N and P after 3 years of experimentation; such a corrective effect of manure was simulated to be due to improved N and P recovery efficiencies in the model. In combination with the experimental data, the simulation results suggested that soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> affect nutrient use efficiencies, operating mostly on the efficiencies of nutrient capture rather than conversion. A typology of fields according to the type of management interventions needed is introduced, based on a generic application of FIELD with this parameterisation...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of field and tabular methods and multivariate analyses {{were used to}} develop groups of ground flora species (i. e., ecological species groups) that characterize and distinguish highly disturbed, landform-level ecosystems dominated by jack pine in northern Lower Michigan. The endangered Kirtland’s warbler formerly or currently occupied the large glacial landforms for which species groups were developed. Eight such ecological species groups were created using 31 woody and herbaceous species sampled in 144 plots within a 20, 000 km 2 geographic region of uniform climate and regional physiography. The groups were initially constructed using subjective, observation-based groupings of species with similar presence and abundance along soil moisture and <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients.</b> Species groups were corroborated using TWINSPAN and detrended correspondence analysis, and the environmental conditions indicated by each were described and contrasted based upon field observations and canonical correspondence analysis. Two of the eight species groups indicated very dry, infertile sites, and one was indicative of a very broad range of sites dominated by jack pine. The remaining five groups reflected a relatively gentle environmental gradient within the set of ecosystems we sampled, indicating small differences along a soil moisture gradient and less so along a soil fertility and light availability gradient. The groups were applied successfully {{for the majority of}} an area that had been repeatedly logged and/or burned for at least 12...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In arctic glacier moraines, bioweathering primed by {{microbial}} iron oxidizers creates <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> that accelerate {{soil development}} and plant establishment. With {{the aim of}} investigating the change of bacterial diversity in a pyrite-weathered gradient, we analyzed {{the composition of the}} bacterial communities involved in the process by sequencing 16 S rRNA gene libraries from different biological soil crusts (BSC). Bacterial communities in three BSC of different morphology, located within 1 m distance downstream a pyritic conglomerate rock, were significantly diverse. The glacier moraine surrounding the weathered site showed wide phylogenetic diversity and high evenness with 15 represented bacterial classes, dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and pioneer Cyanobacteria colonizers. The bioweathered area showed the lowest diversity indexes and only nine bacterial families, largely dominated by Acidobacteriaceae and Acetobacteraceae typical of acidic environments, in accordance with the low pH of the BSC. In the weathered BSC, iron-oxidizing bacteria were cultivated, with counts decreasing along with the increase of distance from the rock, and nutrient release from the rock was revealed by environmental scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analyses. The vegetated area showed the presence of Actinomycetales, Verrucomicrobiales, Gemmatimonadales, Burkholderiales, and Rhizobiales, denoting a bacterial community typical of developed soils and indicating that the lithoid substrate of the bare moraine was here subjected to an accelerated colonization, driven by iron-oxidizing activity...|$|R
40|$|In {{smallholder}} farms throughout subSaharan Africa, it is {{a common}} pattern for some fields to receive substantial inputs of fertilisers and manure, but others to receive nutrient inputs infrequently or never. A soil and crop model, SCAN, based on annual summary of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics was calibrated against chronosequences on coarse soils in semi-arid Zimbabwe, giving satisfactory predictions of organic matter loss and crop yield responses to amendments. This model was then used to explore the effects of different nutrient resource allocation strategies across farms on field- and farm-scale production and the development of soil fertility gradients. Regular applications of manure to only part of a farm, common on farms with a limited amount, rapidly lead to large gradients in crop yield. However, the first version of the model indicated that spreading manure evenly at a lower rate would give greater whole-farm yields, so it seems illogical for farmers to be concentrating their nutrient resources onto infields. Even within an existing soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient,</b> greater total farm yields were obtained by spreading a given amount of fertiliser across the fields than by concentrating this fertiliser onto more fertile fields. However, this result was caused by the failure of the SCAN model to adequately simulate the poor response to fertilisers typically seen in outfields. A second version of the model modified to increase runoff and reduce nutrient availability on soils depleted in carbon gave a more realistic decline in crop yields on fields receiving inadequate nutrient inputs. The results of the second version of the model showed that the optimal allocation strategy is dependent on the existing soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient.</b> Fertiliser should only be applied on fields where grain yield is responsive to higher nutrient inputs, and not on infields which are nutrient saturated or on degraded outfields. To improve the relevance of fertiliser and manure recommendations, it is necessary to consider resource limitations and production at the farm scale, and the effects of applying nutrient resources not only on current crop yield, but also on the development of soil fertility on different fields. Simplified dynamic modelling approaches are highly suitable for exploring such questions of resource allocation at farm scal...|$|E
40|$|One {{sentence}} summary: The {{relationship between}} phylogenetic diversity and ecosystem functioning {{is dependent on}} the taxonomic identity of the main coexisting bacterial lineages. Editor: Angela Sessitsch Quantifying diversity with phylogeny-informed metrics helps understand the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (EF). The sign of these effects remains controversial because phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic identity may interactively influence EF. Positive relationships, traditionally attributed to complementarity effects, seem unimportant in natural soil bacterial communities. Negative relationships could be attributed to fitness differences leading to the overrepresentation of few productive clades, a mechanism recently invoked to assemble soil bacteria communities. We tested in two ecosystems contrasting in terms of environmental heterogeneity whether two metrics of phylogenetic community structure, a simpler measure of phylogenetic diversity (NRI) and a more complex metric incorporating taxonomic identity (PCPS), correctly predict microbially mediated EF. We show that the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and EF depends on the taxonomic identity of the main coexisting lineages. Phylogenetic diversity was negatively related to EF in soils where a marked <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient</b> exists and a single and productive clade (Proteobacteria) outcompete other clades in the most fertile plots. However, phylogenetic diversity was unrelated to EF in soils where the fertilit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the effects of soil nutrient avail-ability and tissue chemistry on decomposition of both fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) and leaves in three sites along a forest chronosequence in the Hawaiian Islands. These sites form a natural <b>fertility</b> <b>gradient,</b> with the youngest and oldest sites having lower nutrient availabil-ity than the intermediate-aged site. Nitrogen (N) limits aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in the youngest site, while phosphorus (P) limits ANPP in the oldest site. Both root and leaf litter decomposed most slowly in the 4. 1 -Myear-old site. We also investigated root decomposition in fertilized plots at the youngest and oldest sites; when roots were produced and decomposed in fertilized plots, root decomposition rates increased with N and P additions at the 4. 1 -Myear-old site. At the 300 -year-old site, however, root decomposition rates did not respond to N or P additions. Roots decomposed fast-er than leaves at the more infertile sites, in part because of lower lignin-to-nitrogen ratios in roots than in leaf lit-ter. Decomposing roots immobilized more nutrients than did decomposing leaves, and may serve an important role in retaining nutrients in these forests...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a method for}} targeting landscapes {{with the objective of}} assessing mitigation options for smallholder agriculture. It {{presents a}}lternatives in terms of the degree of detail and complexity of the analysis, to match the requirement of research and development initiatives. We address heterogeneity in land-use decisions that is linked to the agroecological characteristics of the landscape and to the social and economic profiles of the land users. We believe that as projects implement this approach, and more data become available, the method will be refined to reduce costs and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of mitigation in smallholder agriculture. The approach {{is based on the assumption}} that landscape classifications reflect differences in land productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and can be used to scale up point or field-level measurements. At local level, the diversity of soils and land management can be meaningfully summarized using a suitable typology. Field types reflecting small-scale <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> are correlated to land quality, land productivity and quite likely to GHG emissions. A typology can be a useful tool to connect farmers' fields to landscape units because it represents the inherent quality of the land and human-induced changes, and connects the landscape to the existing socioeconomic profiles of smallholders. The method is explained using a smallholder system from western Kenya as an example...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} smallholder household characteristics and their soil fertility resource allocation to different arable niches and discussed their implications for sustainable management {{in a typical}} semi-arid communal area of Zimbabwe. Results showed that socio-economic circumstances of smallholder farmers were so diverse that application of nutrient inputs largely depended on availability of resources and their perception of niche fertility. Relatively rich households concentrated organic amendments in homestead surroundings and open areas of sandy patches but showed little selection of niches when applying inorganic inputs. Most of the poor households applied leaf litter and chicken manure in open sandy patches and could not afford high quantities of cattle manure and basal inorganic fertilizers. The medium wealth category mainly applied composts in homestead surroundings and open sandy patches. Resource allocation for sustainable soil fertility management was conspicuously a major challenge especially were there was no comprehensive and systematic application in similar niches. Deliberate or inadvertent resource allocation to niches contributed to pronounced soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients</b> within smallholder farming systems where niches like termitaria environments and open sandy patches hinted at nutrient mining. Homestead surroundings had potential to sustain agricultural production. It is recommended that development agents and researchers focus on programmes that improve the resource base of smallholder farmers such as livestock, implement ownership and effective support services as modest external inputs are essential. These strengthen the capacity of smallholder farmers to manage their arable environments sustainably...|$|R
40|$|Besides low soil fertility, climate {{variability}} {{has often}} been identified as the major constraint to agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with rainfall variability (both within and across seasons) being the most critical. Traditionally, reasonable yields could be achieved in spite of constant or smaller resource inputs by expanding the cropped area, {{but this is no}} longer a viable option. Crop production intensification is required to produce more food per unit of input and land, while maintaining or rebuilding soil fertility. However, most smallholder farmers lack access to resources such cash, fertiliser and technological expertise to address constraints caused by the biophysical environments in which they operate. The objective of this review was to collate and appraise the range of crop production intensification options that have been developed for smallholder farmers in SSA. A case study from central Mozambique was included to illustrate the impact and relevance of locally feasible options to farmers who own different resources. The study has revealed that sustainable intensification of crop production requires that multiple constraints are addressed simultaneously, in this case primarily soil fertility/plant nutrient supply and weed management. Success of crop intensification options will also depend on proper targeting to different farm types as well as field soil <b>fertility</b> <b>gradients.</b> Although smallholder farmers in SSA have limited assets, the case study revealed the occurrence of local opportunities to increase current crop productivity which in some cases do not need substantial capital inputs by the farmers, but more efficient use and targeting...|$|R
