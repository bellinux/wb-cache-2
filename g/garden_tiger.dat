25|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> moth {{population}} {{decline is}} of concern for both laboratory research and in nature. A possible way to combat this in a laboratory setting is to use synthetic food. While not ideal, it resolves many issues that arise when trying to raise captive Lepidoptera. Concerns such as food sterility are quickly resolved, along with issues of gathering hard to find or cultivate host plant material. Many larvae, including those of A. caja, can consume synthetic food, which is based primarily on agar, powdered cellulose, cabbage, sucrose, salts, and wheat germ. Synthetic options {{appear to be a}} promising way to raise lab populations of this species, for conservation or for study.|$|E

His own books ranged from a study of the art of Eric Ennion (The Living Birds of Eric Ennion 1982 Victor Gollancz), two editions of Drawing Birds for the RSPB (1986 and 2004), the limited edition Nature Drawings (1992 Arlequin Press), the more autobiographical Land Marks and Sea Wings (2005 Wildlife Art Gallery), and the recent Lines from Nature (2016, Langford Press published posthumously). The book which summed up his whole approach to nature and art was the 2013 Looking at Birds - An Antidote to Field Guides where he suggested that aspiring artists (and birdwatchers) could 'twitch' a single species, maybe [...] "collecting shapes of blackbird".|$|R
5000|$|She was {{approached}} by, and joined, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1922, where she performed in Madison Square <b>Garden</b> with snarling <b>tigers</b> {{and a black}} panther. By {{the end of that}} season, of the six wild animal acts featured with the circus, Mabel Stark's was clearly the greatest success. In 1923, she starred in the Ringling center ring, but two years later in 1925, the circus banned all wild animal acts. After a sojourn to Europe where she performed in a circus, she came back to the U.S. in 1928 and began work with the John Robinson Show. In Bangor, Maine, she lost her footing in a muddy arena and was seriously mauled by her tigers. She would suffer a wound that almost severed her leg, face lacerations, a hole in her shoulder, a torn deltoid muscle {{and a host of other}} injuries. She was rescued by fellow trainer, Terrell Jacobs, and returned to the ring in a matter of weeks, swathed in bandages and walking with a cane. She suffered numerous maulings and serious injury over her nearly 60 years of working with tigers. At one point in her career, she would face 18 big cats in the ring.|$|R

50|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> moth {{is found}} {{throughout}} much of the Palearctic, in Europe as far north as Lapland, in Northern Asia and Central Asia, and in North America. In the mountains (Tien Shan) this species is found up to an elevation of 3000 m. The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> moth loves damp places, which is why it is particularly common in river valleys as well as gardens and parks. The moth is nocturnal and can usually only be seen flying around a source of light. The distinctively coloured, long-haired caterpillar, on the other hand, is seen more frequently. It can grow up to 6 cm long and plays dead when in danger. These moths are most common in June to August, in gardens, park, meadows, grasslands, and scrubby areas.|$|E

5000|$|Some insects, notably some Noctuid moths (such as the Large Yellow Underwing) {{and some}} tiger moths (such as the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger),</b> were {{originally}} theorized {{to defend themselves}} against predation by echolocating bats, both by passively absorbing sound with soft, fur-like body coverings and by actively creating sounds to mimic echoes from other locations or objects (a [...] "phantom echo" [...] that might therefore represent [...] "auditory crypsis"), with alternative theories about interfering with the bats' echolocation ("jamming"). Subsequent research has provided evidence for only two functions of moth sounds, neither of which involve [...] "auditory crypsis:" [...] tiger moth species appear to cluster into two distinct groups: one type produces sounds as acoustic aposematism (warning the bats that the moths are unpalatable) or are acoustic mimics of unpalatable moths, and another type that uses sonar jamming. In the latter type of moth, detailed analyses failed to support a [...] "phantom echo" [...] mechanism underlying sonar jamming but instead pointed towards echo interference.|$|E
40|$|Defensive fluids {{obtained}} from the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger,</b> Scarlet Tiger and Burnet Moths and from the Monarch Butterfly and the Seven-Spot Ladybird Beetle, haemolymphs taken from the wasp, the Burying Beetle and the Rat Flea, and fluids from the eggs of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger,</b> Gypsy Moth and Oak Eggar Moth were examined in the electron microscope after negative staining. Except for the ladybird all the defensive fluids, haemolymphs and egg fluids contained particles 100 - 150 A across which frequently had rectangular or square outlines. In some species the particles were occasionally arranged in groups of 2 and 4 and in the egg fluid of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger</b> they were arranged in rows which were aligned side by side to form strands of considerable length.

They correspond in size to the 16 s component of the haemocyanin 8 of Limulus and Homarus and the protein particles found in Calliphora by other workers...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} the new {{technique}} of cutting ultmthin sections for electron microscopy {{it is now possible}} to section the virus particles themselves and this allows, within limits, the examination of their fine structure. The viruses affecting insects are particularly suitable for a study of this kind, because of their apparently complex nature, their comparatively large size, and their peculiar relationship with the host cell. The viruses which have been selected for this study are representative of each of the known insect virus types; these are, cytoplasmic polyhedral viruses which affect the gut cells of the larvae of Arctia caja, the <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> moth, and other species; a nuclear polyhedral virus which multiplies in the blood cells of a fly larva, Tipula paludosa; a recently discovered virus which multiplies in the fat body of the same larva without the formation of polyliedra, and a granulosis or capsular disease virus from the larva of Melanchra persicariae L., the dot moth. Materials and Metkods For sectioning, all material was fixed in 2 per cent osmic acid, buffered at pH 7 with phosphate buffer, dehydrated with alcohol, and embedded in a mixture of 8 parts butyl methaerylate and 2 parts methyl methacrylate. To obtain sections of the virus particles themselves, freed from cellular material, these were spun down in osmic acid at a speed of 12, 000 r~. P. xt. for 40 minutes and the pellet treated similarly to the other material. The sections were not shadowed with metal, since the methacrylate was not removed, and they were cut on a Cook and Perkins microtome, fitted with a glass knife. Figs. 6, 12, and 15 illustrate sections through pellets of virus. The unseetioned virus particles were shadowed with gold-palladium. Some of the photographs were taken on a Siemens Elmiskop I microscope at 80 kv. and the others on a Metropolitan-Vickers EM 3 electron microscope at 75 kv. Those sections which were thin enough were photographed at a magnification of 40, 000 times on the Siemens microscope and later enlarged optically. Both carbon and formvar-supporting films were used on the grids...|$|E
