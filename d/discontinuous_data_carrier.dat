To achieve a significant decrease in computation complexity, the amount of <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> has to be lowered {{in such a way that}} the corresponding performance decrease is unacceptable.

In {{this paper}} we review the {{development}} of the shock-capturing methodology, paying special attention to the increasing nonlinearity in its design and its relation to interpolation. It is well-known that high-order approximations to a discontinuous function generate spurious oscillations near the discontinuity (Gibbs phenomenon). Unlike standard finite-difference methods which use a fixed stencil, modern shock-capturing schemes use an adaptive stencil which is selected according to the local smoothness of the solution. Near discontinuities this technique automatically switches to one-sided approximations, thus avoiding the use of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>data</b> which brings about spurious oscillations. 1...|$|R
