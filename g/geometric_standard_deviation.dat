5000|$|Corn, sorghum, {{wheat and}} barley {{are the most}} used cereals in the {{preparation}} of feed for the livestock, poultry, swine, and fish industry. Roller and hammer mills are the two types of processing equipment generally used to grind grains into smaller particle sizes. Milling cereal grains by mechanical action involves several forces like compression, shearing, crushing, cutting, friction and collision. The particle size of the ground cereal is very important in the animal feed production; smaller particle sizes increase the number of particles and the surface area per unit volume which increase access to digestive enzymes. Other benefits are increased ease of handling and easier mixing of ingredients. The average particle size is given as geometric mean diameter (GMD), expressed in mm or microns (µm) and the range of variation is described by <b>geometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (GSD), with a larger GSD representing lower uniformity. According to , GMD and GSD are accurate descriptors of particle size distribution when the particle size distribution is expressed as log data, and are distributed log normally. Studies have shown that grinding different grains with the same mill under similar conditions results in products with different particle sizes. The hardness of a grain sample is related to the percentage of fine particles obtained after grinding, with a higher percentage of fine particles from lower hardness grains. [...] discussed that hard endosperm produces irregularly-shaped larger particles, while soft endosperm produces smaller size particles. The correlation between particle size and energy consumed is although not positive but, to obtain very fine particle sizes require higher energy which reduces the rate of production. Moreover, a very fine grind of grain has no impact on the efficiency of pelleting, nor on the power consumed during pelleting. [...] discussed the availability of more data suggesting grain particle sizes are very important in mashed diets than in pelleted diets.|$|E

This paper presents the preliminary measurement results obtained in 43 schools of 5 municipalities in the Republic of Macedonia. The time-integrated radon and thoron gas concentrations were measured by CR- 39 (placed in two chambers with different diffusion barrier), whereas the radon progeny and thoron progeny concentration (EECR and EECT) were measured by LR- 115 nuclear track detectors based Direct Progeny Sensors (DTPS and DRPS). The detectors were deployed at least 0. 5 m distance away from the walls as well as away from windows and doors, in order to minimize the thoron concentration variations, and exposed over three-month period (March–May 2012). The geometric mean values (and <b>geometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations)</b> of radon and thoron concentrations, EERC and EETC were: 76 Bq/m 3 (1. 7), 12 Bq/m 3 (2. 3), 27 Bq/m 3 (1. 4), 0. 75 Bq/m 3 (2. 5), respectively. Equilibrium factors between radon and its progeny (FRn) and thoron and its progeny (FTn) were evaluated: FRn ranges from 0. 10 to 0. 84 and FTn ranges from 0. 003 to 0. 998 with geometric means (and <b>geometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations)</b> equal to 0. 36 (1. 71) and 0. 07 (3. 42), respectively.

Methods: Using headspace gas chromatography, 18 {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) emission concentrations were quantified over eight temperatures (120 – 315 C) for paving asphalt (n 5 20) and Types II, III, and IV BURA (n 5 5) and were summarized by geometric means (GMs) and <b>geometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> (GSDs) at each temperature.
