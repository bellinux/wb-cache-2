40|$|<b>Tall</b> alpine <b>herb</b> {{field is}} largely {{absent from the}} Tasmanian alpine zone. This absence has been {{attributed}} to marsupial grazing. Small islands in the upper Ouse River valley are partly dominated by Craspedia paludicola, a showy <b>tall</b> alpine <b>herb.</b> The herbs dominate on the upstream ends of the islands. The surrounding vegetation on the banks is mainly grassland. The <b>tall</b> <b>herbs</b> are a very minor element of the shore vegetation, occurring on the undercut banks. Grassy islands close to the river banks are grazed and few <b>tall</b> <b>herbs</b> are found there. Craspedia paludicola also occurs in small numbers in damp areas on grassy heaths at other grazed locations, largely within bushes with pungent leaves. The distribution of Craspedia paludicola suggests that it is highly palatable and can thus only survive in larger numbers away from the influence of vertebrate grazers (rabbits and marsupials). It appears that this species requires both disturbance and a lack of grazing to dominate an area...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis was to study plant {{community}} structure, especially {{in relation to}} vertebrate herbivory, in an altitudinal gradient in the Fennoscandian mountain chain. A sowing experiment in a high alpine Ranunculus glacialis population showed that seeds germinated better in cleared microsites than under established individuals. This is contrasted with a hypothesis that predicts positive plant-plant interactions in high alpine environments. It was concluded that plant-plant interactions in die studied population varied from neutral to negative, whereas no indications for positive interactions were found. An exclosure experiment in a snow-bed showed that a lemming population consumed 33 % of the available graminoids and 66 % of the mosses from August to June during a population peak. The results shows that grazing needs to {{be considered as a}} structuring factor in snow-bed vegetation. The vegetation in exclosures in another snow-bed changed from a graminoid-dominated to a herb-dominated plant community during a long-term (six years) experiment No changes of the same magnitude were seen in a <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> meadow on a lower altitude. Survival of transplanted adult shoots from the <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> meadow was equally high in the snow-bed as on the meadow, and germination was also high on bare ground in the snow-bed. Grazing seemed to be a more important structuring factor in the snow-bed than in the more productive <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> meadow. Raising the grazing pressure during one growing season by introducing microtine rodents into enclosures did not cause any large short-term effects on plant community structure in a tall hob meadow or in a snow-bed. Marked shoots showed that some preferred plant species had a high shoot mortality, but biomass for pooled categories of plants was not significantly affected. It was predicted that the <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> meadow would be more grazing sensitive than die snow-bed, but productivity on the meadow seemed to be sufficiently high for the plants to compensate for the grazing during the growing season. A greenhouse experiment showed that voles, when grazing freely, have the potential to deplete productive field layer vegetation contrary to predictions from plant defence theories. A nitrogen-based defence did not prevent heavy shoot mortality for toxic <b>tall</b> <b>herbs.</b> Diss.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{distribution}} of herbs, seedlings and vegetative propagules of woody species in a hardwood floodplain forest along the Upper Rhine in France revealed that the occurrence of most species is significantly correlated to elevation above river level and light transmission in summer.

40|$|Nettle {{grey alder}} forests are a {{dominant}} forest type on lowland swamps in the Bryansk Polesie. They are {{formed as a}} result of repeated cuttings in the place of <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forests. <b>Tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forests are very rare communities in the vegetation cover in this area due to clear cutting, melioration and peat extraction. An assessment of the succession status of <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forests and nettle grey alder forests was carried out in this paper. The criteria of climax state and succession state of communities, developed for Eastern European forests, were used. These criteria are based on the degree of intensity of the following signs in the community: 1) the completeness of species composition of tree synusia; 2) the ontogenetic structure of tree species cenopopulation; 3) the gap-mosaic stand structure; 4) the diversity of microsites in soil cover; 5) the completeness of species composition and ecological-coenotic diversity of vascular species. We showed that <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forest, as opposed to black alder forest, is close to communities of the climax type. This is evidenced by the following features of cenosis: firstly, all tree species in the area that covers the Bryansk Polesie and that are able to grow on lowland swamps are represented in the spruce forest (Alnus glutinosa, Betula pubescens, Fraxinus excelsior, Padus avium, Picea abies, Salix pentandra, Sorbus aucuparia, Ulmus glabra). Secondly, a steady turnover of generations is carried out in the cenopopulations of main edificators (Picea abies and Alnus glutinosa). This is evidenced by the complete and left-sided structure of their ontogenetic spectrum. Thirdly, a system of asynchronously developing gaps (parcels), which are formed on the site of old tree falls, is formed in the community. This ensures the continuous renewal of spruce and alder populations and creates conditions for the regeneration of other tree species. Fourthly, the structure of biogenic microsites has been formed in the soil cover: fallen logs, treefall pits and mounds, sedge tussocks, tree hummocks and substrate composed of the surface tree roots. These microsites determine the stable existence of species of contrasting ecological-cenotic species groups (from water-marsh and nitrophilous groups to wet-meadow, nemoral and boreal groups) in the community. Finally, thanks to the well-developed treefall gap structure and system of microsites, the parameters of the species and ecology-cenotic diversity of <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forests are maximal among all forest types in the lowland swamp of the Bryansk Polesie. All this suggests that <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forests are the climax (final) stage in the development of black alder forests in lowland swamps within the areas of Picea abies and Alnus glutinosa. We showed that the derivative nettle black alder forest, in contrast to the <b>tall</b> <b>herb</b> spruce forest, is in the first stages of restoration. This is indicated by the following signs: firstly, in the black alder forests, not all tree species that can grow on the lowland swamps of the Bryansk Polesie are present. This is often {{due to the fact that}} seed sources (generative trees) are absent in the immediate surroundings. Secondly, there is no normal turnover of generations in the cenopopulations of all tree species. Thirdly, a treefall gap structure (parcel mosaic) is not formed in the communities, which is necessary for the stable turnover of generations in tree populations. Fourthly, the system of biogenic microsite is not developed in the soil cover. Because of this, the composition of the ground cover is limited mainly by plant species of the water-marsh and the nitrophilous groups that are tolerant to the swampy substrate. Fifthly, black alder is distinguished by relatively low indicators of species richness and ecological-coenotic diversity. This is due to the undeveloped mosaic of parcels and microsites. It should be emphasised that the low age of felling (60 – 70 years) is the main reason for the «eternal» succession youth of black alder forests. Felling does not allow the community to reach the final stages of succession with the maximum structural, species and ecological-cenotic diversity...|$|R

40|$|In the literature, {{contrasting}} {{effects of}} plant species richness {{on the soil}} water balance are reported. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effects of plant species and functional richness and functional identity on soil water contents and water fluxes in the experimental grassland of the Jena Experiment. The Jena Experiment comprises 86 plots on which plant species richness (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 60) and functional group composition (zero to four functional groups: legumes, grasses, <b>tall</b> <b>herbs,</b> and small herbs) were manipulated in a factorial design. We recorded meteorological data and soil water contents of the 0 · 0 – 0 · 3 and 0 · 3 – 0 · 7 [*]m soil layers and calculated actual evapotranspiration (ETa), downward flux (DF), and capillary rise with a soil water balance model for the period 2003 – 2007. Missing water contents were estimated with a Bayesian hierarchical model. Species richness decreased water contents in subsoil during wet soil conditions. Presence of <b>tall</b> <b>herbs</b> increased soil water contents in topsoil during dry conditions and decreased soil water contents in subsoil during wet conditions. Presence of grasses generally decreased water contents in topsoil, particularly during dry phases; increased ETa and decreased DF from topsoil; and decreased ETa from subsoil. Presence of legumes, in contrast, decreased ETa and increased DF from topsoil and increased ETa from subsoil. Species richness probably resulted in complementary water use. Specific functional groups likely affected the water balance via specific root traits (e. g. shallow dense roots of grasses and deep taproots of <b>tall</b> <b>herbs)</b> or specific shading intensity caused by functional group effects on vegetation cover.

40|$|Some {{species and}} genera of <b>tall</b> <b>herbs</b> that are {{widespread}} both in Tasmanian and in mainland Australian alpine vegetation are dominant or codominant over large {{areas in the}} Australian Alps, while being typically subordinate species in Tasmania. This difference {{has been attributed to}} the impact of vertebrate herbivores, which are abundant in the Tasmanian high country but rare in or absent from the higher altitudes in the Australian Alps. The present study tests the hypothesis that lack of dominance (> 50 % cover) of <b>tall</b> alpine <b>herbs</b> in Tasmanian alpine and subalpine areas could be at least partially caused by grazing of their reproductive parts. Both in experimental plots and a clipping experiment, <b>tall</b> <b>herbs</b> produced more flowering stems under lower grazing/clipping pressure. In the field, the greatest reduction in flowering occurred under a grazing regime of sheep plus rabbits plus native herbivores. There was no consistent difference in the number of flowering stems between rabbit-grazed and rabbit plus native-grazed areas. However, there was a significant negative relationship between the number of flower heads and wallaby scats and a non-significant positive relationship between the number of flower heads and rabbit scats, suggesting that wallabies, not rabbits, were largely responsible for flower head depletion. Many species had more flowering stems in rabbit plus native vertebrate-grazed areas than in ungrazed exclosures. Therefore, it seems possible that the effects of vertebrate herbivory on flowering {{may have contributed to the}} lack of tall alpine herbfields in Tasmania...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{and soil}} {{nitrogen}} isotope ratios (∂ 15 N) were studied in experimental grassland plots of varying species richness. We hypothesized that partitioning of different sources of soil nitrogen among four plant functional groups (legumes, grasses, small <b>herbs,</b> <b>tall</b> <b>herbs)</b> should increase with diversity. Four years after sowing, all soils were depleted in 15 N {{in the top}} 5 cm whereas in non-legume plots soils were enriched in 15 N at 5 – 25 cm depth. Decreasing foliar ∂ 15 N and D∂ 15 N (= foliar ∂ 15 N - soil ∂ 15 N) values in legumes indicated increasing symbiotic N 2 fixation with increasing diversity. In grasses, foliar Δ∂ 15 N also decreased with increasing diversity suggesting enhanced uptake of N depleted in 15 N. Foliar Δ∂ 15 N values of small and <b>tall</b> <b>herbs</b> were unaffected by diversity. Foliar Δ∂ 15 N values of grasses were also reduced in plots containing legumes, indicating direct use of legume-derived N depleted in 15 N. Increased foliar N concentrations of <b>tall</b> and small <b>herbs</b> in plots containing legumes without reduced foliar ∂ 15 N indicated that these species obtained additional mineral soil N that was not consumed by legumes. These functional group and species specific shifts in the uptake of different N sources with increasing diversity indicate complementary resource use in diverse communities...|$|R
