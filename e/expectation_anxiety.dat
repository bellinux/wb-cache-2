Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any {{place over the}} Downs beyond, too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names--for {{he had never heard}} of any--dropping them furtively {{at the sight of a}} stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple vetches in the hedges, meadowsweet, honeysuckle, belated brambles--but the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries, stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white dead nettles, traveller's-joy, clinging bedstraw, grasses flowering, white campions, and ragged robins. One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings--those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust--and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude, smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone of <b>expectation,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and something like regret that would not be ignored.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of passion}} and more {{generally}} irrational elements in processing knowledge are discussed. This {{seems to be a}} paradox, as science by definition is beyond passion. At the same time science is the expression of a culture. This paradox is examined through the experience and work of crucial figures in physics such as Newton and Einstein. Science is a dialogue between man and nature: part of the search for the transcendental which is common to many cultural activities: art, music, literature. Our time is one of <b>expectation,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and bifurcation.

40|$|Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} disorder characterised by excessive worry (apprehensive <b>expectation),</b> <b>anxiety</b> and somatic symptoms. Unfortunately, because the diagnosis of GAD is poorly recognized, general practitioners and mental healthcare professionals do not exactly {{be aware of the}} presenting symptoms. The disorder is associated with high subjective impairment and high social cost. Consequently, unrecognized GAD results in intensive use of unnecessary and costly healthcare facilities for a long time. GAD can be considered as a gateway disorder that, if not recognized and treated in time, may lead to the development of other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, addictive disorders and also to psychosis. Because of its importance as a predisposing factor for the development of other psychopathology, GAD requires more consideration from a clinical point of view. In this regard, several evidence suggested that GAD is best conceptualized as dimensional construct and in light of this, a dimensional approach to generalized anxiety disorder has important implications for conceptual models, assessment and treatment...|$|E

In line with this interpretation, high-trait anxious individuals performing moderately arousing tasks were expected to manifest a reduced responding to distractors, since this is an adaptive outcome. High- and low-trait anxious participants had to perform a visual search task in a low-stress context. Unrelated neutral and emotional auditory words served as distractors. As a control, neutral and emotional words were also delivered in a no task condition. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) were greater during the task than during the control phase, but in the high anxious group, this increase in SCRs was smaller following emotional distractors than following neutral ones. Moreover, SCRs to both types of words habituated, but the results suggested that only the low-trait anxious participants presented the classical slowing of SCRs habituation when performing the task. All these data are interpreted as an illustration of a resource-based electrodermal inhibition in the high-trait anxious participants.

40|$|Although placebos {{have long}} been {{considered}} a nuisance in clinical research, today they represent an active and productive field of research and, because of the involvement of many mechanisms, {{the study of the}} placebo effect can actually be viewed as a melting pot of concepts and ideas for neuroscience. Indeed, there exists not a single but many placebo effects, with different mechanisms and in different systems, medical conditions, and therapeutic interventions. For example, brain mechanisms of <b>expectation,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and reward are all involved, as well as a variety of learning phenomena, such as Pavlovian conditioning, cognitive, and social learning. There is also some experimental evidence of different genetic variants in placebo responsiveness. The most productive models to better understand the neurobiology of the placebo effect are pain and Parkinson's disease. In these medical conditions, the neural networks that are involved have been identified: that is, the opioidergic–cholecystokinergic–dopaminergic modulatory network in pain and part of the basal ganglia circuitry in Parkinson's disease. Important clinical implications emerge from these recent advances in placebo research. First, as the placebo effect is basically a psychosocial context effect, these data indicate that different social stimuli, such as words and rituals of the therapeutic act, may change the chemistry and circuitry of the patient's brain. Second, the mechanisms that are activated by placebos are the same as those activated by drugs, which suggests a cognitive/affective interference with drug action. Third, if prefrontal functioning is impaired, placebo responses are reduced or totally lacking, as occurs in dementia of the Alzheimer's type...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that those with insecure attachments (characterised by anxiety, avoidance or both; Hazan & Shaver, 1994), would engage in less effective communication on sexual matters, which would in turn predict lower sexual satisfaction.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the patients' life adjustment after epilepsy surgery, through instruments of quality of life (QoL), <b>anxiety,</b> depression, preoperative <b>expectations</b> and postoperative life changing. Methods: Thirty-six adults who underwent temporal lobe epilepsy surgery were interviewed before surgery, and 6 and 12 months after surgery. Results: For all patients, epilepsy surgery gave rise to an evolving process of postoperative adjustment, what means that they were satisfied with surgery results, and that their expectations were reached. The improvement was seen in their QoL (p= 0. 004), anxiety (p= 0. 019) and depression (p= 0. 001), which was associated to their perception of positive life changing. The inexistence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the good QoL after surgery predicted the perception of positive life changing. This study could predict a total of 56. 5 % of aspects involved in the perception of positive life changing after epilepsy surgery, what seems that other variables may be involved in this process. The patients' status before surgery (<b>expectations,</b> QoL, <b>anxiety,</b> depression and seizures frequency) did not predict the life satisfaction after surgery, what means that when patients evaluate their actual lives they do it looking for daily aspects and do not tend to compare to their lives before surgery. Conclusion: The findings of the present study have implications for the evaluation of life adjustment postsurgery, calling attention to measures of preoperative <b>expectations,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> depression and QoL. The strength of these contributions highlights the importance of registering the patients' feelings and opinions during the presurgical evaluation and may help the health providers to understand the aspects necessary to improve the patients' quality of life...|$|R

In 2008 - 09, 1, 098 Mexican origin youth (553 girls and 546 boys, mean age 14. 3 years [SD= 1. 04]) provided data on smoking behavior, physical activity, alcohol use, acculturation, peer and parental smoking, BMI, body im-age, smoking outcome <b>expectations,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> subjective social status (SSS), body image, and sensation-seeking tendencies.

Confidence, <b>expectations,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and general health were rated. Analyses were performed with mixed linear regression. Results: Financial problems were reported for 16 residents (42. 1 %). At baseline, most residents had moderate-to-very high confidence, expectations, and general health but also moderate-to-very high anxiety. The health-related quality of life score was highest in the social domain followed by the environmental, psychological, and physical domains. Their psychological, physical, social, and environmental scores significantly decreased after enrollment. Their happiness and general health scores were significantly reduced after enrollment. The training program duration was negatively associated with all domains.

40|$|Aim. This paper {{reports on}} a study {{examining}} the relationship between women's psychological characteristics and breastfeeding duration, after controlling for socio-demographic factors. Background. The literature suggests that psychological factors may influence breastfeeding behaviour, but studies are few. Existing evidence {{and the results of}} phase 1 of our study were used to construct a list of psychological factors, which were tested for their association with breastfeeding duration in the current design. Method. Participants were postnatal inpatients in one of two regional hospitals between October and December 2005 and they completed the initial questionnaire within 14 days of giving birth (n = 375). Infant feeding method at 6 months and the timing of introduction of other food(s), where relevant, were ascertained by telephone interview. Findings. Forty-four per cent of the sample showed signs of postnatal distress in the 14 days following the birth. Breastfeeding duration was statistically significantly associated with psychological factors including dispositional optimism, breastfeeding self-efficacy, faith in breastmilk, breastfeeding <b>expectations,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> planned duration of breastfeeding and the time of the infant feeding decision. As a set, these psychological factors were more predictive of breastfeeding duration than was the set of socio-demographic characteristics. The duration of any breastfeeding was uniquely predicted by faith in breastmilk, planned breastfeeding duration and breastfeeding self-efficacy. Conclusion. This increased knowledge of the factors influencing breastfeeding will assist in identifying women at risk of early weaning and in constructing programmes capable of increasing the length of time for which women breastfeed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} to explore the <b>expectations,</b> <b>anxieties</b> and emotional impact of eight women having their first child after the age of 37 years. The design used semi-structured interviews to collect data in two phases. The first were conducled when participants were in their third trimester of pregnancy (26 + wecks). The second phase was conducted four to six months post-birth. The rationale for the study was that despite the continuing trend for delayed motherhood (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2002), research on the experience of 2 ̆ 7 late 2 ̆ 7 motherhood is extremely limited. Women are choosing to delay motherhood for many reasons, including the need to feel emotionally prepared, finding the right partner, or after years of career success and having achieved financial stability. However, the 2 ̆ 7 biological clock 2 ̆ 7 may compel women to have a child simply because timc is running out. Rapid advanccs in fertility treatment and improved levels of obstetric care have extended the opportunities for childbearing, to the extent that women are having babies up to the time of menopause, which commonly begins in the late forties (Sowers, 2000). Risks associated with 2 ̆ 7 late 2 ̆ 7 babies include hypertension (Mirowsky); anxiety (Windridge 2 ̆ 6 Benyman, 1999), and foetal abnormality (Benke, Carver, 2 ̆ 6 Donahue, 1995). In addition, women may feel unprepared for motherhood or may experience ambivalence about their decision after many years of career development and settled lifestyle (Heckhausen, Wrosh, 2 ̆ 6 Fleeson, 200 I). 2 ̆ 7 Elderly primigravidae, 2 ̆ 7 as they are referred to, are deemed 2 ̆ 7 high risk 2 ̆ 7 by the medical profession (Mirowsky, 2002) therefore women may be expos cd to a 2 ̆ 7 culture of anxiety 2 ̆ 7 surrounding their choice to have a child at what is thc beginning of the midlife phase...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This research project is an interdisciplinary study, intersecting the humanities with the social sciences and incorporating aspects of discourse analysis, sociology, and women's studies into a unified project. The study is an empirical, qualitative investigation that primarily utilizes interviews and surveys to investigate the ways individuals communicate about feminism in both oral and written discourse. This study begins with an analysis of participants' anonymous responses to qualitative, written surveys that investigate their personal associations with and beliefs about feminism and feminists. These survey responses are unique because, instead of merely answering the survey questions in a precise and direct manner, as philosopher of language H. Paul Grice would expect, the respondents adapt the surveys to fit their own needs. Participants craft their responses in a way that gives them opportunities to express anxieties and assumptions about feminism, to disassociate themselves from the negative stereotypes of feminism, or to use the surveys as a forum to advocate feminist issues. Next, this study explores how individuals discuss feminism in group interviews that are structured as discussions. When discussing feminism in a research interview setting, individuals use their personal ideologies about feminism to formulate expectations of how the interaction will ensue and to determine how they should behave. The topic of the interview and the interview environment, itself, arouse <b>expectations,</b> <b>anxieties,</b> assumptions, and concerns in participants, and these factors complicate communication. In addition to determining how individuals discuss feminism in the artificial environments of these surveys and interviews, this project also explores feminist research methodology.

40|$|Strained {{breathing}} {{is a natural}} respiratory pattern, with cardiovascular implications. It is associated with social factors, attention, <b>expectation,</b> and <b>anxiety</b> and with defense behavior in animals. An inhibition of active behavior is characteristic. Strained {{breathing is}} based on the functional heterogeneity of the medullary postinspiratory neurons. In stressful circumstances, muscle tension and laryngeal reflexes induce a strong reduction of airflow in the glottis, resulting in a prolonged Stage I of expiration and an elevated intrathoracic pressure. The resulting elevations of blood pressure and CO 2 level further stimulate the strained breathing pattern. The straining factor intrathoracic pressure is an important psychophysiological parameter. Functional aspects of strained breathing may be an elevated brain perfusion and the prevention of hyperventilation. It induces blood pressure oscillations and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Frequent strained breathing may contribute to cardiovascular pathology and sleep apnea, creating a link between functional behavior and disease...|$|R
