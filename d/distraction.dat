30|$|Several <b>distractions</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} and incorporated inside the VR classroom. They were split into auditory <b>distractions</b> (sound of cars passing outside, and ambient classroom noise of children talking, pencil dropping and chairs moving) and visual <b>distractions</b> (construction worker entering and exiting the classroom, paper planes flying in the classroom, the fan rotating and a car passing outside) inspired by Rizzo et al. [19]. These <b>distractions</b> were not used in our experiments with the prototype system, since {{the aim of this}} pilot study was to prove that P 300 is indeed a measure of attention. By excluding <b>distractions</b> in our preliminary experiment, we were able to assume attention on all relevant stimuli. These <b>distractions</b> will be included in future training sessions on ADHD subjects.|$|R
40|$|To {{document}} drivers’ {{exposure to}} potential <b>distractions</b> {{and the effects}} of these <b>distractions</b> on driving performance, inconspicuous video camera units were mounted in the vehicles of 70 volunteer subjects. The camera units automatically recorded a closeup view of the driver’s face, a broader view of the interior of the vehicle, and the roadway immediately ahead of the vehicle whenever it was powered on. Three hours of randomly selected data per subject were coded based on a taxonomy of driver <b>distractions</b> (talking on cell phone, eating, tuning radio, etc.), contextual variables (whether vehicle stopped or moving, road type, traffic level, etc.) and observable measures of driver performance (eyes directed inside or outside vehicle, hands on or off steering wheel, and vehicle position in travel lane). Results were analyzed descriptively and using nonparametric bootstrap analysis techniques. The most common <b>distractions</b> in terms of overall event durations were eating and drinking (including preparations to eat or drink), <b>distractions</b> inside the vehicle (reaching or looking for an object, manipulating vehicle controls, etc.), and <b>distractions</b> outside the vehicle (often unidentified). Although many of the <b>distractions</b> were also associated with negative driving performance outcomes, {{further research is needed to}} clarify their impact on driving safety...|$|R

40|$|Two studies {{addressed}} {{how young}} adult college students with {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) (n = 44) compare to their nonaffected peers (n = 42) on tests of auditory and visual–spatial working memory (WM), are vulnerable to auditory and visual <b>distractions,</b> and are affected by a simple intervention. Students with ADHD demonstrated worse auditory WM than did controls. A near significant trend indicated that auditory <b>distractions</b> interfered with the visual WM of both groups and that, whereas controls were also vulnerable to visual <b>distractions,</b> visual <b>distractions</b> improved visualWM in the ADHD group. The intervention was ineffective. Limited correlations emerged between self-reported ADHD symptoms and objective test performances; students with ADHD who perceived themselves as more symptomatic often had better WM and were less vulnerable to <b>distractions</b> than their ADHD peers...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of appropriate lab-based evaluation techniques for mobile technologies requires continued research attention. In particular, experimental design needs {{to account for}} the environmental context in which such technologies will ultimately be used.

This chapter reflects on different techniques that were used in three separate lab-based mobile evaluation experiments to present visual <b>distractions</b> to participants and to measure the participants’ cognizance of the <b>distractions</b> during the course of mobile evaluations of technology. The different techniques met the different needs of the three studies with respect to the fidelity of the data captured, the impact of acknowledging <b>distractions</b> on the evaluation task, and the typical context of use for the technology being evaluated. The results of the studies showed that the introduction of visual <b>distractions</b> did {{have an impact on the}} experimental task and indicate that future work is required in this area...|$|R

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective <b>distraction</b> from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a <b>distraction</b> to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E

Effects of {{external}} <b>distractions</b> {{are not just}} limited to younger novice drivers, {{as is the case}} with in-vehicle <b>distractions.</b> Experienced drivers 2 ̆ 7 ability to maintain their attention on the forward roadway and their ability to anticipate hazards is also compromised in the presence of external <b>distractions.</b> This dissertation seeks to both understand the extent to which external-to-vehicle <b>distractions</b> affect driver safety and study the potential remedies for this problem. ^ Driver behaviors, specifically the ability to anticipate and respond to hazards in the presence of external-to-vehicle <b>distractions,</b> were evaluated for different age groups in a driving simulator. Drivers 2 ̆ 7 performance was evaluated on three categories of hazard anticipation scenarios; (a) top-down explicitly cued scenarios (drivers were cued before they encountered the external-to-vehicle task), (b) top-down implicitly cued scenarios (drivers were cued before they encountered the external-to-vehicle task) and (c) bottom-up cued scenarios (drivers were cued after they encountered the external-to-vehicle task). Eye movement information and vehicle parameters were collected and analyzed. Drivers of all age groups were significantly affected by the presence of external-to-vehicle <b>distractions</b> regardless of the type of cue: drivers took long glances at the external-to-vehicle task, did not scan the appropriate locations for risk relevant elements, and responded significantly slower to hazards in the presence of external-to-vehicle <b>distractions</b> (Experiments 1 and 2). ^ Training was considered as an intervention that could mitigate the effects of external <b>distractions.</b> As a start, the effect of a training program (FOCAL) that reduced the duration of in-vehicle glances on the duration of external-to-vehicle glances was evaluated in a simulator. The training was not effective in reducing the long duration of glances at the external task (Experiment 3). ^ This finding lead to the development of a PC-based attention maintenance training program, FOCAL-Ex, that specifically addressed the issue of external-to-vehicle <b>distractions.</b> The evaluation was done on a PC. The percentage of external-to-vehicle tasks in which trained drivers took especially long glances was significantly less than this percentage for placebo trained drivers (Experiment 4). ...|$|R
