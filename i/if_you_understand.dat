He prefers to call himself a [...] "music practitioner", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as {{he is capable of}} many styles, such as Japanese pop, which he has written along with Jeff Miyahara. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> the structure. He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for [...] "ambitious" [...] games by people with [...] "new ideas".|$|E

2500|$|Tennessee Williams {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} and based {{the character of}} Serafina on Magnani, as Williams was a great admirer of her acting abilities, and he even stipulated that the movie [...] "must star what Time described as 'the most explosive emotional actress of her generation, Anna Magnani." [...] In his Memoirs, Williams described why he insisted on Magnani playing this role:"Anna Magnani was magnificent as Serafina in the movie version of Tattoo.... She was as unconventional a woman as I have known {{in or out of}} my professional world, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> me at all, you must know that in this statement I am making my personal estimate of her honesty, which I feel was complete. She never exhibited any lack of self-assurance, any timidity in her relations with that society outside of whose conventions she quite publicly existed.... he looked absolutely straight into the eyes of whomever she confronted and during that golden time in which we were dear friends, I never heard a false word from her mouth." ...|$|E

The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, [...] "If you look at other suppliers' ability to differentiate, there's very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> what the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it's all about getting stuff done. Games, media, we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game. Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can't do it on a me-too approach." [...] Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear remarked [...] "We want to regain our position as the number one in the world", while Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben proclaimed [...] "It could be the greatest comeback in tech history.
