An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was plagued}} by a few issues during the 2009 season. Most notable were the poor free-throw and 3-point {{shooting}} percentages. Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 {{in both of these}} categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively. Despite their poor performance shooting from beyond the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10.

5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932.

Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E

5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in supervisory roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track, {{to give them an}} understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a remedial education program <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, as well as in engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers.|$|E

5|$|At 2am on March 10, 1975, the North Vietnamese army {{began their}} assault on South Vietnamese forces at Ban Me Thuot. The North Vietnamese 198th Special Forces Regiment spearheaded the attack by hitting the Hoa Binh Airfield, the {{district}} of Mai Hac De, and {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial North Vietnamese attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th Special Forces Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed the North Vietnamese only wanted to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak. By 3:30am, the 4th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Hoa Binh airport, and they waited there <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> infantry and tank units to arrive.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2009–10 season, Djurgården participated in the Nordic Trophy pre-season tournament. In the second game, Josefson scored a hat trick and added two assists against the Malmö Redhawks. At the end of the group stage, Josefson was the scoring leader with five goals and seven points. He scored his first points <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, three assists, in the Elitserien premiere away against HV71. Djurgården lost the game 7–6, but on 20 October, Josefson would get his revenge when he scored the game-winning goal in the 3–2 victory over HV71 20. This was also his first goal of the regular season. Josefson missed six Elitserien games due to the World Junior Hockey Championship, but was back in the roster against Timrå IK on 9 January. He recorded an assist against Rögle BK on 30 January, which was his 17th point of the season, putting him ahead of last season's total. At the end of the regular season, Josefson had scored 8 goals and 20 points in 43 games. The 2009–10 playoffs were Josefson's first Elitserien playoffs, and he played almost every game missing the first two semifinal games against Linköpings HC due to illness. Djurgården lost the finals 4–2 to HV71. Josefson re-signed with Djurgården for another year on 27 April. Despite this and an oral guarantee the club received from Josefson's agent Peter Wallén that Josefson would stay, Josefson signed with the New Jersey Devils on 14 May 2010.|$|E

5|$|Dean Clark {{took over}} as head coach shortly after James' resignation, and led the 1997–98 Hitmen to a {{remarkable}} turnaround. The team improved to a 40–28–4 record and first-place finish in the Central Division, qualifying for {{the playoffs for the}} first time in franchise history. They defeated the Saskatoon Blades and Swift Current Broncos to reach the Eastern Conference final before falling to the Brandon Wheat Kings. Clark was awarded the Dunc McCallum Memorial Trophy as the WHL's top coach, and also won the Canadian Hockey League's Brian Kilrea Coach of the Year Award. Calgary improved to 51–13–8 in 1998–99, finishing one point ahead of the Kamloops Blazers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season title. Led by Brad Moran, Pavel Brendl and goaltender Alexandre Fomitchev, the Hitmen lost just five games in the playoffs en route to their first league championship. They won the title at home before a WHL playoff record crowd of 17,139. They became the first Calgary-based team to qualify for the Memorial Cup since the Calgary Canadians won the 1926 title.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 2007, Bosh {{became the}} new {{franchise}} record holder for double doubles {{in a home}} win against the Miami Heat. He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week {{for the third time}} in his career shortly after, having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records. As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who left had Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net. Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91. The Raptors won Game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced Game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in Game 5. The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in Game 6. Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, 2002–03, saw the Avalanche {{claim the}} NHL {{record for most}} consecutive division titles, nine, breaking the Montreal Canadiens streak of eight, won between 1974–82. The division title came after a bad start by the team, {{that led to the}} exit of head coach Bob Hartley, in December. General Manager Pierre Lacroix promoted assistant coach Tony Granato, who had only three months of coaching experience as an assistant, to the head coach position. The team's playoff spot seemed in doubt at one point, but the Avalanche managed to finish with 105 points, ahead of the Vancouver Canucks by one. The race to the title was exciting, namely the second-to-last game of the season, as the Avalanche needed to win the game to stay in the race, and Milan Hejduk scored with 10 seconds left in overtime to beat Anaheim. The title was guaranteed in {{the final day of the}} regular season, when the Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 5–2 and the Vancouver Canucks lost against the Los Angeles Kings 2–0. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, the Avalanche blew a 3–1 series lead over the Minnesota Wild, and lost in overtime in Game 7. Peter Forsberg won the Art Ross Trophy for the leading scorer of the regular season, which he finished with 106 points (29 goals, 77 assists). Forsberg also won the Hart Memorial Trophy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> season's most valuable player and shared the NHL Plus/Minus Award with teammate Milan Hejduk. Hejduk scored 50 goals to win the Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the NHL. Forsberg was elected to the league's first All-Star team. Hejduk was elected to the second All-Star team.|$|E
