40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of an 8 -week whole-body {{vibration}} training program in various <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> amplitude settings under the same acceleration on the strength and power of the knee extensors. Methods: Sixty-four young participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups with the same acceleration (4 [*]g) : high <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> low amplitude (n[*]=[*] 16, 32 [*]Hz, 1 [*]mm) group, medium <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> medium amplitude (n[*]=[*] 16, 18 [*]Hz, 3 [*]mm) group, low <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> high amplitude (n[*]=[*] 16, 3 [*]Hz, 114 [*]mm) group, and control (n[*]=[*] 16, no vibration) group. All participants underwent 8 weeks of training with body mass dynamic squats, 3 sessions a week. Results: The results showed that the high <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> low amplitude group increased significantly in isometric contraction strength and 120 °/s isokinetic concentric contraction strength; the medium <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> medium amplitude group increased significantly in 60 °/s and 120 °/s isokinetic strength of both concentric and eccentric contraction; <b>and</b> the low <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> high amplitude group increased significantly in 60 °/s and 120 °/s isokinetic eccentric contraction strength.

40|$|Relationships between <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> {{intensity}} of volcanic eruptions are actively sought by geophysicists for both monitoring and research purposes. By analyzing surveillance videos of persistent volcanic activity at Stromboli (Italy), we derived the <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> jet height of > 4000 explosions {{that occurred in}} 72 h-long time windows sampled yearly from 2005 to 2009. We found a positive relationship linking explosion <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> jet height (linked to eruption intensity) when averaging the two parameters over time intervals from hours to days, with a stronger correlation for longer intervals. We interpret this behavior as {{the response of the}} magmatic system to variable influx of magma and gas at depth, increased flux at depth causing more frequent and stronger explosions at the surface. This relationship entails concurrent control of source processes over explosion <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> intensity, directly impacting modeling of explosion sources at persistently active volcanoes in general and hazard assessment at Stromboli in particular.

5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high heterozygosity or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to heterozygosity selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization <b>frequencies</b> <b>and</b> the overall heterozygosity of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{can hear}} {{both in the}} air and below water. They do not have {{external}} ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high <b>frequencies</b> <b>and</b> the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible <b>frequencies</b> <b>and</b> help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.|$|E

5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two <b>frequencies,</b> <b>and</b> the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase drifts are {{a common}} problem in the {{acquisition}} of in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data. If not accounted for, <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase drifts will result in artifactual broadening of spectral peaks, distortion of spectral lineshapes, {{and a reduction in}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present herein a new method for estimating <b>and</b> correcting <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase drifts in in vivo MRS data. METHODS: We used a simple method of fitting each spectral average to a reference scan (often the first average in the series) in the time domain through adjustment of <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase terms. Due to the similarity with image registration, this method is referred to as "spectral registration. " Using simulated data with known <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase drifts, the performance of spectral registration was compared with two existing methods at various SNR levels. RESULTS: Spectral registration performed well in comparison with the other methods tested in terms of both <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase drift estimation. CONCLUSIONS: Spectral registration provides an effective method for <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> phase drift correction. It does not involve the collection of navigator echoes, and does not rely on any specific resonances, such as residual water or creatine, making it highly versatile.
