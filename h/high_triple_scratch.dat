40|$|International audienceThis work {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} grains' interaction on the material removal volume and damage development when glass finishing. The abrasive grains of grinding tool are locally modelled by three sharp tips. The material removal process is hence investigated with respect of the distance separating the indenters. Single Scratch Test (SST) and <b>Triple</b> <b>Scratch</b> Test (TST) are basically conducted. The experimental tests used four speeds and five separation distances ranging, respectively, in 16 - 64 m. min- 1 and 100 - 800 μ m. The depth of cut is however kept constant to 0. 1 mm. The experimental set-up uses a Kistler piezoelectric dynamometer for in-situ force acquirements. Profilometer and optical microscopy are also used to investigate groove characteristics (depth, width and material removed volume). The experimental findings showed that for a given separation distance, there exists a critical speed for which the interaction reaches a threshold point. There is also a critical separation distance where full interaction occurs and the material removal volume is maximum. In TST, cracks induced by the neighbouring scratches may intersect {{with each other to}} leading to an extensive chipping. The results demonstrated that the cumulative interaction between grains is profitable for the material removal process only whether the separation distance between abrasive grains is well controlled...|$|R

50|$|An {{enduring}} {{feature of}} the Challenge was {{the establishment of a}} point system to determine which horse had the <b>highest</b> combined <b>Triple</b> Crown total finish. Points were awarded equally in all three Triple Crown races. Ten points were earned by a win.

The horse that earned the highest number of points and started in all three races was awarded the million dollars. See table below for <b>Highest</b> combined <b>Triple</b> Crown finish in each year since 1987. The $1,000,000 bonus was discontinued after seven years.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop the}} information-theoretical {{concepts}} required {{to study the}} statistical dependencies among three variables. Some of such dependencies are pure triple interactions, {{in the sense that}} they cannot be explained in terms of a combination of pairwise correlations. We derive bounds for triple dependencies, and characterize the shape of the joint probability distribution of three binary variables with <b>high</b> <b>triple</b> interaction. The analysis also allows us to quantify the amount of redundancy in the mutual information between pairs of variables, and to assess whether the information between two variables is or is not mediated by a third variable. These concepts are applied to the analysis of written texts. We find that the probability that a given word is found in a particular location within the text is not only modulated by the presence or absence of other nearby words, but also, on the presence or absence of nearby pairs of words. We identify the words enclosing the key semantic concepts of the text, the triplets of words with <b>high</b> pairwise and <b>triple</b> interactions, and the words that mediate the pairwise interactions between other words...|$|R
