50|$|<b>Embutramide</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand name Embutane) is {{a potent}} opioid {{analgesic}} and sedative drug that is structurally related to methadone. It was developed by Hoechst A.G. in 1958 and was investigated as a general anesthetic agent, but {{was found to have}} a very narrow therapeutic window, with a 50 mg/kg dose producing effective sedation and a 75 mg/kg dose being fatal. Along with strong sedative effects, <b>embutramide</b> also produces respiratory depression and ventricular arrhythmia. Because of these properties, it was never adopted for medical use as an anesthetic as it was considered too dangerous for this purpose. Instead it is used for euthanasia in veterinary medicine, mainly for the euthanization of dogs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Embutramide</b> is {{used for}} {{euthanasia}} {{of a range of}} different animals, mainly small animals kept as pets rather than large farm animals. It may cause significant pain to the animal being euthanized, and so may be less humane than older drugs used for this purpose such as pentobarbital, however it may have less abuse potential than barbiturates especially in the Tributame combination formulation, and so is less likely to be diverted for recreational abuse. <b>Embutramide</b> has however been reported to be used for suicide by people with access to the drug, and was added to the list of Schedule III drugs in the USA in 2006, as a Non-Narcotic with ACSCN 2020, which classifies it with depressants such as benzodiazepines, barbitutates, and other sedative-hypnotics.|$|E

40|$|Tanax is a {{veterinary}} formulation for euthanasia comprising embu-tramide, {{mebezonium iodide}} and tetracaine. A 37 -year-old female {{was found dead}} on her bed, with three empty used syringes {{and a bottle of}} Tanax beside her body. Three needle puncture marks were observed on the body. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the distribution of <b>embutramide</b> and mebezonium iodide in different biological matrices (femoral and cardiac blood, liver, muscle and vitreous humor) using a chromatographic method for the simultan-eous determination of the two drugs. A direct and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method was devel-oped in multiple reaction monitoring mode with positive ionization. Lidocaine was used as an internal standard. Limits of detection and quantitation of 0. 01 and 0. 05 mg/L, respectively, were reached for both compounds. <b>Embutramide</b> levels ranged from 2. 74 mg/L in vit-reous humor to 5. 06 mg/L in femoral blood, while mebezonium iodide was found at widely differing concentrations (ranging from 2. 80 mg/kg in muscle to 24. 80 mg/kg in liver). The chromatograph-ic method developed for this study provides a very simple and sen-sitive means for the simultaneous determination of <b>embutramide</b> and mebezonium iodide, the emetic concentrations of which were consistent with suicides reported in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds pose {{an analytical}} challenge. Mebezonium, a muscle-relaxing agent contained in veterinary euthanasia solution T 61, was analyzed in body fluids, organs, and injection sites of a veterinarian by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS–MS) method. Additionally, <b>embutramide</b> and tetracaine, which {{are two other}} active ingredients contained in T 61, methadone, xylazine, and analgesics were detected by LC–MS–MS and high-performance liquid chromatography–ultraviolet detection methods. For detection of mebezonium a solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with ion-pairing reagent heptafluorobutyric acid was developed. Separation was achieved on Phenomenex Synergi Hydro RP C 18 column combined with ammonium formate buffer and acetonitrile (pH 3. 5). To enrich other drugs, liquid–liquid extraction procedures were used. Most of these drugs were separated on a Restek Allure PFP Propyl column using the mentioned mobile phase. Mebezonium and <b>embutramide</b> were detected in femoral vein serum in concentrations of 10. 9 and 2. 0 mg/L, respectively. The concentration of xylazine and methadone in serum was 2. 0 and 0. 4 mg/L, respectively. The LC–MS–MS method with SPE combined with an ion-pairing reagent allowed the quantitation of mebezonium. Methadone was detected in toxic concentrations and was, in combination with xylazine and T 61, {{considered to be the}} cause of death...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{veterinary}} euthanasia drug containing <b>embutramide,</b> mebezonium, tetracaine, and dimethylformamide (DMF; T- 61 ® or Tanax®) {{may cause}} serious manifestations or even fatalities after self-poisoning. Immediate toxicity is mainly {{due to a}} general anesthetic and due to a neuromuscular blocking agent, while delayed hepatotoxicity seems related to the solvent DMF. The protective role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration remains debatable. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two male veterinarians (50 - and 44 -year-old) attempted suicide by injecting T- 61 in the precordial area for the first one, and by ingesting 50 mL for the second. Both received NAC (for 14 days {{in the first case}} and only for 20 h in the second). Urine was collected for the serial determination of DMF, N-methylformamide (NMF), and N-acetyl-S-(N-methylcarbamoyl) cysteine (AMCC). RESULTS: Both patients developed only mild signs of liver injury. The metabolite of DMF, NMF, appeared rapidly in the urine, while a further delay was necessary for AMCC excretion. The kinetics of elimination of DMF and DMF metabolites were slightly slower than those reported in exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: While both patients had a favorable outcome, there is no clear evidence that NAC could directly influence NMF and AMCC excretion. Further investigations of NMF and AMCC excretion, with and without NAC, would be indicated...|$|E
40|$|Thirty Meleagris gallopavo {{heads with}} their neck {{segments}} were used. Animals were contained and euthanized with {{the association of}} mebezonium iodide, <b>embutramide</b> and tetracaine hydrochloride (T 61, Intervet) by intravenous injection. The arterial system was rinsed with cold saline solution (15 °C), with 5000 IU heparin and filled with red-colored latex. The samples were fixed in 20 % formaldehyde for seven days. The brains were removed with a segment of cervical spinal cord and after, the dura-mater was removed and the arteries dissected. The cerebral carotid arteries, after the intercarotid anastomosis, were projected around the hypophysis, {{until they reached the}} tuber cinereum and divided into their terminal branches, the caudal branch and the rostral branch. The rostral branch was projected rostrolateralwards and gave off, in sequence, two collateral branches, the caudal cerebral and the middle cerebral arteries and the terminal branch was as cerebroethmoidal artery. The caudal cerebral artery of one antimere formed the interhemispheric artery, which gave off dorsal hemispheric branches to the convex surface of both antimeres. Its dorsal tectal mesencephalic branch, of only one antimere, originated the dorsal cerebellar artery. In the interior of the cerebral transverse fissure, after the origin of the dorsal tectal mesencephalic artery, the caudal cerebral artery emitted occipital hemispheric branches, pineal branches and medial hemispheric branches, on both antimeres. The caudal cerebral artery's territory comprehended the entire surface of the dorsal hemioptic lobe, the rostral surface of the cerebellum, the diencephalic structures, the caudal pole and the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and in the convex surface, the sagittal eminence except for its most rostral third. Due to the asymmetry found in the caudal cerebral arteries' ramifications, the models were classified into three types and their respective subtypes...|$|E
