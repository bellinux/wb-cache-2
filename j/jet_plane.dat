500|$|Burtt saw a hand-cranked {{electrical}} generator while watching Island in the Sky, and bought an identical, unpacked device from 1950 on eBay {{to use for}} WALL-E moving around. Burtt also used an automobile self starter for when WALL-E goes fast, {{and the sound of}} cars being wrecked at a demolition derby provided for WALL-E's compressing trash in his body.

Burtt was only able to provide neutral or masculine voices, so Pixar employee Elissa Knight was asked to provide her voice for Burtt to electronically modify. Stanton deemed the sound effect good enough to properly cast her in the role. Burtt recorded a flying [...] radio-controlled <b>jet</b> <b>plane</b> for EVE's flying, and for her plasma cannon, Burtt hit a slinky hung from a ladder with a timpani stick.

500|$|The {{first night}} landing {{was made on}} 8 December 1965. The DC-4 took off from the new Tromsø Airport and dropped mail at Bear Island before {{continuing}} to Longyearbyen. The runway was lit up using paraffin lamps and lights from cars parked along the runway. A radio transmitter was also installed at Hotellneset. During the 1965–66 season, Braathens SAFE made 16 flights to Svalbard. The following two seasons, the contract was awarded to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), but after that they reverted to Braathens SAFE. Fred. Olsen Airtransport made its first flight to Svalbard in 1966. By 1969, a total of 50 flights {{had been made to}} Svalbard, and by 1972, the 100th was made. By then, Braathens SAFE had started using Douglas DC-6B aircraft. During these years, Store Norske also installed permanent lights. The first <b>jet</b> <b>plane</b> to land in Adventdalen was a Fred Olsen Flyselskap Dassault Falcon 20, LN-FOI. The landing was in 1971, and the aircraft brought in 1700 lbs of mail and passengers, picking up a geological survey party. A Fokker F-28 landed on 29 April 1972. From 1974, Boeing 737-200C aircraft were taken into use. They had a side cargo door, allowing easy loading of cargo into the main cabin. Braathens SAFE built a small depot with spare parts and up to [...] of fuel. Aeroflot started flights to Adventdalen in 1973 to serve the neighboring Russian community of Barentsburg.|$|E

The accident occurred after McEntire's private performance for IBM executives the night before. The first plane was a Hawker Siddeley DH-125-1A/522 charter jet, believed to have taken off around 1:45 AM from the Brown Field Municipal Airport, located near the border of Mexico. After reaching an altitude of about 3,572 feet (1,089 m) above sea level, the [...] aircraft crashed on the side of Otay Mountain, located ten miles east of the airport, while the second plane (carrying her other band members) did not crash. The accident was believed to have occurred due to poor visibility near the mountain, which was not considered [...] "prohibitive" [...] for flying. The news was reported nearly immediately to McEntire and her husband, who were sleeping at a nearby hotel. A spokeswoman for McEntire at the time stated in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "she was very close to all of them. Some of them had been with her for years. Reba is totally devastated by this.
