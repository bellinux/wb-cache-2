Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. <b>He</b> <b>rubs</b> the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become caked with mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, {{documentary}} filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of {{a meeting}} Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, {{even if it meant}} hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, injure tight end Vernon Davis' ankles and go after kick returner Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback Alex Smith; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, [...] "then <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out." [...] Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on Steve Gleason and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to Yahoo! Sports without Gleason's approval. However, the Saints were not penalized for illegal hits during that game, which they lost 36–32.|$|E
60|$|Now the Soldier {{knew what}} a capital tinder-box this was.

Now, the Soldier went down again to his {{beautiful}} rooms, and appeared once more in splendid clothes. All his friends immediately recognised him again, and paid him great court.|$|R
60|$|John Messner clung with mittened {{hand to the}} bucking gee-pole {{and held}} the sled in the trail.

In point of fact, he rarely ceased from rubbing them, and sometimes, as their {{numbness}} increased, <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> fiercely. His forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap, the flaps of which went over his ears. The rest of his face was protected by a thick beard, golden-brown under its coating of frost.|$|R

60|$|But the wintry morning {{wants him}} not and wakes him not. It wakes Mr. George of the {{shooting}} gallery and his familiar. They arise, roll up and stow away their mattresses. Mr. George, having shaved himself before a looking-glass of minute proportions, then marches out, bare-headed and bare-chested, to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap, friction, drifting rain, and exceedingly cold water. As <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> himself upon a large jack-towel, blowing like a military sort of diver just come up, his hair curling tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> {{it so that it}} looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive instrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb--as <b>he</b> <b>rubs,</b> and puffs, and polishes, and blows, turning his {{head from side to side}} the more conveniently to excoriate his throat, and standing with his body well bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs, Phil, on his knees lighting a fire, looks round as if it were enough washing for him to see all that done, and sufficient renovation for one day to take in the superfluous health his master throws off.|$|E

60|$|And the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up {{with the}} three buttons, and it tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but that made it worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled and rolled, and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse and worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed himself against it. <b>He</b> <b>rubbed</b> so much and so hard that <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> his skin into a great fold over his shoulders, and another fold underneath, where the buttons used to be (but <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> the buttons off), and <b>he</b> <b>rubbed</b> some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his temper, but it didn't make the least {{difference}} to the cake-crumbs. They were inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry indeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every rhinoceros has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all on account of the cake-crumbs inside.|$|R

60|$|The islander, {{placing the}} larger stick obliquely against some object, with one end {{elevated}} {{at an angle}} of forty-five degrees, mounts astride of it, like an urchin about to gallop off upon a cane, and then, grasping the smaller one firmly in both hands, <b>he</b> <b>rubs</b> its pointed end slowly {{up and down the}} extent of a few inches on the principal stick, until at last he makes a narrow groove in the wood, with an abrupt termination at the point farthest from him, where all the dusty particles which the friction creates are accumulated in a little heap.|$|E
60|$|Between {{the fifth}} and twentieth of October I see the barrels lie under the trees. And perhaps I talk with one who is {{selecting}} some choice barrels to fulfil an order.

Cool eveings prompt the farmers to make haste, and at length I see only the ladders here and there left leaning against the trees.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bucket and his fat {{forefinger}} {{are much}} in consultation together under existing circumstances. When Mr. Bucket has {{a matter of}} this pressing interest under his consideration, the fat forefinger seems to rise, to the dignity of a familiar demon.

The Augurs of the Detective Temple invariably predict that when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference, a terrible avenger will be heard of before long.|$|E
