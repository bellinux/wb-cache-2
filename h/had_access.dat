5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Zimbabwe {{is defined by}} many small scale successful programs but also by {{a general lack of}} improved water and sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe. According to the World Health Organization in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to improved, i.e. clean, drinking-water sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to improved sanitation facilities. Access to improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have <b>had</b> <b>access</b> by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede <b>had</b> <b>access</b> to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
