5|$|The game {{begins in}} 2011 with Cocoro {{traveling}} to SPHIA to interview Inubushi, when her plane experiences turbulence and crashes on Mount Akakura. Yuni and Yomogi get the unconscious Cocoro and Mayuzumi {{to an emergency}} cabin to take shelter from the blizzard. In 2012, Satoru falls from the SPHIA facility's clock tower and loses consciousness. Cocoro wakes up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> is relieved to find that Yuni is safe. Yuni does not recognize her; when looking at herself in a mirror, she sees a man's body. Similarly, Satoru wakes up in a woman's body. Both eventually switch back to their respective bodies, but the phenomenon continues, with their minds moving between their bodies; they conclude that their consciousnesses are transcending time and space. In the cabin, a news article dated July 4, 2011 is found, which says that Yuni was the only survivor, with the other three having died in an avalanche on January 17. Satoru finds a key in his room, but {{does not know what}} it unlocks.|$|E

Many digital pianos can imitate the sounds of several instruments, including a grand piano, electric piano, pipe organ, Hammond organ and harpsichord. They are not sensitive to the climate or humidity changes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{there is also no}} need for tuning, as with acoustic pianos.|$|E

I liked doing stonemasonry as well". He still does it on an occasional basis: [...] "We wouldn’t be carving gravestones or anything.

500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman, and Benny Blanco, who also produced the song. Kesha said that the song originated from a discussion {{they had in the}} studio on the politics of female-male relationships which Kesha later explained, [...] "The song came about when the people that wrote it — me, Benny Blanco, Neon Hitch and [...] Sean Foreman — all got <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> they were talking about how chicks talk too much," [...] "And me and Neon were like, 'No, no, no, guys talk too much," [...] "So, we had this war of who were more obnoxious, chicks or dudes.

500|$|Beating as One was {{recorded}} at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums. Kaplan described the recording sessions {{of the album}} as follows: [...] "We hole up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> work for a really long time. Then we come out and blink our eyes because it's sunny out". Initially, the band {{did not intend to}} write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album {{was the only way to}} accommodate the instrumental track [...] "Spec Bebop", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album [...] "by hook or by crook". Beating as One is the only Yo La Tengo album that {{was recorded}} on an ADAT magnetic tape format, even though it was mixed to analog later.

500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} Yorke, are more {{abstract}} compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for The Bends. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics [...] "seemed {{a mixture of}} overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary" [...] with [...] "images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." [...] Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: [...] "On this album, the outside world became all there was... I'm just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast." [...] He told Q: [...] "It was like there's a secret camera <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite." ...|$|E
500|$|Total release foggers (TRFs), or [...] "bug bombs," [...] {{release a}} fog of {{insecticide}} to kill bugs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> coat surfaces with a chemical so the insects do not return. [...] It {{is estimated that}} 50 million TRFs {{are used in the}} US annually. [...] SENSOR-Pesticides federal and state staff, along with officials from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), published an article in the CDC MMWR that called attention to injuries and illnesses resulting from use of total release foggers. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) published a press release in response, stating that the state would restrict their use. [...] DEC Commissioner Pete Granis announced that the department would move to classify foggers as a restricted-use product in New York State, meaning that only certified pesticide applicators would be able to obtain them. [...] In March 2010, US EPA announced required label changes on indoor TRF products that reflect the label change recommendations made in the MMWR article.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review {{and gave it}} a B- rating. He wrote, [...] "The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on. Whether the stuff that’s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate, but I actually enjoyed most of this episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{refers to}} Jack Kevorkian, the right-to-die activist {{best known for}} his {{advocacy}} of physician-assisted suicide, although Kyle mistakenly refers to him as [...] "Jack Leborkian".

The Cartoon Central network in [...] "Death" [...] is based on Comedy Central, the real-life television network that broadcasts South Park. John Warsog, the man who runs Cartoon Central in [...] "Death", is based on Doug Herzog, the Comedy Central executive who was responsible for bringing South Park to the network. Herzog was excited to be featured in the episode and enjoyed the portrayal. During one scene, Stan's grandfather locks him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> plays music by the Irish vocalist Enya as a form of torture to show Stan what it's like to be his age, and convince Stan to kill him. The parody of Enya's Orinoco Flow used in [...] "Death" [...] was sung by Toddy Walters, who played protagonist Polly Pry in Trey Parker's 1996 film, Cannibal! The Musical. [...] "Death" [...] marked the first appearance of Snacky Cakes, one of Cartman's favorite snack foods.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenny {{suffers from}} a bout of [...] "explosive diarrhea", which spreads {{to others in the}} town, {{including}} the adults protesting Terrance and Phillip. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch Terrance and Phillip at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> forcing him to listen to a song in the style of Enya's [...] "Orinoco Flow". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, Death himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.|$|E
