2500|$|In 1827 {{the first}} school {{building}} was erected. It {{is still standing}} {{just west of the}} Presbyterian church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of Mansfield, PA. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver’s Point—now Lawrenceville—for fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after the adoption of the public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839-40. in the article already quoted from, he says: [...] "I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>school.</b> In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with my assistance. In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship." ...|$|E

He spoke about war, the environment, cooperation, and simply what it means to be a decent human being. And I will never forget what he said at the end of it all. “You are the future of this world. My generation has already had a go and we messed it up.

Then it turned out, as no doubt you have heard, that her former husband was alive when they were married. They ought probably to have separated, but they didn't.

40|$|Mr. President, {{distinguished}} mineralogists, and guests, I {{was delighted}} when Werner Schreyer {{asked me to}} be his citationist, because I admire him for his scholarship, for his dogged pursuit of the perfect experiment seeking exquisite minerals, and for his application of experimental mineralogy to petrological problems. Werner and I have had parallel lives in experimental petrology, following paths that have converged from time to time, and with each convergence has come growing respect and friendship. But as a schoolboy in the 1940 s, I hated Werner Schreyer, and I’m sure that he hated me. We were receiving bombs from our respective air forces in Germany and England, and wartime propaganda is a powerful opinion-shaper.

60|$|And {{yet when}} I think how little I knew of Latin or Greek on leaving Harrow at nineteen, I am {{astonished}} {{at the possibility}} of such waste of time. I am now a fair Latin scholar,--that is to say, I read and enjoy the Latin classics, and could probably make myself understood in Latin prose. But the knowledge which I have, I have acquired since I left school,--no doubt aided much by that groundwork of the language which will in the process of years make its way slowly, even through the skin. There were twelve years of tuition in which I do not remember that I ever knew a lesson! When I left Harrow I was nearly {{at the top of the}} school, being a monitor, and, I think, the seventh boy. This position I achieved by gravitation upwards. I bear in mind well with how prodigal a hand prizes used to be showered about; but I never got a prize. From the first to the last there was nothing satisfactory <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>school</b> career,--except the way in which I licked the boy who had to be taken home to be cured.|$|E
60|$|Home, {{after my}} father's death, {{had become a}} very quiet and uneventful place indeed. My mother had either an unimaginative {{temperament}} or her mind was greatly occupied with private religious solicitudes, and I remember her talking to me but little, and that usually upon topics I was anxious to evade. I had developed my own view about low-Church theology long before my father's death, and my meditation upon that event had finished my secret estrangement from my mother's faith. My reason would not permit even a remote chance of his being in hell, he was so manifestly not evil, and this religion would not permit him a remote chance of being out yet. When I {{was a little boy}} my mother had taught me to read and write and pray and had done many things for me, indeed she persisted in washing me and even in making my clothes until I rebelled against these things as indignities. But our minds parted very soon. She never began to understand the mental processes of my play, she never interested herself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>school</b> life and work, she could not understand things I said; and she came, I think, quite insensibly to regard me with something of the same hopeless perplexity she had felt towards my father.|$|E
6000|$|Early <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>school</b> days a boy had {{a copy of}} the 'Wonders of the World,' which I often read, and disputed {{with other}} boys about the {{veracity}} of some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the [...] "Beagle". In the latter part of my school life I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became a very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle. The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the tutor of the college remarked, [...] "What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr. Darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I often hear the crack when I pass under his windows." ...|$|E
