5|$|The Alsos Mission was an {{organized}} effort {{by a team}} of United States military, scientific, and intelligence personnel to discover enemy scientific developments during World War II. Its chief focus was on the German nuclear energy project, but it also investigated both chemical and biological weapons and the means to <b>deliver</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|In 726 Asad {{rebuilt the}} city of Balkh, which had been {{destroyed}} by Qutayba ibn Muslim following a revolt, and transferred there the Arab garrison troops from nearby Barukhan. Asad also resumed, after almost a decade, the practice of sending envoys to the Chinese court. This move was clearly linked to the Turgesh threat, as the Turks were Chinese vassals and were regarded by the Transoxianians as the agents of the Chinese emperor, sent to <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> from Arab rule. Asad is also said to have built the village of Asadabad near Nishapur, which his descendants held until Tahirid times.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The game's puzzles {{are divided}} into groups set on {{different}} planets. Players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress to the next one, but the game includes optional harder puzzles. Final boss levels, called out as defense levels, complete each planet; here, the player must efficiently create chemicals and <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> in a timely manner, once the reactor systems have been started, to trigger defense systems to ward off attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure.|$|E
5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E

5|$|After {{seeing the}} Do 17M V1 at the Zürich air races in 1937, the Yugoslav Royal Air Force bought license rights for {{production}} at the Drzavna Fabrika Aviona factory in 1938. They equipped it with the more powerful Gnome-Rhône 14N radial engine (although the French exaggerated its performance) Dornier designs were delivered to the Pomorsko Vazduhoplovstvo (Naval Aviation - PV) in 1926, namely the Dornier Komet and Dornier Do Y heavy bombers. The Yugoslavs were familiar with Dornier designs, and on 19 November 1935 Yugoslav pilots test-flew the Do 17 V-3 prototype, D-ABIH, W.Nr. 258. They decided to select the Do 17 for service, despite it being more expensive than any other aircraft, because of the German willingness to <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> quickly without limitations on numbers.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was {{populated}} with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could <b>deliver</b> <b>them.</b> Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E
5|$|Operation Colossus was the codename {{given to}} the first {{airborne}} operation undertaken by the British military, which occurred on 10 February 1941 during World War II. The British airborne establishment was formed in June 1940 by {{the order of the}} British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in response to the successful airborne operations conducted by the German military during the Battle of France. Training began immediately, but a shortage of proper equipment and training facilities, as well as bureaucratic difficulties, meant that {{only a small number of}} volunteers could immediately be trained as parachute troops. The first airborne unit to be formed was actually a re-trained Commando unit, No. 2 Commando, which was subsequently renamed as No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion and numbered approximately 350 officers and other ranks by September 1940. The battalion finished its training in December 1940, and in February 1941 thirty-eight members of the battalion, known as X Troop, were selected to conduct an airborne operation, which was intended to test the capability of the airborne troops and their equipment, as well as the ability of the Royal Air Force to accurately <b>deliver</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Bonaparte {{learned that}} Ganteaume was {{anchored}} in Toulon rather than off the Egyptian coast, {{he was furious}} and ordered the squadron to return to sea and complete its mission as ordered. His anger was amplified by {{the news that the}} frigate Africaine, despatched from Rochefort with the same orders to resupply Egypt, had been captured at the Action of 19 February 1801 by the British frigate HMS Phoebe in the Western Mediterranean. To emphasise his instructions, Bonaparte sent General Jean-Gérard Lacuée to <b>deliver</b> <b>them</b> in person. Ganteaume was ordered to sail to Alexandria immediately, and if the Egyptian port was under attack by British forces, the troops were to be landed anywhere practical between Cape Rasat and Tripoli and make their way to Alexandria overland. Ganteaume sailed on 19 March, as soon as Lacuée had delivered the orders, with seven ships of the line, three frigates and three merchant ships carrying supplies.|$|E

25|$|For Hitler the Eastern Front {{against the}} Soviet Union dwarfed the desert war, {{which was a}} holding action of {{secondary}} importance.
