40|$|Tungsten carbide {{is one of}} the {{essential}} materials used in carbide dies, cutting tools and components under erosion. Although Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is suitable for handling this material, it is not ideal for micro-hole machining due to its hardness property. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the characteristics of EDM micro-hole tungsten carbide using Sodick 3 -axis <b>die</b> <b>sinking</b> <b>machine</b> with 0. 5 mm diameter copper as an electrode. In the current study, the effectiveness of the EDM process was evaluated in terms of material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear rate (EWR) and diameter overcut. Design of Experiment (DOE) method has been adopted and findings on the influence of the process parameters, namely peak current (Ip), pulse on time (ti) and polarity (ve) over MRR, EWR and diameter overcut is presented in this paper. The process employs different range of peak current (1. 5, 3. 0 (A)), pulse on time (3. 2, 6. 4 (μs)) and polarity ((+ve), (-ve)). Experimental results indicate that the MRR increased when the peak current with negative polarity is kept at high level whilst the EWR minimised when the negative polarity with low level of peak current setting is employed. In the case of diameter overcut, it has been found that the use of positive polarity associated with low level pulse on time setting will minimise the diameter overcut and produce a constant micro-hole shape...|$|E

40|$|Four {{zirconia}} based composite {{groups with}} conductive secondary phase additions of TiB 2, TiN, TiC, anti TiC N {{have been developed}} {{with the objective of}} allowing shaping by spark erosion. Each composite was subjected to <b>die</b> <b>sink</b> electrodischarge <b>machining</b> (EDM) using a standard predetermined set of sparking parameters, and an assessment of machining performance was made by comparing volumetric material removal rates (VMRRs), surface finish, and tool wear. Optimum machining conditions for each ceramic composite were found to be polarity dependent. The more electrically conductive composites with higher secondary phase content generally gave higher VMRR values. Erosion rates were further improved by increasing the energy and frequency of sparking while maintaining stable machining with no arcing. Bend testing showed an overall reduction of about 20 %, in the strength of the materials after EDM under non-optimised conditions, when compared with conventionally sawed specimens. Despite the reduced strength, a sizeable bending strength of about 800 MPat was maintained after <b>die</b> <b>sinking.</b> Microstructural investigation revealed that the original microstructure of the more conductive composites with 40 vol. -% secondary phase was maintained when <b>die</b> <b>sinking</b> was carried out under optimised conditions.

40|$|The ideal {{selection}} of manufacturing conditions {{is one of}} the most important aspects to take into consideration in the majority of manufacturing processes and particularly in processes related to Electrical Discharge <b>Machining</b> (EDM). EDM <b>die</b> <b>sinking</b> <b>machines</b> are used to machine conductive metals of any hardness or difficult to machine with traditional methods. The problem in the capabilities of tool electrodes which are not utilized at the optimum Ievels of the operating parameters has attracted the attention of researchers and practicing engineers to manufacture tool electrodes with highly great performance. In this work, an experimental design was conducted to characterize the machining performances and surface integrity of three different composition of copper tungsten (CuW) tool electrode in EDM of D 2 hardened steel (58 - 62 HRC). Machining performances i. e. material removal rate (W) to,o l wear rate (TWR), workpiece surface roughness (Ra) and micro-hardness (MH) were studied for the three different composition of CuW tool electrode made through powder metallurgy 0 method. Machining variables were peak current and pulse duration, meanwhile machining voltage, depth of cut and duty factor were kept constant. The 65 %W electrode is the best choice of CuW electrode on machining D 2 hardened steel'due to the highest machining rate, reasonable tool wear rate and acceptable surface characteristics. The improvement of MRR is obviously affected by the increment of current intensity. MRR increased as the value of peak current increased. The increment of pulse duration is not essentially improving MRR. There is no clear relation between the alteration of pulse duration and MRR. However, the MRR becomes the optimum at an optimal set of variables which is set at 40 A and 400 ~s. The results of the machining performance can extent the availability of database on EDM machinability and surface characteristics of D 2 hardened steel for machinist practices in industrial application of roughing operation...|$|R
