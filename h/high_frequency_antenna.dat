40|$|Detection of {{fractures}} within resistive rock masses is {{at present}} a very Common application of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technique. GPR investigations {{have been performed}} in several mines and quarries, as well as over unstable rock slopes. The detection and location of fractures is obviously of great importance for safety reasons but can also be used, for instance by the quarrying industry, to improve the production of ornamental rock slabs. According to the desired trade-off between resolution and penetration depth, the full frequency range of Commercial GPR systems (from tens of MHz to few GHz) has been employed in these investigations. In most cases rock fractures {{can be considered as}} beds whose thickness is smaller than the resolution limit (i. e., a thin bed), and can be envisaged as layers embedded in a homogeneous formation, giving rise to reflected signals from the top and the bottom of the bed having opposite polarities. Studies on reflections from thin beds have been carried out by the seismic industry for nearly sixty years now and new developments are still underway. In the last decade, the GPR Community has focused on thin beds response to determine rock fracture features (aperture and filling material).

40|$|With the {{development}} of modern wireless communication and radar system, microstrip antenna arrays are widely used and developed. As two key components for antenna feeding network, couplers and phase shifters draw much attention in the past decades. In this thesis, the design for multi-section coupler, patch-based coupler and multi-section phase shifter are thoroughly studied and validated experimentally. Since different input impedances and powers are always required for the antenna arrays, the couplers with different power outputs and impedance transforming are in great demand. As the first contribution of this thesis, a multi-section coupler with arbitrary power ratio and impedance transformation is proposed and thoroughly analyzed so that a wider bandwidth can be achieved. The method of replacing the connecting branches with a “uni-box” largely reduces {{the complexity of the}} analysis and provides the generalized equations for the multi-section coupler. Meanwhile, {{in order to avoid the}} mutual coupling of the branches, a patch based coupler with the same properties is also designed and discussed. A guideline for designing the generalized patch based structure is introduced as well. For the second contribution of the thesis, a multi-section π-based phase shifter is designed and analyzed. In order to avoid the phase oscillation around the center frequency, the relation of the impedances for the short-ended stubs and the phase shift is fully analyzed. The proposed structure can then be extended to a higher order one to achieve a higher phase difference and a wider bandwidth. The research presented in this thesis proposes an efficient method of analysing the multi-section coupler and phase shifter, and provides a guideline for designing the asymmetric patch based structure, which can be applied in the wideband and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> feeding network design. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

One approach to achieve such magnetodielectrics is to embed magnetic materials in a dielectric matrix. In this work, we have prepared and characterized a series of magnetodielectric composites with oriented Fe flake inclusions in an insulating dielectric polymeric matrix. The Fe flakes were prepared by mechanically deforming commercial Fe particles into sub-micrometers thick with aspect ratio (width/thickness) over 100.
