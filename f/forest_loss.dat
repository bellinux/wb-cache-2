5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century. According to a conservative estimate, about 40percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E
25|$|Species of swallow {{and martin}} that are {{threatened}} with extinction are generally endangered due to habitat loss. This {{is presumed to}} be the reason behind {{the decline of the}} critically endangered white-eyed river martin, a species that is only known from a few specimens collected in Thailand. The species presumably breeds in riverbanks, a much diminished habitat in SE Asia. As the species hasn't been reliably seen since 1980 it may already be extinct. Two insular species, the Bahama swallow and golden swallow, have declined due to <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> and also competition with introduced species such as starlings and sparrows, which compete with these swallows for nesting sites. The golden swallow formerly bred on the island of Jamaica, but was last seen there in 1989 and is now restricted to the island of Hispaniola.|$|E
25|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} {{population}} in the wild is faced {{by a number of}} factors that threaten its extinction. Such factors include deforestation, farming, grazing and the expanding human settlements that cause <b>forest</b> <b>loss.</b> There is a correlation between human intervention in the wild with the destruction of habitats and increase in bushmeat hunting. Another of these factors is infertility. Generally, female gorillas mature at 10–12 years of age (or earlier at 7–8 years) and their male counterparts mature more slowly, rarely strong and dominant enough to reproduce before 15–20 years of age. The fecundity of females, or capacity of producing young in great numbers, appears to decline by the age of 18. Of one half of captive females of viable reproductive age, approximately only 30% of those had only a single birth. However, these non-reproductive gorillas may prove to be a valuable resource since the use of assisted reproductive techniques aid in the maintaining of genetic diversity in the limited populations in zoos.|$|E

25|$|Brazil’s Government {{considers}} that, {{despite many}} studies, {{there is still}} much uncertainty about the consequences of climate change and its links to worsening critical events. On the other hand, the Technical Summary of the Fourth Assessment Report of the UNFCC, reflecting a consensus view, indicates a potential Amazon <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> of between 20 and 80% as a result of climate impacts induced by a temperature increase in the basin of between 2.0 and 3.0degrees Celsius. The IPCC is also indicating a likelihood of major biodiversity extinctions as a consequence. Specifically, according to the Earth Simulator, temperature increases and disruption in precipitation cycles (up to a 90% reduction {{by the end of the}} century) could seriously hamper the workings of the Amazon as a forest ecosystem, reducing its capacity to retain carbon, increasing its soil temperature, and eventually forcing the Amazon through a gradual process of savannization. These predictions were reinforced in 2005, when large sections of southwestern Amazonia experienced one of the most intense droughts of the last hundred years. The drought severely affected human population along the main channel of the Amazon River and its western and southwestern tributaries.|$|E
500|$|Because Myotis alcathoe remains poorly known, it is {{assessed}} as [...] "Data Deficient" [...] on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it may be}} endangered {{because of}} its narrow ecological preferences. Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites {{where it has been}} recorded have already been destroyed. <b>Forest</b> <b>loss</b> is another possible threat, and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats. Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats. The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal. In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the changes}} in the 2006–2008 report, not all species were removed from the 2008–2010 list due to {{improvement}} in their situation. [...] Instead, new species were added to bring attention to other closely related species with very small populations that are also at risk of extinction. For example, the highly endangered eastern black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) replaced the Hainan black crested gibbon. [...] The Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) replaced the Horton Plains slender loris (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides) because the former has been hit the hardest of Asian lorises, all of which are declining rapidly due primarily to capture for the exotic pet trade, as well as use in traditional medicines and <b>forest</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] In another case, the brown-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps fusciceps) was omitted from the list since no spokesperson could be found for the species. [...] The same approach was taken with the 2012–2014 list.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, {{acid rain}} and sudden forest {{destruction}} renewed debate {{on whether or}} not a general speed limit should be imposed on autobahns.

The Federal Government sponsored a large-scale experiment with a [...] speed limit in order to measure the impact of reduced speeds on emissions and compliance.
