40|$|This study {{presents}} a real-time guidance strategy for an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{that can be}} used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing insitu measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. In these strategies, periodic adjustments are made in the airspeed and/or heading angle command, <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flights,</b> for the UAV to minimize a projected power requirement. In this study, UAV dynamics are described by a three-dimensional dynamic point-mass model. A stochastic wind field model has been used to analyze the effect of the wind in the process. Onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback linearization. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing UAV flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which the UAV would follow the optimal airspeed command <b>in</b> a steady <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> under zero wind conditions. A performance measure is defined as the average power consumption with respect to no wind case. Different scenarios have been evaluated both over a specified time interval and over different initial heading angles of the UAV. A relative benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement in the performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to show efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithms. Results demonstrate possible power savings of the proposed real-time guidance strategies <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flights,</b> by utilization of wind energy.

5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10.

5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by {{deficiencies in the}} Yugoslav aeronautical industry which had resulted {{in a mixture of}} foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight,</b> enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E

5|$|K5054 {{was fitted}} with a new propeller, and Summers flew the {{aircraft}} on 10 March 1936; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight, a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire {{was a very good}} aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330mph (528km/h), little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348mph (557km/h) <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> in mid-May, when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). Here, Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF. He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing. Edwardes-Jones' report was positive; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator. A week later, on 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, before any formal report had been issued by the A&AEE. Interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> than the Japanese fighters {{they were up}} against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted {{to make sure that he}} had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The compass {{shows the}} aircraft's heading {{relative}} to magnetic north.

Additionally, the compass is subject to Dip Errors. While reliable <b>in</b> steady <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> it can give confusing indications when turning, climbing, descending, or accelerating due to the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, the heading indicator is also used for aircraft operation, but periodically calibrated against the compass.|$|R

25|$|As Hemer noted, the Dr.I was {{considerably}} slower than contemporary Allied fighters <b>in</b> <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> {{and in a}} dive.

25|$|The Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor (originally {{designated}} XP-91) was a mixed-propulsion prototype interceptor aircraft, {{developed by}} Republic Aviation.
