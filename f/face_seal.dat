30|$|Face {{contact can}} affect sealing performance, such as dynamic behavior, thermo{{dynamics}}, friction, wear. The dynamics of <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> {{has been an}} active area since the works by Etsion [23 – 25]. In the aspect of gas <b>face</b> <b>seals,</b> direct numerical method [26 – 30] is detailed but computationally intensive, whilst semi-analytical method including perturbation method [31 – 34] and step jump method [35], on the other hand, is a more practical and efficient alternative but intensively depends on small displacement precondition. Before the introduction of asperity contact, stability and tracking {{have been used to}} illustrate the potential menace of face contact. Variables such as minimum film thickness, axial relative displacement and angular transmissibility are regarded as the indirect evaluation indexes of face contact. With the development of simulation, asperity contact models have been involved to directly gauge their influence on sealing dynamic performance. Harp and Salant [36] developed an axial dynamic model including the Abbott-Firestone plastic asperity contact model. Green [37] researched the transient performance of coned gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> during the startup operation by using the CEB model. Ruan [38] also used the CEB model to investigate the transient performance of spiral groove gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> during the startup and shutdown operations.|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem that}} arises about Hydrostatic seals is that excess leakage may {{eventually}} lead to erosion of the Seal’s structure.

50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - <b>face</b> <b>seal,</b> and barrel seal. <b>Face</b> <b>seal</b> connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{lubrication}} condition between <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> directly affects the reliability, operating life and sealing performance of mechanical seals. Thus, {{the identification of}} lubrication regimes in <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> i. e. boundary lubrication (BL), mixed lubrication (ML) and hydrodynamic lubrication (HL) is of high importance for developing effective online condition monitoring approaches. This paper investigates the tribological behaviour and frictional characteristics of mechanical seals based on nonintrusive acoustic emission (AE) measurements. Mathematical models for AE generation mechanisms are derived based on the tribological behaviour and operating parameters of mechanical seals. They produce agreeable results with experimental data in explaining the types of AE signals observed in monitoring the face lubrication conditions. Frequency domain analysis of data shows that the viscous friction process generates more low frequency AE signals, whereas the asperity interactions show more high frequency AE. Moreover, the feasibility of using statistical parameters of the time domain data is shown to identify the lubrication regimes in <b>face</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal, {{also referred to}} as a mechanical <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> but usually simply as a mechanical seal, is a type of seal utilised in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, blowers, and compressors. When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between the rotating shaft and the stationary pump casing. Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as Gland Packing) to seal the shaft. Since World War II, mechanical seals have replaced packing in many applications.|$|E

50|$|The pneumofathometer hose has {{a smaller}} bore than the main {{breathing}} gas hose of the umbilical, {{but it is}} connected to the same gas supply at the gas panel, and {{can be used as a}} secondary route for surface supplied breathing gas for the diver if the main hose malfunctions.

This is colloquially known as pneumo-breathing, and is a useful adjunct to the bailout set, as the gas supply is less limited.

50|$|Band masks {{generally}} have a one-piece faceplate, {{which may be}} relatively large, firmly mounted to a rigid frame which holds the demand valve or other gas supply fittings. The frame may be of strong plastic or fibre reinforced composite. A <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> {{and in some cases}} a neoprene hood is clamped on by the metal band, which has several buttons protruding, onto which the straps of the spider are fastened to secure the mask to the diver's head. Where a hood is included, it may have a zipper up the back for ease of fitting, and the spider is secured over the hood. A band mask is generally heavier and more cumbersome to fit than a soft skirted mask, and is not easily fitted without assistance. It provides greater security and protection to the diver than a soft-skirted full-face mask, and is lighter and quicker to fit than a helmet.Most band masks are fitted with demand systems for gas supply, but can be operated in free-flow mode.|$|E
