5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase price <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so {{would have required}} a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Crane and Kauffman pitched their {{original}} idea to network NBC in December 1993. NBC liked it and commissioned a complete script, which was submitted in March 1994. Before the script was finished, casting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> main roles began; 75 actors were seen for each part. The pilot was taped on May 4, 1994 at Warner Bros.' studios in Burbank, California. After making final edits to the episode, executive producer Kevin Bright submitted it on May 11, {{two days before}} NBC was due to announce the schedule. Satisfied with the completed pilot, NBC ordered 12 more episodes for the first season. The episode was watched by approximately 22million viewers, making it the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week. Critics compared the show unfavorably to Seinfeld and Ellen, noting the similarities all three series had in depicting friends conversing about their lives. The cast, particularly Schwimmer, were complimented, though there was some concern that the character roles were undeveloped.|$|E

5|$|One of Meddings' first tasks was {{to shoot}} stock {{footage of the}} Thunderbird {{machines}} and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion. The finished island model was a composite {{of more than a}} dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately. The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the Stourhead Estate in Wiltshire. In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as associate producer, Meddings was further tasked with designing the Thunderbird fleet and FAB 1. Scale models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex. Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the Thunderbird machines were created for the series.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1927, Kirishimas first {{reconstruction}} rebuilt {{her as a}} battleship, strengthening her {{armor and}} improving her speed. From 1934, a second reconstruction completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Kirishima acted primarily as a support vessel and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China. On the eve of World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Kido Butai as an escort <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|The 1936–37 MCC tour of Australia under G.O. Allen was the {{occasion}} of Cardus's {{first visit to the}} country. During the tour he made, or consolidated, friendships with players and colleagues including C. B. Fry and Donald Bradman. Fry, a former England cricket captain, was a boyhood hero of Cardus, and was covering the Tests for the London Evening Standard. In Bradman, Cardus found a sophistication and sensitivity that other writers had failed to detect. When interviewed on his arrival in Australia, Cardus speculated how he would cope <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> months of the tour without music; he was touched when the following day music students in Perth gave him a private recital of music by Chopin and Hugo Wolf. During this tour Cardus wrote for The Herald in Melbourne, and broadcast about cricket on Australian radio.|$|E

5|$|The Grizzlies {{had been}} created as an {{expansion}} team along with the Toronto Raptors in 1995. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies performed poorly; they only once finished better than last in the Midwest Division and never reached the playoffs. The Grizzlies were owned by Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, who also owned the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). In 1999, Bill Laurie, owner of the NHL's St. Louis Blues, attempted to buy the Grizzlies, {{with the intent to}} move it to St. Louis. After interference by the NBA, the Grizzlies were sold to Michael Heisley. He immediately started the process to relocate the team, and seven U.S. cities were candidates for the team—Anaheim, California; Buffalo, New York; Memphis, Tennessee; New Orleans, Louisiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Las Vegas, Nevada; and San Diego, California—before settling on the move to Memphis {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The county {{facilities}} in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements to the Grand Jury House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s {{the role of the}} military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a proposal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E

As part of the deal, Molson retained 19.9% of the team and were granted the {{right of first refusal}} for any future sale by Gillett; in addition, the NHL Board of Governors would be required to unanimously approve any attempt to move to a new city.|$|E
5|$|Tolls on the Witham had {{gradually}} risen as improvements {{had been}} made. £263 {{was raised in}} 1763-4, and had reached £898 by 1790. In 1819, income exceeded £4,100 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>six</b> months from March to September, and a five per cent dividend was paid in the following year. By 1826, over £!80,000 had been spent on improvements, and another £40,000 was needed. However, the proprietors were still optimistic, and commissioned Sir John Rennie to investigate an extension to link the Witham to the River Ancholme, but although he made two proposals, neither was implemented. Most traffic was carried by sailing vessels of in barges hauled by horses, but in March 1816, the first steam packet boat arrived on the river. It was named Witham and had been built by Shuttleworth and Robinson, whose yard was on Sincil Dyke. Despite a boiler explosion in March 1817, fortunately without causing injury {{to any of the}} crew or the 30 passengers, a second steam packet was operating by July 1817, and they soon displaced the sailing packet boats. During a flood in 1828, one of them lost power when a floating hedge became jammed in the paddle wheels. In the following year, a Lincoln man, William Pool invented a new type of paddlewheel, which resulted in the boats travelling faster, and in 1836, wooden vessels were superseded by iron packet boats.|$|E
