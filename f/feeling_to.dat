5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine <b>feeling,</b> <b>to</b> Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E

40|$|Attitude toward child-rearing and the {{relevant}} factors were examined for university students. The subjects were 222 university students. A questionnaire was used，which consisted of scales on (1) attitude toward child-rearing，(2) <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children，(3) Intemal Working Models (IWM) ，(4) ego identity status，(5) mental health，(6) mental disorder，and (7) self-esteem. Correlational analysis by multiple regression analysis was conducted. It was found that attitude toward child-rearing of university students was not influenced by IWM，ego identitiy status，mental health，mental disorder nor self-esteem，but by <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children. The positive attitude toward child-rearing {{was associated with the}} positive <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children，and the negative attitude toward child-rearing was related with the negative <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children.

40|$|Attitude toward childrearing and the {{relevant}} factors were examined for female university students. The subjects were 939 female university students. A questionnaire was used, which consisted of scales on (1) attitude toward childrearing, (2) views on sex roles of both females and males, (3) <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children, and (4) attitude toward childrearing of their mother. Correlational analysis by multiple regression analysis was conducted. It was found that attitude toward childrearing of female university students was not influenced by views on sex roles nor attitude toward childrearing of their mother, but by <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children. The positive attitude toward childrearing {{was associated with the}} positive <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children, and the negative attitude toward childrearing was related with the negative <b>feelings</b> <b>to</b> children.

25|$|A large park {{is built}} {{in the center of}} the main campus, and is home to several {{specially}} commissioned sculptures. In addition, a pond surrounded by benches and an open field is available. The park contains old oak trees which were specially transplanted to the location when the university was opened. Together, they form a considerable amount of tree canopies which add a more natural <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> the campus.|$|E

25|$|This {{style was}} admired by Mackintosh because of: its {{restraint}} and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; {{the use of}} texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner {{and the value of}} the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts furniture and design focused {{on the quality of the}} space, which was meant to evoke a calming and organic <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> the interior.|$|E
25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these features, Squibb Park Bridge, an award-winning, $4.9 million, 450-foot long pedestrian bridge constructed in Spring 2013, connects Brooklyn Heights' Squibb Park to Pier 1, creating a critical point of connectivity for the surrounding community. The bridge {{was designed to be}} lightweight and flexible, providing a bouncy <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> visitors. Renovations in and around Squibb Park Bridge are currently underway. The bridge was closed on August 11, 2014, with renovations seeking to strengthen the bridge's structural integrity, incorporate new material and finishes in Squibb Park, and replicate the existing furnishings to be consistent with the neighborhood's historic character. The original ramp has been re-graded in order to enable ADA access into the park. Newly installed lighting {{around the perimeter of the}} park allows the park to restore evening hours. The renovations were completed in March 2017.|$|E

25|$|Vermeer {{is known}} to have {{incorporated}} other artists' ideas, techniques and the poses in which they depict subjects. Some features of Diana share the effects and techniques of Rembrandt. Diana's stout figure is much like those in Rembrandt's work, and Vermeer used thick impasto brushwork following the lines of the folds of her clothing, as Rembrandt did. Also like Rembrandt, Vermeer cast the faces of the group in shadows, which gives a more expressive, moodier cast to the scene. Vermeer's painting is very similar in <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> Rembrandt's Bathsheba, painted in 1654, a work Vermeer very likely saw firsthand, according to Wheelock. The poses of the woman whose feet is washed and the one doing the washing are similar. It is possible that Rembrandt's former pupil, Carel Fabritius (in Delft from 1650 until his death in late 1654), may have made Vermeer familiar with Rembrandt's work.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{arose from}} the media and other {{politicians}} that Patel's home ministry had failed to protect Gandhi. Emotionally exhausted, Patel tendered a letter of resignation, offering to leave the government. Patel's secretary persuaded him to withhold the letter, seeing it as fodder for Patel's political enemies and political conflict in India. However, Nehru sent Patel a letter dismissing any question of personal differences or desire for Patel's ouster. He reminded Patel of their 30-year partnership in the independence struggle and asserted that after Gandhi's death, it was especially wrong for them to quarrel. Nehru, Rajagopalachari, and other Congressmen publicly defended Patel. Moved, Patel publicly endorsed Nehru's leadership and refuted any suggestion of discord, and dispelled any notion that he sought to be prime minister. Though the two committed themselves to joint leadership and non-interference in Congress party affairs, they would criticise each other in matters of policy, clashing {{on the issues of}} Hyderabad's integration and UN mediation in Kashmir. Nehru declined Patel's counsel on sending assistance to Tibet after its 1950 invasion by the People's Republic of China and on ejecting the Portuguese from Goa by military force. Nehru also tried to scuttle Patel's plan with regards to Hyderabad. During a meeting, according to the then civil servant MKK Nair in his book “With No Ill <b>Feeling</b> <b>to</b> Anybody”, Nehru shouted and accused Patel of being a communalist. Patel also one on occasion called Nehru, a Maulana, for appeasing Muslims.|$|E
25|$|On the Canadian home front, {{there were}} {{many ways in which}} women could {{participate}} in the war effort. Not only did women help raise money; they rolled bandages, knitted socks, mitts, sweaters, and scarves for the men serving overseas. Women raised money to send cigarettes and candy overseas and comfort the fighting men. Canadian women were encouraged to marshal support for the war by persuading wives and mothers to allow their men and sons to enlist. During the war, an immense amount of pressure was laid on women to do their part. One of women’s largest contributions to the war was in the form of voluntary organisations. Through different organisations women volunteered millions of hours of unpaid labour. One of the biggest organisations that middle class women participated in was the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire. The IODE strongly advocated imperialist sentiment. By World War I the IODE was of the largest Canadians women’s voluntary associations. The IODE organised writing competitions to raise awareness of the war and bring patriotic <b>feeling</b> <b>to</b> Canadian children. Lois Allan joined the Farm Services Corps in 1918, to replace the men who were sent to the front. Allan was placed at E.B. Smith and Sons where she hulled strawberries for jam. Jobs were opened up at factories as well, as industrial production increased. Work days for these women consisted of ten to twelve hours, six days a week. Because the days consisted of long monotonous work, many women made of parodies of popular songs to get through the day and boost morale. Depending on the area of Canada, some women were given a choice to sleep in either barracks or tents at the factory or farm that they were employed at.|$|E

[...] In the book's appendix Seth describes Peter Arno as [...] "possibly The New Yorkers greatest stylist". [...] Seth appropriates the sophisticated, jaded satirical mood, thick brushline, and compositional sense of Arno's work. [...] Seth's brushline is simple and organic, and he gives attention to buildings, landscapes, weather conditions, and other background details. [...] The brushstrokes broaden into thick black shadows, sometimes flattening figures to near-abstract silhouettes. [...] A greyish-blue wash accents the otherwise black-and-white cartooning.
