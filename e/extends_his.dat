5|$|Newton's theorem {{describes}} {{only the}} effects of adding an inverse-cube central force. However, Newton <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> theorem to an arbitrary central forces F(r) by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular, such as ellipses with low orbital eccentricity (ε ≤ 0.1), which is true of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the solar system. Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury, which has an eccentricity ε of roughly 0.21, and suggested that it may pertain to Halley's comet, whose orbit has an eccentricity of roughly 0.97.|$|E

Thor and the Asgardians slay or imprison those who oppose them, including a young religious mutant called Davis; Zarrko the Tomorrow Man; Perrikus of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government, and even his fellow Avengers.

25|$|The fights {{are held}} {{outdoors}} in an oval ring (douzha), which was traditionally a flat clay pot but is more commonly a plastic container today. Crickets are stimulated with a tickler (cao) {{made of a}} rat's whisker hairs (Beijing style) or of fresh grass strands (Shanghai style). The handler tickles the cricket's head, then the abdomen, and finally the hind legs. Each fight consists of three or five bouts; the winner must score in two of three or three of five bouts. A bout is stopped when the triumphant winner <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> wings {{as a sign of}} victory, or when his opponent flees from the action. Laufer wrote that the fights of his time usually ended in the death of one of the crickets: The winners physically beheaded their opponents. Present-day fights may look vicious but are not lethal; the loser is always allowed to flee from the winner.|$|E
25|$|In Naoya's 8th Day, the Protagonist {{learns that}} Metatron is holding Tokyo hostage and {{extending}} the lockdown, forcing the remaining demon tamers {{to kill the}} new Overlord. If the Protagonist chooses to avoid killing the demon tamers, {{the people in the}} lockdown will gradually see the angels as their true enemy. This culminates in Yuzu, Amane, and Captain Izuna rallying the people in the Yamanote Circle behind the Overlord in opposition to God's tyranny. After defeating Metatron, the Protagonist soon leaves to rally the demons in a war against the Heavenly Host. If the Protagonist chooses to kill both the demon tamers and angels that get in his way, he soon becomes feared by the humans in the lockdown. This results in Yuzu and Midori allying with Metatron in an attempt to stop him. Once he is defeated, the Overlord soon <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> power to Japan and soon the rest of the human world, gradually uniting them as a single nation under his despotic rule before waging war against YHWH Himself.|$|E
25|$|Federer next {{traveled}} to Melbourne {{for the first}} Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open. The Swiss advanced through the first four rounds without {{the loss of a}} set, starting his campaign by defeating qualifier Alexander Kudryavtsev, receiving a walkover into the third round when Andreas Beck withdrew with a lower back injury prior to their second round match, and beating Ivo Karlović to improve to a 10–1 head-to-head record against the Croat. Federer then faced Australian teenager Bernard Tomic and downed him in less than two hours to extend his record streak of Grand Slam quarterfinals consecutive appearances to 31. In the quarterfinals, Federer faced world no. 11 Juan Martín del Potro in his 1000th career match. It was their first meeting in a major tournament since Del Potro defeated Federer in five sets in the 2009 US Open men's final. As the tight match slowly progressed, Federer took control and flew by del Potro in straight sets. With his win, Federer becomes the first player at age 30 and over to reach the Australian Open semifinals since Andre Agassi, and <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> match winning streak (started in September 2011) to 24 consecutive victories. Federer played world no. 2 and archrival Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. He opened up the match by winning the first set, but ultimately lost momentum and dropped the next three sets after a failed attempt {{to get back in the}} match by taking the third set, committing 63 unforced errors. Federer's loss to Nadal saw his winning streak of 24 consecutive matches end and his record against Nadal slip to 9–18.|$|E

500|$|Samson's {{story has}} also {{garnered}} commentary from a Christian perspective; the Epistle to the Hebrews praises {{him for his}} faith. Ambrose, following the portrayal of Josephus and Pseudo-Philo, represents Delilah as a Philistine prostitute, and declares that [...] "men should avoid marriage with those outside the faith, lest, instead of love of one's spouse, there be treachery." [...] Caesarius of Arles interpreted Samson's death as prefiguring the crucifixion of Jesus, remarking: [...] "Notice here {{an image of the}} cross. Samson <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> hands spread out to the two columns as to the two beams of the cross." [...] He also equates Delilah with Satan, who tempted Christ.|$|E

Upon doing so, David sees visions of Elijah orchestrating several terrorist disasters, including David's recent train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. David is horrified, but Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find him. Calling himself [...] "Mr. Glass", a nickname his peers had used to taunt him with when he was growing up, he explains that his own purpose in life is to be the villain to David's hero.|$|E
