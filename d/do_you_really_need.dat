Much of the fandom's ridicule from others comes from {{the perception of the}} mostly adult male fanbase enjoying a show that is marketed to the young female demographic. Through this, the brony community has encountered ridicule through trolling on internet forums, not only from its inception at 4chan, but after moving away from the site. This has also been called out in popular media. The Fox News Channel comedy talk program Red Eye poked fun at the fandom because it largely consists of young adult males. Kurt Schlichter of BigHollywood.com called the phenomenon a [...] "terrifying new trend", and wrote, [...] "Hollywood, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to enable the creepy immaturity of these geebos?

5000|$|Although on {{the surface}} level Esther's life {{seems to be in}} perfect order - she has got a good job, she is happily married, her {{children}} are well-behaved, they all are quite wealthy, they do not suffer from any illnesses - Esther is constantly suffering in some way or other. She has always seen herself as [...] "a person with so much to sort out", and this is why she has been in analysis for a quite a number of years. She spends a fortune on it and even has to sell her mother's diamond ring. At one point in the novel, she learns the difference between compulsive and obsessive behaviour (compulsive behaviour is to do with action, obsessive behaviour with thoughts) and promptly thinks she herself shows both types of behaviour. She suffers from agoraphobia as well as claustrophobia. When she was 15, back home in Australia, her father let her drive his car in public until they were stopped by the police. Now, as an adult, she is afraid to drive, and considers herself lucky that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>really</b> <b>need</b> a car in New York City. She is neurotic, a woman with [...] "excessive anxieties and indecisions", and likely to panic when having to face things. She is all for drugs: beta blocker, Valium, Mylanta, and other pills. On the other hand, Esther neither smokes nor drinks.|$|R

When she came to my father {{and asked him to}} give her an office, he replied, 'Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> one?'"

5000|$|Cliff Ramshaw {{reviewed}} Encyclopedia Magica Volume Four for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. He stated, [...] "Let's face it, if you've {{already got}} the previous volumes you're pretty much committed to buying Encyclopedia Magica Volume Four." [...] While he figured {{that the goal}} of completeness was [...] "all very well", he argued that [...] "the Encyclopedia takes things a bit far. Under the entry for Swords there's a set of tables for determining the properties of Special Swords. Under the entry for Weapons there's a near identical set of tables for determining the properties of Intelligent Weapons. There are three different versions of Excalibur. Many items are tied so intimately to a specific dungeon that they'd be useless outside it; not a few are just plain silly. And once you've read about a ring of protection, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> official approval before introducing a cloak of protection to your campaign?" [...] Ramshaw ended the review by concluding that despite the cost of all four volumes, [...] "one volume isn't much use without its pals - so only the most dedicated of collectors are likely to be tempted." ...|$|E

The answer is definitely YES, if you care about presenting a professional image, building successful business relationships, earning the respect of your colleagues and clients, and effectively representing your organization in a variety of settings. People who are successful and effective in their careers develop not only an expertise in their field, but an overall polish in appearance and behavior. They know how to greet others and make introductions, converse on many subjects, dine with dignity and treat people of all levels with respect. Observe someone in your organization whom you respect and view as successful. Notice how the person can move effortlessly from the conference table to the dining table, handle a variety of challenges without self consciousness, and put colleagues and friends at ease. By learning and practicing etiquette skills, you can develop a demeanor that will increase your level of comfort in social and business settings. Your polish an...|$|E
40|$|Journal, I kept {{wondering}} {{how all the}} projects that experience massive escalations ever get approved in the first place. Look at Mark Keil’s 10 -question, one-minute test for factors that promote software project escalation [11]. Question 1 asks if the project charter is missing. If the answer is yes, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to go further? How many projects come in on budget, finish on time, and succeed — really succeed — without a project charter? If you don’t {{know what you are}} sup-posed to be accomplishing, for whom, when, and why, {{how do you know when}} you have done it? Question 2 asks if the user / customer needs are ill defined. If the answer to that is yes, again, why is the project funded in the first place? And if the answer to both questions is yes, then what’s your probability of success? Question 3 asks if the scope, complexity, or schedule was underestimated from the beginning. If the answer is yes, then your organization will get the project it deserves. I would ask instead, why do you need 10 questions to figure out that you are going to have a project escalation? If you are answering yes to these questions, wh...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} several years, {{there have been a}} growing number of {{researchers}} working together to push forward the field of top-down proteomics. In its most basic form, top down (TD) involves observing intact proteins and incorporating the intact masses derived either from mass spectra or gels in the reported description of the proteins. In most applications, intact mass information alone is not enough to unambiguously identify a protein, and so tandem mass spectrometry must be performed. The most complete incarnation of TD involves observing a native (i. e., unchanged from its in vivo state) protein/peptide in a mass spectrometer, followed by its isolation and fragmentation. From the precursor and fragment ion masses, one can then make an unambiguous determination of not just the protein identity, but also its native post-translational state. This includes all post-translational modifications, proteolytic cleavages (e. g., signal peptide cleavages), amino acid changes from non-synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms, and primary structure changes due to alternative splice variants. In this educational session, we will discuss some of the basic questions surrounding top-down proteomics. What is it? Why do it? How is it done? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> a $ 700, 000 instrument to do it? We will also include some recent results from some of the top labs that are using TD technology to explore both targeted and proteome-wide problems. We hope to pique your interest in this growing field and engender lively discussion...|$|E

Then this book is for you! Perhaps you have a telescope from years ago, which you used a few times, then put it away in a closet, where it has been gathering dust ever since. Could you still use that telescope, or do you have to buy a new one? And what about all the gadgets on the market now? Which ones <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>need?</b> About how much will it all cost you, and what should you look for when you finally have a night out to look? Antony Cooke will give you those answers, and outline a program for star (and Solar System) gazing that {{you will be able to}} fit into your busy life. He tells why it is imperative to get yourself the right equipment from the start (without breaking the bank!) and why he thinks it is important to focus on live viewing rather than fancy gadgetry and imaging techniques.
