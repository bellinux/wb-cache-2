They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

I had just discovered Britten for myself.

He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father.

According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program.

It also showed a neon-style aspect of the video, where Roberts wore Nike Air Max trainers, with neon moving sperm-shaped graffiti moving to the beat of the track. OK! magazine responded well whilst noting her unusually short dress in the video, they said [...] "we can't help but feel upbeat and summery when watching the star bounce about for single Lucky Day." [...] Aaron Spencer-Charles of Metro gave a mixed review, whilst describing the video, he ended with [...] "and that's it really.

500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament I reckon to beat." [...] Despite some {{bumps in the road}} and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well".

Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> slept with a loaded gun beside my bed."

After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry."

[...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song about that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles.

I may be hardheaded, but that's what I believe. We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch.

In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've been thinking about it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to take the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his."
