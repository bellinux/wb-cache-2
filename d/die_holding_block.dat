50|$|A victim cache is a cache used to <b>hold</b> <b>blocks</b> {{evicted from}} a CPU cache upon replacement. The victim cache lies between the main cache and its refill path, and only <b>holds</b> <b>blocks</b> that were evicted {{from the main}} cache. The victim cache is usually fully associative, and is {{intended}} {{to reduce the number}} of conflict misses. Many commonly used programs do not require an associative mapping for all the accesses. In fact, only a small fraction of the memory accesses of the program require high associativity. The victim cache exploits this property by providing high associativity to only these accesses. It was introduced by Norman Jouppi from DEC in 1990.|$|R

50|$|The {{percussion}} fuze {{was adopted}} by Britain in 1842. Many designs were jointly examined by the army and navy, but were unsatisfactory, probably because of the safety and arming features.

It was a wooden fuze some 6 inches long and used shear wire to <b>hold</b> <b>blocks</b> between the fuze magazine and a burning match. The match was ignited by propellant flash and the shear wire broke on impact. A British naval percussion fuze made of metal did not appear until 1861.|$|R
40|$|CONSIDERABLE {{progress}} is being made in the preservation of fowl semen. Wilcox (1960) demonstrated a pro-nounced improvement in fertilizing ability of stored semen by using specific diluents. More recently Harris and Hobbs (1964) reported on the effect of different diluent rates and the effects of C 02 level on fowl semen stored in carbon dioxide extenders. The objective {{of this study was to}} inves-tigate storage of chicken semen by mea-suring the effect of different gaseous envi-ronments on the fertilizing ability of fowl semen when stored for several hours in Cryovac enclosures at 10 °C. MATERIALS AND METHODS The initial experiment in this study was designed to study the effect of a nitrogen gaseous environment on fowl semen. For this test, referred to here as test 1, fifty Leghorn males were milked as described by Borrows and Quinn (1937) in rapid succession. Test 1 was conducted when the Leghorn flock was 280 days of age. The semen was pooled, mixed and dispensed to 36 graduated vials so that each contained 0. 6 ml. of semen. The 36 uncorked vials were assigned to 4 <b>holding</b> <b>blocks</b> of 9 vials each. Each <b>holding</b> <b>block</b> was inserted in a Cryovac bag with dimensions of 9 " X 16 ".
