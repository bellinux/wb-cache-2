25|$|Although a {{mainstay}} of <b>display</b> <b>technology</b> for decades, CRT-based computer monitors and televisions constitute a dead technology.

The rapid advances and falling prices of LCD flat panel technology, first for computer monitors and then for televisions, has been the key factor in the demise of competing display technologies such as CRT, rear-projection, and plasma display.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Our {{goal was}} to {{evaluate}} {{the degree to which}} <b>display</b> <b>technologies</b> influence the perception of size in an image. Background: Research suggests that factors such as whether an image is displayed stereoscopically, whether a user’s viewpoint is tracked, and the field of view of a given display can affect users’ perception of scale in the displayed image. Method: Participants directly estimated the size of a gap by matching the distance between their hands to the gap width and judged their ability to pass unimpeded through the gap in one of five common implementations of three <b>display</b> <b>technologies</b> (two head-mounted <b>displays</b> [HMD] and a back-projection screen). Results: Both measures of gap width were similar for the two HMD conditions and the back projection with stereo and tracking. For the displays without tracking, stereo and monocular conditions differed from each other, with monocular viewing showing underestimation of size. Conclusions: <b>Display</b> <b>technologies</b> that are capable of stereoscopic display and tracking of the user’s viewpoint are beneficial as perceived size does not differ from real-world estimates. Evaluations of different <b>display</b> <b>technologies</b> are necessary as display conditions vary and the availability of different <b>display</b> <b>technologies</b> continues to grow. Applications: The findings are important to those using <b>display</b> <b>technologies</b> for research, commercial, and training purposes when {{it is important for the}} displayed image to be perceived at an intended scale...|$|R

25|$|This used tiny microcapsules {{filled with}} {{electrically}} charged white particles suspended in a colored oil. In early versions, the underlying circuitry controlled whether the white particles {{were at the}} top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known electrophoretic <b>display</b> <b>technology,</b> but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.|$|E
25|$|Electronic paper, {{also called}} e-paper, is a <b>display</b> <b>technology</b> {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} appearance of ordinary ink on paper. Electronic paper reflects light like ordinary paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely without drawing electricity, while allowing the image to be changed later. Applications of e-paper technology include e-book readers capable of displaying digital versions of books, magazines and newspapers, electronic pricing labels in retail shops, time tables at bus stations, and electronic billboards. Electronic paper was invented in 1973 by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometres across.|$|E

The order carried an estimated retail price of $3.7 billion, though the actual price Skybus would have paid had not been announced. Additionally, the aircraft were going to come with a 12-year maintenance agreement that was new for Airbus and Skybus was the launch customer for this service plan which helped them manage maintenance costs. Additionally, the aircraft would have been equipped with the latest in EFB (electronic flight bags) and HUD (heads up <b>display)</b> <b>technology,</b> as well as TCAS II terrain and traffic avoidance technology which is integrated in with an EGPWS technology box that protects from terrain collision. Skybus planned to lease aircraft of the same type until the new aircraft were to begin delivery in late 2008.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{graphics}} {{has always}} pushed {{the limits of}} <b>display</b> <b>technology,</b> and has seen a number of cycles of integration and separation of compute-host and display. Early systems like Project MAC were bespoke and unique, but in the 1970s the MMS-X and similar systems used (relatively) low-cost terminals, such as the Tektronix 4014 series, often over dial-up lines to multi-user hosts. The devices could only display static pictures but were able to evangelize MG. In the late 1970s, {{it was possible for}} departments (such as crystallography) to afford their own hosts (e.g., PDP-11) and to attach a display (such as Evans & Sutherland's PS-1) directly to the bus. The display list was kept on the host, and interactivity was good since updates were rapidly reflected in the display—at the cost of reducing most machines to a single-user system.|$|E
25|$|A vaccine induces active {{immunity}} when antigens are injected into {{an animal that}} cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In passive immunity the desired antibody titers are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated {{as early as the}} 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility. Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing contraceptive vaccines to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market. Research done using phage <b>display</b> <b>technology</b> on lymphocytes from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens. This detailed molecular knowledge of anti-sperm antibodies may be of use {{in the development of a}} passive immunocontraceptive product.|$|E
25|$|Due to the LCD layer {{that generates}} the desired high {{resolution}} images at flashing video speeds using very low power electronics {{in combination with}} these excellent LED based backlight technologies, LCD technology has become the domination <b>display</b> <b>technology</b> for products such as televisions, desktop monitors, notebooks, tablets, smartphones and mobile phones. Although competing OLED technology is pushed to the market, such OLED displays does not feature the HDR capabilities like LCDs in combination with 2D LED backlight technologies have, reason why the annual market of such LCD-based products is still growing faster (in volume) than OLED-based products while the efficiency of LCDs (and products like portable computers, mobile phones and televisions) may even be further improved by preventing the light to be absorbed in the colour filters of the LCD. Although until today such reflective colour filter solutions are not yet implemented by the LCD industry and did not made it further than laboratory prototypes, such reflective colour filter solutions still likely will be implemented by the LCD industry to increase the performance gap with OLED technologies).|$|E

500|$|Sora {{was planned}} as an {{artificial}} intelligence from the start, but because Uchikoshi thought robots seemed cliche, and holograms {{could not move}} around to different places, {{he came up with}} the idea of her being an image shot onto people's eyes with a laser; thinking that if a layman like himself could come up with the idea of such technology, an expert in the field could have been working on developing it already, so he researched it and found out about retinal scanning <b>display</b> <b>technology,</b> and made use of it in the game's story. The full names of both the original You and her clone were taken from a name dictionary, and were initially challenged by KID's marketing team, who thought they sounded [...] "lame"; they relented after Nakazawa explained that the names had a meaning and could not be changed. Because Uchikoshi liked the film Interview with the Vampire, he conceived Tsugumi as being a vampire; the staff did not like this idea, so it was scrapped, but the concept of her being immortal was kept, which led to the introduction of the Curé Virus in the story, as Uchikoshi considered the spreading of vampirism similar to a virus. Another remnant of the vampire concept was kept in Sara, who has infrared vision and can see in the dark. Sara was noted by Uchikoshi as being the otherwise single [...] "normal" [...] person in the cast, offsetting the balance; because of this, she was made into the Kid's twin sister.|$|E
