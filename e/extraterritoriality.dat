5|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} Taw Cheng Kong stands as {{authority}} for {{the proposition that the}} Singapore courts will apply in domestic law the rules and principles of public international law that have previously been received into the common law. The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of customary international law that had been received into the common law, that is, the presumption against <b>extraterritoriality,</b> and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E
5|$|The {{appellant}} further highlighted {{that section}} 6 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act ("RSIA"), which was enacted shortly after Singapore's independence from Malaysia, provides that Part IV of the Constitution of Malaysia ceased to have effect in Singapore. Since Part IV contains Article 73(a) – the <b>extraterritoriality</b> clause – the appellant argued that its exclusion meant that Singapore's Parliament was not empowered {{to make any}} law which had extraterritorial effect.|$|E
5|$|The case {{received}} extensive {{attention in}} the Japanese media, especially in Okinawa, and the crime sparked a public debate over the U.S. military presence in Japan, the privileges of <b>extraterritoriality,</b> {{as well as the}} fair trial practices of Japanese legal system and the Japanese police. The case involved the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of <b>extraterritoriality,</b> offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|After China's {{defeat in}} the First Opium War, the country was {{forcibly}} opened to foreign trade {{by a number of}} treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties. Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's concession to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal <b>extraterritoriality</b> as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E
5|$|The {{site of the}} UN {{headquarters}} has <b>extraterritoriality</b> status. This affects some {{law enforcement}} where UN rules override the laws of New York City, {{but it does not}} give immunity to those who commit crimes there. In addition, the United Nations Headquarters remains under the jurisdiction and laws of the United States, although a few members of the UN staff have diplomatic immunity and so cannot be prosecuted by local courts unless the diplomatic immunity is waived by the Secretary-General. In 2005, Secretary-General Kofi Annan waived the immunity of Benon Sevan, Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladimir Kuznetsov in relation to the Oil-for-Food Programme, and all were charged in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Benon Sevan later fled the United States to Cyprus, while Aleksandr Yakovlev and Vladimir Kuznetsov decided to stand trial.|$|E
25|$|British {{subjects}} were placed under consular jurisdiction. Thus, {{for the first}} time, Siam granted <b>extraterritoriality</b> to foreign aliens.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} respect the foreigners' self-government, there were limits on the {{abilities}} of Japanese to enter the settlement and of Japan to exercise police power in the area. Due to the <b>extraterritoriality</b> enforced by unequal treaties, legal disputes involving Westerners were subject to judgment by their consulates. The right to self-government was tied {{to the land of}} the settlement, and thus did not apply outside its boundaries, but the right to consular jurisdiction was tied to the people it applied to, and thus extended even to disputes that occurred outside the settlement. In practice, foreigners claimed the same <b>extraterritoriality</b> outside the settlement that they did inside, which sometimes developed into trouble with the Japanese side.|$|E
25|$|Half {{a century}} later, Western Europe forced {{their way in}} via the Opium War. Led by the British, one western power after another imposed unequal {{treaties}} on China, including provisions of <b>extraterritoriality</b> that excluded Europeans from the application of local laws.|$|E
25|$|A further {{entanglement}} {{consists in}} liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist {{for example in}} the Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the <b>extraterritoriality</b> of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places.|$|E
25|$|The least {{controversial}} {{basis is}} that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts {{that affect the}} fundamental interests of the state, such as spying, even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian Information Technology Act 2000 largely supports the <b>extraterritoriality</b> of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} TVPA of 2000 {{has been}} reauthorized three times, {{the most recent}} being the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. These reauthorizations have clarified definitions of trafficking and forced labor in order both to aid in prosecution of traffickers and to aid the victims of trafficking. The reauthorization versions have also required {{the federal government to}} terminate all contracts with overseas contractors involved in human trafficking or forced labor. <b>Extraterritoriality</b> jurisdiction was also extended to cover all U.S. nationals and permanent residents who are living overseas.|$|E
25|$|In 1842 the Qing Dynasty {{was forced}} to sign the Treaty of Nanking—the first of what the Chinese later called the unequal treaties—which granted an {{indemnity}} and <b>extraterritoriality</b> to Britain, opened five treaty ports to foreign merchants, and ceded Hong Kong Island to the British Empire. The failure of the treaty to satisfy British goals of improved trade and diplomatic relations led to the Second Opium War (1856–60), and the Qing defeat resulted in social unrest within China. In China, the war is considered the beginning of modern Chinese history.|$|E
25|$|Jean de La Forêt {{negotiated}} the capitulations on 18 February 1536, {{on the model}} of previous Ottoman commercial treaties with Venice and Genoa, although they only seem to have been ratified by the Ottomans later, in 1569, with ambassador Claude Du Bourg. These capitulations allowed the French to obtain important privileges, such as the security of the people and goods, <b>extraterritoriality,</b> freedom to transport and sell goods in exchange for the payment of the selamlik and customs fees. These capitulations would in effect give the French a near trade monopoly in the Orient. Foreign vessels had to trade with Turkey under the French banner, after the payment of a percentage of their trade.|$|E
25|$|Finland leases the 19.6km-long Russian {{part of the}} Saimaa Canal from Russia and {{is granted}} <b>extraterritoriality</b> rights. The area {{is not part of}} the EU, it is a special part of Russia. Under the treaty signed by Finnish and Russian governments, Russian law is in force with a few {{exceptions}} concerning maritime rules and the employment of canal staff which fall under Finnish jurisdiction. There are also special rules concerning vessels travelling to Finland via the canal. Russian visas are not required for just passing through the canal, but a passport is needed and it is checked at the border. Euros are accepted for the canal fees. Prior to the 50-year lease renewal coming into effect in February 2012, the Maly Vysotsky Island had also been leased and managed by Finland. Since then it has been fully managed by Russian authorities, and is no longer part of the concession territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century {{was a time of}} {{domestic}} crises and external threats for Joseon Korea (1392–1910). Starting in the 1860s, a series of rebellions caused by excessive taxation and misgovernment threatened the reigning dynasty, while foreign powers — mostly western countries, but also Meiji Japan — used military force to try to open Korea to trade. The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876 opened three Korean ports to commerce and granted Japanese merchants <b>extraterritoriality</b> in these ports. This unequal treaty prompted even more foreign interventions, as it turned Korea into a target of rivalry between imperialist powers. One crucial issue was whether Korea was a sovereign state or a Chinese dependency. Despite Joseon's status as a tributary of Ming (1368–1644) and then Qing (1644–1911) China — which implied the sending of tribute missions and a ritually inferior position of the Korean king vis-à-vis the Chinese emperor — Korea could also dictate both its domestic and foreign policies, creating an ambiguous situation that frustrated western powers.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the First Opium War in 1842, Britain and China {{signed the}} Treaty of Nanking, which {{effectively}} overthrew the original mercantilist system and forced open the ports of Guangzhou, Xiamen ("Amoy"), Fuzhou ("Foochow"), Ningbo ("Ningpo"), and Shanghai to British trading. Seeing that Britain could easily eliminate foreign competition in China with its new privileges and considerable trading prowess, Americans found the need to reestablish their diplomatic relations and commercial equality in China. For the previous fifty-nine years, Americans had been interacting with China merely through their business transactions, without government-to-government communication. As a result, the administration of President John Tyler sent the commissioner Caleb Cushing to negotiate a treaty in which America would receive the same privileges as Britain. Cushing, in the Treaty of Wanghsia in 1844, not only achieved this goal but also won the right of <b>extraterritoriality,</b> which meant that Americans accused of crimes in China were to be tried by American courts only. This treaty was monumental in that it laid the foundation for a more extensive and regulated American trade with China; American ships would no longer make the sporadic—and somewhat reckless—voyages to China so characteristic of the Old China trade.|$|E
25|$|During the Qianlong reign (1735–96) the dynasty {{reached its}} apogee but then began its initial decline in {{prosperity}} and imperial control. The population rose to some 400 million, but taxes and government revenues were fixed {{at a low}} rate, virtually guaranteeing eventual fiscal crisis. Corruption set in, rebels tested government legitimacy, and ruling elites failed to change their mindsets {{in the face of}} changes in the world system. Following the Opium War, European powers imposed unequal treaties, free trade, <b>extraterritoriality</b> and treaty ports under foreign control. The Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) and the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) in Central Asia led to the deaths of some 20 million people, most of them due to famines caused by war. In spite of these disasters, in the Tongzhi Restoration of the 1860s, Han Chinese elites rallied to the defense of the Confucian order and the Qing rulers. The initial gains in the Self-Strengthening Movement were destroyed in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895, in which the Qing lost its influence over Korea and the possession of Taiwan. New Armies were organized, but the ambitious Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 was turned back in a coup by Empress Dowager Cixi, a conservative leader. When the Scramble for Concessions by foreign powers triggered the violently anti-foreign Yihetuan ("Boxers"), the foreign powers invaded China, Cixi declared war on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the Imperial Court to Xi'an.|$|E
500|$|Lim {{noted that}} {{although}} the view held in Singapore appears to be that a country's laws are not presumed to apply extraterritorially, it might be desirable to include a general <b>extraterritoriality</b> clause. He derived support for this statement from Taw Cheng Kong, where the Court of Appeal expressed the following view: ...|$|E
500|$|The complex has {{a street}} address of United Nations Headquarters, New York, NY 10017, USA. For {{security}} reasons, all mail sent to this address is sterilized, so items {{that may be}} degraded can be sent by courier. The United Nations Postal Administration issues stamps, which must be used on stamped mail sent from the building. Journalists, when reporting from the complex, often use [...] "United Nations" [...] rather than [...] "New York City" [...] as the identification of their location {{in recognition of the}} <b>extraterritoriality</b> status.|$|E
500|$|In 1936 the Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs (1936 Trafficking Convention) was {{concluded}} in Geneva. The U.S., led by Anslinger, {{had attempted to}} include the criminalization of all activities in the treaty – cultivation, production, manufacture and distribution – related {{to the use of}} opium, coca (and its derivatives), and cannabis, for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. Many countries opposed this and the focus remained on illicit trafficking. Article 2 of the Convention called upon signatory countries to use their national criminal law systems to [...] "severely" [...] punish, [...] "particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty", acts directly related to drug trafficking. The U.S. refused to sign the final version because it considered the convention too weak, especially in relation to extradition, <b>extraterritoriality</b> and the confiscation of trafficking profits.|$|E
500|$|The United Nations (UN) is an {{intergovernmental}} organization tasked to promote international co-operation {{and to create}} and maintain international order. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was [...] established on 24 October 1945 after World War II {{in order to prevent}} another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan, New York City, and is subject to <b>extraterritoriality.</b> Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. The UN is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful {{intergovernmental organization}} in the world.|$|E
500|$|In 1854 the United States {{pressured}} Japan {{into the}} Convention of Kanagawa, which ended Japan's isolation, but {{was considered an}} [...] "unequal treaty" [...] by the Japanese public, since the US did not reciprocate most of Japan's concessions with similar privileges. In many cases Japan was effectively forced into a system of <b>extraterritoriality</b> that provided for the subjugation of foreign residents {{to the laws of}} their own consular courts instead of the Japanese law system, open up ports for trade, and later even allow Christian missionaries to enter the country. Shortly after the end of Japan's seclusion, in a period called [...] "Bakumatsu" [...] (幕末, [...] "End of the Shogunate"), the first German traders arrived in Japan. In 1860 Count Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg led the Eulenburg Expedition to Japan as ambassador from Prussia, a leading regional state in the German Confederation at that time. After four months of negotiations, another [...] "unequal treaty", officially dedicated to amity and commerce, was signed in January 1861 between Prussia and Japan.|$|E
500|$|Finally, {{in chapter}} ten Townsend affirms that the [...] "backward Chinese" [...] are America’s [...] "only {{legitimate}} problem in Asia" [...] and asks {{what can be}} done to deal with a nation that spends aid money corruptly, does not respect its loans, mistreats and attacks foreigners, ignores international drug laws, will not protect foreign investment, and does not engage in productive diplomacy with other nations. He warns Americans that the Chinese see kindness only as weakness and thus can never respond to any type of positive reinforcement. [...] "For every Chinese, from highest to lowest," [...] he argues, [...] "all the acts of life are concentrated upon extracting, from those who mean nothing to him, what he can for the benefit of himself and his clan." [...] By contrast, he believes that the Chinese do understand force and respect strength. Therefore, he advocates that the United States forgo naive [...] "sentimentalist" [...] thinking and adopt a policy of [...] "stern insistence upon our rights without cruel abuse of our strength", including withholding further loans without strict conditions and holding on to foreign concessions and <b>extraterritoriality.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The , {{also called}} the Harris Treaty, between the United States and Japan was signed {{on the deck of}} the [...] in Edo (now Tokyo) Bay on July 29, 1858.

2500|$|<b>Extraterritoriality.</b> Robert Stack of the IRS {{said that}} <b>extraterritoriality</b> was {{incorrect}} (a myth): [...] "FATCA has received considerable international support because most foreign governments recognize how effective FATCA, {{and in particular}} our intergovernmental approach, will be in detecting and combating tax evaders". [...] The legislation enables US authorities to impose regulatory costs, and potentially penalties, on FFIs who otherwise have few if any dealings with the US. [...] The U.S. has sought to ameliorate that criticism by offering reciprocity to potential countries who sign intergovernmental agreements (IGAs), {{but the idea of}} the US Government providing information on its citizens to foreign governments has also proved controversial. [...] The law's interference in the relationship between individual Americans or dual nationals and non-American banks led Georges Ugeux to term it [...] "bullying and selfish." [...] The Economist called FATCA's [...] "extraterritoriality stunning even by Washington's standards." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Normanton Incident fanned an {{increase}} in anti-British and anti-foreign sentiment in Japan, and was upheld {{as an example of}} the urgent need to revise the Unequal Treaties which Japan had signed with various foreign powers, especially with regards to clauses pertaining to <b>extraterritoriality.</b> The incident was picked up by the Solidarity Movement Party, then in its infant stages. [...] They raised the issue all across the land, criticizing Inoue's handling of the situation as [...] "coquettish" [...] and [...] "cowardly" [...] diplomacy. [...] As a result of this incident, the movement, which demanded foreign policy reform as well as the abolishment of the Unequal Treaties, was significantly strengthened.|$|E
2500|$|In 1843, the Treaty of Nanjing {{was signed}} by {{official}} representatives of both Britain and China. [...] It allowed the opening of major five major Chinese ports, granted <b>extraterritoriality</b> to foreigners and their activities in China, indemnification for the opium destroyed and completed the formal acquisition of the island of Hong Kong, which had been officially taken over as a trading and military base since 26 January 1841, though {{it had already been}} used years earlier as a transhipment point. Trade with China, especially in the illegal opium, grew, and so did the firm of Jardine, Matheson and Co, which was already known as the Princely Hong for being the largest British trading firm in East Asia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{end of the}} Corsican Guard, {{triggered}} by an incident that occurred in Rome on August20, 1662, gives an insight into {{the evolution of the}} geopolitical situation in Europe and on the growing French influence in Italy. Toward the middle of the 17th century, the presence in Rome of numerous diplomatic missions of the European states ended up creating a paradoxical situation in which the major powersthrough over-extension of the concept of <b>extraterritoriality,</b> the so-called [...] "liberty of quarters"had in some cases provided their embassies with real military garrisons (whose soldiers were free to bear weapons throughout the city), leading to the transformation of entire areas of the city center into free zones, where criminals and killers could find refuge, untouchable by the law.|$|E
2500|$|The 1536 Franco-Turkish treaty {{allowed the}} French in the Ottoman Empire {{to be judged}} by their own laws, in a French Consular court (a status the Venetians had already been granted), {{exemption}} from the usual taxes and dues levied upon non-Muslim foreigners, and trading concessions. This treaty offered guaranties (especially <b>extraterritoriality)</b> that would become the model for future [...] "unequal treaties" [...] between European and Asian powers. By this agreement, French law courts, churches and valuables would all remain extraterritorial in the Ottoman Empire. In a sense, French possessions in the Ottoman Empire would become the first foreign possessions of the French Crown, effectively a Crown Colony of France. The French protectorate also extended to the Holy Places of Jerusalem. By 1620, one third of France's foreign trade {{was done with the}} Ottoman Empire.|$|E
2500|$|Megacorporations {{control the}} lives of their {{employees}} and command their own armies; the ten largest have <b>extraterritoriality,</b> such as currently enjoyed by foreign heads of state. Technological advances make cyberware (mechanical replacement body parts) and bioware (augmented vat-grown body parts implanted in place of natural organs) common. The Computer Crash of 2029 {{led to the creation of}} the Matrix, a worldwide computer network that users interact with via direct neural interface. When conflicts arise, corporations, governments, organized crime syndicates, and even wealthy individuals subcontract their dirty work to specialists, who then perform [...] "shadowruns" [...] or missions undertaken by deniable assets without identities or those that wish to remain unknown. The most skilled of these specialists, called shadowrunners, have earned a reputation for getting the job done.

2500|$|The deputy {{director}} general of legal affairs of the People's Bank of China, the central bank of the People's Republic of China, Liu Xiangmin said [...] "China's banking and tax laws and regulations do not allow Chinese financial institutions to comply with FATCA directly." [...] The U.S. Department of the Treasury suspended negotiations with Russia in March 2014. Russia, while not ruling out an agreement, requires full reciprocity and abandonment of US <b>extraterritoriality</b> before signing an IGA. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on June 30, 2014 that allowed Russian banks to transfer FATCA data directly to US tax authorities—after first reporting {{the information to the}} Russian government. Russian banks are required to obtain client consent first but can deny service if that consent is not given.

For these reasons, it has been praised as the [...] "best-planned foreign settlement in the Orient". Its <b>extraterritoriality</b> was acknowledged in some of its administrative and financial affairs, and it was managed by an autonomous organization structured with foreign residents (most of whom had interests in east-india company and/or associates) at its center.

2500|$|On July 30, 1937, Tientsin {{fell to the}} Empire of Japan {{as part of a}} {{military}} operation in the Second Sino-Japanese War but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese mostly continued to respect the integrity and <b>extraterritoriality</b> of foreign concessions in Tientsin until 1941. In December 1937, Japanese took Shanghai, China's business capital. It was a major blow to the government of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, as 85% of all Chinese government revenue came from Shanghai. After the loss of Shanghai, the economic ability of China to continue to resist Japan was very much in doubt. Flush with a series of Japanese victories in China, in early January 1938, the Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe announced a set of sweeping [...] "non-negotiable" [...] war aims that would have transformed China into a virtual protectorate of Japan's if implemented.
