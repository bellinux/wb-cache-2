5000|$|<b>Dominicans</b> are {{considered}} to be preachers signified by an [...] "OP" [...] (order of preachers) after their names. <b>Dominicans</b> strive to emulate St. Dominic in all of their various ways of preaching and prayer. Racine <b>Dominicans</b> also align themselves with the holiness and wisdom of St. Catherine of Siena. In fact, S. Suzanne Noffke, OP, a foremost authority of St. Catherine of Siena, {{is a member of the}} Racine <b>Dominicans.</b> She has written numerous books on St. Catherine of Siena.|$|R

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, {{the government of the}} <b>Dominican</b> Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the <b>Dominican</b> Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor the progress of the storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the <b>Dominican</b> Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of the <b>Dominican</b> Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the <b>Dominican</b> Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Copernicia berteroana: Haiti and the <b>Dominican</b> Republic.|$|E
5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} <b>Dominican</b> Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the <b>Dominican</b> Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the <b>Dominican</b> Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the <b>Dominican</b> Republic.|$|E
50|$|During {{twenty-two years}} of Haitian occupation, the Haitians {{implemented}} what some <b>Dominicans</b> {{viewed as a}} brutal military regime. Use of the French language over Spanish was enforced, and the army closed La Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino. In addition, the Haitian army confiscated all church land and property and imposed mandatory military service. This difficult time for the <b>Dominicans</b> created cultural conflicts in language, race, religion and national tradition between the <b>Dominicans</b> and Haitians. Many <b>Dominicans</b> developed a resentment of Haitians, who they saw as oppressors.|$|R
50|$|The middle class, {{which is}} the class with the {{broadest}} colour spectrum, is roughly ⅓ white. Altogether, about 45% of the lower-middle, upper-middle and upper class <b>Dominicans</b> are white, with mixed-race <b>Dominicans</b> reaching a similar proportion.|$|R
5000|$|His second {{main area}} of {{research}} {{has to do with}} race and ethnicity in the United States, and particularly, immigrant incorporation. His second book, [...] "Encountering American Faultlines," [...] details the experience of <b>Dominicans</b> in Providence, and particularly focuses on their racial and ethnic identity formation. Through this case study, Itzigsohn looks at both first and second-generation <b>Dominicans</b> and what their position is within the socioeconomic structure. He finds that second-generation immigrants fare slightly better than their parents but mostly remain in service-based working class occupations. In addition, Itzigsohn finds that while first-generation <b>Dominicans</b> embrace transnational identities, second-generation <b>Dominicans</b> gear more towards a panethnic identity as Latinos.|$|R

5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to the <b>Dominican</b> Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in the <b>Dominican</b> Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the <b>Dominican</b> Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to the <b>Dominican</b> Republic; sixteen nuns from the <b>Dominican</b> Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|In June 1947, Castro {{learned of}} a planned {{expedition}} to overthrow the right-wing military junta of Rafael Trujillo, a U.S. ally, in the <b>Dominican</b> Republic. Widely seen as a dictator, Trujillo utilized a violent secret police which routinely murdered and tortured opponents. Becoming president of the University Committee for Democracy in the <b>Dominican</b> Republic, Castro decided to join the expedition, led by <b>Dominican</b> exile General Juan Rodríguez. Launched from Cuba, the mission began on July 29, 1947; it consisted of around 1,200 men, {{most of whom were}} exiled Dominicans or Cubans. However, the <b>Dominican</b> and U.S. governments were prepared, and soon quashed the rebellion. Grau’s government arrested many of those involved before they set sail, but Castro escaped arrest by jumping off of his naval frigate and swimming to shore at night.|$|E
50|$|A 2011 {{poll found}} that the {{majority}} of <b>Dominicans</b> were unhappy with the government. Nevertheless, although many <b>Dominicans</b> believed that Fernández could lead them through the economic difficulties, they showed themselves to be dissatisfied with his program.|$|R
50|$|On {{the basis}} of his record, Oldebourg concludes that Raymond was a “fanatic”. Later in 1235 the <b>Dominicans</b> were {{required}} to leave Count Raymond’s territories, the Bishop with them, and he left Toulouse in the midst of popular unrest. The <b>Dominicans</b> withdrew to Carcassonne. Bishop Raymond went to Rome, to appeal to Pope Gregory IX for help; the Pope wrote putting pressure on Count Raymond, and the <b>Dominicans</b> negotiated a return to Toulouse in 1236.|$|R
50|$|In 1820, Inglott {{was chosen}} as Prior of the <b>Dominicans</b> at Vittoriosa. Later, while Rector, in 1826 Inglott was also chosen to head the Maltese <b>Dominicans</b> {{on behalf of the}} Sicilian Province. He {{retained}} this office until 1829.|$|R

50|$|Briefly before 1600 Portuguese traders left Solor {{and settled}} in Larantuka. The traders were in {{conflict}} with the <b>Dominicans</b> in Solor, because they were more interested in trade than in Christianization. In 1613 the Dutch occupied Solor and the <b>Dominicans</b> moved to Larantuka, too.|$|R
50|$|Our Lady of Mount Carmel {{is located}} in Purgatorio {{neighborhood}} with a '500 century door and arch. It was built by the <b>Dominicans</b> when they arrived from Uggiano. Due to the earthquake the <b>Dominicans</b> abandoned the church and built the church of St Dominic.|$|R
50|$|Pace {{was born}} at Vittoriosa, Malta, on December 17, 1851. He joined the <b>Dominicans</b> in 1867 at almost 16 years of age.

Due to the colera epidemic which hit the Maltese islands in those days, Pace was sent to Florence, Italy, at the convent of Saint Maximin, to pursue his theological studies there. In 1874 he acquired his colour in philosophy and theology.|$|R
