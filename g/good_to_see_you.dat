2500|$|One other {{incorrect}} {{dialogue is}} after the re-entry blackout. In the movie, Tom Hanks (as Lovell) says [...] "Hello Houston... this is Odyssey... it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again." [...] In the actual re-entry, the Command Module's transmission was finally acquired by a Sikorsky SH-3D Sea King recovery aircraft which then relayed communications to Mission Control. CAPCOM and fellow astronaut Joe Kerwin (not Mattingly, {{who serves as}} CAPCOM in this scene in the movie) then made {{a call to the}} spacecraft [...] "Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over." [...] Jack Swigert, not Lovell, replied [...] "Okay, Joe," [...] and unlike in the movie, this was well before the parachutes deployed; the celebrations depicted at Mission Control were triggered by visual confirmation of their deployment.|$|E
2500|$|This {{does not}} apply in case of the neuter gender {{adjectives}} because nouns do not have neuter gender. Such adjectives are used {{in combination with other}} parts of speech having no gender (infinitive, some pronouns) or in zero subject sentences and tend to describe a general environment. For example, rūsyje buvo vėsu (zero subject sentence) – it was cool in the cellar; gera tave matyti (the gender neutral infinitive (matyti) is the subject) – it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> Moreover, adjectives in neuter can be used as an object (and in some cases – as a subject) as well (a rough equivalent of English [...] "that what is" [...] + adjective): jis matė šilta ir šalta – he saw [...] cold and hot (he went through fire and water). Adjectives that end in -is do not have the neuter gender. Most of the time neuter gender adjectives are written just like feminine adjectives. However, vocally, neuter gender is distinct by different stressing. Also neuter gender does not have any numbers or cases, and it is mostly used for predicatives. Usage in the role of object (like in [...] "jis matė šilta ir šalta") is rare.|$|E

6000|$|Crow, {{with his}} {{revolver}} still gripped in his hand, stepped forward, his face quivering with emotion. [...] "Little Father, it is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you; <b>you</b> are not hurt? Where is Two Horns?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> {{have not}} {{forgotten}} your former instructions in drilling and marching," [...] he said. [...] "I trust {{that during the}} present term we shall see even better results, so that the work done here may compare favorably with that done at West Point." ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[A {{trace of}} genuine feeling in her voice.] It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> too.|$|E

6000|$|HARRY. [Eagerly, shaking him warmly by the hand.] At last. By Jove, it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. You know Knox, don't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Bern!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "How <b>good</b> it is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!</b> We're riding away, <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> The storm burst--and I'm {{a ruined}} woman!... I {{thought you were}} alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not a bit}} changed you are, Nillie," [...] said Mr. Malcolm MacPherson admiringly. [...] "And it's <b>good</b> I'm feeling <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. Are <b>you</b> glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me, Nillie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doing nothing! My God, you've made Mart Haney over new. You've {{converted}} him--as they say, you've redeemed him. Let me {{tell you}} something, little sister, Mart worships you. It does him <b>good</b> just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> You don't expect the moon to fry bacon, do you? Stars don't run pumps! Mart is satisfied. Every time you speak to him or pass by him he gets happy all the way through--I know, for I feel just the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Howdy!" [...] greeted Larry. [...] "It shore is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> men--the fust we've {{come on in}} {{an awful}} hunt through these heah hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, Josie," [...] said O'Gorman, as they seated {{themselves}} on the bench. [...] "How do you like being a sleuth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Jack," [...] he said, and {{indicated}} the galloping team. [...] "The sensation I {{seem to make}} {{shows no signs of}} lessening." ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{few moments}} the officer of the boat stepped into the Ranger's gangway. Cocking his bonnet gallantly, Paul {{advanced}} towards him, making a very polite bow, saying: [...] "Good morning, sir, <b>good</b> morning; delighted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> That's a pretty sword you have; pray, {{let me look at}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me! <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again is like the violets and primroses." [...] She was {{crouching}} close to Lady Fawn, with her hand in that of her friend Lydia. [...] "I haven't a word to say against Lady Linlithgow, but it is like winter here, after dear Richmond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, I do, for it has troubled me a <b>good</b> deal <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> so badgered by {{that very}} uncomfortable old lady. Independence {{is a very}} nice thing, and poverty isn't half as bad as this sort of slavery. But {{you are not going}} to be poor, nor worry about anything. We'll just be married and take mother and Toady home and be as jolly as grigs, and never think of Mrs. K. again,--unless she loses her fortune, or gets sick, or comes to grief in any way. We'd lend her a hand then, wouldn't we, Polly?" [...] and Van's mild face was {{pleasant}} to behold as he made the kindly proposition.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Tom," [...] Andrew said. [...] "I {{heard you}} had just got home, and though it's an {{unhealthy}} country, you're looking very fit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> work, Joseph. I {{have always}} lived in mortal terror of an axe; but {{you seem to}} know how to use one." ...|$|E

40|$|Detta är en tom sida! i Preface The present master thesis {{has been}} made as an {{cooperation}} between the division of Structural Mechanics and the division of Theoretical and Applied Aesthetics at the Inst. of Technology at Lund University. The thesis consists of this book and a booklet, which both should be read together. We {{would like to thank}} our supervisors, Göran Sandberg and Morten Lund, for their engagement, guidance and <b>good</b> critic. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> cooperate gave a supplement to our thought about our own cooperation. Also thanks to Kent Persson for being helpful with the programs we used and for giving good advice. Last we would thank our jury at our presentation for being part of making a great discussion...|$|R
40|$|What’s {{the first}} {{sentence}} you would say when you greet a friend (besides Hi, Hello or Howdy) ? A couple examples come to mind: How are you? How have you been? <b>Good</b> Morning! Nice <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!</b> No doubt {{you can come up}} with a couple more that are similar in the spirit. There are of course cultural and situational differences and people may express their greetings both audibly and physically, such as handshaking, hugging, cheek kissing, or gesturing a wave or a high-five...|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, Rock {{appeared}} on Broadway in Stephen Adly Guirgis' play The Motherfucker with the Hat with Bobby Cannavale and Annabella Sciorra. [...] Rock {{was nominated for}} a Drama League Award. In an interview with Vibe Magazine, Rock stated that he chose to do Broadway because he wanted more people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him [...] "really act. Sometimes when you do comedy, that can be a little formulaic, and it's hard for really <b>good</b> directors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>you</b> can act." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> up there," [...] said Slone. [...] "An' that splendid horse! ... He {{knows what}} he is. It'll break Bostil's heart to see that horse beat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{step into}} my office a minute. It does me <b>good,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again, upon my word, and I can't let you get by without a little pow-wow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless your sweet calm face!" [...] she cried, with an hysterical sob. [...] "It does me <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> Oh, but I {{have been}} sorely tried this day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|While {{she looked}} about {{her for the}} proper egress, {{the door opened and}} {{admitted}} one of the ladies of the house, who advanced with a discreet smile, gently rubbing, under her long loose sleeves, a pair of plump white hands. Isabel recognised Madame Catherine, whose acquaintance she had already made, and begged that she would immediately let her see Miss Osmond. Madame Catherine looked doubly discreet, but smiled very blandly and said: [...] "It will be <b>good</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> I'll take you to her myself." [...] Then she directed her pleased guarded vision to Madame Merle.|$|R
50|$|After Rubicon Springs is Cadillac Hill. Cadillac Hill is {{a series}} of switchbacks up to Observation Point, {{starting}} with a rutted out section with many exposed tree roots. After turning a hairpin the trail becomes very off camber and contains a series of boulders to maneuver around or over. After that is a steep stairstep obstacle to climb. At {{the top of the hill}} is Observation Point, a <b>good</b> place <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where <b>you</b> have just driven and to take a short break before the long dirt road to Lake Tahoe. There are a few small sections of rocks after this but nothing that poses a significant obstacle.|$|R
2500|$|Another of Lynch's {{prominent}} themes is industry, {{with repeated}} imagery of [...] "the clunk of machinery, {{the power of}} pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", {{as can be seen}} with the industrial wasteland in Eraserhead, the factories in The Elephant Man, the sawmill in Twin Peaks and the lawn mower in The Straight Story. Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It makes me feel <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> giant machinery, <b>you</b> know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> Dick," [...] he declared, [...] "like {{coming back}} to the {{primitive}} forces of nature, unchanged, unchanging. The sight of you's enough to stop a revolution." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No apology can {{be needed}} for your {{appearance}} in your own pew, Sir Amyas," [...] said the Major with outstretched hand; [...] "it did my heart <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (forcing a smile). Oh, I'm all right. (Eagerly.) But you, Stephen? How are you? (Excitedly.) Oh, it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again! (Her eyes {{continue}} {{fixed on}} his face pleadingly, questioningly.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{dialogue}} is laughable, the pacing is sluggish and the performances are one-note." [...] Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times wrote: [...] "Fifty Shades of Grey the movie, for the record, {{is not quite}} as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey the book. But that's not saying much." [...] We Got This Covered critic Isaac Feldberg gave the film one and a half stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one a sensual and stylish romance, and the other a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life. Regrettably, the latter and lesser of the two ends up on top.". The Guardian lead film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film one star out of five, calling it [...] "the most purely tasteful and softcore depiction of sadomasochism in cinema history" [...] with [...] "strictly daytime soap" [...] performances. A.O. Scott of The New York Times called the movie [...] "terrible", but wrote that [...] "it might nonetheless be a movie that feels <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> whether <b>you</b> squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Miss Lillian" [...] was a {{favorite}} of the press for her Southern charm and down-to-earth manner. For reporters and interrogators alike, she always had a warm country sass response for every question. One biographer recalls a story about a 1976 encounter between Carter and a reporter from New York who flew down to Plains to meet her: [...] "Miss Lillian greeted her, and said 'Welcome to Plains! It's so nice <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you!</b> Would you like some lemonade? How was your journey? Your dress is beautiful'; pouring out the southern hospitality. And the reporter jumped right in on Miss Lillian and said 'Now Miss Lillian, your son's running for president and said he'll never tell a lie now, as a mother, are you telling me he's never told a lie?' And she goes 'oh, Jimmy tells white lies all the time!' the reporter said 'Tell me what you mean: what is a 'white lie'" [...] And Miss Lillian said 'Remember when I said [...] "Welcome to Plains and how <b>good</b> it is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> That's a white lie'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So behold you of return, my friend! {{you quit}} for ever the sword and those arid plains {{where you have}} passed {{so many years of}} your life, {{separated}} from those to whom, at the commencement, you held very nearly. Did it not seem once as if two hands never could unlock, so closely were they enlaced together? Ah, mine are old and feeble now; forty years have passed since the time when you used to say they were young and fair. How well I remember me of every one of those days, though there is a death between me and them, and it is as across a grave I review them! Yet another parting, and tears and regrets are finished. Tenez, I do not believe them when they say there is no meeting for us afterwards, there above. <b>To</b> what <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>you,</b> friend, if we are to part here, and in Heaven too? I have not altogether forgotten your language, is it not so? I remember it because it was yours, and that of my happy days. I radote like an old woman as I am. M. de Florac has known my history from the commencement. May I not say that after so many of years I have been faithful to him and to all my promises? When the end comes with its great absolution, I shall not be sorry. One supports the combats of life, but they are long, and one comes from them very wounded; ah, when shall they be over? ...|$|R
