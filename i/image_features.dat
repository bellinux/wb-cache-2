25|$|Fasanella {{served two}} stints in reform schools {{run by the}} Catholic Church for truancy and running away from home. He later said he was sexually abused ("used as a girl") by the priests. These {{experiences}} instilled a deep dislike for authority and reinforced Fasanella's hatred for anything which broke people's spirits. Fasanella later depicted his experience in reform school in a painting titled Lineup at the Protectory 2 (1961). The melancholy <b>image</b> <b>features</b> rows of boys standing at attention, watched over by scowling, ominous-looking priests. Fasanella quit school after the sixth grade.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{original}} goals of tone mapping was {{to be able to}} reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different <b>image</b> <b>features.</b> Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem.|$|E
