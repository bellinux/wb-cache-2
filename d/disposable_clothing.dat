5000|$|The company {{dates back}} to 1989, when Piotr and Wiesław Żyznowski started a new {{business}} under the name Mercator Żyznowski i Spółka Partnership. In 1993, it {{was transformed into a}} joint stock company. Further development made it necessary to divide the company into three independent partnerships. As a result, the following entities were established: Mercator Medical S.A., in 1996, and Mercator Papier S.A. and Mercator Poligrafia S.A., in 1998. The company started its business operations by distributing medical and protective gloves. Over the course of time, the product line was extended to include dressings, <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing</b> and surgical drapes. The company holds the following certificates: ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 13485:2003. [...] In 2011 these were extended to include the manufacture of medical examining gloves and dressings, purchasing, storing, packaging and customising, as well as domestic sales and export of medical products and personal protective equipment. Mercator Medical is the first polish company which has done industrial investment in Thailand. Company has 1% of sales of medical gloves globally, delivers medical products to 45 countries in the world.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} in a laminar-flow operating room between total-body exhaust gowns and a clothing system made from Fabric 450. This <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing</b> {{was found to be}} much more comfortable and convenient than the total-body exhaust gowns. The average airborne bacterial counts obtained during total hip replacement operations from each of the clothing systems were identical when the downflow method of ventilation was used (0. 7 per cubic mefre) and no significant difference could be demonstrated when the crossflow system was used (2. 2 per cubic mefre with the total-body exhaust gowns and 3. 1 per cubic metre with the <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing).</b> Tests in a dispersal chamber were carried out to find the effectiveness of each item of the <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing</b> in reducing bacterial dispersion. These tests demonstrated the relative ineffectiveness of wearing a surgical gown as compared with wearing the complete system. It was confirmed bacteriologically that the downflow system of ventilation was more efficient than the crossflow type; the importance of this observation with respect to clothing and sepsis is discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{surgical}} site infections {{has become more}} critical during the last years. The number of airborne microbes depends on the number released by the staff in the room or supplied from neighbouring rooms. In order {{to minimize the risk}} of nosocomial infections during surgical procedures technical developments like ventilation systems were introduced in the operating room (OR). In this study several factors like clothing and types of ventilation systems have been investigated and their impact on the effectiveness for reducing microbial burden in the OR has been assessed. In case of OR-gowns we found a benefit for a <b>disposable</b> Swedish <b>clothing</b> concept regarding microbiological contamination in comparison with the German standard multiuse clothing. Moreover our study shows that there is comparable effectiveness of a fairly novel temperature controlled airflow ventilation system (TAF) compared to standard low turbulent uni-directional airflow (TAV) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Advanced Clothing System (ACS) is to use {{advanced}} commercial off-theshelf {{fibers and}} antimicrobial treatments {{with the goal of}} directly reducing the mass and volume of a logistics item. The current clothing state-of-the-art on the International Space Station (ISS) is <b>disposable,</b> mostly cotton-based, <b>clothing</b> with no laundry provisions. Each clothing article has varying use periods and will become trash. The goal is to increase the length of wear of the clothing to reduce the logistical mass and volume. The initial focus has been exercise clothing since the use period is lower. Various ground studies and an ISS technology demonstration have been conducted to evaluate clothing preference and length of wear. The analysis indicates that use of ACS selected garments (e. g. wool, modacrylic, polyester) can increase the breakeven point for laundry to 300 days...|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} the Constellation Program, which will return humans {{to the moon and}} {{establish}} an Outpost, NASA has conducted an analysis of crew clothing and laundry options. Single-use or "disposable" clothing has been used from Apollo until International Space Station (ISS) missions, meaning that clothes were worn for the whole mission or thrown away when they became too dirty to wear any longer. This is justified for short duration missions; however, as the Constellation mission will last much longer and each individual Outpost mission is expected to last up to 180 days, mission goals and launch penalties for mass and volume may lead to a different conclusion. Furthermore, the habitat atmosphere pressure and therefore oxygen volume percentage will be different from ISS or Shuttle. Almost daily EVA sorties will be a norm during Outpost exploration missions. All of these factors will have impacts on selection of crew clothing and laundry options for Outpost missions. Mass and volume estimates for disposable crew clothing have been shown as a major penalty in long-duration manned space exploration missions in previous analyses. Assuming <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing</b> like ISS, Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of crew clothing and hygiene towels was estimated to be 11, 000 kg or about 11 % of total life support system ESM for a 10 -year Lunar Outpost mission with 4 crew members. Ways to reduce this clothing penalty, which are discussed in this paper, include: a) Reduce clothing supply rate through using clothes made of advanced fabrics; b) Reduce daily usage rate by extending its use duration before disposing; and c) Use laundry and reusable clothing. The report summarizes recent research efforts in advanced clothing, proposed clothing supply rates for Exploration missions, results of a trade-off study between <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing</b> and laundry, and conclusions and suggestions for Constellation Program clothing...|$|E
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{incidents}} at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities involving {{the migration of}} radioactive contaminants through protective clothing. The authors analyzed 68 occurrence reports for the following factors: (1) type of work; (2) working conditions; (3) type of anti-contamination (anti-C) material; (4) area of body or clothing contaminated; and (5) nature of spread of contamination. A majority of reports identified strenuous work activities such as maintenance, construction, or decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) projects. The reports also indicated adverse working conditions that included hot and humid or cramped work environments. The type of anti-C clothing most often identified was cotton or water-resistant, <b>disposable</b> <b>clothing.</b> Most of the reports also indicated contaminants migrating through perspiration-soaked areas, typically in the knees and forearms. On {{the basis of their}} survey, the authors recommend the use of improved engineering controls and resilient, breathable, waterproof protective clothing for work in hot, humid, or damp areas where the possibility of prolonged contact with contamination cannot be easily avoided or controlled...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn November 2012, a {{dairy farmer}} in the {{district}} Kleve first observed a reduction in milk yield, respiratory symptoms, nasal discharge, fever, sporadic diarrhoea and sudden deaths in dairy cows and calves. In the following months, further farms were found infected with cattle showing similar clinical signs. An epidemiological investigation was carried out to identify the source of infection, the date of introduction, potential transmission pathways and to analyse {{the extent of the}} epidemic. Furthermore, laboratory analyses were conducted to characterise the causative agent. BVDV had been diagnosed in the index herd in December 2012, but due to the atypical clinical picture, the virus was not immediately recognised as the causative agent. Further laboratory analysis showed that this outbreak and subsequent infections in the area were caused by a BVD type 2 c virus with a characteristic genome insertion, which seems {{to be associated with the}} occurrence of severe clinical symptoms in infected cattle. Epidemiological investigations showed that the probable date of introduction was in mid-October 2012. The high risk period was estimated as three months. A total of 21 affected farms with 5325 cattle were identified in two German Federal States. The virus was mainly transmitted by person contacts, but also by cattle trade and vehicles. The case-fatality rate was up to 60 % and mortality in outbreak farms varied between 2. 3 and 29. 5 %. The competent veterinary authorities imposed trade restrictions on affected farms. All persons who had been in contact with affected animals were advised to increase biosecurity measures (e. g. using farm-owned or <b>disposable</b> protective <b>clothing).</b> In some farms, affected animals were vaccinated against BVD to reduce clinical signs as an “emergency measure”. These measures stopped the further spread of the disease...|$|R
