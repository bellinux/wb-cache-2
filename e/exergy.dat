25|$|After {{finding the}} {{chemical}} <b>exergy</b> {{in a given}} system, one can find the total <b>exergy</b> by adding it to the thermomechanical <b>exergy.</b> Depending on the situation, the amount of chemical <b>exergy</b> added can be very small. If the system being evaluated involves combustion, the amount of chemical <b>exergy</b> is very large and necessary to find the total <b>exergy</b> of the system.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{thermomechanical}} <b>exergy,</b> chemical <b>exergy</b> {{depends on}} the temperature and pressure of a system {{as well as on}} the composition. The key difference in evaluating chemical <b>exergy</b> versus thermomechanical <b>exergy</b> is that thermomechanical <b>exergy</b> does not take into account the difference in a system and environment's chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment's state, then the overall system will have <b>exergy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>exergy</b> {{destruction}} of a cycle {{is the sum of}} the <b>exergy</b> {{destruction of}} the processes that compose that cycle. The <b>exergy</b> {{destruction of a}} cycle can also be determined without tracing the individual processed by considering the entire cycle as a single process and using one of the <b>exergy</b> destruction equations.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of chemical <b>exergy</b> resembles the standard {{definition of}} thermomechanical <b>exergy,</b> {{but with a}} few differences. Chemical <b>exergy</b> {{is defined as the}} maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment. Defining the <b>exergy</b> reference environment {{is one of the most}} vital parts of analyzing chemical <b>exergy.</b> In general, the environment is defined as the composition of air at 25°C and 1 atm of pressure. At these properties air consists of N2=75.67%, O2=20.35%, H2O(g)=3.12%, CO2=0.03% and other gases=0.83%. These molar fractions will become of use when applying Equation 8 below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exergy</b> {{analysis}} is {{performed in the}} field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently. The term <b>exergy,</b> was coined by Zoran Rant in 1956, but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs. In recent decades, utilization of <b>exergy</b> has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and energetics.|$|E
25|$|As {{a simple}} example of <b>exergy,</b> air at {{atmospheric}} conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition contains energy but no <b>exergy</b> {{when it is}} chosen as the thermodynamic reference state known as ambient. Individual processes on Earth such as combustion in a power plant often eventually result in products that are incorporated into the atmosphere, so defining this reference state for <b>exergy</b> is useful even though the atmosphere itself is not at equilibrium and is full of long and short term variations.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{is neither}} created nor {{destroyed}} during a process. Energy changes from one form to another (see First Law of Thermodynamics). In contrast, <b>exergy</b> is always destroyed when a process is irreversible, for example loss of heat {{to the environment}} (see Second Law of Thermodynamics). This destruction {{is proportional to the}} entropy increase of the system together with its surroundings. The destroyed <b>exergy</b> has been called anergy. For an isothermal process, <b>exergy</b> and energy are interchangeable terms, and there is no anergy.|$|E
25|$|As it was expected, fossil-fired {{power plants}} {{presents}} the highest specific CO2 emissions, with the {{coal-fired power plants}} leading the group. However, even though fossil-fired power plants presents the most marked environmental impacts, their total unit <b>exergy</b> costs are much lower than that presented by sugar cane bagasse-fired power plants. This shows that, although almost renewable, the typical configurations of sugar cane bagasse-fired power plants are far from being efficient technologies. Hydro and wind farms present the lowest specific CO2 emissions {{as well as the}} lowest unit <b>exergy</b> cost. Due to the high participation of renewable sources in the production of electricity (near to 89% of the total), Brazilian electricity mix emissions are found to be 7.5 and 11.8 times lower than Europe and World electricity mixes. Also, owed to the higher efficiency of hydroelectric power plants, which contribute to the major part of the electricity generation in Brazil, the total unit <b>exergy</b> cost is lower, and thus, <b>exergy</b> efficiency of electricity generation is higher if compared with countries based on fossil fuels for electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|Testing {{this idea}} in living organisms or {{ecosystems}} {{is impossible for}} all practical purposes because of the large time scales and small <b>exergy</b> inputs involved for changes to take place. However, if this idea is correct, {{it would not be a}} new fundamental law of nature. It would simply be living systems and ecosystems maximizing their <b>exergy</b> efficiency by utilizing laws of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Measuring <b>exergy</b> {{requires}} {{the evaluation of}} a system’s reference state environment. With respect to the applications of <b>exergy</b> on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system {{requires the}} assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, {{it is becoming increasingly}} imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources, and how human interference alters this potential.|$|E
25|$|Other qualities {{within a}} {{reference}} state environment include temperature, pressure, and {{any number of}} combinations of substances within a defined area. Again, the <b>exergy</b> of a system is determined by the potential of that system to do work, so it is necessary to determine the baseline qualities of a system before it is possible to understand the potential of that system. The thermodynamic value of a resource can be found by multiplying the <b>exergy</b> of the resource by the cost of obtaining the resource and processing it.|$|E
25|$|Apparently, total <b>exergy</b> cost of {{wind and}} natural-gas fired {{technologies}} are almost the same, but contrarily to the wind power plants, the non-renewable unit <b>exergy</b> costs of NG-fired power plants is practically equal to the total cost. It {{should be noted that}} this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants. If energy storage is {{to be taken into account}} for intermittent technologies such as wind farms, the total <b>exergy</b> cost could be slightly increased. The upstream and downstream CO2 emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total CO2 emissions, if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant. Finally, it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since, according to the results reported by Dones et al., the GHG emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants.|$|E
25|$|Referencing the {{inherent}} qualities {{of a system}} {{in place of a}} reference state environment is the most direct way that ecologists determine the <b>exergy</b> of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the thermodynamic properties of a system, and the reference substances that are acceptable within the reference environment. This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the atmosphere, solids within the Earth’s crust, and molecules or ions in seawater. By understanding these basic models, it’s possible to determine the <b>exergy</b> of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of solar radiation on plant life. These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how <b>exergy</b> can be defined through natural resources.|$|E
25|$|However, from a {{theoretical}} point of view, <b>exergy</b> {{may be defined}} without reference to any environment. If the intensive properties of different finitely extended elements of a system differ, {{there is always the}} possibility to extract mechanical work from the system.|$|E
25|$|Today, it is {{becoming}} increasingly popular to analyze the environmental impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage. To understand the ramifications of these practices, <b>exergy</b> is utilized as a tool for determining the impact potential of emissions, fuels, and other sources of energy. Combustion of fossil fuels, for example, is examined with respect to assessing the environmental impacts of burning coal, oil, and natural gas. The current methods for analyzing the emissions from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the <b>exergy</b> of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to examine these with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the atmosphere. In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.|$|E
25|$|No heat or work {{interactions}} with the surroundings occur, and therefore, there are no transfers of availability between the system and its surroundings. The change in <b>exergy</b> of an isolated system is equivalent, but opposite the value for irreversibility of that system.|$|E
25|$|Equation 9 is more {{commonly}} used due to the simplicity of only having to look up the standard chemical <b>exergy</b> for given substances. Using a standard table works well for most cases, even if the environment conditions vary slightly, the difference is most likely negligible.|$|E
25|$|An exergoeconomic {{assessment}} {{accounting for}} the total and non-renewable unit <b>exergy</b> costs and specific CO2 emissions of Brazilian electricity is performed by Flórez-Orrego et al. (2014), comprising thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind farms and biomass-fired power plants. The analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction, fuel transportation and processing, operation and decommissioning of the plant, with electricity generation as the desired output. This approach allows the calculation of direct CO2 emissions {{as well as the}} upstream and downstream emissions, which {{play an important role in}} some technologies. In this way, a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved. An iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit <b>exergy</b> costs of electricity and processed fuels, since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes.|$|E
25|$|Maximal {{possible}} {{conversion of}} heat to work, or <b>exergy</b> content of heat, {{depends on the}} temperature at which heat is available and the temperature level at which the reject heat can be disposed, that is {{the temperature of the}} surrounding. The upper limit for conversion is known as Carnot efficiency and was discovered by Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. See also Carnot heat engine.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar {{collector}} (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a solar thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes waste {{heat from the}} PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher <b>exergy</b> and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} energy saved through {{recycling}} depends upon the material being recycled {{and the type of}} energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life-cycle analysis using real energy values. In addition, <b>exergy,</b> which is a measure of useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem the}} energy {{analysis}} method cannot resolve is that different energy forms (heat, electricity, chemical energy etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, {{as a consequence}} of the two main laws of thermodynamics. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is <b>exergy.</b> According to the first law of thermodynamics, all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the second law diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exergy</b> {{in a sense}} can be {{understood}} as a measure of value of energy. Since high-exergy energy carriers can be used in for more versatile purposes, due to their ability to do more work, they can be postulated to hold more economic value. This can be seen in prices of energy carriers, i.e. high-exergy energy carriers such as electricity tend to be more valuable than low-exergy ones such as various fuels or heat. This has led to substitution of more valuable high-exergy energy carriers with low-exergy energy carriers, when possible. An example is heating systems, where higher investment to heating systems allows using low-exergy energy sources. Thus high-exergy content is being substituted with capital investments.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} use emergy (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, {{budgets for}} the amount of energy of one kind (<b>exergy)</b> that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by adaptive reuse systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{hypothesis}} {{in systems}} ecology {{is that the}} design engineer's observation that a greater capital investment is needed to create a process with increased <b>exergy</b> efficiency is actually the economic result of a fundamental law of nature. [...] By this view, <b>exergy</b> is the analogue of economic currency in the natural world. The analogy to capital investment is the accumulation of <b>exergy</b> into a system {{over long periods of}} time resulting in embodied energy. [...] The analogy of capital investment resulting in a factory with high <b>exergy</b> efficiency is an increase in natural organizational structures with high <b>exergy</b> efficiency. [...] (See Maximum power). [...] Researchers in these fields describe biological evolution in terms of increases in organism complexity due to the requirement for increased <b>exergy</b> efficiency because of competition for limited sources of <b>exergy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Exergy</b> is a {{combination}} property of a system and its environment because {{it depends on the}} state of both the system and environment. [...] The <b>exergy</b> of a system in equilibrium with the environment is zero. <b>Exergy</b> is neither a thermodynamic property of matter nor a thermodynamic potential of a system. [...] <b>Exergy</b> and energy both have units of joules. The internal energy of a system is always measured from a fixed reference state and is therefore always a [...] state function. [...] Some authors define the <b>exergy</b> of the system to be changed when the environment changes, in which case it is not a state function. [...] Other writers prefer a slightly alternate definition of the available energy or <b>exergy</b> of a system where the environment is firmly defined, [...] as an unchangeable absolute reference state, and in this alternate definition <b>exergy</b> becomes a property {{of the state of the}} system alone.|$|E
2500|$|Does {{the human}} {{production}} {{of an economic}} good deplete the <b>exergy</b> of Earth's natural resources more quickly than those resources are able to receive <b>exergy?</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Exergy</b> {{is useful}} when {{measuring}} {{the efficiency of}} an energy conversion process. [...] The exergetic, or 2ndLaw, efficiency is a ratio of the <b>exergy</b> output divided by the <b>exergy</b> input. [...] This formulation {{takes into account the}} quality of the energy, often offering a more accurate and useful analysis than efficiency estimates only using the First Law of Thermodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|In thermodynamics, the <b>exergy</b> (in older usage, {{available}} work and/or availability) of {{a system}} is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir. When the surroundings are the reservoir, <b>exergy</b> is the potential {{of a system}} to cause a change as it achieves equilibrium with its environment. [...] <b>Exergy</b> is the energy that is available to be used. After the system and surroundings reach equilibrium, the <b>exergy</b> is zero. [...] Determining <b>exergy</b> {{was also the first}} goal of thermodynamics. The term [...] "exergy" [...] was coined in 1956 by Zoran Rant (1904–1972) by using the Greek [...] and [...] meaning [...] "from work", but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs in 1873.|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{proposed by}} systems ecologists is {{to consolidate the}} three <b>exergy</b> inputs described in the last section into the single <b>exergy</b> input of solar radiation, and to express the total input of <b>exergy</b> into an economic good as a solar embodied joule or sej. (See Emergy) <b>Exergy</b> inputs from solar, tidal, and geothermal forces all at one time had their origins {{at the beginning of}} the solar system under conditions which could be chosen as an initial reference state, and other speculative reference states could in theory be traced back to that time. With this tool we would be able to answer: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>exergy</b> to energy in a {{substance}} {{can be considered}} a measure of energy quality. [...] Forms of energy such as macroscopic kinetic energy, electrical energy, and chemical Gibbs free energy are 100% recoverable as work, and therefore have an <b>exergy</b> equal to their energy. [...] However, forms of energy such as radiation and thermal energy can not be converted completely to work, and have <b>exergy</b> content less than their energy content. [...] The exact proportion of <b>exergy</b> in a substance depends on the amount of entropy relative to the surrounding environment as determined by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, {{comparing}} oil <b>exergy</b> to coal <b>exergy</b> using {{a common}} reference state would require geothermal <b>exergy</b> inputs {{to describe the}} transition from biological material to fossil fuels during millions {{of years in the}} Earth's crust, and solar radiation <b>exergy</b> inputs to describe the material's history before then when {{it was part of the}} biosphere. [...] This would need to be carried out mathematically backwards through time, to a presumed era when the oil and coal could be assumed to be receiving the same <b>exergy</b> inputs from these sources. [...] A speculation about a past environment is different from assigning a reference state with respect to known environments today. Reasonable guesses about real ancient environments may be made, but they are untestable guesses, and so some regard this application as pseudoscience or pseudo-engineering.|$|E
2500|$|One goal {{of energy}} and <b>exergy</b> methods in {{engineering}} is to compute what comes {{into and out of}} several possible designs before a factory is built. Energy input and output will always balance according to the First Law of Thermodynamics or the energy conservation principle. <b>Exergy</b> output will not balance the <b>exergy</b> input for real processes since a part of the <b>exergy</b> input is always destroyed according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics for real processes. After the input and output are completed, the engineer will often want to select the most efficient process. An energy efficiency or first law efficiency will determine the most efficient process based on wasting as little energy as possible relative to energy inputs. [...] An <b>exergy</b> efficiency or second-law efficiency will determine the most efficient process based on wasting and destroying as little available work as possible from a given input of available work.|$|E
2500|$|In recent decades, {{utilization}} of <b>exergy</b> has spread outside {{of physics and}} engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and energetics. [...] Defining where one field ends and the next begins {{is a matter of}} semantics, but applications of <b>exergy</b> can be placed into rigid categories.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>exergy</b> is also used, {{by analogy}} with its {{physical}} definition, in information theory related to reversible computing. [...] <b>Exergy</b> is also synonymous with: availability, available energy, exergic energy, essergy (considered archaic), utilizable energy, available useful work, maximum (or minimum) work, maximum (or minimum) work content, reversible work, and ideal work.|$|E
2500|$|Irreversibility {{accounts}} {{for the amount of}} <b>exergy</b> destroyed in a closed system, or in other words, the wasted work potential. For highly efficient systems, the value of I, is low, and vice versa.
