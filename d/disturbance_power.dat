40|$|The basic {{hypothesis}} {{of the paper}} is that machine part surfaces are membranes that divide inner and outer space, receive <b>disturbance</b> <b>power</b> from inner space and emit it to the surroundings. Additionally, machine systems operation causes numerous disturbances such as collisions, sliding, rolling, etc. Gear drives are a very interesting case for analysis of teeth impacts, which cause restorable free vibrations and spreading of <b>disturbance</b> <b>power</b> through elastic structure. The gear unit housing has a dominant role in the transformation of <b>disturbance</b> <b>power</b> and modulation of the sound emitted to the surroundings. This is an important detail for monitoring and diagnostics by emitted noise measurements. By combination of theoretical, numerical and experimental analyses, using a classical gear drive unit (reducer), this article explains the process of spreading <b>disturbance</b> <b>power</b> through the elastic structure, especially {{the role of the}} gear unit housing. Its role in the noise frequency spectrum modulation is determined by modal sensitivity to disturbances and noise isolation ability of the housing.

40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the last century {{agricultural}} intensification within Europe has led to a drastic decline in the extent of botanically diverse grasslands. Whilst measures to enhance the diversity of agriculturally-improved grasslands are in place, success has often been limited. One of the primary factors limiting success is the paucity of sources of propagules of desirable species in the surrounding landscape. The restoration of two contrasting grassland types (lowland hay meadow and chalk grassland) was examined using a replicated block experiment to assess the effectiveness of two methods of seed application (hay strewing and brush harvesting) and two methods of pre-treatment <b>disturbance</b> (<b>power</b> harrowing and turf stripping).

We set a simple model of the disruption region, and admitted that the intensity of the disturbing current, J, is equal to the intensity of FAC, inflowing in the dawn sector of the ionospheric projection of SCW. On such a basis, using the 14 Sep 2004 substorm data, we calculated the values of J, also components Jx and Jy along and across the tail, respectively. For this purpose, by means of the magnetogram inversion technique, maps of the FAC density spatial distribution in the polar ionosphere were calculated. We made calculations separately for the two subsequent phases of the substorm- the pseudobreakup phase (PSR), and the following expansion phase (TLR). We noted that the PSR development in the near tail and sudden expansion of disturbance to the mid- and distant tail both were stimulated by the IMF turning northward.

The range of machines (including one- and two-row models that are pushed, animal drawn or mounted on power tiller mounted units) was introduced by IRRI in 1986.

40|$|Electricity {{is vital}} for our daily life in modern cites. In order to ensure its {{reliability}} and supply, an electric power monitoring system is indispensable in an electric power system. Currently, most electric power monitoring systems are designed for steady-state monitoring only. They {{may not be able}} to monitor instantaneous <b>power</b> <b>disturbances,</b> such as voltage surge, happened in electric power systems. In fact, instantaneous <b>power</b> <b>disturbances</b> are frequently found in electric power systems, which result in equipment failures and cause financial losses. Therefore, a novel electric power monitoring system is proposed in this thesis. Besides traditional functions, the proposed system is capable of monitoring and analyzing instantaneous <b>power</b> <b>disturbances</b> in electric <b>power</b> systems. Novelties of the proposed monitoring system are in the following three major aspects. Firstly, the proposed system is capable of monitoring instantaneous <b>power</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Unlike traditional monitoring systems, the proposed system captures not only statistical power quantities (e. g. kW, kWh), but also voltage and current waveforms. Since a considerable communication network bandwidth is required to transmit electric waveforms in a remote monitoring system, a novel waveform compression algorithm is proposed to realize real-time electric power waveform monitoring on low-speed communication networks (e. g. Zigbee). Secondly, the proposed system is capable of identifying various kinds of <b>power</b> <b>disturbances</b> automatically. It relieves electrical engineers from manned disturbance identification on preserved waveforms. Unlike traditional disturbance identification algorithms, the proposed system can identify not only voltage disturbances, but also current disturbances. Hence, it can provide a better chance in identifying more problems and <b>disturbances</b> in electric <b>power</b> systems. Thirdly, a novel time-frequency analysis method is proposed to analyze preserved waveforms. The proposed method is an improvement to the well-known Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). DWPT has been used by researchers and engineers to analyze disturbances and harmonics in electric power systems. However, DWPT is subjected to a non-uniform leakage problem, which has been discussed intensively in many studies. In order to tackle this issue, a frequency shifting scheme is introduced in the proposed method. A prototype has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed electric power monitoring system. There are two major components – a prototype meter and a central monitoring system. The performance of the prototype has been evaluated by conducting experiments and field tests. The capability of the proposed system for realtime remote monitoring has been verified on Zigbee network, which is a low-power, low speed wireless communication network...|$|R
