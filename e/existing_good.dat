40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{quantitative}} model of Schumpeterian economic dynamics. New {{goods and services}} are endogenously produced through combinations of <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> As soon as new goods enter the market they may compete against already <b>existing</b> <b>goods,</b> in other words new products can have destructive effects on <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> As {{a result of this}} competition mechanism <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> may be driven out from the market - often causing cascades of secondary defects (Schumpeterian gales of destruction). The model leads to a generic dynamics characterized by phases of relative economic stability followed by phases of massive restructuring of markets - which could be interpreted as Schumpeterian business `cycles'. Model timeseries of product diversity and productivity reproduce several stylized facts of economics timeseries on long timescales such as GDP or business failures, including non-Gaussian fat tailed distributions, volatility clustering etc. The model is phrased in an open, non-equilibrium setup which can be understood as a self organized critical system. Its diversity dynamics can be understood by the time-varying topology of the active production networks. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{informal}} {{model is}} described {{that leads to}} multiple macroeconomic equilibria {{as a consequence of}} random variation in the relative amounts of technological change for new and <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> The novel observation is that the rate of introduction and market penetration of new goods (sometimes called product innovation) vis-à-vis technological advance for <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> (sometimes called process innovation) importantly affects the labor supply decision. A relatively rapid influx of new goods will generally increase labor supply, while relatively more technological advance for <b>existing</b> <b>goods</b> will reduce labor supply to the market. These impacts are seen to provide insights into Rostow’s stages of growth. Short run variations in the relative importance of the two types of technological change are seen to imply unpredictable business cycle behavior of the type we observe. The welfare implications of national income accounting that fails to consider changes in leisure are discussed...|$|R

That is to say, {{the rate}} of growth of the number of new goods is {{directly}} proportional to investment in the introduction of new goods — and the proportion is the productivity of new goods —, and is inversely proportional to the cost of developing and producing them, and in the production of <b>existing</b> <b>goods.</b> Once again, entry barriers and costs should be lowered, whereas productivity should be increased.|$|R

Market penetration involves targeting on selling existing goods or services in the targeted markets to increase a better market share/value (Arkolakis, 2010). It can be achieved in four different way including growing the market share of current goods or services; obtaining dominance of existing markets; reforming a mature market by monopolising the market and driving out competitors; or increasing consumptions by existing customers (Free Management Ebooks, 2013).|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of the ineligibility criteria has remained fairly consistent {{throughout the history of}} the award, with some subtle changes. For example, from 2005 until 2014, whether or not a player was ineligible was based on the penalty determined by the Tribunal's Match Review Panel before applying adjustments based on a player's good or bad record, or for accepting an early guilty plea or a player's <b>existing</b> <b>good</b> record - meaning that a player could be ineligible based on an infringement which was worthy of a one-game suspension, but still avoid suspension by taking an early guilty plea on the charge. Since 2015, the criteria has been solely based upon whether or not the player is suspended during the season.|$|E

A logit analysis is conducted to estimate the effects of local monopoly power, cost advantages, and learning.

While the chemical similarity of products has the largest effect, results nonetheless indicate the empirical significance of potential monopoly power in influencing product introductions by multiproduct firms. ...|$|R
