500|$|Feller {{estimated}} that military service cost {{him at least}} 100 career wins. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, {{it is likely that}} Feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. Feller said [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400than 300if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't take that as a complaint.

500|$|Supporters of Rangel {{argued that}} by {{comparison}} with previous cases, a reprimand {{would be a more}} fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. [...] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. [...] It was to no avail. [...] On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. [...] Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's [...] "accumulation of actions" [...] that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. [...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. [...] The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart I am not going to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety." ...|$|E

Rowland said there were initially two songs in the running for the lead single, but [...] "without a doubt we had to go with , I just fell in love with it... It's definitely a club banger. You know the first time I heard it, I went bananas." [...] At Pat Field's Disco Party in New York, she told Universal Music Group executives [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> gut that it felt good. Nobody could take my thoughts away from that.

The official extended dance remix was released alongside the main single on May 18, 2010. In the United Kingdom, [...] "Commander" [...] was planned for a June 28, 2010 release. Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower, smoother sound. American rapper Nelly heard the new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on the remix. It was released as part of the UK Remixes EP. as well as the second U.S. remixes EP. The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19, 2010 confirmed that [...] "Commander" [...] would serve only as the [...] "international lead single", leading to speculation another song would be released domestically. This speculation was confirmed when the Ne-Yo-penned, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off" [...] was set to impact on radio stations in the United States. However those plans were changed and on June 29, 2010 two singles were serviced to impact in the United States.

2500|$|From {{the age of}} 14, Buble {{spent six}} years working during the summer as a {{commercial}} fisherman {{with his father and}} crewmates. He called the experience [...] "the most deadly physical work I'll ever <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lifetime. We'd be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility {{and what it means to}} be a man." ...|$|E
