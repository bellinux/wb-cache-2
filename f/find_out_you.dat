500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> <b>You</b> have got to get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E
2500|$|Columnist Elsa Maxwell, {{commenting on}} Block's {{approach}} to writing, {{said he was}} [...] "serious – almost academic – about being funny." [...] Block was once asked what was the hardest material to write for a comedian. He quipped, [...] "The ad libs!" [...] While it was widely believed that emcee Phil Baker ad-libbed the popular game shows Take It Or Leave It and $64 Question, most of the shows were actually written by Block. An example of what [...] appears to be casual conversation, but was actually a joke written by Block, was for entertainer Kenny Murray to say to his television studio audience: [...] "I don't care whether you laugh at my jokes or not. But it will be pretty embarrassing for you if {{people all over the}} country <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>you</b> don't have a sense of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|His book Either/Or {{discussed}} {{whether or}} not love can be deceived. Is it {{a good thing to}} <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>you</b> have been deceived or is it something that makes you angry? Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness. Leave it solely to God-after all, he knows best how to take care of everything for one who becomes alone by seeking him." ...|$|E
