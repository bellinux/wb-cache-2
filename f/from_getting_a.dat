5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The Merry Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> percentage of the more profitable film. The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{was born}} in 1843 in Niles, Ohio. After service as an Army officer in the Civil War, he became a lawyer and settled in Canton, Ohio. In 1876 {{he was elected to}} Congress, and he {{remained}} there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re-election in a gerrymandered district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. Personal insolvency would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, Mark Hanna. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern bosses such as Thomas Platt and Matthew Quay, and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state favorite son candidates to run and prevent McKinley <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> majority of delegate votes at the Republican National Convention, which might force him to make deals on political patronage. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's Garret Hobart as his running mate.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. Vettel set the fastest times {{in the second and third}} sessions and clinched his fourth pole position of the season with a time of 1:37.587. It was the Red Bull team's eighth pole in the season's nine races. He was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who recorded a lap time 0.075 seconds slower than Vettel. Hamilton qualified third but locked his rear tyres on his final timed heading into turn 17 and slowed down, preventing him from improving his grid position. The two Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth (with Alonso ahead of Massa); Massa encountered slower cars which prevented him from gaining optimum tyre temperature and could not improve his fastest lap time. Kubica took sixth position and felt more movement on his Renault when he had the medium compound tyre equipped. Button had oversteer through turn 24 and made a mistake in the following corner which restricted him to seventh. Nico Hülkenberg was eighth, ahead of Williams teammate Barrichello in ninth who was affected by a brake-warm up problem. Petrov rounded out the top ten and made mistakes on his final timed lap which prevented him <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> better starting position.|$|E

Sayama weighed only 160 pounds, which, even given his training, impaired him <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> permanent spot on NJPW cards.

25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that romantic {{involvement}} in adolescence decreases aggression in males and females, but decreases {{at a higher rate}} in females. Females will seem more desirable to their mate if they fit in with society and females that are aggressive do not usually fit well in society, they can often be viewed as antisocial. Female aggression is not considered the norm in society and going against the norm can sometimes prevent one <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> mate. However, studies have shown that an increasing number of women are getting arrested for domestic violence charges. In many states, women now account for a quarter to a third of all domestic violence arrests, up from less than 10 percent a decade ago. The new statistics reflect a reality documented in research: women are perpetrators as well as victims of family violence. However, another equally possible explanation is a case of improved diagnostics: it has become more acceptable for men to report female domestic violence to the authorities {{while at the same time}} actual female domestic violence has not increased at all. This can be the case when men have become less ashamed of reporting female violence against them, therefore an increasing number of women are arrested, although the actual number of violent women remains the same.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, Miller {{started his}} fourth {{season in the}} VFA. In a match against Coburg, {{regarded}} as one of the strongest teams in the competition, he was assigned to man Bob Pratt, who was regarded as the greatest forward of the era.Perry, p. 44. Pratt had scored 678 goals in ten seasons for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL), the top tier of football, and had scored more than 100 goals in each of his last three seasons. Miller restricted Pratt to one goal for the match and was named as the best on ground. In the third quarter, Miller restricted Pratt to two marks, and in the fourth quarter, he prevented the forward <b>from</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> single kick. Scouts from the VFL club St Kilda signed Miller on the spot. Reacting to Miller's signing, The Age opined that he [...] "is one of the most promising players ever to enter league ranks, and can be played anywhere in defence.

500|$|The Buccaneers routed a Giants {{team that}} came in having won 5 of their past 6 games. Giants quarterback Phil Simms was sacked 5 times for 75 yards, intercepted twice, and gave up two fumbles.

Both sides denied running up the score during either of the season's matchups, though the Tampa players were said to have approached this game as a grudge match. The game was mostly devoid of the trash-talking that had characterized the previous meeting, the Giants having little room for words. The Giants' 3 points was the lowest score allowed by the Buccaneers, and the Buccaneers had their second-highest point total with 31. The Buccaneers used a two-tight end set, providing additional blocking that helped spring Ricky Bell for 152 yards in three quarters of play.

It was short-lived, however; in the 18th minute, Nicky Butt conceded a free-kick for a foul on Vieira. From [...] "about 33 yards out", Henry shot the ball past United's wall and beat Howard in goal.
