40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flexible monocular system capable of recognising sign lexicons far greater in number than previous approaches. The {{power of the}} system is due to four key elements: (i) Head and hand detection based upon boosting which removes the need for temperamental colour segmentation; (ii) A body centred <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> which overcomes issues with camera placement, calibration and user; (iii) A two stage classification in which stage I generates a high level linguistic <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> which naturally generalises and hence reduces training; (iv) A stage II classifier bank which does not require HMMs, further reducing training requirements. The outcome of which is a system capable of running in real-time, and generating extremely high recognition rates for large lexicons with as little as a single training instance per sign. We demonstrate classification rates as high as 92 % for a lexicon of 164 words with extremely low training requirements outperforming previous approaches where thousands of training examples are required. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{functions}} of gestures in preschoolers’ <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities.</b> Specifically, utilizing McNeill’s growth point theory (1992), I examine how gestures contribute {{to the creation of}} contrast from the immediate context in the spoken discourse of children. When preschool children describe an <b>activity</b> consisting <b>of</b> multiple actions, like playing on a slide, they often begin with the central action (e. g., sliding-down) instead of with the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>activity</b> sequence (e. g., climbing-up). This study indicates that, in <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> gestures may be among the cues the speaker uses for forming a next idea or for repairing the temporal order <b>of</b> the <b>activities</b> described. Gestures may function for the speaker as visual feedback and contribute to the process of utterance formation and provide an index for assessing language development...|$|R

30|$|The {{scientific}} {{state of}} the art is to output text commentary on very constrained activity such as traffic using simple image features such as trajectory points (see, e.g., [1]). We propose that an accurate commentary of activity can be acquired when there is a good intermediate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> available. This enables more complex and more general sensing of the scene than merely trajectories. In fact we develop a sensing strategy around activity recognition and head-pose estimation. This paper, consequently enables the machine to explain more complex, less constrained activity and interactions among people. The focus and the achievement of the work presented in this paper is to explain interactions between human agents and {{to do it in a}} way which can be applied in different domains where people interact.|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli {{cytochrome}} c nitrite reductase is a homodimeric enzyme whose 10 heme centres {{range in}} reduction potential from ca. - 30 to - 320 mV. Protein film voltammetry (PFV) {{was performed to}} assess how the reactivity of the enzyme towards {{a number of small}} molecules was influenced by heme oxidation state. The experimental approach provided a high-resolution <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> across the electrochemical potential domain by virtue {{of the fact that the}} enzyme sample was under the precise potential control of an electrode at all times. The current potential profiles displayed by nitrite reductase revealed that heme oxidation state has a profound, and often unanticipated, effect on the interactions with substrate molecules, nitrite and hydroxylamine, as well as the inhibitor, cyanide. Thus, PFV provides a powerful route to define redox-triggered events in this complex multi-centred redox enzyme...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} and evaluate a new statistical generative model of functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data. The model, topographic latent source analysis (TLSA), assumes that fMRI images are generated by a covariate-dependent superposition of latent sources. These sources are defined in terms of basis functions over space. Importantly, the number of parameters in the model does not depend on the number of voxels, enabling a parsimonious <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> patterns that avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional voxelbased approaches. Our spatial model leads naturally to a multi-subject extension in which latent sources at the subject-level are treated as perturbations of a group-level template. We evaluate TLSA according to prediction, reconstruction and reproducibility metrics and show that it compares favorably to a Naive Bayes model while using fewer parameters. We also describe a hypothesis-testing framework {{that can be used to}} identify significant latent sources. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Estimation is an {{important}} skill that should be owned by the students due to the relevancy to the everyday life computations. However, in reality students are better in doing exact computation rather than computational estimation.
