Nevertheless, many hypotheses {{about the causes}} of early angiosperm success and how angiosperms influenced Mesozoic ecosystem function hinge on understanding the maximum capacity for early angiosperm metabolism. We applied structure-functional analyses of leaf veins and stomatal pore geometry to determine the hydraulic and diffusive <b>gas</b> exchange <b>capacities</b> of Early Cretaceous fossil leaves. All of the late Aptian-early Albian angiosperms measured possessed low vein density and low maximal stomatal pore area, indicating low leaf <b>gas</b> exchange <b>capacities</b> in comparison to modern ecologically dominant angiosperms. Gas exchange capacities for Early Cretaceous angiosperms were equivalent or lower than ferns and gymnosperms. Fossil leaf taxa from Aptian to Paleocene sediments previously identified as putative stem-lineages to Austrobaileyales and Chloranthales had the same <b>gas</b> exchange <b>capacities</b> and possibly leaf water relations of their living relatives. Our results provide fossil evidence for the hypothesis that high leaf <b>gas</b> exchange <b>capacity</b> is a derived feature of later angiosperm evolution.

A fast tissue may become saturated {{in the course}} of a normal sports dive, while a slow tissue may have absorbed only a small part of its potential <b>gas</b> <b>capacity.</b> By calculating the levels in each compartment separately, researchers are able to construct more effective algorithms. In addition, each compartment may be able to tolerate more or less supersaturation than others. The final form is a complicated model, but one that allows for the construction of algorithms and tables suited to a wide variety of diving. A typical dive computer has an 8–12 tissue model, with half times varying from 5 minutes to 400 minutes. The Bühlmann tables use an algorithm with 16 tissues, with half times varying from 4 minutes to 640 minutes.|$|E

25|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure the body tissues are therefore normally saturated with nitrogen at 0.758bar (569mmHg). At increased ambient pressures due to depth or habitat pressurisation, a diver's lungs {{are filled with}} breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately. The inert gases from the breathing gas in the lungs diffuse into blood in the alveolar capillaries and are distributed around the body by the systemic circulation in the process known as perfusion. Dissolved materials are transported in the blood much faster {{than they would be}} distributed by diffusion alone. From the systemic capillaries the dissolved gases diffuse through the cell membranes and into the tissues, where it may eventually reach equilibrium. The greater the blood supply to a tissue, the faster it will reach equilibrium with gas at the new partial pressure. This equilibrium is called saturation. Ingassing appears to follow a simple inverse exponential equation. The time it takes for a tissue to take up or release 50% of the difference in dissolved <b>gas</b> <b>capacity</b> at a changed partial pressure is called the half-time for that tissue and gas.|$|E

Moreover, results were not corrected for confounding variables, such as lean muscle mass, gender, and <b>gas</b> transfer <b>capacity</b> of the lungs. OBJECTIVES: To compare quadriceps muscle strength and peak V. O 2 in women and men while stratifying for age and <b>gas</b> transfer <b>capacity.</b> We then corrected for lower-limb lean muscle mass to see whether and to what extent the age-graded reduction remained evident. METHODS: Retrospectively, data of 374 women and 593 men with COPD were analyzed: lung function, current drug therapy, quadriceps strength, peak V. O 2, lower-limb lean muscle mass, and <b>gas</b> transfer <b>capacity.</b> RESULTS: Quadriceps strength and peak V. O 2 were lower in older women and men with a <b>gas</b> transfer <b>capacity</b> of 50 % predicted. Yet, counter to our hypothesis, lower-limb lean muscle mass did not show an age-graded reduction and, in turn, could not account for the relationship of age with quadriceps strength and peak V. O 2. CONCLUSIONS: It is apparent that there is an age-graded reduction in skeletal muscle function in patients with COPD. Therefore, prevention of an age-graded decline in quadriceps muscle strength and peak V. O 2 may need to become an outcome of pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with COPD...|$|R

2500|$|The capital {{expenditure}} {{to build the}} facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends {{on the type of}} the storage field. As a general rule of thumb, salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working <b>Gas</b> <b>Capacity</b> Basis. However one should keep in mind that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a Deliverability basis, they may be less costly. A Salt Cavern facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working <b>gas</b> <b>capacity.</b> The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface {{and the quality of the}} geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working <b>Gas</b> <b>Capacity.</b> Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas. [...] The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when gas prices are high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.|$|E

2500|$|Redesigned bow {{and stern}} {{sections}} increased the <b>gas</b> <b>capacity</b> slightly for a corresponding increase in lift, but a more radical measure was {{the removal of the}} external keel corridor from the R23X design. Not contributing significantly to the strength of the hull, the keel's main function was to distribute the weight of the fuel tanks, ballast bags and other heavy items, as well as to allow the crew to travel between the cars, and its removal effected a considerable reduction in weight together with improved manoeuvrability. Instead, the various loads were concentrated at the bulkheads and suspended from the radial wiring that maintained the shape of the hull. The gas-bags were shaped to accommodate a new internal corridor, created by the provision of inverted [...] "U"-shaped ribs above the two lowest longitudinal members, which also allowed access to the fuel tanks and ballast. An improved system of pipes linking the fuel tanks enabled faster refuelling, and could be used to jettison fuel in an emergency. However, as with earlier designs, doped linen was used for the hull's outer covering; and being absorbent, just a few hours of rain could add around a ton of water to the weight.|$|E
