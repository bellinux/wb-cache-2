The {{reason for this is that}} the traditional experimental method to optimize devices is no more sufficient because of the high costs and long times needed.

The results of process simulation are needed as input for the simulation of the electrical behavior of the device as well as for understanding the effects of successive process <b>steps</b> <b>on</b> <b>wafer</b> topography and dopant distributions.

40|$|ABSTRACT – This report {{reviews the}} {{technique}} of layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly, in particular cases involving electrostatic interactions between thin film monolayers. LbL self-assembly is used {{in a variety of}} different applications, two of which discussed in the report are LbL MEMS and LbL protein multilayers. In the fabrication of LbL MEMS, multilayers of polymer-clay-magnetite nanocrystal are deposited via photolithographic <b>steps</b> <b>on</b> a <b>wafer.</b> The final product is a free-standing cantilever that responds to a magnetic field. The LbL technique, applied to MEMS, allows the precise tailoring of surface interactions, and hence is useful for the fabrication of surface-based devices. In the application of trapping active proteins, polyamidoamine dendrimers and heme proteins are integrated in a multilayer thin film structure that allows the retention of intact biological activity. The pH of the system can significantly affect the interaction strength, and although oppositely charged species are favourable for electrostatic interactions, it is not a requirement for multilayer formation. Finally, electroactivity is explored in relations to bilayer number. It is concluded that electroactivity decreases as the bilayer number increases, and it is important to control film thickness for effective electron exchange in devices...|$|R

40|$|Device {{encapsulation}} {{and packaging}} often constitutes {{a substantial part}} of the fabrication cost of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) transducers and imaging sensor devices. In this paper, we propose a simple and cost-effective wafer-level capping method that utilizes a limited number of highly standardized process steps as well as low-cost materials. The proposed capping process is based <b>on</b> low-temperature adhesive <b>wafer</b> bonding, which ensures full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility. All necessary fabrication steps for the wafer bonding, such as cavity formation and deposition of the adhesive, are performed on the capping substrate. The polymer adhesive is deposited by spray-coating <b>on</b> the capping <b>wafer</b> containing the cavities. Thus, no lithographic patterning of the polymer adhesive is needed, and material waste is minimized. Furthermore, this process does not require any additional fabrication <b>steps</b> <b>on</b> the device <b>wafer,</b> which lowers the process complexity and fabrication costs. We demonstrate the proposed capping method by packaging two different MEMS devices. The two MEMS devices include a vibration sensor and an acceleration switch, which employ two different electrical interconnection schemes. The experimental results show wafer-level capping with excellent bond quality due to the re-flow behavior of the polymer adhesive. No impediment to the functionality of the MEMS devices was observed, which indicates that the encapsulation does not introduce significant tensile nor compressive stresses. Thus, we present a highly versatile, robust, and cost-efficient capping method for components such as MEMS and imaging sensors. QC 20161019 </p...|$|R

The main barriers for these approaches are high cost, issues with electrical isolation within the Si via {{and the need}} of high investments for new equipment which is not used in WLP up to now. A planar integration technology of ultra-thin bare dice in a Wafer-Level Thin Film technology yield to a high-dense module will be presented here. This Thin Chip Integration (TCI) technology consists {{of one or more}} ultra-thin chips which are stacked on a larger sized standard thick chip and which are interconnected by a thin film routing. The wafer level thinning of the ICs to 20 - 40 mu m leads to the integration of IC into a redistribution. The ICs are bonded on a carrier chip on wafer-level using Photo-BCB (Cyclotene 4000 from The Dow Chemical Company). A standard thin film multilayer which was developed for a redistribution process is realized in a planar fashion on top of the embedded system. The metallization is based on a Ti:W / Cu tie layer, which is subsequently electroplated. Photo-BCB is used as interlevel low k dielectric. The final metallization opens the possibility to stack a FC on top of the embedded chips. The final module consists of an embedded IC on a CMOS or sensor wafer with a third IC FC-bonded on top. An example of this approach is presented in details including electrical and reliability tests. All <b>steps</b> are done <b>on</b> <b>wafer</b> level enabling a low cost technology which can be manufactured using standard redistribution infrastructure already established in the packaging industry.
