40|$|Quality {{estimation}} (QE) approaches aim {{to predict}} the quality of an automatically generated output without relying on manually-crafted references. Having access only to the system's input and output, a QE module assigns a score or a label to each (input, output) pair. In this thesis we develop approaches {{to predict the}} quality of outputs of two types of natural language processing (NLP) systems: machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR). The work presented here {{can be divided into}} three parts. The first part presents advances on the standard approaches to MT QE. We describe a general feature extraction framework, several quality indicators dependent and independent from MT systems that generate the translations, and new quality indicators that approximate the cross-lingual mapping between the meaning of source and translated sentences. Such advances result in state-of-the-art performance in two official evaluation campaigns on the MT QE problem. In the second part we show that the standard MT QE approaches suffer from <b>domain</b> <b>drift</b> problems due to the high specificity of labeled data currently available. In the standard MT QE framework, models are trained on data from a specific text type, with translations produced by one MT system and with labels obtained over the work of specific individual translators. Such models present poor performance when {{one or more of these}} conditions change. The ability of a system to adapt and cope with such changes is a facet of the QE problem that so far has been disregarded. To address these issues and deal with the noisy conditions of real-world translation workflows, we propose adaptive approaches to QE that are robust to both the diverse nature of translation jobs and differences between training and test data. In the third part, we propose and define an ASR QE framework. We identify useful quality indicators and show that ASR QE can be performed without having access to the ASR system, by only exploring information of its inputs and outputs. We apply a subset of the same adaptive techniques developed for MT QE and show that the ASR QE setting can also benefit from robust adaptive learning algorithms...|$|E

Sitting atop the HA spike is a globular head domain that binds to cellular receptors during viral entry and contains the major antigenic sites targeted by the immune system. Because of this selective pressure, the sequence in the head <b>domain</b> <b>drifts</b> enough to require an updated seasonal vaccine most years. A stalk domain connects the head to the viral membrane and is responsible for fusing viral and host membranes so that the pathogen can invade human cells. The immune system usually {{does not have a}} strong response to the partially hidden stalk domain, so portions of the stalk remain highly conserved across all influenza subtypes. The FI6 antibody makes extensive contacts with conserved parts of the stalk, thereby blocking HA from harpooning a sticky fusion peptide into the host membrane during viral entry.|$|R

40|$|The most {{abundant}} plasma protein, human serum albumin (HSA), {{is known to}} undergo several conformational transitions in an acidic environment. To avoid buffer effects and correlate global and local structural changes, we developed a continuous acidification method and simultaneously monitored the protein changes by both small-angle scattering (SAXS) and fluorescence. The progressive acidification, based on the hydrolysis of glucono-δ-lactone from pH 7 to pH 2. 5, highlighted a multistep unfolding involving the putative F form (pH 4) and an extended and flexible conformation (pH < 3. 5). The scattering profile of the F form was extracted by component analysis and further 3 D modeled. The effect of acid unfolding at this intermediate stage {{was assigned to the}} rearrangement of the three albumin <b>domains</b> <b>drifting</b> apart toward a more elongated conformation, with a partial unfolding of one of the outer domains. To test the stabilizing effect of fatty acids, here palmitic acid, we compared the acid unfolding process of albumin with and without ligand.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} explore the relationships between technology and volunteerism. Despite the fact that information and communication technologies (ICTs) proliferate within voluntary organisations and have an obvious effect on volunteering practice, the literature on the relationships between such technologies and voluntary contexts is scant. This is particularly in terms of its insights with regard to the actual processes of production and consumption of these technologies within the sector. This interdisciplinary research project was carried out to answer a central research problem: how do information technologies interrelate with human activities in voluntary settings? In throwing light on this problem, an ethnographic case-oriented study was conducted in a Scottish community-based sports organisation over the course of two years. This research has utilised insights from the Sociology of Technology, Information Systems Research and Organisational Sociology to find out how human actors’ interactions with technology play out in the context of volunteer-involving organisations, and to conceptualise the complexity of the unfolding of technology in relation to the specific characteristics of volunteering activities. To unpack the core research question, three types of sociotechnical interactions were identified as the most relevant: these were ‘service’, ‘identity’ and ‘ecological’. My analysis of the empirical data suggests that there are different domains within which these critical interactions are assembled. In my research, three different <b>domains</b> (<b>drifting,</b> conditioning and imbricating) have thematically emerged when sociotechnical interactions were being mapped out in (a) shadowing a technology project, (b) analysing technological non-use and (c) rethinking organisational persistence in the selected observed case. This thesis argues for an ‘infrastructural’ approach when studying technology so as to extend our understanding about technology-initiated improvement projects in the sector. This research argues that accomplishing volunteer work requires complicated mixture of sociomaterial assemblages, including ICTs, which are embedded in the everyday life of volunteers, paid staff and their community. Furthermore, this study discusses that existing analytical infrastructural approaches developed in relation to artefact-oriented, large-scale sociotechnical networks need some modification to be satisfyingly applied in low-tech, mundane settings such as volunteer work in amateur sports...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of concept learning, target {{concepts}} may have portions with short-term changes, other portions may support long-term changes, and yet others may not change at all. For this reason several local windows need to be handled. We suggest facing this problem, which naturally exists {{in the field of}} concept learning, by allocating windows which can adapt their size to portions of the target concept. We propose an incremental decision tree that is updated with incoming examples. Each leaf of the decision tree holds a time window and a local performance measure as the main parameter to be controlled. When the performance of a leaf decreases, the size of its local window is reduced. This learning algorithm, called OnlineTree 2, automatically adjusts its internal parameters in order to face the current dynamics of the data stream. Results show that it is comparable to other batch algorithms when facing problems with no concept change, and it is better than evaluated methods in its ability to deal with concept drift when dealing with problems in which: concept change occurs at different speeds, noise may be present and, examples may arrive from different areas of the problem <b>domain</b> (virtual <b>drift)</b> ...|$|R

The cleaning is usually performed in the time domain by using a quadratic function to fit the time series data, and then removing the fitted part from the data. Having Fourier transformed the residuals, and then convolved with LISA transfer function, LISA sensitivity curve can be obtained. However, cosmic gravitational-wave background cannot be retrieved with this approach due to its random nature. Here we provide a new representation of power spectrum given by discrete Fourier transform, which is applied to find the function of the drift power for the cleaning in the frequency domain. We also give the probability distribution used to analyze the data in the frequency domain. We combine several techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, simulated annealing, and Gelman & Rubin's method, with Baye's theorem to build the algorithm. The algorithm is utilized to analyze 24 simulations of LISA instrumental noise. We prove that the LISA sensitivity can be recovered through this approach. It can help us to build algorithms for some tasks which are must accomplished in the frequency domain for LISA data analysis.

However, {{it is not yet}} understood how complex images are represented across thesemaps. In this study, we askwhether a linear filtermodel can explain how cortical spatial frequency domains are activated by complex images. Themodel assumes that the response to a stimulus at any point on the cortical surface can be predicted by its individual orientation, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency tuning curves. To test thismodel, we imaged the pattern of activitywithin cat area 17 in response to stimuli composedofmultiple spatial frequencies. Consistentwith the predictions of themodel, the stimuli activated low and high spatial frequency domains differently: at low stimulus <b>drift</b> speeds, both <b>domains</b> were strongly activated, but activity fell off in high spatial frequency <b>domains</b> as <b>drift</b> speed increased.

Drifting gratings, typically used to reveal orientation preference domains, contain a motion component that may be represented in MT. Consequently, this stimulus could activate groups of cells responsive to the motion of the grating, its orientation or a combination of both. Domains elicited from either moving or static gratings were remarkably similar, indicating that these groups of cells are responding to orientation, although they may also encode information about motion. To assess the relationship between <b>domains</b> defined by <b>drifting</b> oriented gratings and those responsive to direction-of-motion, the response to drifting fields of random dots was measured within domains defined from thresholded maps of activation elicited by the drifting gratings.

Three lithofacies, A, B, and C, are defined based {{on a combination of}} sedimentological and mineralogical analyses. The dominant lithofacies A corresponds to contourite deposits; lithofacies B and C comprise turbidites and debrites respectively. Three main criteria have been utilized to distinguish between these deposits: (i) the vertical trend of the grain-size and the sedimentary structures. The contourites show complete sequences (C 1 to C 5 divisions) and truncate sequences (basecut-out divisions, e. g., C 3 –C 2 –C 1, and C 3). The turbidites display mainly Td–Te divisions, although Tc division is also present to a lesser extent. The debrites display deformational and shearing structures; (ii) the modal frequency distribution. The contourite sequences show similar mode grain-size values in different textures suggesting that the steady conditions of supply are maintained over time. In contrast, turbidite and debrite sequences display different modes, primarily conditioned by mixing of components from allochthonous sources and their downslope gravitational transport; (iii) the sediment composition (clay mineral, bulk mineral and sand fraction) and provenance that reflect long- and short-distance transport modes. Most of the terrigenous components of the contourites come from the Guadalquivir drainage basin, whereas for the turbidites and debrites these are sourced from the neighbouring fluvial drainage basins (Guadiana, Tinto-Odiel). The biogenic components in the latter indicate shallow depositional environments prior to seafloor failure. The spatial and temporal distributions of the lithofacies reflect the different (palaeo) environments of the Faro Drift. Debrite and incomplete turbidite sequences characterize the palaeo-moat domain during the Early Pleistocene. Complete contourite sequences (C 1 to C 5) and basecut-out sequences (C 3 –C 4 –C 5, and C 3) characterize the proximal palaeo-drift domain during the Early and Middle Pleistocene and the complete contourite sequences represent the distal <b>drift</b> <b>domain</b> during the Late PleistoceneThe research was supported through the MOWER (CTM 2012 - 39599 -C 03), MONTERA (CTM 2009 - 14157 -C 0 - 02) and CGL 2012 - 33281 projects funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

There is a need to devise better and increasingly automated systems for analyzing and utilising such data, from online data streams, for the purposes of classification and prediction. Across many domains such as banking, financial markets, network management and even in biomedical monitoring of pathogen sensitivity to drugs, the competitive edge is gained by those who act on their data fastest, most accurately and keep up to date with any changes occurring in their domain. This has led to the rise of research into online learners. These automated systems serve to train themselves on received data and discover rules for use in classification and prediction. They serve to keep those rules up to date as concept drift, i. e. changing of the underlying rules, occurs. However, to date, there has been little undertaken into research as to how latency in the data stream impacts upon such learning. This thesis examines the hypothesis that latency can have a substantial impact upon the performance of online learners operating on <b>domains</b> with concept <b>drift,</b> and, that key meta-data attributes describing example passage throughout the domain may help to resolve such issues. The thesis explores what it means to be a domain by developing a generic model. The assumptions that are applied in current research upon the nature of example arrival are considered and challenged. A framework, ELISE, for simulating various latency conditions for the purposes of experimenting with meta-data attributes relating to temporal events in the example life-cycle is developed. From this several online learner algorithmic and procedural approaches are tested as a potential solution to handling latency; based upon not just isolated examples but comprehension of the temporal nature of a data stream. Finally, future work is suggested for further improvements. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{peculiar}} motions {{are believed}} to reflect the local inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the universe, triggered by the ongoing process of structure formation. As a result, realistic observers do not follow the smooth Hubble flow but have a peculiar, `tilt', velocity relative to it. Our Local Group of galaxies, in particular, moves {{with respect to the}} universal expansion at a speed of roughly 600 ~km/sec. Relative motion effects are known to interfere with the observations and their interpretation. The strong dipolar anisotropy seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background, for example, is not treated as a sign of real universal anisotropy, but as a mere artifact of our peculiar motion relative to the Hubble flow. With these in mind, we look into the implications of large-scale bulk motions for the kinematics of their associated observers, by adopting a `tilted' Friedmann model. Our aim is to examine whether the deceleration parameter measured in the rest-frame of the bulk flow can differ from that of the actual universe due to relative-motion effects alone. We find that there is a difference, which depends on the speed as well as the scale of the bulk motion. The faster and the smaller the <b>drifting</b> <b>domain,</b> the larger the difference. In principle, this allows relatively slow peculiar velocities to have a disproportionately strong effect on the value of the deceleration parameter measured by observers within bulk flows of, say, few hundred megaparsecs. In fact, under certain circumstances, it is even possible to change the sign of the deceleration parameter. It goes without saying that all these effects vanish identically in the Hubble frame, which makes then an illusion and mere artifact of the observers' relative motion.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to quantify amounts of recharge to aquifers overlain by a covering of drift and to understand the flow mechanisms by which this occurs. This requires an identification of the key Chalk and Sherwood Sandstone Drift hydrogeological environments, the understanding of recharge processes and a quantification of recharge for each of these domains. The approach adopted by this project is to investigate three aspects: 1. Identify the various <b>Drift</b> <b>domains,</b> develop conceptual models for each domain and with the help of simple spreadsheet type calculations, perform sensitivity analysis to test recharge rates for a range of parameters and boundary conditions within their range of uncertainty. 2. Determine recharge mechanisms and likely rate at field sites in East Anglia and the Tern catchment. In the Tern catchment the study is based on recharge of the Sherwood Sandstone through a thin drift cover. The East Anglia field site has been established at a site where the Chalk is overlain by thick till. The study here will be largely based on water quality data including geochemical residence time indicators and will include the following objectives: • to ascertain whether recharge occurs through the till and to quantify rates. • to establish the degree of importance of (a) fissure-related bypass flow, and (b) flow through higher permeability sand lenses. • to determine the residence times of the various groundwater components in the till and underlying Chalk. • to determine the extent of denitrification within the till. Calculate catchment scale recharge rates using regional Environment Agency data (groundwater levels, hydrological and water quality) and working closely with the Environment Agency.
