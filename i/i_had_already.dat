5|$|Edward I died in 1307 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward II. The new King at first enjoyed the good will of his nobility, Valence among them. Conflict soon ensued, however, {{connected}} especially with the enormous unpopularity of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston. Gaveston's arrogance towards the peers, and his control over Edward, united the Baronage {{in opposition to the}} King. In 1311 the initiative known as the Ordinances was introduced, severely limiting Royal powers in financial matters and in the appointment of officers. Equally important, Gaveston was expelled from the realm - as Edward <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> done once before. Pembroke, who was not among the most radical of the Ordainers, and had earlier been sympathetic with the King, had now realised the necessity of exiling Gaveston.|$|E

25|$|These tenses (except for present perfect) {{correspond}} roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (I {{had read}} / I will have read). They {{are used in}} various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs – I didn’t take that book because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> read it; Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų – After the trip the children will have badly missed their parents.|$|E

25|$|If I {{knew what}} I know now I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Maximilian died in January 1519 and bequeathed to his {{grandson}} Carlos I the hereditary lands of House Habsburg with adjoining Burgundian lands {{as well as}} a disputed claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. To secure his essential investments into House Habsburg Jakob Fugger decided to support the election of the 19-year-old claimant to the throne. In addition to Carlos I, the English King Henry VIII, the French King Francois I and Frederick III, Elector of Saxony announced their candidacy. Francois <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> secured the votes of the Archdiocese of Trier and the Electorate of the Palatinate as well as offering a sum of 300.000 guilders of election money. The Prince-electors consisted of the three archbishops of Mainz, Cologne and Trier in addition to the King of Bohemia, the Elector of the Palatinate, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the Duke of Saxony.|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{called this}} idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|Raised as a Lutheran, Gingrich was a Southern Baptist in {{graduate}} school. He converted to Catholicism, Bisek's faith, on March 29, 2009. He said: [...] "over {{the course of}} several years, I gradually became Catholic and then decided one day to accept the faith <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> come to embrace". He decided to officially become a Catholic when he saw Pope Benedict XVI, during the Pope's visit to the United States in 2008: [...] "Catching a glimpse of Pope Benedict that day, I was struck by the happiness and peacefulness he exuded. The joyful and radiating presence of the Holy Father was a moment of confirmation about the many things I had been thinking and experiencing for several years." [...] At a 2011 appearance in Columbus, Ohio, he said, [...] "In America, religious belief is being challenged by a cultural elite trying to create a secularized America, in which God is driven out of public life." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets {{a little hard to}} have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling or maybe they felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm not sure. I haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E

500|$|Massa denied responsibility, {{and agreed}} with the stewards' decision: [...] "I think there's little to say: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> entered the turn and he hit me from behind, {{spinning}} me round." [...] The penalty was largely criticized in the media. GrandPrix.com called the penalty [...] "bizarre", saying that Bourdais [...] "could not just disappear". James Allen of ITV said that in light of FIA race director Charlie Whiting's announcement prior to the race, which indicated that cars exiting the pit-lane would have right of way, the penalty was [...] "ridiculous". French sporting newspaper L'Équipe criticized the stewards for their intervention, saying that both drivers held their lines and the collision was just a racing incident. Mark Blundell, who drove in Formula One for five years, called for former drivers {{to be part of}} the stewards meetings which award penalties: [...] "You can examine pieces of paper, graphs, telemetry, but you don't know what's going on in a driver's brain until you've experienced it." [...] Blundell's suggestion eventually became fact - the 2010 season introduced a system whereby a former F1 driver acted as a steward during each Grand Prix.|$|E
500|$|When Tisdale was twelve, {{she sang}} for then-President Bill Clinton during an {{event at the}} White House {{as part of a}} troupe. Hoping to expand her career, Tisdale and her family moved to Los Angeles, California. She landed her first role in 1997, guest {{starring}} on an episode of both Smart Guy and 7th Heaven. During this time, she also began doing modeling work for Ford Models. The following year, Tisdale appeared as a voice actor in both An All Dogs Christmas Carol (1998) and A Bug's Life (1998). She guest starred in an episode of Boston Public in 2000, earning a 2000 Young Artist Award nomination for [...] "Best Guest Performance in a TV Drama". Tisdale continued to make guest appearances on television shows and appear in minor film roles throughout the following years, with roles in films such as Donnie Darko (2001) and The Mayor of Oyster Bay (2002). During this time, Tisdale continued to work and attend school, stating [...] "I was always in regular school and I worked in clothing stores growing up. I didn't 'make it' until I was 18, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> graduated public school. I definitely feel like I had the best of both worlds." ...|$|E
500|$|According to McEntire, Clarkson was {{the first}} singer to pair up with her for the album [...] (2007). She also claimed that [...] "Because of You" [...] was not the {{original}} song {{to be included in}} the album; it was another song that she recorded with Clarkson, titled [...] "A Lot Like You." [...] McEntire explained that it was Narvel, her husband, who convinced her to go back in the studio and record [...] "Because of You" [...] after he heard both McEntire and Clarkson rehearsing the song. She expressed, [...] "Narvel saw it. That wasn't one of the songs we had talked about recording – matter of fact, Kelly and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> recorded a song, 'A Lot Like You,' for the duet project, and he said, 'You've got to do this one together,' so we did." [...] Musically, the song is different from the original version. Thom Jhurek of Allmusic described the duet version as [...] "a big, overblown power ballad" [...] which incorporates [...] "guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals." [...] The use of violin was also incorporated into the duet, giving it a melodramatic quality that was deemed [...] "unnecessary" [...] by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics. The song was officially sent to radio stations on May 15, 2007, as the lead single from the album. It was added to country radio playlists on May 28, 2007.|$|E
