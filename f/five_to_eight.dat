5|$|Glee {{debuted in}} America on the Fox network on May19, 2009. Series creator Ryan Murphy planned to include <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> musical numbers per episode, and to release {{accompanying}} soundtrack albums every few months. In the week {{prior to the}} broadcast of the pilot episode, Murphy stated that seven different companies had bid on {{the rights to the}} series' first soundtrack. The contenders were narrowed down to four labels, with Fox ultimately signing a deal with Columbia Records as a result of chairman Rob Stringer's belief that Glee would be a success. Stringer appreciated the series' use of both classic and contemporary pop music. He suggested that other record labels underestimated the potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, and water quality. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from May through July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. Maturity is reached in <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> months, and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E

5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

Stages <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> formed a four-stage journey that navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 Domaines ski resort in the Pyrenees. Stage nine took place between Saint-Girons to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, before a long transfer moved the race to the north-west of the country. Stage ten finished in {{the port city of}} Saint-Malo, with the next finishing at the Mont Saint-Michel island commune in Normandy. The following four stages, 11 to 15, crossed the center of the country back to the south-east finishing atop Mont Ventoux. The next five stages took place in and around the Alps, before a second long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The snails mate from May through July, and {{lay eggs}} from June through July. They are hermaphroditic; however, {{it is unclear}} if self-fertilization is possible. The eggs, {{numbering}} 8 to 14, are approximately 2mm in diameter, spherical, transparent, and very distinctive within a cluster. Generally, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis eggs are not {{found to have a}} heavy gelatinous layer surrounding the entire cluster, which is associated with egg masses of Succinea sp. B. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis egg clusters are deposited at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. The young snails hatch in 2 to 3 weeks, measuring barely 2mm. It is still unclear when the snails mature, although Grimm (1981) believes they reach maturity in <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> months, or the spring following hatching. At the end of their first full year of growth, snails observed by Aloi and Ringler (1982) averaged around 10mm. By the end of the following year, the adult snails were observed to reach a length of approximately 21mm; they then die, completing a life span of about 2.5 years. This life span is similar to those in captive populations (Rosamond Gifford Zoo, unpublished data).|$|E
