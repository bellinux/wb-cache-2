5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E

25|$|The Tralee and Dingle Light Railway {{was once}} one of Europe's most western {{railways}} when it opened on 31 March 1891 connecting Tralee and Dingle by rail along the Dingle Peninsula before closing in June 1953. In 1993 a 3km section was reopened as a preserved line between the Aquadome in Tralee and Blennerville Windmill. Currently this railway {{is no longer in}} operation. A railway used to operate to Fenit Harbour from Tralee before closing in June 1978. Currently a section of this railway has been restored as a walk/cycle way in the Tralee urban area and it is hoped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> this will extend out to Fenit {{along the lines of the}} Great Southern Trail situated in West Limerick.|$|E

Joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping Old Nick away. As punishment, he cuts their heat and power. Joy decides to tell Jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. She has Jack fake a fever, hoping that Old Nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but Old Nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it convinced me that I had overcome all traces of my depression.

500|$|On April 20, Kennedy sent {{a memo to}} Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, asking Johnson to {{look into}} the status of America's space program, and into {{programs}} that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up. Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that [...] "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership."

500|$|Although Hoglan {{initially}} {{denied the}} definitive break-up of the band, {{saying they would}} go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on [...] "extended hiatus", and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, Ziltoid the Omniscient, Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, {{as well as other}} people's music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 Metal Hammer interview, where he stated [...] "there may be some stuff I do <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's just not going to be Strapping".|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} feature of the Big Bang spacetime {{is the presence of}} particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never [...] "catch up" [...] to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> {{we will be able to}} influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.|$|E
500|$|... "Bart to the Future" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the second episode of the series to show the Simpson family's life in the future, following the season six episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] that aired five years earlier in 1995. Three more future-set episodes have been released since [...] "Bart to the Future", the first being Future-Drama (season 16, 2005), second being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] (season 23, 2011) and third being [...] "Days of Future Future" [...] (season 25, 2014). Greaney's inspiration for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] came from [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He and The Simpsons writer Matt Selman were sitting in Greaney's office one day, {{trying to come up with}} new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode. Greaney wanted to write an episode set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> focused on Bart instead of Lisa. He thought it would be interesting to explore how the future works out for [...] "a guy like Bart, who doesn't pay attention to school work and is all about being cool." ...|$|E

500|$|Zur {{typically}} {{is brought}} in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and television—where nothing changes after he starts besides post-production effects—making video game music composition a more [...] "flexible" [...] process. He finds that it is [...] "crucial" [...] for him {{to play a game}} before he can compose music for it, even if it only a development version. Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player to feel at that point in the game. While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create. Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music [...] "intuitively", rather than {{spending a lot of time}} planning it out. When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family. The types of projects that he would like to work on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> he has not yet done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.|$|E
500|$|On January 20 {{that year}} the Soviets {{announced}} that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten-day period. The Albanians later {{claimed that the}} specialists had sabotaged Albania's oil installations before departing. [...] Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the Palace of Culture of Tirana {{on the occasion of}} his 1959 visit, all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961. A shipment of materials for the Palace, which arrived in Durrës, was [...] "withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials 'had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania.'" [...] On April 23 a Sino–Albanian trade agreement was concluded; Soviet First Deputy Premier Alexei Kosygin sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet–Albanian trade agreements. Among other things it stated that [...] "It is understandable that the Albanian leadership cannot expect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>that</b> the USSR will help it as it has in the past, with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit." [...] On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana [...] "and was never to return." [...] On August 26, [...] "only five days before the beginning of the fall semester," [...] the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR; these students given a deadline to leave by October. An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that, [...] "The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five-year Plan in the industrial sector alone. Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid. Thus {{in the first years of}} the 3rd Five-year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired." ...|$|E

2500|$|A further {{decision}} on sending more troops {{came after the}} administration completed a broader review of Afghanistan policy. On 27 March 2009, Obama announced after an intense 60-day White House policy review, in which military commanders and diplomats, regional governments, partners, Nato allies, NGOs and aid organisations were consulted, a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. [...] "So I want the American {{people to understand that}} we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>That</b> is the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: we will defeat you," [...] Obama said. For this purpose Obama announced that he plans to further bolster American forces in Afghanistan, increase aid to Pakistan, and set strict standards – like levels of violence and casualties in Afghanistan, Pakistani attacks against insurgents and accounting for U.S. aid – for measuring progress in fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban in both countries. Part of his strategy was the deployment of 4,000 U.S. troops – beyond the additional 17,000 he authorized in February—to work as trainers and advisers to the Afghan army and police. The move was accompanied by a [...] "surge" [...] in US civilians to Afghanistan to help rebuild the country's infrastructure. In addition to the renewed focus on Afghanistan, the Obama administration was to step up pressure on Pakistan to tackle the al-Qaida and Taliban safe havens in the tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan. US military and civilian aid was to be increased. The last element of the policy was to try to engage Afghanistan's regional neighbours, including Russia and Iran, in helping to pacify Afghanistan.|$|E
