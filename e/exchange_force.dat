50|$|In physics {{the term}} <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> {{has been used}} to {{describe}} two distinct concepts which should not be confused.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preferred}} {{meaning of}} <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> is in particle physics, where it denotes a force {{produced by the}} exchange of force carrier particles, such as the electromagnetic force produced by the exchange of photons between electrons and the strong force produced by the exchange of gluons between quarks. [...] The idea of an <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> implies a continuous exchange of particles which accompany the interaction and transmit the force, a process that receives its operational justification through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.|$|E
50|$|As another, entirely distinct, {{meaning of}} <b>exchange</b> <b>force,</b> it is {{sometimes}} used as a synonym for the exchange interaction, between electrons which arises {{from a combination of}} the identity of particles, exchange symmetry, and the electrostatic force.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies in}} {{psychology}} have documented how the behaviour of verbally communicating pairs {{is affected by}} social {{factors such as the}} partner's gaze. However, few studies have examined whether physically interacting pairs are influenced by social factors. Here, we asked two partners to <b>exchange</b> <b>forces</b> with one another, where the goal was to accurately replicate the force back onto the other. We first measured an individual's accuracy in reproducing a force from a robot. We then tested pairs who knowingly <b>exchanged</b> <b>forces</b> whilst separated by a curtain. These separated pairs <b>exchanged</b> <b>forces</b> as two independent individuals would, hence the force reproduction accuracy of partners is not affected by knowingly reproducing a force onto a nonvisible partner. On the other hand, pairs who <b>exchanged</b> <b>forces</b> whilst facing one another consistently under-reproduced the partner's force in comparison to separated partners. Thus, the force reproduction accuracy of subjects is strongly biased by facing a partner...|$|R
5000|$|The gauge bosons, {{which were}} {{particles}} that <b>exchange</b> <b>forces.</b> These {{ranged from the}} massless, easy-to-detect photon (the carrier of the electro-magnetic force) to the exotic (though still massless) gluons that carry the strong nuclear force.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} {{problems}} in nuclear physics is {{the determination of the}} forces which bind nuclei together. A few facts were obtained in the beginning from the vast collection of data on the binding energies of nuclei. In order to account for saturation, Heisenberg (1) and Majorana (2) introduced the idea of <b>exchange</b> <b>forces,</b> somewhat akin to the <b>exchange</b> <b>forces</b> which occur in molecular binding. These forces give rise to spin and parity dependence in the interaction. From the large ratio of the binding energy of the alpha particle to that of the deuteron, Wigner (3) deduced that the forces were short ranged and very strong within that range...|$|R
50|$|In physics, the {{exchange}} interaction (with an exchange energy, and exchange term) is a quantum mechanical effect that only occurs between identical particles. Despite sometimes being called an <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> in analogy to classical force, {{it is not}} a true force, as it lacks a force carrier.|$|E
50|$|The {{exchange}} {{interaction is}} sometimes called the <b>exchange</b> <b>force.</b> However, {{it is not a}} true force and {{should not be confused with}} the exchange forces produced by the exchange of force carriers, such as the electromagnetic force produced between two electrons by the exchange of a photon, or the strong force between two quarks produced by the exchange of a gluon.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, Tamm and Semen Altshuller {{suggested}} that the neutron has a non-zero magnetic moment, the idea was met with scepticism at that time, as the neutron {{was supposed to be}} an elementary particle with zero charge, and thus could not have a magnetic moment. The same year, Tamm coined an idea that proton-neutron interactions can be described as an <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> transmitted by a yet unknown massive particle, this idea was later developed by Hideki Yukawa into a theory of meson forces.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ball lightning {{has been observed}} for a long time, but {{the nature of these}} luminous balls has been unknown. It is proposed here that they consist of highy excited Rydberg atoms with large polarizabilities that bind them together. Thus the cohesion of the balls comes from photon <b>exchange</b> <b>forces</b> (London dispersion forces) rather than the more usual electron <b>exchange</b> (chemical) <b>forces.</b> The cohesion in plasmas generated at the back faces of detonating explosives has a similar basis. Estimates are given to justify this interpretation...|$|R

50|$|The {{materials}} {{in which the}} exchange interaction is much stronger than the competing dipole-dipole interaction are frequently called magnetic materials. For instance, in iron (Fe) the <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> is about 1000 times stronger than the dipole interaction. Therefore, below the Curie temperature {{virtually all of the}} dipoles in a ferromagnetic material will be aligned. In addition to ferromagnetism, the exchange interaction is also responsible for the other types of spontaneous ordering of atomic magnetic moments occurring in magnetic solids, antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism.There are different exchange interaction mechanisms which create the magnetism in different ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic substances. These mechanisms include direct exchange, RKKY exchange, double exchange, and superexchange.|$|E
50|$|In the Standard Model {{of modern}} physics, the four {{fundamental}} {{forces of nature}} {{are known to be}} non-contact forces. The strong and weak interaction primarily deal with forces within atoms, while gravitational effects are only obvious on a macroscopic scale. Molecular and quantum physics show that the electromagnetic force is the fundamental interaction responsible for contact forces. The interaction between macroscopic objects can be roughly described as resulting from the electromagnetic interactions between protons and electrons of the atomic constituents of these objects. Everyday objects do not actually touch; rather, contact forces are result of the interactions of the electrons at or near the surfaces of the objects (<b>exchange</b> <b>force).</b> This includes friction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Physical human-robot {{collaboration}} is character-ized by a suitable <b>exchange</b> of contact <b>forces</b> between human and robot, which {{can occur in}} general at any point along the robot structure. If the contact location and the <b>exchanged</b> <b>forces</b> were known in real time, a safe and controlled collaboration could be established. We present a novel approach that allows localizing the contact between a robot and human parts with a depth camera, while determining in parallel the joint torques generated by the physical interaction using the so-called resid-ual method. The combination of such exteroceptive sensing and model-based techniques is sufficient, under suitable conditions, for a reliable estimation of the actual <b>exchanged</b> <b>force</b> at the contact, realizing thus a virtual force sensor. Multiple contacts can be handled as well. We validate quantitatively the proposed estimation method {{with a number of}} static experiments on a KUKA LWR. An illustration of the use of estimated contact forces in the realization of collaborative behaviors is given, reporting preliminary experiments on a generalized admittance control scheme at the contact point.

40|$|First-principles {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed for the exchange interaction and <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> between two magnetic Fe(100) thin films.

40|$|Storing and {{accessing}} {{information in}} atomic-scale magnets requires magnetic imaging techniques with single-atom resolution. Here, we show simultaneous detection of the spin-polarization and <b>exchange</b> <b>force,</b> {{with or without}} the flow of current, with a new method, which combines scanning tunneling microscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy. To demonstrate the application of this new method, we characterize the prototypical nano-skyrmion lattice formed on a monolayer of Fe/Ir(111). We resolve the square magnetic lattice by employing magnetic <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> microscopy, demonstrating its applicability to non-collinear magnetic structures, for the first time. Utilizing distance-dependent force and current spectroscopy, we quantify the exchange forces in comparison to the spin-polarization. For strongly spin-polarized tips, we distinguish different signs of the <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> which we suggest arises from a change in exchange mechanisms between the probe and a skyrmion. This new approach may enable both non-perturbative readout combined with writing by current-driven reversal of atomic-scale magnets...|$|E

40|$|Mobile sensor {{networks}} {{are an important}} part of modern robotics systems and are widely used in robotics applications. Therefore, sensor deployment is a key issue in current robotics systems research. Since it is one of the most popular deployment methods, in recent years the virtual force algorithm has been studied in detail by many scientists. In this paper, we focus on the virtual force algorithm and present a corresponding parameter investigation for mobile sensor deployment. We introduce an optimized virtual force algorithm based on the <b>exchange</b> <b>force,</b> in which a new shielding rule grounded in Delaunay triangulation is adopted. The algorithm employs a new performance metric called ‘pair-correlation diversion', designed to evaluate the uniformity and topology of the sensor distribution. We also discuss the implementation of the algorithm's computation and analyse the influence of experimental parameters on the algorithm. Our results indicate that the area ratio, φs, and the <b>exchange</b> <b>force</b> constant, G, influence the final performance of the sensor deployment in terms of the coverage rate, the convergence time and topology uniformity. Using simulations, we were able to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and we obtained an optimal region for the (φs, G) -parameter space which, in the future, could be utilized as an aid for experiments in robotic sensor deployment...|$|E
40|$|Water {{relative}} permittivity profiles perpendicular to mica surfaces have been measured by {{atomic force microscopy}} using the force acting on uncharged tips when immersed in the mica double-layer. This force is modelled by the gradient of the electrostatic energy variation (dielectric <b>exchange</b> <b>force)</b> involved in the immersion of the tip with a {{relative permittivity}} epsilon (Tip) in the double layer region with epsilon (DL). The measured variable permittivity profile starting at epsilon approximate to 4 at the interface and increasing to epsilon approximate to 80 about 10 nm from the surface suggests a reorientation of water molecule dipoles {{in the presence of}} mica interfacial charges. Changes in water polarization are therefore responsible for the hydration or structural forces acting on the tips immersed in the inner double layer. Corroboration for the proposed model (dielectric <b>exchange</b> <b>force)</b> is given by the observation of an attractive force when metal-coated tips (epsilon (Tip) approximate to infinity) are immersed in the mica double layer. Support for the change in the water relative permittivity at the interface is given by measurements of only a repulsive force component when silicon nitride and silicon tips are immersed in solvent where there is no interaction between the mica surface and the solvent and, consequently, no solvent structuring at the interface...|$|E
