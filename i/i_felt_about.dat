500|$|In August 2000, Gingrich married Callista Bisek {{four months}} after his divorce from Marianne was finalized. He and Callista live in McLean, Virginia. In a 2011 {{interview}} with David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network, Gingrich addressed his past infidelities by saying, [...] "There's no question at times in my life, partially driven by how passionately <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> this country, that I worked too hard and things happened {{in my life that}} were not appropriate." [...] In December 2011, after the group Iowans for Christian Leaders in Government requested that he sign their so-called [...] "Marriage Vow", Gingrich sent a lengthy written response. It included his pledge to [...] "uphold personal fidelity to my spouse".|$|E
500|$|Larter {{promotes}} natural beauty. At the 2007 Emmy Awards, Larter styled her {{own hair}} {{as opposed to}} using her hair-styling team. This {{was part of the}} Dove Hair's [...] "Real Beauty" [...] challenge which required her to use Dove's new moisturizing shampoos, conditioners and treatments. She also states that she refuses to conform to the idea of the perfect Hollywood body. In an interview with Allure, Larter revealed she once was asked by producers, by faxes sent out to her agent and manager, to lose weight. [...] "I just remember sitting in my trailer hysterically crying from the embarrassment <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> myself, my body – and that no one could talk to me directly." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E

Upon joining DFA, Arshad said: [...] "I decided that I {{wanted to do}} something that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> passionate <b>about</b> and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> passionate <b>about</b> making a difference. We actually deserve better than what we have, so that’s what I work on." [...] In the 2006 general election, Arshad worked as the GOTV Director for Jerry McNerney for Congress.|$|R

6000|$|... "Fred Arnold {{was in the}} {{battalion}} and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> dreadfully <b>about</b> him, for I {{realized that it was}} because of me that he was going away with such a sorrowful expression. I couldn't help it but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> as badly as if I could.|$|R
500|$|... "Teen Spirit" [...] {{is widely}} {{interpreted}} to be a teen revolution anthem, an interpretation {{reinforced by the}} song's music video. In an interview conducted the day Nevermind was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, [...] "We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults [...] It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme." [...] As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the song's meaning. When discussing the song in Michael Azerrad's biography , Cobain revealed that he felt a duty [...] "to describe what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> my surroundings and my generation and people my age." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blurred Lines" [...] was controversial: its {{video was}} called sexist for its {{perceived}} degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape. Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an opportunity to say the things that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E

6000|$|... "French," [...] he said, [...] "keep mum, {{but it was}} {{the elderly}} family retainer, Macdougal. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> restless <b>about</b> him. He has lost the girl--he was married to her, by-the-bye--and the jewels. No fear of his {{slipping}} away. I shall have him here at the time I told you." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Cold Case Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Y's (Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross and James Fauntleroy II). At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> that relationship and how I feel about it now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When I first met Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and I {{told her that she}} had a big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing. Imagine how stupid <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> four months later, I’m in London driving around and I hear, ‘And now, the Top of the Pops, Tracey Ullman with ‘They Don’t Know About Us.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{took the}} title from {{a passage in}} Paradise Lost where Adam says to Eve that their {{expulsion}} from Paradise [...] "will prove no sudden but a slow pac'd evil,/ A Long Day's Dying to augment our pain," [...] and {{with the exception of}} the old lady Maroo, what all the characters seem to be dying of is loneliness, emptiness, sterility, and such preoccupation with themselves and their own problems that they are unable to communicate with each other about anything that really matters to them very much. I am sure that I chose such a melancholy theme partly because it seemed effective and fashionable, but I have no doubt that, like dreams generally, it also reflected the way <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> at least some dimension of my own life and the lives of those around me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} to him the position in which I stood towards Miss Batchford, and the hesitation which <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> writing to Grosse.

50|$|Shock And Awe: A {{song about}} the {{invasion}} of Iraq. It turned out in favour {{of the victims of}} the bombings when I wrote it, as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> bad <b>about</b> the civilians involved. Still, the songs aim at capturing some of the tremor et stupor of such a massive military operation.|$|R

2500|$|Billboard commended it as [...] "her most {{personal}} and intimate work to date," [...] confronting [...] "domestic abuse, AIDS, and homophobia with her most sexually explicit songs ever." [...] Jackson stated, [...] "That was {{a crossroads for}} me: sharing what I'd been going through personally and how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> {{what was happening in}} the world." [...] She added, [...] "It was about leaving behind the side of me that didn’t like myself very much... learning to accept myself, and it is still work in progress." [...] Kyra Phillips of CNN declared it [...] "difficult and very intimate," [...] exploring [...] "Jackson's darker side, her emotional break down and the secret that shocked the world." [...] Regarding its content, Jackson said, [...] "I’m sure it did alienate a lot of people, but that’s what I was feeling, and I wanted to write about it, so I did." [...] Jackson later stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{regards to}} the Iran-Contra affair, a major {{administration}} scandal that involved the diverting of funds being shipped to Iran to the contras in Nicaragua, An American Life says, [...] "None of the arms we'd shipped to Iran {{had gone to the}} terrorists who had kidnapped our citizens." [...] Of the scandal, Reagan writes, [...] " [...] McFarlane, [...] Poindexter, [...] Casey, and, I presume, [...] North knew how deeply <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> the need for the contras' survival as a democratic resistance force in Nicaragua. Perhaps that knowledge... led them to support the contras secretly and saw no reason to report this to me." [...] The autobiography goes on to claim that, [...] "s president, I was at the helm, so I am the one who is ultimately responsible." [...] The book also discusses Reagan's political rivalry and personal friendship with former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill.|$|E
2500|$|I {{could have}} done lots more, put in much more work and {{developed}} more pictures, but I had also a desire to say what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> life. Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been fascinating to me. They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [heart torn]. It is dreadful {{to think}} how you have been here all these years while I have gone round the world. I escaped young; but it has drawn me back. It wants to break my heart too. But it shan't. I have left you and it behind. It was silly of me to come back. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sentimental <b>about</b> papa and Hesione and the old place. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> them calling to me.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was more}} fogged than ever. And not only fogged--wounded and resentful. I {{remember}} {{reading a book}} where a girl [...] "suddenly fled from the room, afraid to stay for fear dreadful things would come tumbling from her lips; determined {{that she would not}} remain another day in this house to be insulted and misunderstood." [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> much <b>about</b> the same.|$|R
2500|$|During the Fragile Tour, Wakeman bought {{four books}} {{at an airport}} bookstall in Richmond, Virginia, {{including}} one about Henry VIII and his six wives titled The Private Life of Henry VIII (1964) by Scottish writer Nancy Brysson Morrison. As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in and suddenly I found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my head and I would write it down. Sometimes I was flying, other times I was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if he was doing a surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>about</b> them at the time".|$|E

For that matter, I was puzzled {{about other things}} now and then, and although I {{wanted to get back}} to you <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> shabby <b>about</b> coming home. Somehow I had a notion I ought to stay. After all, you let me go and would like me to finish my job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{think that}} he is a better man than you are,” I answered, impelled, somehow, with a desire to draw upon myself a portion of the wrath <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> was <b>about</b> to break upon his head. “His human fictions, as you choose to call them, make for nobility and manhood. You have no fictions, no dreams, no ideals. You are a pauper.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortable <b>about</b> {{going down}} to breakfast in the morning, as I had never set eyes on Mr. Murdstone since the day when I {{committed}} my memorable offence. However, as it must be done, I went down, {{after two or three}} false starts half-way, and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own room, and presented myself in the parlour.|$|R

60|$|I was {{somewhat}} staggered at his answer. I had expected a groan of remorse. The ghost appeared, on the contrary, {{to be rather}} conceited over the business.

60|$|The {{books were}} always most {{carefully}} and punctually returned, {{and in time}} Jacob Settle and I became quite friends. Once or twice as I crossed the moorland on Sundays I looked in on him; but on such occasions he was shy and ill at ease so that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> diffident <b>about</b> calling to see him. He would never under any circumstances come into my own lodgings.|$|R
