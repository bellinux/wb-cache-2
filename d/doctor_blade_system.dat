The inking unit {{can be either}} of fountain roll system or <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system.</b> The fountain roll system is a simple old system yet if {{there is too much}} or too little ink this system would likely control in a poor way. The doctor blade inside the anilox/ceramic roller uses cell geometry and distribution. These blades ensure that the cells are filled with enough ink.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary ink {{metering}} systems {{employ a}} self contained system {{known as a}} chambered <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and doctor blades.One blade work as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} master thesis is to {{investigate}} why the bolts in a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> breaks {{and to find}} a suitable action to prevent this. The <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> can easily be explained as a scraper that cleans a roll. The scraper moves sideways (oscillates) and the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> along with the roll can be folded back for maintenance work. The work began with collecting relevant data about the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system.</b> When this was done various sources of error {{that may have been}} causing the problems were listed and investigated more closely. Based on these studies, the cause of the failure has been concluded based on the most likely sources of error. The result shows three possible causes of accidents listed below:• A unit performing the oscillating movement that was mounted to the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> could have caused to high strain on the bolts• The movement that is created when the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> and the roll is folded back causes bending in the bearings• Too high load on the roll {{as a result of a}} wrongly adjusted doctor blade. Except these reasons, maintenance routines have been listed as a possible cause. This theory has higher insecurity and need to be investigated closer over a longer period of time. The problem with the oscillating unit is already resolved since it was replaced short before the work started. The folding movement has a unit installed that is meant to make the movement parallel, but this unit is malfunctioning. A suitable complement to this is a measurement system that ensures parallelism. The high load can be resolved by adjusting the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> to the roll. In addition to these proposed actions a suggestion for improvement has been made. This should be done by moving the adjustment for the doctor blade to a more beneficial position. Validerat; 20120623 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} caused by extensive use of polymeric materials arise mainly {{due to lack of}} landfill space and depletion of finite natural resources of fossil raw materials, such as petroleum or natural gas. The substitution of synthetic petroleum-based resins with natural biodegradable resins appears to be one appropriate measure to remedy the above-mentioned situation. This study presents the development of a composite that uses environmentally degradable starch-based resin as matrix and basalt fibre plain fabric as reinforcement. Prepreg sheets were manufactured by means of a modified <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> and a hot power press. The sheets were used to manufacture bidirectional-reinforced specimens with fibre volume contents ranging from 33 to 61 %. Specimens were tested for tensile and flexural strength, and exhibited values of up to 373 and 122 MPa, respectively. Through application of silane coupling agents to the reinforcement fibres, the flexural composite properties were subsequently improved by as much as 38 %. Finally, in order to enhance the fire retardancy and hence the applicability of the composite, fire retardants were applied to the resin, and their effectiveness was tested by means of flame rating (according to UL 94) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively...|$|E

50|$|A Yankee dryer is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the Yankee dryer, the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby crêping the paper.

5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in gravure coating & printing are the rotational position {{at which the}} blade wipes the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the development and}} {{construction of a new}} patented <b>doctor</b> <b>blade.</b> A <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is used when creping soft paper from a large rotating Yankee cylinder. At the current state the <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> are in use for four to six hours before it needs to be switch due to wearing, stopping the production of soft paper. The new idea is to have a very long and small blade that will slide into a fixed blade and be continuously pulled when creping paper. The company CS Production had a concept of the fixed blade but wanted to further develop it since the blade was too wide.   Measurements where done with the old blade and with the old testing device to measure the pull force required to pull the blade. New concepts where made by the method of brainstorming and evaluated with an elimination matrix. Rivet joints where selected as the joining technique for the new design. The new concept contains one dominant blade that smaller parts were assembled to form the final blade. The material selected for the dominant blade and the section blade was a cold rolled stainless spring steel strip and for the middle disc the material was aluminum bronze string casted. Test on the pull force required where done with the new <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> in the new test rig.  FEM simulation where done on {{a small part of the}} blade to see where stresses are occurring in the blade. The FEM result showed that no stresses where on the middle discs, rivets or section blades. This is not reliable results because the small <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> is pushing down onto the middle discs and stresses should be occurring on the discs.  Further testing is needed to see if the blade can withstand the forces applied to it...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{processes}} used in manufacturing of multilayer ceramic packages, multilayer capacitors and large scale integration circuits is tape casting. In this process, the wet tape thickness is one of the single most determining parameters affecting the final properties of the product, and it is therefore of great interest to be able to control it. One way to control the tape thickness is to use a two <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> configuration in the tape casting machine. In this case, it becomes important to fix the height of the slurry in front of both <b>doctor</b> <b>blades</b> according to the desired tape thickness and casting speed (belt velocity). In the present work, the flow in both <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> regions of a slurry is described with a steady state momentum equation in combination with a Bingham plastic constitutive equation, and this is integrated to a closed form analytical solution for both reservoirs based on the desired wet tape thickness and casting speed. The developed model is used to investigate the impact of different material parameters and machine designs on the required slurry height.

Most of these producers, however, complain about excessive vibration that is caused by the roller passing over the cover crop.

Experiments were performed to determine if two alternative roller blade designs would decrease vibration while maintaining the ability to kill a cover crop. Results showed that a spiral <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> or a short−staggered straight <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> significantly reduced vibration as compared to the standard long−straight <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> typically found on rollers.

A reel-to-reel compatible large-area coating technique for solutions is given by <b>doctor</b> <b>blade</b> casting, which is applied here to deposit colloidal nanocrystals onto various substrates. The self-assembly process is demonstrated for magnetic nanocrystals, having a high potential for applications in magnetic memory devices. Shape-controlled (spherical and cubic) and monodisperse nanocrystals with a Wustite core and a cobalt ferrite shell are used in particular. <b>Doctor</b> <b>blade</b> casting of these colloidal nanocrystals results in films exhibiting hexagonally closely packed arrangements, which are formed by a top-down growth, as is evidenced by cross sectional transmission electron microscopy.
