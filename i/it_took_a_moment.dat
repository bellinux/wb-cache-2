25|$|Next, Mohun Bagan were {{up against}} a fairly {{confident}} Shillong Lajong side who had entered the semi finals upsetting Kolkata giants East Bengal 4–3 on aggregate. The first 30 minutes of the semi final was a closely contested tie. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of individual brilliance from Sony Norde in the 40th minute to open the scoring for Bagan. His long range effort rebounded of Lajong goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Jeje Lalpekhlua grabbed onto the opportunity as he toed {{the ball into the}} net. This goal opened the scoring flood gates for Mohun Bagan. In the final stages of the first half Bikramjit Singh scored a screamer from a Cornell Glen pass to put Mohun Bagan 2–0 ahead. After the restart Jeje Lalpekhlua completed his hat-trick by scoring in the 51st and 56th minute. At the fag end of the match young star Azharuddin Mallick put the final nail in the Lajong coffin to secure a comprehensive 5–0 victory for the Mariners.|$|E
60|$|And {{the good}} woman put more wood on the fire, {{and as the}} tongues of flame {{streamed}} up high and clear, she approached {{her face to the}} window-pane and started back with half a scream, as a pale, anxious visage with sad dark eyes seemed to approach her. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two for her to discover that she had seen only the reflection of her own anxious, excited face, the pitchy blackness without having converted the window into a sort of dark mirror.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} her eyes roved wildly about the scene beneath her. I think that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{for the true}} {{condition}} to make any impression upon her--she could not at first realize that the temple had fallen before the assault of men of the outer world. When she did, there must have come, too, a terrible realization of {{what it meant to}} her--the loss of power--humiliation--the exposure of the fraud and imposture which she had for so long played upon her own people.|$|E

60|$|Isabel {{looked at}} him with a puzzled look, and felt almost {{compelled}} to laugh, the situation was so supremely ridiculous. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to think it all out rationally. Yet, after all, though the letter came from the other brother, Ernest, it was this particular brother, Harold, she had been talking to and admiring all the day; it was this particular brother, Harold, who had gained her consent, and whom she had promised to love and to marry. And at that moment it would have been doing Isabel Walters an injustice not to admit that in her own soul she did then and there really love Harold Carnegie.|$|E
60|$|The {{hall was}} large and had many windows. Men were in {{consultation}} upon a platform. Women {{to the number of}} twenty sat close together upon benches. Back of them stood another crowd. But the women on the benches held Shefford's gaze. They were the prisoners. They made a somber group. Some were hooded, some veiled, all clad in dark garments except one on the front bench, and she was dressed in white. She wore a long hood that concealed her face. Shefford recognized the hood and then the slender shape. She was Mary--she whom her jealous neighbors had named the Sago Lily. At sight of her a sharp pain pierced Shefford's breast. His eyes were blurred when he forced them away from her, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> for him to see clearly.|$|E
50|$|Back in Seacouver, Richie {{concentrated}} on training, running the dojo, and letting MacLeod fight his own battles.

He chased Roscza who ran to the police. Roscza denied shooting Tessa. Richie brought back the memory to the reformed junkie and left Roscza alive with the knowledge that he was a murderer.|$|E

40|$|At three metres in height, {{the figure}} of a man looms over the viewer. Painted on two {{fibreglass}} resin panels with a thin wash of paint in muted, sombre colours, the man is stretched and anamorphically distorted.

60|$|That morning, however, {{there was}} a slight stir among those who, with their knitting, were waiting their turn in the outer office as the {{vice-consul}} ushered the police inspector into the consul's private office.

25|$|Dantzig's {{original}} {{example was}} {{to find the best}} assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the observable universe.

50|$|This example, from a {{game played}} in Linares in 2002, {{is one of}} the very rare {{circumstances}} where a grandmaster makes the worst move possible, the only one allowing checkmate on the next move. In this queen endgame, White has some advantage after 69.fxg6+ fxg6 70.Kf4 due to Black's weak pawn on c6. However, Beliavsky playing White played 69.Kf4??, overlooking the response 69...Qb8#. According to Johannessen, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> for both players to realize that it was checkmate, and Beliavsky was a good sport over this mishap.|$|R
40|$|During {{a recent}} {{symposium}} on drug shortages, a community pharmacist colleague pleaded {{for more information}} from his industrial pharmacist colleagues. “We {{have to face the}} patients, and explain to the patients why their medicine is not available”, he said. He was right, of course, but the point is another, more fundamental one. Down at the coalface of pharmacist–patient interaction, a single box is dispensed to a single patient, a very personal interaction at the core of our profession that is sometimes denied to industrial pharmacists. This is not to diminish for <b>a</b> single <b>moment</b> industrial pharmacists’ constant commitment to quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, but our daily practice is centred around batch releases, market authorisations, pharmacovigilance, quality assurance – all of which are certainly a commitment as pharmacists to patients. However, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of deliberate pause to stop and try to visualise the individual patient to whom the single box of medicine is destined, and, even then, how does one valorise the significance of that box of medicines to that patient, what it means to him or her {{to be able to get}} through the day with that much less pain, or to have the hope of another day of life without the fear of remission?N/...|$|R
