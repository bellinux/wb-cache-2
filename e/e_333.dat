Here we describe several highly attenuated second-generation RV-based vaccine vehicles expressing HIV- 1 Gag. For this approach, we modified the previously described RV vaccine vector SPBN by replacing the arginine at position 333 (R 333) within the RV glycoprotein (G) with glutamic acid (<b>E</b> <b>333),</b> deleting 43 amino acids of the RV G cytoplasmic domain (CD), or combining the R 333 exchange and the CD deletion. In addition, we constructed a new RV vector that expresses HIV- 1 Gag from an RV transcription unit upstream of the RV phosphoprotein gene (BNSP-Gag) instead of upstream of the G gene. As expected and as demonstrated for SPBN-Gag, all vaccine vehicles were apathogenic after peripheral administration. However, the new, second-generation vaccine vectors containing modifications in the RV G were also apathogenic after intracranial infection with 105 infectious particles, and BNSP-Gag produced a 50 %-reduced mortality in mice. Of note, the observed attenuation of pathogenicity {{did not result in}} either the attenuation of the humoral response against the RV G or the previously observed robust cellular response against HIV- 1 Gag. These findings demonstrate that very safe and highly effective RV-based vaccines can be constructed and further emphasize their potential utility as efficacious antiviral vaccines...|$|E

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of cystathionine [gamma]lyase (CGL) from yeast has been solved by molecular replacement at {{a resolution of}} 2. 6 a. The molecule consists of 393 amino acid residues and one PLP moiety and is arranged in the crystal as a tetramer with D 2 symmetry as in other related enzymes of the CysMetmetabolism PLPdependent family like cystathionine [beta]lyase (CBL). A structure comparison with other family members revealed surprising insights into the tuning of enzymatic specificity between the different family members. CGLs from yeast or human are virtually identical at their active sites to cystathionine [gamma]synthase (CGS) from E. coli. Both CGLs and bacterial CGSs exhibit [gamma]synthase and [gamma]lyase activities depending on {{their position in the}} metabolic pathway and the available substrates. This group of enzymes has a glutamate (<b>E</b> <b>333</b> in yeast CGL) which binds to the distal group of cystathionine (CTT) or the amino group of cysteine. Plant CGSs use homoserine phosphate instead of Osuccinylhomoserine as one substrate. This is reflected by a partially different active site structure in plant CGSs. In CGL and CBL the pseudosymmetric substrate must dock at the active site in different orientations, with S in [gamma]position (CBL) or in [delta]position (CGL). The conserved glutamate steers the substrate as seen in other CGLs. In CBLs this position is occupied by either tyrosine or hydrophobic residues directing binding of CTT such that S is in the in [gamma]position.

40|$|The -secretase {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for the proteolysis of integral membrane proteins. Nicastrin has been proposed to operate as the substrate receptor of the complex with the Glutamate 332 (<b>E</b> <b>333</b> in human) serving as the anionic binding site for the a-amino-terminal group of substrates. The putative binding site is located within the aminopeptidase-like domain of Nicastrin. The E 332 is proposed to function as the counterpart of the exopeptidase Glu located in the active site of these peptidases. While E 332 could bind the a-amino-terminal group of substrates, we hypothesized, in analogy with M 28 -aminopeptidases, that other residues in the putative binding site of Nicastrin should participate in the interaction as well. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of these residues affected the in vivo processing of APP and Notch substrates only weakly. In addition, the E 332 Q mutation, which completely abolishes the anionic a-amino-terminal binding function, remained fully active. When we introduced the previously characterized E 332 A mutation, we found strongly decreased -secretase complex levels, but the remaining complex appeared as active as the wild type complex. We confirmed in two independent in vitro assays that the specific enzymatic activity of the E 332 A mutant was comparable to that of the wt-complex. Thus, E 332 crucially affects complex maturation rather than substrate recognition. Moreover other Nicastrin mutants, designed to either impede or alter substantially the putative binding pocket, affected only marginally -secretase activity. Consequently, these studies indicate that the main role of the E 332 is in the maturation and assembly of -secretase rather than in the recognition of the substrates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays {{important}} roles in host defense against a variety of pathogens including influenza A virus (IAV). Ligand binding by SP-D is mediated by the trimeric neck and carbohydrate recognition domain (NCRD). We used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human SP-D and a panel of mutant collectin NCRD constructs to identify functionally and structurally important epitopes. The ability of SP-D to bind to IAV and mannan involved partially overlapping binding sites that are distinct from those involved in binding to the glycoprotein- 340 (gp- 340) scavenger receptor protein. A species-specific motif (D 324,D 325,R 343), which has been implicated in the specific binding of several ligands, contributes to recognition by mAbs that block antiviral or mannan binding activity. D 325, in particular, {{is involved in the}} epitopes of these blocking mAbs. Conversely, the interspecies substitution of arginine for Lys 343 in the rat NCRD (rK 343 R) conferred binding to two of the mAbs. The single site substitution of alanine for R 349 or E 347 resulted in highly selective alterations in mAb binding and caused decreased antiviral activity. Mutations at Glu 333 (<b>E</b> <b>333</b> A), Trp 340 (W 340 F), and Phe 335 (F 335 A), which abrogated antiviral activity, were associated with decreased binding to multiple blocking mAbs, consistent with critical structural roles. More conservative substitutions at 335, which showed a significant increase in neutralization activity, caused selective loss of binding to one mAb. The analysis reveals, for the first time, an extended binding site for IAV; calcium-dependent antiviral activity involves residues flanking the primary carbohydrate binding site as well as more remote residues displayed on the carbohydrate recognition domain surface...|$|E

Optimization studies on the types and concentrations of the coagulant and flocculant showed that {{the highest rate of}} turbidity removal was obtained with 10 mg L- 1 FL- 2949 (coagulant) and 12 mg L- 1 A <b>333</b> <b>E</b> (flocculant), which was about 14. 4 and 866. 7 times higher than that obtained with A <b>333</b> <b>E</b> alone and that obtained through natural precipitation by gravity, respectively.

Zeta potential measurements were conducted to elucidate the removal mechanism of the fine particles, and they revealed that there was a strong linear relationship between the removal rate of each pair of coagulant and flocculant application and the zeta potential differences that were obtained by subtracting the zeta potential of flocculant-treated mine water from the zeta potential of coagulant-treated mine water. Accordingly, through an optimization process, coagulation-flocculation by use of polymers could be advantageous to mine water treatment, because the process rapidly removes fine particles in mine water and only requires a small-scale plant for set-up purposes owing to the short retention time in the process...|$|R

To investigate the nature of Archaean ferropicrite magmatism, we sampled ferropicrites from the Steep Rock, Lumby Lake, Grassy Portage Bay, and Dayohessarah Lake greenstone belts in the Western Superior Province, Ontario, Canada. Ferropicrite samples that are thought to approximate liquid compositions have 18 wt % Fe 2 O 3 at 19 wt % MgO, and frequently contain less than 5 wt % Al 2 O 3. They are enriched inTi and high field strength elements relative to koma-tiites, and have fractionated trace element profiles (La/Yb 11). These distinctive geochemical characteristics require that ferropi-crites and komatiites have different mantle sources, with that of the ferropicrites being Fe- and incompatible element-enriched compared with that of komatiites. A consideration of recent 5 GPa melting experiments on pyrolite and Fe-rich Martian mantle compositions indicates that Archaean ferropicrites could be generated by melting of an olivine-dominated mantle source with a Mg-number of 85 at 5 GPa.

In order to determine forage DM yield, plants were hand-clipped at the vegetative stage (104 days after sowing, in 2006) and at full bloom (132 and 170 days, in 2005 e 2006, respectively). Forage nutritive value was accessed by determining crude protein (CP) concentration and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). Results showed that when plants were at the full bloom stage and under moderate shading, forage DM yield was reduced by 57 %, forage CP content was increased by 2, 3 %, and IVOMD was raised by 5, 5 %, compared to plants at full sun. In terms of their potential utilization, common oat and black-oat show promise for regional silvopastoral systems in southern Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a precoded and iteratively {{detected}} downlink {{multiuser system}} is proposed, which {{is capable of}} operating in rankdeficient scenarios, {{when the number of}} transmitters exceeds the number of receivers. The literature of uplink space division multiple access (SDMA) systems is rich, but at the time of writing there is a paucity of information on the employment of SDMA techniques in the downlink. Hence, we propose a novel precoded downlink SDMA (DL-SDMA) multiuser communication system, which invokes a low-complexity nearmaximum-likelihood sphere decoder and is particularly suitable for the aforementioned rank-deficient scenario. Powerful iterative decoding is carried out by exchanging extrinsic information between the precoder’s decoder and the outer channel decoder. Furthermore, we demonstrate with the aid of extrinsic information transfer charts that our proposed precoded DL-SDMA system has a better convergence behavior than its nonprecoded DL-SDMA counterpart. Quantitatively, the proposed system having a normalized system load of Ls = 1. <b>333,</b> i. <b>e.,</b> 1. <b>333</b> times higher effective throughput facilitated by having 1. 333 times more DL-SDMA transmitters than receivers, exhibits a “turbo cliff” at an Eb/N 0 of 5 dB and hence results in an infinitesimally low bit error rate (BER).

CDM prevalence and effects on virologic responses were analyzed retrospectively using clinical data. The effects on etravirine susceptibility were assessed in clinical samples and confirmed using site-directed mutants. The most prevalent CDMs (> 10 %) were A 371 V, E 399 D, A 376 S, N 348 I, A 360 T, G <b>333</b> <b>E,</b> and L 283 I. CDM presence {{was positively correlated}} with thymidine analogue-associated mutations, but not with NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). The presence or number of CDMs did not significantly reduce etravirine susceptibility, although small reductions were seen in samples with G 333 D, N 348 I, A 360 V, T 369 I, and A 376 S. N 348 I, E 399 G, and N 348 I/T 369 I were associated with reduced etravirine susceptibility when present with K 103 N, L 100 I, or Y 181 C. N 348 I or T 369 I was associated with reduced etravirine susceptibility when present with K 101 P or K 103 R/V 179 D. Virologic responses to an etravirine-containing regimen were slightly diminished when G 333 D, G 335 D, or A 376 S was present, but this was not confirmed in subgroups with higher baseline resistance or without etravirine RAMs. CDMs alone do not confer substantial reductions in etravirine susceptibility but can further reduce etravirine susceptibility in combination with certain NNRTI mutations.

40|$|Resumo: Este trabalho apresenta um estudo do processo de extração supercrítica (SFE) de óleo de urucum, para obter sementes desengorduradas e extrato rico em tocotrienóis. O trabalho consistiu em um estudo dos parâmetros do processo, do aumento de escala e da viabilidade econômica. Uma revisão da agroindústria do urucum mostrou uma tendência crescente de seu uso devido ao aumento da demanda dos consumidores por produtos naturais e que as sementes são ricas em tocotrienóis, substâncias com ação antioxidante e hipocolesterolêmica. No entanto, a valorização socioeconômica dos produtores, a obtenção de extrato com maior qualidade e o aproveitamento dos subprodutos dos processos foram os principais pontos que ainda precisavam ser aprimorados. Desde que a tecnologia supercrítica tem a vantagem de obter extratos e resíduo livres de solvente, agregando valor aos produtos e subprodutos do processo, um estudo preliminar de viabilidade econômica do processo SFE de óleo de urucum com CO 2 supercrítico foi realizado, usando os dados disponíveis na literatura. O estudo mostrou que a SFE de óleode urucum com dados não otimizados foi viável, uma vez que os custos de manufatura (COM) dos extratos, para as diversas escalas industriais, foram iguais a US$ 382, 82 /kg (100 L), US$ 258, 54 /kg (500 L) e US$ 232, 88 /kg (1000 L). Diante disso, condições otimizadas de processo foram determinadas com ensaios experimentais em 313 <b>e</b> <b>333</b> K e 20, 31, e 40 MPa. A quantidade máxima de óleo foi obtida em 333 K/ 40 MPa. Nestas condições, um experimento cinético (OEC) foi realizado e o COM do extrato foi estimado em função do tempo de extração. Com a otimização do tempo de processo, o COM doextrato para as capacidades de 100 e 500 L decresceu para US$ 124, 58 /kg e US$ 109, 27 /kg, respectivamente. Um extrato mais concentrado em ?-tocotrienol, (14, 6 ± 0, 4) %, foi obtido em 313 K/ 20 MPa. Nesta condição, foi obtido o menor teor de bixina no extrato, (0, 9 ± 0, 1) %. Logo, extrato rico em substâncias funcionais e sementes desengorduradas, e ricas em bixina para {{posterior}} extração, foram obtidas com o COM viável para diferentes escalas industriais. OECs em equipamento de 5 L, em 313 K/ 20 MPa, validaram o critério de aumento de escala usado na simulação do processo para a estimativa do COM: manter constantes a razão entre a massa de solvente e a massa de matéria-prima (S/F) eo tempo de residência do solvente, obtidos em escala de laboratório. As OECs em ambas as escalas apresentaram desempenho similares, tanto em rendimento de extrato, quanto de tocotrienóis. Os valores de COM dos extratos foram estimados para os cenários de investidor, produtor e indústria de colorantes, com custo de matéria-prima variando de 0, 00 - 2, 20 US$/kg. Para o cenário do investidor, o tempo de processo favorável do ponto de vista econômico foi em 105 minutos, com COM de (115 ± 5) US$/kg para uma unidade de 500 L e S/F de 8, 7. Para os cenários, produtor e a indústria, os menores COMs foram (40 ± 6) US$/kg, (15 ± 2) US$/kg, e (12 ± 1) US$/kg, para as capacidades de 50, 300 e 500 L, respectivamente, em 28 minutos e S/F de 3, 1. O tempo de retorno de investimento variouentre 1 - 5 anos, para o produtor, que vende tanto o óleo, quanto o resíduo gerado: sementes desengorduradas e ricas em bixina; e para a indústria de colorantes, que utilizam as sementes desengorduradas para a produção do colorante, além de poder vender o óleo. Este estudo mostrou que a SFE é economicamente viável para escalas a partir de 50 L. Além disso, tem a vantagem de produzir sementes com teor de óleo reduzido/controlado e extrato com concentrações diferentes em ?-tocotrienol, apenas ajustando as condições operacionais do processoAbstract: This work {{presents a}} study of the supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of annatto oil to obtain defatted seeds and extract rich in tocotrienols. The work consisted in studying the process parameters, the scale-up and economic feasibility. A review of the annatto agribusiness showed a trend of using annatto due to the increasing consumer demand for natural products because the seeds are rich in tocotrienols, which are antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic substances. However, the socioeconomic evaluation of the producers, the recovery of higher quality extract, and the use of process byproducts were found as the main points that still needed to be improved. Supercritical Technology has theadvantage of obtaining solvent-free extracts and residue that add value to the products and byproducts of the process. Thus, a preliminary study of economic feasibility of the SFE process of annatto oil was carried out using the available data in literature. The study showed that the SFE of annatto oil was ecnomically feasible with no data optimized, since the cost of manufacturing (COM) of extracts, for various industrial scales, were US$ 382. 82 /kg (100 L), US$ 258. 54 /kg (500 L) e US$ 232. 88 /kg (1000 L). Therefore, optimized conditions of the process were determined with the experimental assays at 313 <b>e</b> <b>333</b> K and 20, 31, and 40 MPa. Largers amounts of oil were obtained in 333 K/ 40 MPa. In these conditions, kinect experiments were carried out and the COM of extracts was estimated as a function of extraction time. The optimization of process time decreased the COM for the capacities 100 e 500 L to US$ 124. 58 /kg to US$ 109. 27 /kg respectively. Extract more concentrated in ?-tocotrienol, (14. 6 ± 0. 4) % was obtained at 313 K/ 20 MPa. In this condition, the lowest bixin content was obtained in the extract, (0. 9 ± 0. 1) %. Therefore, an extract rich in functional substances and defatted seeds, and rich in bixin for later extraction were obtained with different feasible COM for industrial scales. The overall extraction curves (OECs) determined in a 5 L unit at 313 K/ 20 MPa showed that the scaling-up criterion used in the SFE simulation to estimate the COM was validated. The criterion was to keep constant the mass of solvent to mass of feed ratio (S/F) and the solvent residence time obtained in laboratory scale. The OECs in both scales had similar performance, with similar yield of extract and tocotrienols. The COM of the extracts was estimated for different scenarios considering three different stakeholders: investor, producer and colorant industries. The raw material cost ranged from 0. 00 to 2. 20 US$/kg. In the investor's scenario, the best process time, from the economic standpoint, was 105 minutes, with COM (115 ± 5) US$/kg for a 500 L and S/F of 8. 7. For producer and industry scenarios, the lowest COMs were (40 ± 6) US$/kg, (15 ± 2) US$/kg, e (12 ± 1) US$/kg, obtained at 28 minutes and S/F of 3. 1 for capacities of 50, 300 and 500 L, respectively. The payback period ranged between 1 - 5 years for the producer selling oil, waste, and defatted seed which has high bixin content. The colorant industry use defatted seeds for colorant production, and sells the oil. This study showed that the SFE is economically feasible for units of at least 50 L. Moreover, the process has the advantage of producing seed with reduced or controlled oil content, and extract with different concentrations of ?- tocotrienol, only by adjusting the operating conditions of the proces...|$|E

Usando o método de gradiente de severidade da doença, foram obtidas em cada experimento quatro epidemias da doença, com diferentes severidades, desde D 1 até D 4, em ordem decrescente, o que permitiu comparar o efeito das epidemias no crescimento da planta e na produção de tubérculos, bem como determinar o momento de se iniciar o controle da doença. Tendo como base o tempo desde o plantio até o aparecimento dos primeiros sintomas da epidemia, foram avaliados os seguintes métodos para previsão da doença: dias acumulados (DA); graus-dia acumulados (GD), tendo como temperatura-base 7 ºC; e dias fisiológicos acumulados (DF), tendo como temperatura mínima 7 ºC, máxima de 30 ºC e ótima de 21 ºC. O estabelecimento do gradiente da doença mostrou diferenças significativas na produção em cada experimento. As maiores reduções na produção dos tubérculos ocorreram na parcela não tratada com fungicida D 1, com 49, 6 % em 2000; 52, 7 % em 2001; e 58, 2 % em 2002. A previsão da epidemia utilizando-se os métodos DA e GD não indicou o momento certo para iniciar o controle da epidemia. O método DF foi o mais adequado, estabelecendo-se o primeiro sintoma entre 240 <b>e</b> <b>333</b> DF. Conclui-se que a pinta-preta, dependendo da severidade, afeta a área foliar e a produção de tubérculos. Dos métodos para determinar o estabelecimento da pinta-preta, o DF apresentou o maior potencial, recomendando-se seu uso para iniciar o manejo da doença aos 250 DF após o plantio, sempre e quando as condições ambientais favorecem o estabelecimento do patógeno. The {{influence}} {{of an early}} blight epidemic on potato tuber yield was evaluated in three field experiments during 2000 to 2002 crop seasons under Viçosa, Minas Gerais state growing conditions. Through a disease severity gradient method, used four different dosages of fungicide chloratalonil were obtained four epidemic levels with severity range of D 1 (maximum), plot without fungicide treatment, to D 4 (minimum), plot with fully dosage fungicide commercial recommended, were obtained, which allowed for comparison of the epidemic effect on plant growth and tuber yield, and indicated the time for initiating of the first early blight (Alternaria solani) lesions on potato foliage The disease was predicted by using the methods based either degree days (DD) with base temperature of 7 ºC and physiological days (PD) having minimum, optimum and maximum temperature of 7, 21 and 30 ºC, respectively, accumulated during the period between planting and the first symptom appearance. Plots with higher disease levels along the gradient had significantly loss tuber yield in all trials. The highest yield reduction of 49, 6; 52, 7 and 58, 2 % occurred in D 1, plots without fungicide treatment, during the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The epidemic prediction through accumulated DD or PD did not indicate the appropriate time to initiate the epidemic control. However, the PD method that predicted the first symptoms between 240 and 333 accumulated PDs {{was found to be}} more adequate. The data revealed that green leaf area and tuber yield reduction caused by the early blight is dependent upon the disease severity. Compared to the others, the PD method appears to be most suitable to determine when the disease will establish, and thus can be recommended to initiate the disease management at 250 accumulated PDs, under disease-favorable climatic conditions...|$|E
