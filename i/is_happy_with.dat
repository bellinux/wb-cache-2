5|$|Jan urges Pam {{to take a}} {{corporate}} training program in graphic design in New York City when Pam reveals {{that she wants to}} be a graphic designer, but Roy quashes the idea. Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish, which creates tension between them. Pam then tells the camera she <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> her life now, and that they do not even make her dream house in Scranton. She then breaks down and cries in front of the camera. As the day comes to a close, Michael leaves the warehouse in complete disarray.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to popular}} demand from citizens, Ben restarts the youth {{basketball}} league, although {{with only two}} teams. They are coached by Ron (Nick Offerman), who is extremely strict and disciplined with his players, and Andy (Chris Pratt), who is very laid back and lets his kids go out of control. Tom (Aziz Ansari), who referees the game, becomes jealous when his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives to support Ron. Tom insists he <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) and does not mind that Wendy is dating Ron. However, Tom repeatedly calls false fouls against Ron's players until {{all of them are}} benched.

During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

25|$|Richard Bevan, chief {{executive}} of the League Managers Association (LMA), stated the following month that Keegan would consider a return to the club but only if those who hold the ownership are willing to develop a structure which he <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with.</b> Up until Dennis Wise's resignation as director of football at Newcastle in April 2009, many fans directed the blame of Keegan's exit at both owner Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise as a result of such a role being established and poorly used. The club was warned by the LMA on 5 September 2008 to develop a structure which would satisfy the next manager to replace Keegan to avoid a similar situation repeating itself and damaging the club's image.|$|E
25|$|The Sprinter fleet that EMT {{inherited}} at {{the start}} of the franchise was in a very poor state. Problems ranged from basic and simple to major complicated faults. The fleet was put together from various sources - around four different previous companies, with some coming directly from passenger work but some that had been lying idle surplus to requirements off lease in sidings. East Midlands Trains has claimed that it will take the lifetime of the franchise to get the trains to a standard that it <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with.</b> In addition to the various sources of the trains, passenger figures given to the Department for Transport prior to the franchise were incorrect, leading to a shortfall in the number of seats provided (a 26% decrease in capacity on route 2) compared with what was required.|$|E

500|$|Apostolidès {{expressed}} {{the view that}} many of the characters in Tintin and the Picaros could be divided into pairs. He considered Calculus and Alcazar to be one such pair, noting that they are [...] "both masters of power and control, the former in science and the latter in politics". He also placed Castafiore and Peggy together as a pair, noting that they each embody [...] "love, both maternal and romantic". Haddock and Wagg were also paired together, both being [...] "driven to succeed, but the former <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> playing out his success in private lie, whereas the latter tries to aggrandize himself everywhere". Finally, he paired together Ridgewell and Tintin, noting that while in The Broken Ear they had a father-son style relationship, at this point they have become equals.|$|E

500|$|Ford {{disliked the}} new angle, telling Lucas, [...] "No way am I {{being in a}} Steven Spielberg movie like that." [...] Spielberg himself, who {{depicted}} aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, resisted it. Lucas {{came up with a}} story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994. (Stuart had previously written The Fugitive, which starred Ford.) Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow Henry Jones, Sr. to return, expressing concern over whether his son <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> what he has accomplished. After he learned that Joseph Stalin was interested in psychic warfare, he decided to have Soviets as the villains and the aliens to have psychic powers. Following Stuart's next draft, Lucas hired Last Crusade writer Jeffrey Boam to write the next three versions, the last of which was completed in March 1996. Three months later, Independence Day was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film. Lucas decided to focus on the Star Wars prequels.|$|E
