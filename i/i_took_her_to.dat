500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it. My daughter, my youngest daughter, really wanted me to do it for that reason – Johnny Depp was in it. (She came on set to meet Depp) and he was really delightful to her, she had a great time. Then, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the junket – and (Depp) greeted her like an old pal when he saw her. I've got plenty of brownie points at the moment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh yes,' said Elizabeth, 'that {{was soon}} settled; {{she was only}} scared, so <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Mamma, who kissed us both, told Dora she loved us all the same, and so on; which made her quite happy again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a more {{immediate}} question—-what are we {{to do with your}} sister if she escapes to-night? Shall <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Henderson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> away," [...] he answered. [...] "Where should <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to?</b> What can a lonesome old vagabond, like me, do for her? If she's happy where she is--let her stop where she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you see, I haven't exactly popped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> yet; but I {{have been}} doing the civil; and if she's up <b>to</b> snuff, as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be, she knows very well what I'm after by this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your Charlotte is Fisher's wife, you know, and {{a worthy}} good {{creature}} she is. Poor old Fisher, {{the first time}} I saw tears on his cheeks was when his wife met him being carried up, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> wife, and clothed {{her warm}} [...] With skins of the gleaming seal; [...] Her {{wandering}} glances sank to rest [...] When {{she held a}} babe to her fair, warm breast, [...] And she loved me dear and leal.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> her room," [...] said Adriana, [...] "I suppose I was nervous; but I {{burst into}} tears, and threw my arms round {{her neck and}} embraced her, {{but she did not}} respond. She touched my {{forehead}} with her lips, and withdrew from my embrace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{at least}} will be richer," [...] {{said the other}} woman, [...] "and by the crown of Baaltis. Well, I do not grudge it you, {{and as for the}} {{daughter}} of Sakon, she shall be Ithobal's if <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> him limb by limb." ...|$|R
60|$|One evening {{my mother}} {{suggested}} that, <b>to</b> entertain <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the theatre. <b>I</b> didn't really like to, because I was seventeen and sensitive about {{appearing in the}} streets with a girl. I couldn't see my way to enjoying my delight in public. But we went.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] said Flora saucily. [...] "I'm {{glad to hear}} that, because I mean to {{keep you}} in a dying state. I will tell the story as a dead secret <b>to</b> Lucy, when <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see my poor people, and you sha'n't hear it for weeks to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} that you'd be coming," [...] said Sexty, [...] "and {{she wanted me to}} put off my pipe and little drop of drink; but I said that if Mrs. Lopez was the lady <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be she wouldn't begrudge a {{hard-working}} fellow his pipe and glass on a holiday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, very well. I don't know {{anything}} about that. I saw him coming away from here, {{and it may be}} as well to tell you that I have made up my mind. Linda Tressel is not the sort of young woman that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be, and I shall have nothing more to say to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{glimpses of}} the light of home as I had ever known, had {{streamed}} from her. How young she was, how fair, how loving! <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the first poor roof that I was master of, and made it rich. She came {{into the darkness of}} my life, and made it bright.-- She is before me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!--no {{more dead}} than you are, only <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be five-and-thirty. And {{when a woman}} has had nine children, you know, she looks none the younger; and I can tell ye that when she trod on my corruns at a ball at the Grand Juke's, I felt {{something}} heavier than a feather on my foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|God {{bless the}} woman with the black mittens for making me laugh so this morning! <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be a kind of public-spirited Mrs. Sparsit, and as such <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> my bosom. God bless you both, my dear friends, in this Christmas and New Year time, and in all times, seasons, and places, and send you to Gad's Hill with the next flowers! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} {{but that she}} {{was found in the}} fields and that I caught her after a fight in which she slew two rykors and in which I slew a Moak, and that <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Luud, to whom, of course, she belongs. If Luud wishes <b>to</b> {{question}} <b>her</b> that is for Luud to do--not for me." [...] Thus always he answered the curious.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{the little}} boat-house, {{and there we}} hired a boat, and I rowed in silence under the bridge and into {{the shade of a}} tree. The square grey stone masses of the Foreign Office loomed through the twigs, I remember, and a little space of grass {{separated}} us from the pathway and the scrutiny of passers-by. And there we talked.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the station, {{and after}} she had gone I was to drive to Dover, and cross to Calais by the night boat. I couldn't, I felt, return to London. We walked over the crest {{and down to the}} little station of Martin Mill side by side, talking at first in broken fragments, for the most part of {{unimportant}} things.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A schoolmaster, {{and says}} dinner-mats! I'll {{give you a}} clue to my trade, {{in a game of}} forfeits. I love my love with a B because she's Beautiful; I hate my love with a B because she is Brazen; <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the sign of the Blue Boar, and I treated her with Bonnets; her name's Bouncer, and she lives in Bedlam.--Now, what do I make with my straw?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{raised her}} hand in quick impatience: the {{suggestion}} might have been almost abject. [...] "It isn't a question of recovery. It won't be a question of any vulgar struggle. To 'get him back' she must have lost him, and to have lost him she must have had him. [...] "With which Fanny shook her head. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be waking up to is the truth that, all the while, she really HASN'T had him. Never." ...|$|R
5000|$|About his ethnic {{affiliation}} Silkman said: [...] "I {{was brought}} up Jewish and I'm Jewish through and through.It is my daughter's batmitzvah next year so <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> shul when <b>I</b> can." [...] Silkman {{has been involved in}} greyhound racing, with his dogs Half Awake, Skomal and Carlsberg Champ respectively winning the 1987 Gold Collar (Catford), 1988 Guineas (Hackney) and the 1990 Cesarewitch (Belle Vue). He is a presenter on Racing Post Greyhound TV. Silkman is also involved in horseracing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{if he had}} {{a better}} hope lighted as his guiding star! But we must not stand talking now, Jock; <b>I</b> must <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Church quietly with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I shall. Good-bye, Marie. You'll {{find the}} {{difference}} between me and him yet.' So he took his leave, and as he sauntered away he thought that upon the whole he had prospered, considering the extreme difficulties under which he had laboured in carrying on his suit. 'She's quite {{a different sort of}} girl from what <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be,' he said to himself 'Upon my word, she's awfully jolly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later a pleasant-looking but dignified lady came out from among the tea-drinkers and bore down {{directly}} on me. [...] "I hear," [...] she said, [...] "you've been talking to my little girl, and I {{want you to know}} I was very sorry I couldn't let her paddle. She was just recovering from whooping-cough when <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the seaside, and I was afraid to let her go in the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{a curious}} horror of {{anything}} abnormal. Once <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] {{thinking that this}} would be an enchanting experience for her. Not only was it intolerably repellent to her, it was terrifying, and when the bodies of the characters suddenly lengthened, she sought refuge under the seat. All deformities, grotesqueries were to her horrible, appalling. She refused to look at the actors and at last I took her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had a sister," [...] {{continued}} the skipper, {{in a somewhat}} uneven voice, [...] "I should <b>take</b> <b>her</b> out. This evening, for instance, <b>I</b> should <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> a theatre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{said the}} priest, [...] "deliver me over Torfrida the younger, {{daughter}} of Hereward and this woman, that <b>I</b> may <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the King, who {{has found a}} fit husband for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{your own}} sake," [...] Aynesworth said fiercely, [...] "I trust {{that this is}} one of the unaccountable things. For the rest, you shall have no other chance. <b>I</b> shall <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Truro tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you--another time. But, old fellow, I don't {{know whether}} we either of us could stand your house full of {{children}} yet. Emily would be always among them, and think she liked it; but I knew how it would be. It was just so when <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> a kind friend of ours after the little girls were taken; she had the children constantly with her, but I never saw her so ill as she was afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What could I do? I don't {{know what}} money looks {{like in the}} morning. And she'd paid her last cent of pocket-money for her {{railroad}} ticket except a quarter, which she had squandered on gum-drops. She was eating them out of a paper bag. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> a boarding-house on Thirty-second Street where I used to live, and hocked her. She's in soak for a dollar. That's old Mother McGinnis' price per day. I'll show you the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{goes to the}} Louvre, but I {{see nothing}} of the copies. She has {{something}} on her easel; I suppose {{it is one of}} the pictures you ordered. Such a magnificent order ought to give her fairy-fingers. But she is not in earnest. I can't say anything to her; I am afraid of her. One evening, last summer, when <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> walk in the Champs Elysees, she said some things to me that frightened me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will soon}} be over now. The singing-master is going, and the Italian master has just arrived. I am sparing no pains to make my young prima donna a most {{accomplished}} person. In learning to sing she must also learn the language which is especially the language of music. I shall perfect her in the accent when <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Italy. It is the height of my ambition <b>to</b> have <b>her</b> mistaken for an Italian when she sings in public. Is there anything I can do before I leave you again? May I send you some more champagne? Please say yes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we will see. If she be {{the woman}} <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be, <b>I</b> think I could do {{something}} with her. I have never supposed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be a bad woman,--never. I will think of it." [...] Then Lady Glencora left her husband, and did not consult him afterwards as to the course she would pursue. He had his budget to manage, and his speeches to make. The little affair of the Duke and Madame Goesler, she thought it best <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into <b>her</b> own hands without any assistance from him. [...] "What a fool I was," [...] she said to herself, [...] "to have her down there when the Duke was at Matching!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] {{cried the}} milkmaid angrily. [...] "See {{what you have}} done! My cow has broken her leg, and <b>I</b> must <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the mender's shop and have it glued on again. What {{do you mean by}} coming here and {{frightening}} my cow?" ...|$|R
