40|$|Abstract: Landscapes {{reflect the}} {{multifunctional}} nature {{of land and}} the complex relationships that exist between society and the <b>environment.</b> <b>Land</b> <b>management</b> systems have evolved to provide resources to meet societal demand but within a human lifetime these practices can significantly change both the landscape and the relationship that people have with the affected land. Land uses have differing, often conflicting objectives and making decisions on landscape futures is challenging to decision makers and compromises must be made between competing economic, ecological and social values. When dealing with competing criteria, land use decision-making is complex, made more so {{when we consider the}} spatial and temporal dimensions of the decisions. Scenario development is an effective way to present complex spatial and temporal information and geographical information systems provide a basis with which to assess the relative success of alternative landscape scenarios quantitatively. This paper describes a software system – ScenarioBuilder- which allows stakeholders and expert groups to build landscape scenarios depicting different forest management strategies in a 68000 Ha study area in Southern Tasmania comprising private property, state forest and national park land. The ScenarioBuilder software built around ESRI ArcObjects is operator controlled and allows manipulation, selection and display of the underlying 2 D polygon based forestry data.

At the same time, natural resources are becoming scarce and climatic changes influence more and more the conditions of vegetal and animal production.

40|$|Land {{cover is}} one of the {{fundamental}} data sets on <b>environment</b> assessment, <b>land</b> <b>management</b> and biodiversity protection, etc. Hence, data quality control of land cover is extremely critical for geospatial analysis and decision making. Due to the similar remote-sensing reflectance for some land cover types, omission and commission errors occurred in preliminary classification could result to spatial inconsistency between land cover types. In the progress of post-classification, this error checking mainly depends on manual labour to assure data quality, by which it is time-consuming and labour intensive. So a method required for automatic detection in post-classification is still an open issue. From logical inconsistency point of view, an inconsistency detection method is designed. This method consist of a grids extended 4 -intersection model (GE 4 IM) for topological representation in single-valued space, by which three different kinds of topological relations including disjoint, touch, contain or contained-by are described, and an algorithm of region overlay for the computation of spatial inconsistency. The rules are derived from universal law in nature between water body and wetland, cultivated land and artificial surface. Through experiment conducted in Shandong Linqu County, data inconsistency can be pointed out within 6 minutes through calculation of topological inconsistency between cultivated land and artificial surface, water body and wetland. The efficiency evaluation of the presented algorithm is demonstrated by Google Earth images. Through comparative analysis, the algorithm is proved to be promising for inconsistency detection in land cover data...|$|R
40|$|Land-use {{change to}} meet 21 st-century demands for food, fuel, and fiber {{will depend on}} many {{interactive}} factors, including global policies limiting anthropogenic climate change and realized improvements in agricultural productivity. Climate-change mitigation policies will alter the decision-making <b>environment</b> for <b>land</b> <b>management,</b> and changes in agricultural productivity will influence cultivated land expansion. We explore to what extent future increases in agricultural productivity might offset conversion of tropical forest lands to crop lands under a climate mitigation policy and a contrasting no-policy scenario in a global integrated assessment model. The Global Change Assessment Model is applied here to simulate a mitigation policy that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4. 5 W m− 2 (approximately 526 ppm CO 2) in the year 2100 by introducing a price for all greenhouse gas emissions, including those from land use. These scenarios are simulated with several cases of future agricultural productivity growth rates and the results downscaled to produce gridded maps of potential land-use change. We find that tropical forests are preserved near their present-day extent, and bioenergy crops emerge as an effective mitigation option, only in cases in which a climate mitigation policy that includes an economic price for land-use emissions is in place, and in which agricultural productivity growth continues throughout the century. We find that idealized land-use emissions price assumptions are most effective at limiting deforestation, even when cropland area must increase to meet future food demand. These findings {{emphasize the importance of}} accounting for feedbacks from land-use change emissions in global climate change mitigation strategies...|$|R

This paper facilitates an overall understanding of the <b>land</b> <b>management</b> paradigm. The model reflects drivers of globalisation and technology development which support establishment of multifunctional information systems incorporating diverse land rights, land use regulations and other useful data. A third major driver, sustainable development, stimulates demands for comprehensive information about environmental conditions in combination with other land related data. It is argued that development of such a model is important or even necessary for facilitating a holistic approach to the <b>management</b> of <b>land</b> as the key asset of any nation or jurisdiction.
