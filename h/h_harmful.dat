40|$|AbstractControlled low {{strength}} materials (CLSM), is a self-flowing cementitious backfill material, {{most suitable}} for sustainability objectives since it makes use of wastes in large quantities. Wasted gypsum wall boards (drywalls), a construction & demolition waste, are known to pollute atmosphere by releasing <b>harmful</b> <b>H</b> 2 S gas when dumped at landfills. Use of waste drywalls with flyash, as cement replacement in concrete and CLSM, have resulted in low strength mixes at initial & later ages, respectively. In this paper powdered drywalls with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), was used as secondary cementitious material along with stone dust as fine aggregates, to produce sustainable CLSM mixtures with varying binder ratios and water contents. Reduction in compressive strength at later ages was not observed for mixes with low water contents, hence use of GGBS instead of flyash with lesser water contents, is effective in resisting detrimental effects of sulfates present in drywalls...|$|R

However, high abundance of phytoplankton could give harmful effects toward water ecosystem. Moreover, they could produce toxic substances {{that will be}} accumulated within their consumer. This accumulation could be dangerous for human or animals. This research were aimed to determine and calculatespecies of harmful algae in Banyuasin coastal waters.

In the form of cone-shaped with a diameter of 30 cm, length 100 cm and mesh size 30 μm. The result showed that there are 35 genera of phytoplankton. That have been found and consisted of four groups; Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae. 13 species were identified as Harmful Algal (Chaetoceros, Coscinodiscus, Nitzschia, Skeletonema, Thalassiosira, Alexandrium, Ceratium, Dinophysis, Noctiluca, Protoperidinium, Prorocentrum, Anabaena dan Oscillatoria), with seven of them were known for having toxin (Nitzschia, Alexandrium, Dinophysis, Protoperidinium Prorocentrum, Anabaena and Oscillatoria).

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a {{well-known}} environmental chemical threat with an unpleasant smell of rotten eggs. Aside from the established toxic effects of high-dose H 2 S, research {{over the past decade}} revealed that cells endogenously produce small amounts of H 2 S with physiological functions. H 2 S has therefore been classified as a “gasotransmitter. ” A major challenge for cells and tissues is the maintenance of low physiological concentrations of H 2 S in order to prevent potential toxicity. Epithelia of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract are especially faced with this problem, since these barriers are predominantly exposed to exogenous H 2 S from environmental sources or sulfur-metabolising microbiota. In this paper, we review the cellular mechanisms by which epithelial cells maintain physiological, endogenous H 2 S concentrations. Furthermore, we suggest a concept by which epithelia use their electrolyte and liquid transport machinery as defence mechanisms in order to eliminate exogenous sources for potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>H</b> 2 S concentrations...|$|R
40|$|In the plankton, {{heterotrophic}} microbes encounter and ingest phytoplankton prey, which effectively removes > 50 % {{of daily}} phytoplankton {{production in the}} ocean and influences global primary production and biochemical cycling rates. Factors such as size, shape, nutritional value, and presence of chemical deterrents are known to affect predation pressure. Effects of movement behaviors of either predator or prey on predation pressure, and particularly fleeing behaviors in phytoplankton are thus far unknown. Here, we quantified individual 3 D movements, population distributions, and survival rates of the toxic phytoplankton species, Heterosigma akashiwo {{in response to a}} ciliate predator and predator-derived cues. We observed predator-induced defense behaviors previously unknown for phytoplankton. Modulation of individual phytoplankton movements during and after predator exposure resulted in an effective separation of predator and prey species. The strongest avoidance behaviors were observed when H. akashiwo co-occurred with an actively grazing predator. Predator-induced changes in phytoplankton movements resulted in a reduction in encounter rate and a 3 -fold increase in net algal population growth rate. A spatially explicit population model predicted rapid phytoplankton bloom formation only when fleeing behaviors were incorporated. These model predictions reflected field observations of rapid <b>H.</b> akashiwo <b>harmful</b> algal bloom (HAB) formation in the coastal ocean. Our results document a novel behavior in phytoplankton that can significantly reduce predation pressure and suggests a new mechanism for HAB formation. Phytoplankton behaviors that minimize predatory losses, maximize resource acquisition, and alter community composition and distribution patterns could have major implications for our understanding and predictive capacity of marine primary production and biochemical cycling rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn a {{majority}} of living organisms, a fundamental protection mechanism from reactive oxygen species is by the ascorbate–glutathione cycle in which an important antioxidant, ascorbate (vitamin C), is utilized to convert <b>harmful</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2 to H 2 O. Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) maintains reduced pools of ascorbate by recycling the oxidized form of ascorbate. By screening a Brassica campestris cDNA library, we identified a B. campestris MDHAR cDNA (BcMdhar) which encodes a polypeptide of 434 amino acids possessing domains characteristic of FAD- and NAD(P) H-binding proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) shows {{a high level of}} identity to the cytosolic MDHAR of rice, pea and tomato, and does not possess N-terminal leader sequence suggesting that it encodes a cytosolic form of MDHAR. Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated that a single nuclear gene encodes this enzyme. Northern hybridization analysis detected BcMdhar transcripts in all plant tissues examined. The level of BcMdhar mRNA increased in response to oxidative stress invoked by hydrogen peroxide, salicylic acid, paraquat, and ozone...|$|R
40|$|During {{an attempt}} to purify the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases from human liver and kidney, we {{discovered}} a novel short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, which was well separated from the known peroxisomal oxidases on various chromatographic columns. However, further experiments demonstrated that the novel oxidase is identical with the mitochondrial short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. (1) Subcellular fractionation revealed that the short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase is present in mitochondria and absent from peroxisomes. (2) The molecular mass (43 kDa) of the subunit of the purified oxidase {{was similar to that}} reported for the dehydrogenase. (3) The substrate spectrum of the oxidase was comparable with that described for the dehydrogenase. (4) On column chromatography, the oxidase and dehydrogenase activities co-eluted. Our results indicate that, in the absence of suitable electron acceptors, the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is capable of transferring electrons directly to molecular oxygen, yielding potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2. This raises the question as to whether the dehydrogenase might function as an oxidase in conditions in which the activity of the electron-transport chain is decreased, such as reperfusion after ischaemia. status: publishe...|$|R

Nonphotochemical, particle-associated net production rates of O 2 - ranging from 1 to 16 pmol L- 1 s- 1 were also determined and calculated to be similar in magnitude to the likely abiotic photochemical O 2 - production rates in GBR surface waters.

Pseudo-first-order O 2 - decay rate constants were very low at O 2 - concentrations 10 nmol L- 1.

40|$|Ascorbate {{peroxidase}} (AP) is a {{key enzyme}} that scavenges potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2 and thus prevents oxidative damage in plants, especially in N 2 -fixing legume root nodules. The present study demonstrates that the nodule endodermis of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) root nodules contains elevated levels of AP protein, {{as well as the}} corresponding mRNA transcript and substrate (ascorbate). Enhanced AP protein levels were also found in cells immediately peripheral to the infected region of soybean (Glycine max), pea (Pisum sativum), clover (Trifolium pratense), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) nodules. Regeneration of ascorbate was achieved by (homo) glutathione and associated enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione pathway, which were present at high levels. The presence of high levels of antioxidants suggests that respiratory consumption of O 2 in the endodermis or nodule parenchyma may be an essential component of the O 2 -diffusion barrier that regulates the entry of O 2 into the central region of nodules and ensures optimal functioning of nitrogenase.

40|$|To {{investigate}} kinetic {{behaviors of}} aerobic granules under different cycle times, we cultivated aerobic granules in sequencing batch reactors R 1, R 2, and R 3 with cycle time of 1. 5, 4, and 8 h, respectively. After the three reactors reached the steady state, {{we found that}} granules in R 1 with a cycle time of 1. 5 h were the biggest while the most compact granules with density of 74. 6 g l? 1 was produced in reactor R 2 with a cycle time of 4 h. Both granule density and granule size greatly influenced the specific COD removal rate (qs) and the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) because of the mass transfer limitation in granules. However, the difference of COD removal rate by different granules could be neglected in aerobic granular reactor as 1000 mg l? 1 of influent COD was depleted during 30 min by the biomass with high concentration in the reactor. Furthermore, {{we found that the}} observed specific biomass growth rate (?obs) of granular sludge decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 031 d? 1 while the observed biomass growth yield (Yobs) of granular sludge decreased from 0. 316 to 0. 063 g VSS g? 1 COD when cycle time varied from 1. 5 to 8 h. Both ?obs and Yobs had good linear relationships with organic loading rate (OLR). However, the high ?obs with cycle time of 1. 5 <b>h</b> would be <b>harmful</b> to the long-term stability of aerobic granules although OLR and reactor treating capacity could be enhanced greatly by shortening cycle time. In addition, high effluent biomass concentration and high Yobs with short cycle time would burden the sedimentation tanks and the sludge disposal. The balance between advantages and disadvantages by using short cycle time thus should be considered.

40|$|The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) {{contains}} {{highly variable}} multi-gene families, which {{play a key}} role in the adaptive immune response within vertebrates. Among the Capra MHC class II genes, the expressed DRB locus is highly polymorphic, particularly in exon 2, which encodes the antigen-binding site. Models of variable non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratios among sites may provide important insights into functional constraints at different amino acid sites and may be used to detect sites under positive selection. Many non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) at the DRB locus in goats are suspected to impact protein function. This study, therefore, aimed at comparing the efficiency of six computational approaches to predict the likelihood of a particular non-synonymous (amino acid change) coding SNP to cause a functional impact on the protein. This involved the use of PANTHER, SNAP, SIFT, PolyPhen- 2, PROVEAN and nsSNPAnalyzer bioinformatics analytical tools in detecting harmful and beneficial effects at H 57 G, Y 89 R, V 104 D and Y 112 I substitutions in the peptide binding region of the DRB gene of Nigerian goats. The results from PANTHER analysis revealed that H 57 G, Y 89 R and Y 112 I substitutions (Pdeleterious= 0. 113, 0. 204 and 0. 472, respectively) were beneficial; while that of V 104 D was deleterious (Pdeleterious= 0. 756), an indication that it was non-neutral. As regards the SNAP approach, H 57 G and Y 89 R substitutions were returned neutral with expected accuracy of 53 and 69 %, respectively while V 104 D and Y 112 I substitutions were <b>harmful.</b> <b>H</b> 57 G and Y 89 R substitutions were also found harmless in the SIFT analysis.
