5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> <b>fit</b> criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E

It measures <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> <b>fit</b> of data with a theoretical distribution, with zero corresponding to exact agreement with the theoretical distribution; the p-value thus measures how likely the fit would be this bad or worse.|$|E
40|$|Many {{data mining}} and {{statistical}} {{machine learning algorithms}} {{have been developed to}} select a subset of covariates to associate with a response variable. Spurious discoveries can easily arise in high-dimensional data analysis due to enormous possibilities of such selections. How can we know statistically our discoveries better than those by chance? In this paper, we define a measure <b>of</b> <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> spurious <b>fit,</b> which shows how good a response variable can be fitted by an optimally selected subset of covariates under the null model, and propose a simple and effective LAMM algorithm to compute it. It coincides with the maximum spurious correlation for linear models and can be regarded as a generalized maximum spurious correlation. We derive the asymptotic distribution <b>of</b> such <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> spurious <b>fit</b> for generalized linear models and $L_ 1 $ regression. Such an asymptotic distribution depends on the sample size, ambient dimension, the number of variables used in the fit, and the covariance information. It can be consistently estimated by multiplier bootstrapping and used as a benchmark to guard against spurious discoveries. It can also be applied to model selection, which considers only candidate models with <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits</b> better than those by spurious fits. The theory and method are convincingly illustrated by simulated examples and an application to the binary outcomes from German Neuroblastoma Trials. Comment: 49 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

Biological efficacy was determined for egg production, egg mass, and egg weight using five regression models.

2500|$|The same {{relationship}} {{occurs in}} many other rankings unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, income rankings, ranks of number of people watching the same TV channel, and so on. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913. Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> <b>fit</b> of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution. When Zipf's law is checked for cities, a better fit has been found with exponent s = 1.07; i.e. the [...] largest settlement is [...] {{the size of the}} largest settlement. While Zipf's law holds for the upper tail of the distribution, the entire distribution of cities is log-normal and follows Gibrat's law. Both laws are consistent because a log-normal tail can typically not be distinguished from a Pareto (Zipf) tail.|$|E

Statistical uncertainties in {{the estimation of}} extremes are normally not well considered in present practice or even present research. This paper shows the application of extreme distributions to river variables with non negligible levels of uncertainty and presents an approach to deal with them. Four distribution types (Gumbel, Pearson III (log shifted Gamma), Lognormal and Generalised Pareto) are fitted to peaks over threshold or annual maxima data sets of river discharges. Piecewise exponential distributions are used to summarise the four distribution types and bootstrapping methods for quantifying the uncertainty in the design discharges.
