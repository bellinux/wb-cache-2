5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
25|$|Although Newton's {{theory has}} been superseded, most modern non-relativistic {{gravitational}} calculations still use <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> much easier {{to work with and}} is sufficiently accurate for most applications.|$|E
25|$|Tom Robbins waxed {{philosophical}} {{about the}} Remington SL3, a typewriter {{that he bought}} to write Still Life with Woodpecker. He eventually did away with <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too complicated and inhuman for the writing of poetry.|$|E
25|$|Church {{teaching}} {{places the}} origin of the Eucharist in the Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, at which he is believed to have taken bread and given it to his disciples, telling them to eat of <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his body, and to have taken a cup and given it to his disciples, telling them to drink of <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the cup of the covenant in his blood.|$|R

25|$|In graph theory, a maximal {{independent}} set (MIS) or maximal stable set is {{an independent}} set {{that is not a}} subset of any other independent set. In other words, there is no vertex outside the independent set that may join <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> maximal with respect to the independent set property.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of entomology, ethyl acetate is an {{effective}} asphyxiant for use in insect collecting and study. In a killing jar charged with ethyl acetate, the vapors will kill the collected insect quickly without destroying <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not hygroscopic, ethyl acetate also keeps the insect soft enough to allow proper mounting suitable for a collection.|$|E
25|$|Zheng Jie {{keeps in}} a small vial pieces of her ankle bone that were removed during the ankle surgery of 2007. She says she keeps <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a part of her, and that it makes her cherish being able to play tennis again and life in general. She says that {{although}} it made her world ranking plunge, it also made her grow up a lot.|$|E

25|$|Shoji {{lives with}} a bar hostess, {{wondering}} {{what it would be}} like to have a child with her and whether the child would grow up as a Napoleon or Hitler. Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

"Once upon a time", Ribby, a [...] "Pussy-cat" [...] invites {{a little}} dog called Duchess to tea {{with plans to}} serve her [...] "something so very very nice" [...] baked in a pie dish with a pink rim. Ribby {{promises}} Duchess she shall have the entree entirely to herself. Duchess accepts the invitation but hopes {{she will not be}} served mouse. [...] "I really couldn't, couldn't eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a party." ...|$|E

500|$|Ahmadzai {{used the}} {{technique}} of making the music freeze midrhythm throughout American Life, including [...] "Love Profusion". One technique was the stutter edit, which Ahmadzaï clarified was not characteristic of his production and recording. [...] "People get upset {{because they think it}} is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But I do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> natural. The stuttering can help you create a new groove", he said. The track starts with a [...] "strummy" [...] acoustic guitar introduction, as described by Michael Paoletta from Billboard, on the four-chord progression of Bm–Fm–A–E sequence. The folk rock inspired song has elements of electronica and folk at its core. Its rhythm is [...] produced by a four piece bass drum—which fades in and out abruptly—and atmospheric synth-strings, which are added later in the song.|$|E
500|$|Diamond and Pearl {{are set in}} {{the fictional}} region of Sinnoh, an island based on the Japanese island of Hokkaidō. Sinnoh is {{probably}} not directly connected to any other region in the Pokémon universe, much like Hoenn. It is characterized by large, snow-covered mountains (Mt. Coronet, {{a part of a}} mountain range, divides Sinnoh in half). In this game, the starters are the grass-type Turtwig, the fire-type Chimchar, and the water-type Piplup. Turtwig can evolve into Grotle and then into Torterra, Chimchar can evolve into Monferno and then into Infernape, and Piplup can evolve into Prinplup and then into Empoleon. Unlike other regions, Sinnoh has a [...] "northern" [...] feel to <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the only region with snow-covered routes. Sinnoh is also characterized by its waterways; it has three main lakes (Verity, Acuity, and Valor) that form a triangle. Unlike the Hoenn region, however, which is mostly water routes, only 30 percent of Sinnoh's landscape comprises waterways. Underneath Sinnoh's surface is the Sinnoh Underground, which is a large maze of caves and tunnels.|$|E
500|$|For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural {{selection}} was in essence synonymous with evolution by {{natural selection}}. After {{the publication of}} On the Origin of Species, educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism, partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its [...] "unguided" [...] and non-progressive nature, a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea's acceptance. However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase survival of the fittest, which became a popular summary of the theory. The fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer's phrase {{as an alternative to}} natural selection, with credit given: [...] "But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." [...] Although the phrase is still often used by non-biologists, modern biologists avoid <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tautological if [...] "fittest" [...] is read to mean [...] "functionally superior" [...] and is applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged quantity over populations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] says Tagrag, [...] "we {{were talking}} about--about--pigeon-shooting; the Count here {{says he will}} blow a bird all to pieces at twenty yards, and I said I wouldn't stand <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> regular murder." ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Fifth Wave" [...] book {{series by}} Rick Yancey, the main {{character}} and protagonist is named Cassie for Cassiopeia, having <b>been</b> named after <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pretty, not <b>because</b> her parents knew the myth.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Schuyler {{appeared}} thoughtful. [...] "I fancy he did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary. Didn't <b>it</b> {{strike you}} that you were hurting him? That {{is a good man}} and an honest one, though, of course, he may be mistaken." ...|$|R
500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E

5000|$|Chomsky's {{words on}} this matter had a real influence, {{sometimes}} indirect, and history should record <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> of vital importance in helping alter the state of widespread ignorance about East Timor that then existed in the United States and elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|Peters {{said that}} [...] "The Galileo is {{important}} because it's really the biggest surviving movie or TV set of the modern era.

2500|$|Geneviève Forget, a {{video game}} streamer, states in a Kotaku {{interview}} that [...] "Harassment does happen in my stream chat {{from time to time}} that people start discussing my appearance but it really isn't the focus on my stream.
