5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
25|$|A key {{development}} {{in the ability to}} use APL effectively, before the widespread use of CRT terminals, was the development of a special IBM Selectric typewriter interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the IBM 1050 and IBM 2741 terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and not be forced to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them. Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.|$|E

500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how it played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes {{make use of the}} voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "snug", {{sometimes}} called the smoke room, was typically a small, very private room {{with access to the}} bar that had a frosted glass external window, set above head height.

2500|$|Before leaving EastEnders, Oberman {{provided}} {{the voice of}} [...] "Miss Dickson" [...] in the adult-themed cartoon Bromwell High for Channel Four. It was also announced that Oberman would guest star in the second series of the revived Doctor Who, playing the character of Yvonne Hartman, whom she described as [...] "a sophisticated sort of baddie", with a BBC source declaring Oberman [...] "perfect to play evil Yvonne and will be brilliant at terrorising {{the next generation of}} viewers". The two-part series finale entitled [...] "Army of Ghosts" [...] and [...] "Doomsday", aired in July 2006, attracting audiences of 8.19 million and 8.22 million respectively. Oberman extols her appearance in Doctor Who as a career highlight, being a [...] "self-confessed Whovian" [...] or fan of the show: [...] "Some people, their life’s ambition is to walk <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the Queen Vic, mine was to see a Tardis and a sonic screwdriver... and a Dalek!" [...] That year also saw Oberman plan a return to the National Theatre in Mike Leigh's play, Two Thousand Years. Leigh had already asked Oberman to appear as part of the original cast, but she declined given her hectic schedule on EastEnders at the time. However, after she signed up for the 2006 production and began attending rehearsals she fell ill, a blood test revealing that she was pregnant, forcing her {{to pull out of the}} play. Instead, Oberman signed on to the BBC One six-part comedy drama series Sorted as series regular Amy, alongside Will Mellor.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
