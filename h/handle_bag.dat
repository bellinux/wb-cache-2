40|$|Understanding {{population}} dynamics {{is at the}} core of conservation biology. However, our understanding of the mechanisms driving {{population dynamics}} remains unclear in many cases. Animal behavior in response to biotic and abiotic stressors is an important driver of these population dynamics and varies both within- and among-individuals in a population. Consistent differences in behavior among individuals within a population are referred to as personality traits. Boldness, a personality trait representing the willingness of an individual to engage in risky behavior, may help predict individual and community-level consequences, such as survivorship. Here, we investigated the inter- and intra-individual variation in risk-taking behavior (i. e., boldness) and the ecological consequences of such variation in a wild population of Piute ground squirrels (Urocitellus mollis). Boldness was quantified using an in-field <b>handling</b> <b>bag</b> test. Response to the <b>handling</b> <b>bag</b> test varied among individuals by sex, age, time in trap before test, season, and year but was consistent within individuals, suggesting that the <b>handling</b> <b>bag</b> test was a reliable measurement of personality (i. e., boldness). We found that boldness had a positive relationship with trappability and a negative relationship with survivorship. Additionally, we found that the effect of boldness on survivorship was higher in females than males and higher for squirrels captured in a habitat with shrub cover than in a habitat with just grass and no shrub cover. Our results suggest that animal personality can predict important life-history consequences, such as survivorship, and could therefore be used to better understand the mechanisms driving population dynamics patterns and better inform population conservation and management practices...|$|R

40|$|Western barred {{bandicoots}} (Perameles bougainville) {{from five}} Western Australian colonies were examined during 2006.

Fleas, ticks and larval trombiculid mites (chiggers) {{were collected from}} bandicoots and their <b>handling</b> <b>bags</b> and preserved in ethanol. Chiggers were mounted and cleared in Hoyer’s medium. Fleas were boiled in potassium hydroxide, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in methyl salicylate and mounted with Canada balsam. Ticks were identified using a dissecting microscope. Schoutedenichia emphyla chiggers were found on periscrotal, peripouch and aural skin in many P. bougainville from Dryandra. The ticks Haemaphysalis humerosa and H. ratti were collected from Bernier and Dorre Islands. In all, four flea species have been identified on P. bougainville. Echidnophaga gallinacea and Pygiopsylla tunneyi were common at Heirisson Prong and the Islands colonies, respectively. Xenopsylla vs. vexabilis was occasionally identified on bandicoots from Bernier Island and Heirisson Prong. Leptopsylla segnis and P. tunneyi were found on a bandicoot from Kanyana. No Austrochirus dorreensis (a fur mite) or Haemaphysalis lagostrophi were collected in 2006, despite previous literature reports. Apart from localized dermatitis with chigger infestation and mild blood loss from tick and flea attachment, the significance of ectoparasitism in P. bougainville remains unresolved. The potential role of these ectoparasites as disease vectors is under current investigation.

40|$|Fuzzy {{logic is}} a {{powerful}} tool to model knowledge uncertainty, measurements imprecision, and vagueness. However, there is another type of vagueness that arises when data have multiple forms of expression that fuzzy logic does not address quite well. This {{is the case for}} multiple instance learning problems (MIL). In MIL, an object is represented by a collection of instances, called a bag. A bag is labeled negative if all of its instances are negative, and positive if at least one of its instances is positive. Positive bags encode ambiguity since the instances themselves are not labeled. In this paper, we introduce fuzzy inference systems and neural networks designed to <b>handle</b> <b>bags</b> of instances as input and capable of learning from ambiguously labeled data. First, we introduce the Multiple Instance Sugeno style fuzzy inference (MI-Sugeno) that extends the standard Sugeno style inference to handle reasoning with multiple instances. Second, we use MI-Sugeno to define and develop Multiple Instance Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (MI-ANFIS). We expand the architecture of the standard ANFIS to allow reasoning with bags and derive a learning algorithm using backpropagation to identify the premise and consequent parameters of the network. The proposed inference system is tested and validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets suitable for MIL problems. We also apply the proposed MI-ANFIS to fuse the output of multiple discrimination algorithms for the purpose of landmine detection using Ground Penetrating Radar.

50|$|The {{heart and}} soul of the town was the grain trade. Farmers, grain agents, lumpers (the men who <b>handled</b> the <b>bagged</b> grain) and their {{families}} were vital to this. From November onwards the town bustled with activity as the grain was harvested and brought into the town. The bags of grain were built into huge stacks around the town to await the arrival of the sailing ships.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} analysis of wall thickness of medical balloons and tubing of all sizes using a revolutionary white light interferometry system. Measurements can be taken at all critical dimensions of medical balloons including the balloon sleeves, main balloon body, the shoulder or cone. For main body and tube thickness, values are given for both top and bottom walls, outside and inside diameter. In operation, infrared light (1310 nm) is directed through a measurement probe via optical fiber to the material to be measured. At each juncture of refractive index, some portion of the transmitted light will be reflected back into the probe and some portion will continue through the material. In {{the case of a}} catheter, some IR energy will be reflected back to the device at the top and bottom surfaces of the tubing walls, generating measurements of not only the thickness of the walls themselves, but also the inside diameter distance between the walls. Accurate measurements can be obtained from almost any flat or formed material that allows passage of 1310 nm infrared light. Glass, plastic, silicone, or molded parts that are clear, translucent, dyed, and possibly opaque are good candidates for this measurement approach. This presentation will illustrate advances in measurement of thinner materials than previously reported and discuss measurement of various medical and industrial components such as silicone implants, medical adhesives, capillary flow cells, and medical liquid (blood, saline, etc.) <b>handling</b> <b>bags</b> that can benefit from this new technology.
