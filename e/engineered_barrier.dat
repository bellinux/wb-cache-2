In one of the multi-barrier concepts for preventing the escape of radioactive substances from a high-level nuclear waste repository, the barrier consists of a copper container, compacted bentonite as buffer and backfill (the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier),</b> and the repository host rock. Corrosion of the copper canister and radiolysis of water both produce hydrogen. When the buffer and backfill are saturated with water and the permeability of the bentonite is reduced by swelling, any hydrogen that is produced can accumulate in the space between the container and the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier.</b> This will result in pressures exceeding the entry pressure of the bentonite and passage of gas through the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier.</b> An experimental program was developed to investigate the thermal and hydraulic properties of the buffer and backfill under conditions expected to exist in a permanent repository for radioactive waste.

Various radiation-induced point defects have been observed in kaolinite, dickite, montmorillonite and illite. In kaolinite, the defects stable at the scale of geological periods {{have been used for}} geochemical applications or dating. Nevertheless, the potential influence of point defects on clay properties has not been demonstrated. Ballistic effects of heavy ions (alpha recoil nuclei) are able to amorphize the structure of clay minerals, as it was shown for smectite either irradiated with ion beam or doped with alpha emitters, leading to consistent amorphization doses. Several estimations show that amorphization of smectite from the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> would occur after 1000 years of exposure arising from waste leakage. Besides, amorphization by ionizing radiation in a HLNWR is unlikely because required dose is unrealistically too high. Consequences of amorphization on physico-chemical properties such as swelling, CEC, solubility are potentially very important but have not been described for clay minerals. Ionizing radiations can reduce structural Fe 3 + in montmorillonite and may thus potentially modify its layer charge and CEC. The influence of irradiation on physico-chemical properties such as CEC is revealed only at high irradiation doses, larger than several MGy, and remains relatively limited. Nevertheless, contradictory results still exist about the effect of irradiation on redox and surface reactivity. These parameters together with their consequences on properties, obtained on model specimen used in laboratory or test experiments, must be considered in the performance assessment of the <b>engineered</b> <b>barrier</b> of a nuclear waste disposal. This paper reviews the various aspects of irradiation effects on clay minerals with emphasis on physico- chemical properties, after a presentation of the methodology of experimental irradiation...|$|E
