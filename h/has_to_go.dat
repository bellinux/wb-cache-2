5|$|Carly, an attorney, {{has just}} started a {{relationship}} with Mark, a man she had sex with eight weeks earlier. She is upset when Mark tells her he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out of town but decides {{to go over to}} his house to seduce him. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate, whom she'd originally assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, the two women befriend one another. Kate then discovers that he is seeing yet another woman, whom she at first believes to be Carly, but they both discover that Mark is seeing a third woman: Amber.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the artifact, Shepard has {{a vision of the}} Reaper fleet approaching. Kenson and her entire team, however, turn out to have been indoctrinated from having spent too much time studying the artifact. She attacks Shepard, who is eventually overwhelmed by her soldiers. Upon awakening two days later, Shepard manages to escape and reach the control room, where he/she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Bahak system's relay. In retaliation, Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the reactor core of the facility, but Shepard ultimately stops her. Shepard then contacts his/her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay, resulting in the destruction of the entire Bahak system. Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett, their superior officer, who explains that he/she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Earth and face the consequences, setting the stage for Mass Effect 3.|$|E

'Why, you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Doctors' Commons with a suit, and you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a {{court of}} Common Law with a suit, and you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the House of Lords with a suit, and you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if {{it was a case}} of very plain sailing), I suppose from a {{thousand}} to fifteen hundred pound,' said Mr. Bounderby.

I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> an eye factory and find the eyes. False teeth. There's a lot in that photograph. I think John's almost-last written words were about that {{particular}} cover; that was {{pointed out to me}} by Martin Harrison, who wrote the text to my book.

25|$|If the bowler's back foot {{is behind}} {{parallel}} to the bowling crease, the bowler loses momentum and speed when delivering the ball.

25|$|The RAR {{table is}} one or many data {{structures}} {{that provide the}} receiver, for each authority that submits CRIDs, information on the corresponding resolution service provider.

To her, the silver medal feels like gold after all she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through in the recent years, and more specifically recalling she could not walk for days in early July.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned. When an army unit goes {{against the grain of}} the pattern, he reasoned, it becomes conspicuous; to hide, it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with the pattern. He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be given refugee status a {{displaced}} person <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process, which is conducted {{by the government of}} the country of asylum or the UNHCR, and based on international, regional or national law.

25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in with the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

Draistail traps him, saying that he is not yet ready.|$|E

Phil offers to drive him back home, something that upsets Claire because Phil leaves her alone while he knows how much nervous she is when they are about to fly. Manny is kept for questioning after his name matches a name on a no-fly list and Haley flirts with a boy while Dylan is trapped inside the Dunphy's house.|$|E
