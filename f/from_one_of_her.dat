5|$|HMS Hesperus was an H-class {{destroyer}} {{that had}} originally been ordered by the Brazilian Navy with the name Juruena in the late 1930s, but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939, commissioned in 1940 as HMS Hearty though quickly renamed. She was damaged by German aircraft during the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols after her repairs were completed. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties in late 1940. She was briefly assigned to Force H in 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force the next month for escort duties in the North Atlantic. Hesperus was transferred to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in late 1941 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the next three years. She was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1943 after suffering damage <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two ramming attacks that sank German submarines. The ship sank two other submarines during the war by more conventional means. After the end of the war, Hesperus escorted the ships carrying the Norwegian government in exile back to Norway and served as a target ship through mid-1946. She was scrapped beginning in mid-1947.|$|E

25|$|Both ships sank quickly, and Varangberg {{had no time}} {{to launch}} her {{lifeboats}}. Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose to such an angle that her lifeboats could not be lowered. However, the liner had three liferafts mounted so as to float clear {{in the event of a}} shipwreck, and one of her radio officers survived by clinging to a large piece of her cork cargo that had floated free <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> holds.|$|E
25|$|As Cyclops {{lifeboats}} {{were launched}} and got clear, Kersley {{and some of}} his officers remained aboard to ensure that everyone who was still alive had left. 29 minutes after the first attack U-123 fired a second torpedo <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stern tubes, which hit Cyclops port side. The ship immediately started to break up and sank within five minutes. Some of those remaining aboard managed to reach a liferaft that the Chief Officer had released only minutes before.|$|E
25|$|About 25 {{minutes after}} the first {{explosion}} U-615 attempted a coup de grâce by firing a torpedo <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stern tubes. This missed, so the submarine reloaded her bow tubes and turned to fire again. The next torpedo struck Empire Star between her No. 4 and No. 5 holds {{about an hour and}} a half after the first explosion. The ship remained afloat, so U-615 hit her with another coup de grâce. Empire Stars bow rose from the sea and she sank by the stern, and about five minutes later a strong underwater explosion shook the lifeboats. The submarine did not surface to question the survivors.|$|E

25|$|As Abosso {{settled in}} the water, she {{temporarily}} righted herself, her crew got her emergency generator working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the débris area, and scanned the boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 liferafts afloat and occupied. Heydemann {{did not try to}} question survivors to identify the ship, and claimed in his report that this was because the weather was poor.|$|E
25|$|Oxenham was not {{the most}} {{prolific}} of these three, as she had 87 titles published during her lifetime (and a further two were published by her niece, who discovered the manuscripts among Oxenham's papers in the 1990s) whereas Brent-Dyer published 100 books of various kinds. Nearly forty of Oxenham's books comprise the main Abbey Series, with another thirty or so in several connecting series and the remaining twenty - some in small series of their own, and some isolated titles - having no connection with the Abbey books at all. During the 1920s to the 1950s she had several short stories, and some longer serialised ones, published in Annuals such as the Girl's Own Annual, British Girl's Annual, Little Folks and Hulton's Girls' Stories. Some of these stories were connected to the books - i.e. dealt with characters <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books or series - others became books, or sections of books, that were published {{a year or two}} later.|$|E
25|$|The Pequod is now heading {{southeast}} toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard {{from the}} mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Now Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin {{be used as}} a new life buoy. Starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked. Next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the Rachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The Rachel is seeking survivors <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son. Ahab refuses to join the search. Twenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him. Suddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, the Pequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets the Delight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck. Ahab speaks about his wife and child, calls himself a fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah.|$|E
