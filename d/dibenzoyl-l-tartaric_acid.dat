40|$|Co-crystallization is a {{technique}} which can be applied for the separation of enantiomers. Usually, enantiomers do not form eutectic mixtures, which are easy to separate. The determination of the pure component solubility {{is one of the}} key steps in co-crystal screening: the region in the phase diagram in which the co-crystal is formed, depends on the solubility of the pure components. The UNIFAC model can be used for preliminary estimations of the solubility. RS-atenolol and DL-amino acids were used for co-crystal screening. RSatenolol forms a solid solution and DL-amino acids form a racemic compound or a conglomerate. RS-atenolol and L-malic acid (L-MA) form a salt, which is very stable in ethanol at low concentration of L-MA. Atenolol with <b>dibenzoyl-L-tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> forms two liquid phases in ethanol: a liquid and a viscous oil phase. No crystals could be obtained from this combination, even not at long storing at room temperature. Only hydrophobic amino acids formed co-crystals during cooling crystallization. Due to steric hindrance, only D-L combinations of amino acids can be co-crystallized, this leads to separation of enantiomers. Separations were performed for DL-Val with L-Phe and for DL-Phe with L-Phe and L-Leu. IRSProcess and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This report {{concentrates}} {{on the possibility of}} separating a mixture of enantiomers by co-crystallization. To discover this area in a systematic way, two main tracks are followed: solubility prediction of organic compounds and experimental co-crystallization. The determination of the pure component solubility {{is one of the key}} steps in co-crystal screening: the region in the phase diagram in which the co-crystal is formed, depends on the solubility of the pure components. It turned out that the prediction of the solubility is not accurate enough to play an important role in designing co-crystals. UNIFAC can be used for preliminary estimations of the solubility, PC-SAFT looks more promising, but this method needs at least five solubility points to be able to calculate the solubility. Experimental co-crystallization is devided into two sub-topics: atenolol and amino acids. RS-atenolol forms a solid solution and DL-amino acids form a racemic compound or a conglomerate. A couple of co-formers were tested. RS-atenolol and L-MA form a salt, which is very stable in ethanol at low concentration of L-MA.
