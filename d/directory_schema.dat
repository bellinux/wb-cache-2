However, it becomes difficult to establish trust relationship across heterogeneous domains due to different actual trust mechanism and security policy {{as well as the}} intrinsic flaw of each trust model. Since Internet has been used commonly in information systems technologies, many applications need some security capabilities to protect against threats to the communication of information. Two critical procedures of these capabilities are authentication and authorization. This report presents a strong authentication and authorization model using three standard frameworks. They are PKI, PMI, and Directory. The trust in this approach is enabled by the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) which is applied for client two-factor authentication and secures the infrastructure. We introduce the preventive activity-based authorization policy for dynamic user privilege controls. It helps prevent successive unauthorized requests in a formal manner. At the core, we apply An Improved Trust Model to facilitate the authentication with the different keys with work flow of model efficiently.

"A {{database}} schema specifies, {{based on the}} database administrator's knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or those {{of interest to the}} possible end-users." [...] The notion of a {{database schema}} plays the same role as the notion of theory in predicate calculus. A model of this [...] "theory" [...] closely corresponds to a database, which can be seen at any instant of time as a mathematical object. Thus a schema can contain formulas representing integrity constraints specifically for an application and the constraints specifically for a type of database, all expressed in the same database language. In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, types, sequences, materialized views, synonyms, database links, <b>directories,</b> XML <b>schemas,</b> and other elements.|$|R
40|$|The X. 500 {{directory}} {{provides a}} powerful mechanism for storing and retrieving information about objects of interest.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{publicly}} accessible databases has increased the difficulty in knowing about their existence, their contents {{and the way to}} access them. So it would be very useful to put the information about available databases online, having databases catalogued according to their contents. To support end users in retrieving such information, accessing the catalogue of database should be very powerful. On the other hand the maintenance of the information contained in the catalogue cannot be performed in a centralized site due to the natural distribution of information around the world. The standard OSI X. 500 is considered a suitable mean to maintain a distributed catalogue of online source of information. This paper proposes a new X. 500 object class, named "onlineDatabase" (subclass of the object class "onlineInforn 1 ationResource") to map any database information entry as well as a <b>directory</b> <b>schema</b> suitable to deploy the information on a world wide basis while leaving the maintenance of the information to its producer or as near as possible to him. The papers describes how, using the object class "documentSeries", a hierarchical subject index mapping the UNESCO thesaurus has been implemented. This Thesaurus is used by UNESCO to index (by arguments) and retrieve all documents and publications processed through the computerized Documentation System of the UNESCO libraries. Any database entry can be referred by more than one thesaurus entry. For any entry of the thesaurus it 2 ̆ 7 s possible to select any database dealing a specific argument. A prototype implementation of the system is presented. The prototype is composed by a X. 5 OO DSA, an end-user interface running on UNIX system, and a catalogue of databases presently available through the ASTRA service. The end-user interface is able to retrieve the entry of the database of interest by accessing the subjects subtree, or by directly selecting the database entry. Any database entry contains some information such as: the content, the logon and logoff procedures, the database producers, distributors and contact persons, the network access procedures, the source from which the database has been implemented, the cost-of-use, the database management system and where to find much more information...|$|E

40|$|Establishing space {{communication}} between ground facilities and other satellites is a painstaking task that requires many precise calculations dealing with relay time, atmospheric conditions, and satellite positions, {{to name a}} few. The Space Communications Emulation Facility (SCEF) team here at NASA is developing a facility that will approximately emulate the conditions in space that impact {{space communication}}. The emulation facility is comprised of a 32 node distributed cluster of computers; each node representing a satellite or ground station. The objective of the satellites is to observe the topography of the Earth (water, vegetation, land, and ice) and relay this information {{back to the ground}} stations. Software originally designed by the University of Kansas, labeled the Emulation Manager, controls the interaction of the satellites and ground stations, as well as handling the recording of data. The Emulation Manager is installed on a Linux Operating System, employing both Java and C++ programming codes. The emulation scenarios are written in extensible Markup Language, XML. XML documents are designed to store, carry, and exchange data. With XML documents data can be exchanged between incompatible systems, which makes it ideal for this project because Linux, MAC and Windows Operating Systems are all used. Unfortunately, XML documents cannot display data like HTML documents. Therefore, the SCEF team uses XML Schema Definition (XSD) or just schema to describe the structure of an XML document. Schemas are very important because they have the capability to validate the correctness of data, define restrictions on data, define data formats, and convert data between different data types, among other things. At this time, in order for the Emulation Manager to open and run an XML emulation scenario file, the user must first establish a link between the schema file and the directory under which the XML scenario files are saved. This procedure takes place on the command line on the Linux Operating System. Once this link has been established the Emulation manager validates all the XML files in that <b>directory</b> against the <b>schema</b> file, before the actual scenario is run. Using some very sophisticated commercial software called the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) installed on the Linux box, the Emulation Manager is able to display the data and graphics generated by the execution of a XML emulation scenario file. The Emulation Manager software is written in JAVA programming code. Since the SCEF project is in the developmental stage, the source code for this type of software is being modified to better fit the requirements of the SCEF project. Some parameters for the emulation are hard coded, set at fixed values. Members of the SCEF team are altering the code to allow the user to choose the values of these hard coded parameters by inserting a toolbar onto the preexisting GUI...|$|R
