40|$|Floodplains along {{regulated}} rivers often suffer from serious environmental degradation. River and floodplain rehabilitation measures along the major rivers of Hungary {{are motivated by}} two objectives: to inrease the floodwater retention capacity of floodplains (also beyond the dykes) and to improve the ecological conditions of floodplain habitats (with special regard to oxbow lakes). In this paper reports and documents mostly written in Hungarian are presented for the international public on river and floodplain rehabilitation efforts. Examples for the water management objective are cited from the Tisza and Körös Rivers, while interventions promoting the second, nature conservation (and also forestry and agriculture), aim are mentioned from the Danube and Drava Rivers. A common characteristic of the case studies is that they apply ’hard engineering’ solutions to environmental problems.

50|$|In 1920 a new {{pumping station}} at its present site began operation.In 1923, an {{attorney}} prepared {{a bill for}} the legislature to abolish the City Councils supervision of the DMWW Board. The Board is responsible to run DMWW and the Mayor appoints Board members when vacancies occur with the City Council only approving the appointments.In 1928, Denman recommended adding a softening plant to save customers money spent on soap and {{wear and tear on}} clothes. Arguments for and against it continued with the Board voting to delay building until 1938 and further delayed by World War II.In 1929, the Hazen water tower, Des Moines only water tower, 110 feet high was constructed of concrete and steel, holding 2 million gallons of water. In 1931, the benefit of fluoride in preventing tooth decay opened a controversy for three decades.Between 1933 and 1935, during the Great Depression, about 3500 men could not pay their water bills, and Denman offered them work often for several days, laying water mains, grade park roads, inspect hydrants. Seven thousand plantings of trees and shrubs were made yearly from seedlings grown in the greenhouse.In 1942, DMWW bought 650 acres of farmland southwest of Des Moines to build an <b>emergency</b> <b>reservoir,</b> the Dale Maffitt Reservoir, which was opened for fishing in 1948. In 1945, another flood and in 1947 a record-breaking flood occurred. From 1948-49, the softening plant was built, called the filter building which housed the laboratory and the water rate increased {{for the first time in}} 50 years. In 1950, levees around the Fleur Drive treatment plant were built. In 1959, DMWW started fluoridating its water at the request of the city council.|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} art in this field is reviewed. Starting from a {{synthesis}} of the positive experiences gained {{in the operation of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>reservoir</b> specific proposals are submitted for improving particular steps in operation control and for possibilities of further perfection. The flood situations warranting emergency storage and the ‘conventional ’ approach to reservoir dimensioning are described, point-ing out the difficulties in determining the ‘optimal ’ time of impoundment; the drawdown created by emergency storage in the river system is analysed (Figs. 1 and 2) and indices showing the effective-ness of impoundment are derived (Table 1). The key hydrologic-hydraulic parameters reflecting the effects of emergency storage events since 1966 in Hungary are summarised in Table 2. A simplified, approximate method is presented to estimate the drawdown curve from the maximum drawdown. The influence ranges estimated for the inundation of particular reservoirs are shown in Fig. 4. The approach by which the impact study on the parameters of typical flood waves can be simplified and thus made accessible to calculation is presented (sensitivity analysis). The results obtained for this complex phenomenon are compiled in a readily understandable form to support decision making in actual operation control situations. Summarising the ramified studies, the improvements recom-mended and the perfection options proposed, a refined version of the conceptual model of perfected operation control of emergency flood reservoirs is presented in Fig. 6...|$|E

40|$|A simulation-optimisation {{methodology}} for designing {{the operation of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the Hungarian Tisza basin László Koncsos / Edina Balogh Received 2009 - 09 - 10, revised 2009 - 11 - 30, accepted 2010 - 03 - 08 This work reports {{the results of an}} investigation of reservoirs that were selected in Hungary in the framework of a new flood control strategy for the River Tisza, the largest tributary of the River Danube. Through a comprehensive analysis the optimal operation mode was identified, which would need to be applied to achieve the maximum decreasing effect on peak water lev-els. The flood waves were simulated using a 1 D hydrodynami-cal model, which is based on the Saint-Venant equations. Both measured and synthetic discharge data were used as boundary conditions. The time lead as compared to the flood peak was determined for the reservoir system. On the Upper-Tisza the fig-ures exceed the order of magnitude of the possible time lead of the realistic forecast, meaning that further research of the re-conditioned discharge forecast is necessary. The investigation results of the interaction of two reservoirs showed that the sum of the decreasing effects on water levels when separated reser-voirs work independently approaches the decreasing effect of the jointly operating reservoirs reasonably well. Therefore the joint impacts can be estimated using quick linear programming methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the brake commands to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the brake level commands. Instead, the brake pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: cut-off valve, vent valve, auxiliary valve, and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the auxiliary reservoir, the <b>emergency</b> <b>reservoir,</b> and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Forecasts for peak streamflows from annual {{snow melt}} {{are widely used}} by <b>emergency</b> management, <b>reservoir</b> operators, and river recreationists in the Colorado and Great Basins.

Historical forecasts were verified along with reforecasts from the River Forecast System to produce a suite of verification statistics for current forecast points. Preliminary results, although site specific, suggest that both forecasts and reforecast have better skill that climatology and that skill improves with lead time. The resulting analysis will be used to drive changes to the peak flow forecast program at the CBRFC.

50|$|One of the company's {{most notable}} designs came in 1998 when it collaborated with Steve Wynn to design The Fountains of Bellagio, for the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Fountains {{are set in}} an 8-acre (3.2 ha) manmade lake. Under Bellagio, WET collaborated {{with an array of}} composers and choreographers to create the Fountain’s shows, {{including}} renowned composer Gerard Schurmann and the American choreographer, producer and director Kenny Ortega. Contrary to urban myth, the lake is not filled with treated greywater from the hotel. The lake is serviced by a freshwater well that was drilled decades prior to irrigate a golf course that previously existed on the site. The Fountains actually use less water than irrigating the golf course did. In the event of an <b>emergency,</b> the Fountain’s <b>reservoir</b> can be pumped into firefighting equipment to assist any neighboring casino without drawing from the city system. The Fountains of Bellagio introduced WET’s motion controlled robotic water nozzles, built for WET by the robotics company Sarcos, {{for the first time in}} the industry. After this project, WET expanded its manufacturing capabilities to where it is now manufacturing virtually all of its invented devices in house. The company's feature incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 individually programmed nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights. It is estimated that the Fountains cost $40 million to build. The nozzles are synchronized to music and shoot water up to 240 feet in the air.

40|$|Extreme {{environmental}} events, such as floods, droughts, rainstorms, {{and strong}} winds have severe consequences for human society. Changes in extreme weather and climate events have significant impacts and {{are among the}} most serious challenges to society in coping with a changing climate. The cost of damage caused by extreme climate events is rising all over the world. The European Environment Agency (EEA) report ("Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerabilities in Europe 2012 ") stated that the cost of damage had increased from € 9 billion in the 1980 s to € 13 billions in the 2000 s. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that $ 188 billion in damage was caused by the severe weather events in 2011 and 2012. Understanding and identifying hydrometeorologic extreme events and their changes through time are key in sustaining agriculture and socio-economic development. Planning for weather-related <b>emergencies,</b> agricultural and <b>reservoir</b> management and insurance risk calculations, all rely on knowledge of the frequency of these extreme events. The assessment of extreme precipitation is an important problem in hydrologic risk analysis and design. Erosion and removal of the fertile soil layer through hydroclimatic extreme events is also a serious problem in semi-arid to arid regions, especially in mediterranean climates. Accurate measurements of precipitation on a variety of space and time scales are important to climate scientists and decision makers, including hydrologists, agriculturalists and emergency managers. The historical record of precipitation observations is limited mostly to land areas where rain gauges can be deployed, and measurements from those instruments are sparse over large and meteorologically important regions of the Turkey, such as over the Southeastern Anatolia Region. While rain gauge measurements are often used to tune hydrologic models, they are limited by their spatial coverage. Remote sensing techniques using spaceborne sensors provide an excellent complement to continuous monitoring of rain events both spatially and temporally. In this study we compare ground-station data with Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) products at the 3 -hour time scale to evaluate satellite rain estimates for agricultural and hydrological applications in Turkey. The remote sensing dataset TRMM product 3 B 42 has been validated with daily rain gauge measurements in order to characterize rainfall variability in the Southeastern Anatolia region. The precipitation retrievals from the TRMM satellite were compared with data from 7 surface rain gauges within the period of 1998 – 2012. Spatiotemporal patterns through statistical analyses were identified by fitting Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) rainfall distribution to the rainfall time series, and the fitting results were analyzed focusing on the behaviour of the shape parameter. Spatial patterns and correlations of rainfall events across the study area were also analysed by the calculation of the 90 th, 95 th and 99 th percentiles. Regional frequency relationship were developed using the chosen GEV distribution. The recurrence intervals for different years have been estimated using the GEV distribution and their spatial variability has been described. The recurrence intervals of large rainstorms have also been identified for the rain gauge stations with the related TRMM pixel time series and spatial patterns in the study area have been evaluated. Preliminary results indicate that there exist large discrepancies between rain gauge and TRMM data at mean rainfall values; however, least squares fits indicate reliable and quite linear correlation for the 90 th, 95 th, 99 th percentiles (r 2 = 0. 70, 0. 77, and 0. 75 respectively) and the annual maximum daily amount of precipitation (r 2 = 0. 69). In other words, TRMM product 3 B 42 can be used to assess first-order rainfall statistics and recurrence intervals, but rainfall magnitudes vary significantly from ground measurements...|$|R
