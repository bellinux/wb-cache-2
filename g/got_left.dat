5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister <b>got</b> <b>left</b> behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E

But she was a real person that <b>got</b> <b>left</b> behind.".|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rap-Up {{magazine}} {{noted that the}} remix of the song which was featured on the mixtape Big R Ego was [...] "potent, but not quite fatal". Eskridge of Sister 2 Sister wrote in her review of the song that [...] "we can't help but wonder why {{it would have been}} cut". Matthew Richardson of Prefix Magazine noted, [...] "As far as songs that <b>got</b> <b>left</b> in the studio, 'Poison' actually isn't that bad. The song's production isn't loud enough for this to be a single, but Beyonce sounds fine here." [...] Nia Beckwith of the website AllHipHop gave a positive review about the song, saying that it was [...] "the most noteworthy" [...] track she heard during the week of its premiere. She wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the novel were varied. The New Yorker declared Lee [...] "a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer", and The Atlantic Monthlys reviewer rated the book [...] "pleasant, undemanding reading", but found the narrative voice—"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult"—to be implausible. Time magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it [...] "teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life" [...] and calls Scout Finch [...] "the most appealing child since Carson McCullers' Frankie <b>got</b> <b>left</b> behind at the wedding". The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: [...] "This {{is in no way}} a sociological novel. It underlines no cause... To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance." ...|$|E

Later, when Barton celebrates the {{completed}} script by dancing at a USO show, he is surrounded by soldiers. In Lipnick's next appearance, he wears a colonel's uniform, which is really a costume from his company. Lipnick has not actually entered the military but declares himself ready to fight the [...] "little yellow bastards". Originally, this historical moment just after the United States entered World War II was to {{have a significant impact on}} the Hotel Earle. As the Coens explained: [...] "e were thinking of a hotel where the lodgers were old people, the insane, the physically handicapped, because all the others had left for the war. The further the script was developed, the more this theme <b>got</b> <b>left</b> behind, but it had led us, in the beginning, to settle on that period." ...|$|E

500|$|On 3 July 1986, {{just before}} the start of the {{recording}} sessions for The Joshua Tree, Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly. The event shocked the entire band; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, [...] "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed." [...] Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton described it as [...] "a very sobering moment", saying, [...] "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've <b>got</b> <b>left</b> with them." [...] Bono said, [...] "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home." [...] He later commented, [...] "it brought gravitas to the recording of The Joshua Tree. We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much." [...] Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the traditional Māori manner at Kai-iwi Marae near Whanganui, Carroll's hometown. Bono sang [...] "Let It Be" [...] and [...] "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" [...] for him at the funeral.|$|E

Meneses, an established smuggler and a Contra supporter as well, taught Blandón how to smuggle and provided him with cocaine. When Ross discovered the market for crack in Los Angeles, he began buying cocaine from Blandón. Blandón and Meneses' high-volume supply of low-priced high-purity cocaine [...] "allowed Ross to sew up the Los Angeles market and move on.
