40|$|The aims of this {{wide-range}} review {{concerning the}} <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles are to present: (1) {{the diversity of}} definitions and the complexity of analysis <b>of</b> the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles; (2) the authors' own definition <b>of</b> the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles and division of techniques of its analysis. The review presents objective techniques, subjective techniques along with their physiological background, and a combination of techniques {{as well as a}} new biomechanical approach called modelling of skin. The structure of the paper is as follows: definitions <b>of</b> the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles, including the authors' definition; objective techniques <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> measurement; physiological approach; subjective techniques <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> measurement; combination <b>of</b> objective and subjective techniques; modelling techniques and the biomechanics approach for measurement <b>of</b> the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles; division <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> measurement techniques according to the authors. This paper gives a review of the international literature from 1930 to 2010 concerning the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> textiles and other related subjects like skin physiology, perception though the skin, and biomechanical aspects of the skin. Due to obvious limitations the authors have chosen only those papers which seemed to have the strongest relation to the presented topic and which are {{at the same time the}} most interesting studies in the authors' opinion...|$|R
