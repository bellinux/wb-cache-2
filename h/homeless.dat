5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s <b>homeless</b> problem within 10 years and clear {{downtown}} streets of its widespread <b>homeless</b> population. He stated {{that people who}} were <b>homeless</b> and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally <b>homeless</b> and 4,535 street <b>homeless</b> population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the <b>homeless</b> population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally <b>homeless</b> population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street <b>homeless</b> population. However, after 2005, the <b>homeless</b> population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of <b>homeless</b> rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the <b>homeless</b> population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the <b>homeless</b> population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E
5|$|About 30,000people {{were left}} <b>homeless</b> statewide though other {{authorities}} estimated that 24,000people were left <b>homeless</b> in both Sonora and Sinaloa combined. Throughout the mainland, 12 communities sustained heavy damage. In all, all, {{there are no}} reports of major damage in the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Following {{cooperation}} between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation, <b>homeless</b> people, street children and beggars are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and <b>Homeless</b> People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre. The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and street children, {{as well as a}} flophouse. As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and <b>homeless</b> people {{in and out of the}} centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 the Paris {{agglomeration}} (urban area) counted 28,800 {{people without}} a fixed residence, {{an increase of}} 84 percent since 2001; it represents 43 percent of the <b>homeless</b> in all of France. Forty-one percent were women, and 29 percent were accompanied by children. Fifty-six percent of the <b>homeless</b> were born outside France, the largest number coming from Africa and Eastern Europe. The city of Paris has sixty <b>homeless</b> shelters, called Centres d'hébergement et de réinsertion sociale or CHRS, which are funded by the city and operated by private charities and associations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{he appeared}} in Kicking It, a documentary following six <b>homeless</b> men from Kenya, Russia, Afghanistan, Ireland, Spain and the US {{as they attempt to}} qualify for the <b>Homeless</b> World Cup. Farrell appeared on screen and provided the narration, donating his earnings to a <b>homeless</b> shelter in Ireland. The film was released simultaneously in theatres and on television, airing on ESPN2 in a very short window before its DVD release. Farrell received positive reviews for his involvement in the true story.|$|E

5|$|The Compass Housing Authority, a <b>homeless</b> {{advocacy}} group, {{also proposed}} renovating the building into a downtown <b>homeless</b> shelter and services center in 2014, but were {{rejected by the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services over a lack of funding.|$|E
5|$|As supervisor, Newsom had as his {{centerpiece}} a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), {{which offered}} care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists for the <b>homeless</b> {{in lieu of}} direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program. Many <b>homeless</b> rights advocates protested against the initiative. The successfully passed ballot measure raised the political profile of Gavin Newsom and provided the volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} <b>homeless,</b> with many others temporarily <b>homeless</b> in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything in their path to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E
5|$|Dar runs two {{charitable}} organisations as well. These trusts reportedly work {{to provide}} shelter to the <b>homeless,</b> help financially deprived students, and arrange mass marriage events for needy couples.|$|E
5|$|Destroyed housing {{across the}} island left more than 7,000people <b>homeless</b> after the storm's passage.|$|E

5|$|Extensive damage {{occurred}} in Haiti {{due to high}} winds and flash flooding. Total costs for that country were estimated to be at more than $400million (1980 USD). Roughly 60% of the nation's coffee crop was destroyed. In all, 220people were killed and 835,000 were left <b>homeless.</b> In Port-au-Prince, 41 deaths were caused by tin roofs flying off and around 1200 were made <b>homeless</b> by flooding. Another 140 people were reported dead from flooding.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, urgent requests {{for food and}} clean water were made by residents in the hardest hit areas. By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left <b>homeless.</b> According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left <b>homeless.</b> By October30, the number affected and <b>homeless</b> had risen to 1.1million and roughly 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD). By October25, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of Care Not Cash {{began on}} July 1, 2004. As {{part of his}} Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more <b>homeless</b> people were given {{permanent}} shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco <b>Homeless</b> Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project <b>Homeless</b> Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line {{in front of the}} Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Farrell joined other celebrities as a {{spokesman}} for the Special Olympics World Games in Shanghai, China. He has also lent his support to the anti-bullying campaign Stand Up! organised by the Irish LGBT youth organisation BeLonG To in March 2012. The actor appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show two years earlier to increase awareness of the subject.

5|$|The Philippines and Taiwan {{sustained}} {{the most extensive}} losses from Typhoon Nora, with 36people losing their lives collectively. In the former, more than 1million residents were left <b>homeless</b> as high winds and flooding wrecked homes. Damage in the country reached $2million (1973USD). In Taiwan, more than 1,000homes were destroyed and 8,000people were left <b>homeless.</b> The typhoon was also responsible for several maritime incidents that killed at least four people.|$|E
5|$|The Red Cross {{estimated}} that 75% {{of the deaths}} from the storm were children under 12. At first, most of the bodies found by the army were buried normally though due to the high death toll, some were just buried under debris. Some dead bodies were later burned to prevent disease. According to preliminary estimates by officials, 40,000people were made <b>homeless</b> and an addition 20,000were injured, 126of which were considered significant. Within another day, the <b>homeless</b> total rose to70,000. Total damage from the hurricane was estimated at $100million (1976USD).|$|E

Local health officials in Mexico City warned {{of the possibility of}} outbreaks of hepatitis, typhoid, and other waterborne diseases. In response to the threat, homes located in the northern portions of the city near the Río de los Remedios were fumigated.|$|E

5|$|The <b>homeless,</b> {{who were}} by {{majority}} South and Central American males, {{said that they}} came into the area from their respective countries in promise of work. A particular individual who was interviewed said that the work he was told about had only been short term and, along {{with many of the}} others, had nowhere else to go. Most who had been approached about relocation into nearby <b>homeless</b> shelters express their hesitation to leave the Grove Church Cemetery grounds, fearful that they would lose the freedom they had on the public property. Measures were taken to remove and clean up the cemetery, and it is believed that while some may have entered into shelters, others likely still reside in the general area, while some had moved into the wooded eastern side of the Palisades hills in Union City, where many shacks can be seen supporting the <b>homeless.</b>|$|E
