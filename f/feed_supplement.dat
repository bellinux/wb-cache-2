40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of using microminerals in organic form on the performance and quality of eggs from commercial laying hens at the end of laying. Four hundred and eighty Hisex strain hens, 72 to 80 weeks of age, were used. A randomized complete design was used, with six replications and 16 birds for each experimental unit. Five diets were evaluated: basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with all microminerals in inorganic form (control); basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with 50 % microminerals zinc (Zn) + manganese (Mn) + copper (Cu) in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form; basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with 50 % zinc in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form; basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with 50 % manganese in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form; and basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with 50 % copper in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form. There was no effect of diets on egg production, feed intake, food conversion and egg shell percentage and thickness. Birds fed basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> only with zinc or manganese in organic form produced eggs with lower specific weight. The use of basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with copper in organic form has minimized egg loss. However, the best results (lower egg loss, higher specific weight and higher weight of eggs) were obtained with the basal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with microminerals Zn + Mn + Cu in organic form and, therefore, it is recommended for feeding of commercial laying at the end of laying...|$|R

25|$|Overuse {{and poor}} {{irrigation}} practices {{have led to}} increased salt content in the soil, reducing the productivity of the land. Irrigation salinity is caused by water soaking through the soil level adding to the ground water below. This causes the water table to rise, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. As the irrigated area dries, the salt remains. At Wakool in the Riverina region of New South Wales, irrigation salinity is mitigated through a salt interception scheme that pumps saline ground water into evaporation basins, protecting approximately 50,000 hectares of farmland in the area from high water tables and salinity. The subsequent salt has various uses including as an animal <b>feed</b> <b>supplement.</b> The program has returned to production over 2,000 hectares of previously barren farmland and encouraged the regeneration of native eucalypts.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} effect of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® {{on the results of}} rearing the {{multiple}} age groups of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus Rafinesque). Methodology. The study of effect of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® on the results of rearing the multiple age groups of channel catfish have been carried out according to conventional methods. The experiments were conducted in the conditions of Pridneprovsky industrial fish farm of Dnepropetrovsk region. Channel catfish larvae were reared in standard trays. Water volume in trays was maintained at a level of 1. 4 m 3, stocking density of larvae was 20 thousand fish/tray. Rearing of young-of-the-year channel catfish was conducted in 1 m 3 cages, stocking density of grown up larvae was 1000 fish/m 3. Age 1 + channel catfish was reared in 1 m 3 cages, stocking density was 150 fish/m 3. Findings. The studies demonstrated that feeding of multiple age groups of channel catfish with balanced combined feeds with the addition of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® compared to the control group, which was fed with the combined <b>feed</b> but without <b>supplements,</b> increased their growth intensity. The use of these <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> in the combined feed composition contributes to an increase in fish growth rate and fish output and to a reduction in feed costs for fish rearing. The results of the conducted works allow determining the optimum doses of the addition of <b>feed</b> <b>supplements</b> NUPRO® and BIO-MOS® in the composition of combined feeds for feeding multiple age groups of channel catfish reared in the controlled conditions of aquaculture, which are as follow: NUPRO® when added to the feed of channel catfish larvae – 0. 5...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} of gelatin hydrolysate {{consists of a}} literature study of the substance in which the working mechanism will be reviewed, {{as well as a}} practical research part that includes a preference test that studied the preference of horses between a food grade and pharma grade quality of gelatine hydrolysate. To summarize the current state of knowledge about GH: -	Gelatin hydrolysate has the same amino acid composition as collagen fibrils and is used for the synthesis of these fibrils. -	Gelatin hydrolysate accumulates in cartilage. -	Bovine chondrocytes in vitro show an increase in collagen secretion when stimulated with gelatin hydrolysate. -	Gelatin hydrolysate acts as an inhibitor for cartilage breakdown In the production process of GH there are some steps taken with different durations or steps that are repeated. Differences in treatment lead to different product purities and therefore different qualities of GH. The higher the quality, the higher the cost of production. Gelatin hydrolysate can also be produced under different standards. For example, the pharma-grade standard for pharmaceutical products has many rules and regulations to comply. The food-grade standard used is regulated to a lesser extent. -	The main objective of the study described in this report was to determine whether horses display a preference for either of these different qualities of GH (Pharma- versus Feed grade quality) -	How does the preference for the <b>feed</b> with GH <b>supplement</b> turn out if compared to <b>feed</b> with no <b>supplement?</b> -	In this test the supplement was presented to horses {{in the form of a}} dry powder as topdressing over the normal feed,. It was questioned if this would be a preferable way of <b>supplementing</b> the <b>feed?</b> This preference test was split into three field tests. The first test was held at a stable in a town called Kasterlee (Belgium). In this test the horses were given the choice between their normal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with the high purity pharma-grade GH, and their normal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with the lower purity food-grade GH. This group of horses was to some extent adapted to a diet supplemented with GH. The second test was held at a stable in a town called Peer (Belgium). In this test the horses were given a choice between their normal <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with the lower purity food-grade GH, and their normal <b>feed</b> without any <b>supplements.</b> The third test was held at a stable in a town called Sappemeer (Netherlands). In this test the horses were again, like in the first test, given the choice between the two qualities of GH. The difference compared to the group of horses in Kasterlee was that this group of horses had never been fed with GH. Conclusion -	The results show that horses have a preference for <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with the high purity pharma-grade GH over <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with the lower purity food-grade GH. -	The results also show that horses have a preference for <b>feed</b> without <b>supplements</b> over <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with the lower purity GH. -	The acceptance of <b>feed</b> <b>supplemented</b> with GH is higher when the horses are given time to get used to the product...|$|R
