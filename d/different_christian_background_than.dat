40|$|Spiritual {{psychology}} has {{a special}} status and essential role in philosophical theology of Thomas Aquinas and Mulla Sadra. Characteristics of such status and role can be clearly found in compiling structure of “Summa Theologiae” of Aquinas and “Asfar” of Sadra. A Comparative survey of this fundamental element in two systematical structures indicates that these philosophers has so similarly regarded spiritual psychology in networks of metaphysical teachings and doctrines that considered both ontological aspect of human being as caused/creature and his epistemological statue or situation about God, himself and world. But {{the issue of the}} way of human beings toward God in two mentioned systems has provided two different types of justification and compiling structure, because of <b>different</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>background</b> of Aquinas’ thought and Islamic background of Sadra's thought...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} based on ethnographic field {{research}} conducted in the central part of Ghana, in the Brong Ahafo region. It gives a description of two yam festivals performed in 2010 {{in the small town of}} Jema and the nearby village of Kokuma. The author depicts the meanings associated with yams in traditional indigenous cultures and vernacular religions in Ghana as well as within the broader region of the Gulf of Guinea. Contemporary yam festivals are interpreted in relation to the old symbolic and sacred meanings of the yam as “the king of crops” as well as in relation to the contemporary circumstances of African societies which are becoming modernised and less dependent on traditional agriculture. A special focus is placed on the position of chiefs, royal attributes (stools) and involvement of people from <b>different</b> religious <b>backgrounds</b> (<b>Christians,</b> Muslims, “traditionalists”). The concept of “sensational forms” proposed by Birgit Meyer is discussed in relation to yam festivals, which are treated here as performances generating a specific religious “style” shared by contemporary Ghanaians irrespective of their religious affiliations...|$|R
