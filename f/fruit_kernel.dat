40|$|Knowledge of the {{magnitude}} of genetic variability, heritability and genetic advance in the selection of desirable characters could assist the plant breeders in ascertaining criteria {{to be used in the}} breeding programmes. Twenty three introgressed oil palm progenies were evaluated at the Specialized Centre for Oil Palm Research of Cameroon, from 2004 to 2014 to estimate performance, genetic variability, heritability and genetic advance of oil yield and some economic traits in terms to select new oil palm parent materials with the traits of interest. The results revealed high variability among oil palm population for all the characters. Moderate estimates of the phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variations associated with high heritability and moderate genetic advance as percent of mean were obtained for characters of fresh fruit bunch, bunch number, oil yield, kernel to bunch, kernel to <b>fruit,</b> <b>kernel</b> yield and height increment.

40|$|Field {{work was}} carried out in July/August 2009 in {{northern}} Iran. 180 trees Prunus divaricata ssp. caspica from different landuse systems; homegardens, fields, and the surrounding forests; were randomly selected for investigation. Forty mature, undamaged fruits were collected randomly from the four quarters of each tree crown {{at the peak of the}} fruit season. Phenotypic variation of fruit and kernel were determined and SPSS ver. 16. 0 was used for data analysis. Results of the study indicated a very considerable variation in phenotypic variation of fruits and kernels from the different landuse systems. There were highly significant and strong relationships between traits from different landuse systems. However the relationships between fruit mass and kernel as well as shell mass varied between the systems: the weakest were from the forests and the strongest from homegardens. Generally, the relationship between fruit mass and nut mass was high in all landuse systems in comparison with the relationship of <b>fruit</b> <b>kernel</b> and shell mass. Comparisons of mean values for almost all traits between landuse systems were significantly different. The commercially desirable traits like fruit mass and fruit length were significantly different.

40|$|By {{studying}} cultivated maize and its wild closest relative, Balsas teosinte, I addressed two questions: 1) female gametophyte {{development and}} double fertilization in Balsas teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis), and 2) kin recognition within a seed: {{the effect of}} genetic relatedness of an endosperm to its compatriot embryo on maize seed development. First, {{over the course of}} maize evolution, domestication {{played a major role in}} the structural transition of the vegetative and reproductive characteristics that distinguish it from its closest wild relative, Balsas teosinte. Little is known, however, about impacts of the domestication process on the cellular features of the female gametophyte and the subsequent reproductive events after fertilization. The results show that the fertilization process of Balsas teosinte is basically similar to domesticated maize. In contrast with maize, many events associated with the development of the embryo and endosperm appear to be initiated earlier in Balsas teosinte. I propose that the relatively longer duration of the free nuclear endosperm phase in maize is correlated with the development of a larger <b>fruit</b> (<b>kernel)</b> and with a bigger endosperm compared with Balsas teosinte. Second, as one of two sexually formed products resulting from double fertilization in angiosperms, the endosperm nourishes its compatriot embryo during seed development and/or germination and ultimately dies. Previous theoretical studies suggest that the coefficient of relatedness of an endosperm to an embryo in the same seed might determine the amount of resources ultimately available for the embryo during seed development. My results show that the degree of genetic relatedness of an endosperm to its compatriot embryo has a significant effect on embryo weight, but not on endosperm weight. Thus, the endosperm of heterofertilized seeds appears to behave less cooperatively with respect to resource transfer toward its less-closely-related embryo compared to those in homofertilized seeds. This study provides key insights into the developmental and cooperative interactions between the endosperm and embryo as affected by coefficients of relatedness...|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the inter-relationships between the traits characterising tree-to-tree variation in <b>fruits</b> and <b>kernels</b> is fundamental {{to the development of}} selected cultivars based on multiple trait selection. Using data from previously characterised marula (Sclerocarya birrea) trees in Bushbuckridge, South Africa and North Central Region of Namibia, this study examines the relationships between the different traits (fruit pulp, flesh/juice mass, and nut shell and kernel mass) as a means to determine the opportunities to develop cultivars. Strong and highly significant relationships were found between fruit mass and pulp mass in trees from South Africa and Namibia, indicating that size is a good predictor of fruit pulp production. However, fruit size is not a good predictor of nut or kernel production, as there were weak relationships between fruit and nut and/or kernel mass, which varied between sites and landuses. Generally, the relationships between <b>fruit</b> mass and <b>kernel</b> mass were weaker than between fruit mass and nut mass. Relationships between kernel mass and shell mass were generally weak. The lack of strong relationships between <b>fruit</b> and <b>kernel</b> mass does, however, imply that there are opportunities to identify trees with either big fruits/small nuts for pulp production, or trees with large kernels in relatively small <b>fruits</b> for <b>kernel</b> oil production. However, within fruits from the same tree, nuts could contain 0 – 4 kernels, indicating that even in trees with an inherent propensity for large kernels, improved pollination may be required to maximise kernel mass through an increase in kernel number. Finally, the relationships between percentage kernel oil content and the measured morphological traits were also very weak. The conclusions of these results are that there is merit in identifying different combinations of traits for the selection of trees producing either pulp or <b>kernels.</b> Consequently, <b>fruit</b> and <b>kernel</b> ‘ideotypes’ are presented as guides to the selection of elite trees for cultivar development. These results have important implications for the domestication of the species as a producer of <b>fruits</b> or <b>kernels</b> for food/beverages or cosmetic oils...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{study the}} effects of xenia, methaxenia, lipid and fatty acid rates and {{elements}} on pistachio, 4 male genotypes from among all male genotypes provided by Rafsanjan Pistachio Research Institute were selected. The flowering period of the chosen genotypes was the same as 3 female cultivars of Kalleghoochi, Ohadi, Ahmadaghaii. By using completely randomized blocks design we conducted various experiments during the years 2006 and 2007. The highest percentage of fat was found in the kernels of Ahmadaghaii (52. 92 %) and the lowest in Kalleghoochi (45. 48 %). From among different factors and their interacting effects, only the effect of pollen and cultivar type on the fat content of the fruit was significant only at 5 % level. Thus R 27 and N 16 pollen produced the highest fat content in the kernels of Ahmadaghaii (58. 7 and 57. 7 %). The most common simple unsaturated fatty acid found in the kernels of all cultivars was oleic acid and the most important compound unsaturated fatty acid in <b>fruit</b> <b>kernels</b> was linoleic acid. Pollen type was only effective on the amount of meristoleic and palmitoleic fatty acids.
