40|$|Introduction: The United States Environmental Protection Agency began {{monitoring}} {{lead and}} other contaminants in residential properties the 35 th Avenue district of Northern Birmingham in October of 2012. The EPA sampled eleven-hundred homes for lead and other contaminants, and in 2014 the EPA began cleanup on 400 sites. Residents have refused cleanup {{here and in}} other sites such as the Colorado smelter site and the Omaha City Superfund site {{due to lack of}} knowledge of the harms of lead poisoning, general mistrust of government agencies, or apathy. A complete and concise lead <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> for residents from the community outreach may encourage the remaining residents to allow the EPA to sample and cleanup. Lead contamination and poisoning are serious threats that can adversely affect people’s health and lives. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether or not the selected lead <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> were understandable to the general public, and future <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> need to be revised before being used. If a new <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> needed to be completed, what information would be needed? Is there a way to effectively convey information in a simple and direct way? Methods: The methodology will focus on four areas to assess the 35 th avenue <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> and eleven other <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> used in the various government and private establishments. Information obtained from these areas will then be used to create a new <b>fact</b> <b>sheet.</b> The following studied areas are: 1) How <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> were gathered; 2) Reading analysis; 3) Suitability Assessment of Materials; and 4) Development of new <b>fact</b> <b>sheet.</b> Results: The Flesch-Kincaid reading levels ranged from 5. 5 to 16. The average level for the twelve <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> was 9. 9. Seven <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> could be read at a level below the 10 th grade. Therefore, with the use of the currently evaluated lead <b>fact</b> <b>sheets,</b> more that 50 % of Americans would not be able to understand them (Doak et al., 1996). Discussion: A lead <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> should be no more than one page in length that focuses on background, procedures, and prevention during a response to lead contamination. The new lead <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> should be written at a 6 th-grade reading level and receive a high score on SAM. The new revisions to the <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> will ensure that the new <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> will be comprehensible by the majority of adults in the United States...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A mercury <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> that {{contains}} essential information {{and can be}} clearly understood by majority of adults is needed. In Fiscal Year 2009, EPA responded to more releases related to mercury than any other release. Since 2003, EPA has responded to more than 200 mercury releases. The American Association of Poison Control Centers estimate more than 50, 000 people {{have been exposed to}} mercury vapors from 2003 to 2008, and 19, 000 mercury cleanups have occurred from 2006 to 2008. Purpose: To determine what information needs to be included in a mercury <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> and how it should be created to inform adults who may be important in preventing and limiting exposure during accidental mercury release in the United States. Methods: The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula Data and the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) tool were used to determine readability and appropriateness of twelve <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> related to elemental mercury. Length of <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> and illustration coverage percentage were also assessed. In addition, surveys were performed with four people who were involved in response to mercury releases in 2007 to 2009. The information they provided was also summarized to determine important elements that {{should be included in the}} <b>fact</b> <b>sheets.</b> Results: Information in a <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> should include the background of mercury, procedures in the event of a release, and ways to prevent releases. Based on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the literacy levels required to comprehend the 12 <b>facts</b> <b>sheets</b> was 11. 4 on average. The majority of adults cannot comprehend the twelve <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> evaluated. Based on the evaluation of the material using SAM, none of the <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> scored higher than adequate with SAM. Only two <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> were written on one page and none of the <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> used relevant, simple illustrations with captions. Discussion: An effective mercury <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> needs to be about one page long and focuses on background, procedures, and prevention of exposure during a mercury release. Information obtained from interviews found that people focused the majority of their attention on the first page only. The <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> needs to be written at a sixth grade reading and to be able to receive a superior rating when assessed with SAM. This will ensure that the <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> is readable and comprehendible by the majority of adults and include the necessary information that the public must know regarding mercury. A new <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> was developed and assessed using both Flesch-Kincaid level and SAM and was found to have a 6. 6 reading grade level and received a superior score under SAM. This <b>fact</b> <b>sheet</b> will be used by EPA along with the existing more comprehensive <b>fact</b> <b>sheets</b> at state agencies, and poison control centers for future releases and will be given to schools to educate and prevent future releases...|$|R
