40|$|Background: Urticaria is {{a common}} skin {{condition}} {{with a wide range}} of subtypes. It is characterized by the rapid appearance of wheals and itching or burning sensation. The physical urticarias are chronic conditions triggered by their respective namesake physical factors. Their pathogenesis remains mostly unclear, but it is known that mastcell degranulation releases histamine and other mediators, thus causing the wheal-and-flare reaction. The most common forms of physical urticaria are dermographic urticaria (DU) - shearing forces on the skin result in weals and itching - and Acquired cold urticaria (ACU) - a skin condition, in which exposure to cold results in wheals and itching. Both have a profound impact on patient quality of life. Secondgeneration antihistamines are recommended as the first-line treatment. Aim: The objective of this pilot study was to assess how urticaria symptoms affected cognitive performance and mood as known in allergic rhinitis. And if a single dose of 20 mg of the second-generation antihistamine <b>Ebastine</b> is effective in protecting urticaria patients from this impairment of performance. Methods: This pilot-study was designed as a double-blind, crossover, placebocontrolled, trial including 29 adults. After having received Placebo or 20 mg <b>Ebastine,</b> cognitive performance and mood were assessed before and after ACU and DU symptoms were experimentally provoced on two areas of the forearms. Efficacy was assessed by rating weals, erythema, pruritus and burning after provocation. Results: Neither urticaria symptoms nor the <b>Ebastine</b> treatment had negative impact on any of the parameters of cognitive performance or mood but <b>Ebastine</b> dramatically reduced the number of patients who experienced wheals, pruritus, and burning after provocation. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that urticaria symptoms had no negative impact on cognitive performance or mood and that <b>Ebastine</b> is safe and effective in preventing the symptoms of ACU and DU...|$|E
40|$|Histamine {{sensitizes}} the nociceptor transient reporter potential channel V 1 (TRPV 1) and {{has been}} shown to contribute to visceral hypersensitivity in animals. We investigated the role of TRPV 1 in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and evaluated if an antagonist of histamine receptor H 1 (HRH 1) could reduce symptoms of patients in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. By using live calcium imaging, we compared activation of submucosal neurons by the TRPV 1 agonist capsaicin in rectal biopsy specimens collected from 9 patients with IBS (ROME 3 criteria) and 15 healthy subjects. The sensitization of TRPV 1 by histamine, its metabolite imidazole acetaldehyde, and supernatants from biopsy specimens was assessed by calcium imaging of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons. We then performed a double-blind trial of patients with IBS (mean age, 31 y; range, 18 - 65 y; 34 female). After a 2 -week run-in period, subjects were assigned randomly to groups given either the HRH 1 antagonist <b>ebastine</b> (20 mg/day; n = 28) or placebo (n = 27) for 12 weeks. Rectal biopsy specimens were collected, barostat studies were performed, and symptoms were assessed (using the validated gastrointestinal symptom rating scale) before and after the 12 -week period. Patients were followed up for an additional 2 weeks. Abdominal pain, symptom relief, and health-related quality of life were assessed on a weekly basis. The primary end point of the study was the effect of <b>ebastine</b> on the symptom score evoked by rectal distension. TRPV 1 responses of submucosal neurons from patients with IBS were potentiated compared with those of healthy volunteers. Moreover, TRPV 1 responses of submucosal neurons from healthy volunteers could be potentiated by their pre-incubation with histamine; this effect was blocked by the HRH 1 antagonist pyrilamine. Supernatants from rectal biopsy specimens from patients with IBS, but not from the healthy volunteers, sensitized TRPV 1 in mouse nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons via HRH 1; this effect could be reproduced by histamine and imidazole acetaldehyde. Compared with subjects given placebo, those given <b>ebastine</b> had reduced visceral hypersensitivity, increased symptom relief (<b>ebastine</b> 46 % vs placebo 13 %; P =. 024), and reduced abdominal pain scores (<b>ebastine</b> 39 ± 23 vs placebo 62 ± 22; P =. 0004).

In an online survey, patients whose medication was switched assessed the impact on efficacy, fatigue, and work productivity/attendance. Methods Allergy patients in Norway completed a 25 -item online survey. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with AR or CU who were switched to cetirizine or loratadine from desloratadine, <b>ebastine,</b> or fexofenadine were included. Participants rated post-switch efficacy, fatigue, and effect on work productivity/attendance compared with their pre-switch medication. Patients also reported post-switch change in number of doctor visits required, total treatment cost, and whether they had switched or wanted to switch back to their previous medications. Results Of 1920 patients invited, 493 responded and 409 of these were eligible. Previous antihistamines were desloratadine (78. 4 % of respondents), <b>ebastine</b> (16. 0 %), and fexofenadine (5. 6 %). Post-switch, 64. 7 % received cetirizine and 35. 3 % loratadine. Compared with previous therapy, cetirizine and loratadine were rated less effective by 46. 3 % of respondents; 28. 7 % reported increased fatigue; and 31. 6 % reported decreased work productivity with the generic agents. At {{the time of the}} survey, 26 % of respondents had switched back to their previous medication. Conclusions This is the first survey to assess the impact on patient-reported outcomes of a mandated switch from prescription to generic antihistamines in Norway.

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of 10 compounds have been updated. Some values are lacking for drugs under development, but also for older antihistamines. Thereafter, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships are reported from published or original documents. A linear pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship has been found for acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, <b>ebastine</b> and terfenadine, whereas nonlinear relationships have been calculated for <b>ebastine</b> (in the dog), levocabastine, mizolastine, noberastine and terfenadine. It must be concluded that this type of approach for therapeutic optimisation is very fruitful and may enable large numbers of clinical studies to be avoided. Trends for the future include: (i) in vitro binding studies with the human H 1 -receptor obtained by molecular biology; (ii) the characterisation of the cytochromes P 450 responsible for the biotransformation of antihistamine; (iii) the calculation of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship in healthy individuals; and (iv) prospective effect-controlled clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{precise and}} rapid RP-HPLC method was {{developed}} for the determination of <b>ebastine</b> in pharmaceutical formulations. The method was carried out on a Phenomenex RP-C 18 column using a mixture of methanol and water (90 : 10) and detection was done at 262 nm. The linearity range was 5 - 100 &# 956;g/ml. The intra-day and inter-day precision were {{in the range of}} 0. 22 &#x 0025; to 0. 49 &#x 0025; and 0. 24 &#x 0025; to 0. 73 &#x 0025;, respectively...|$|E
