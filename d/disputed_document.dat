40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate how handwriting as an individualisation technique in fraud investigation can be used by police detectives, SARS investigators and forensic investigation specialists, who are responsible for the investigation and linking the perpetrator, with a view to criminal prosecution. A further intent was to share and introduce a number of important concepts, namely: criminal investigation, identification, individualisation, fraud, evidence and handwriting. The research will explain the sophisticated investigation techniques used to obtain sufficient information to prove the true facts in a court of law. Identification is the collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which an object is definitively recognisable or known, while the individual characteristics establish the individuality of a specific object. Many types of evidence may be used to link an individual with a crime scene, and associate that individual with the performed illegal handling. It also explained that during a cheque/document fraud investigation, it is in most cases the only link to information to trace, identify and individualise the perpetrator, and to obtain a handwriting specimen. It is also discussed how to eliminate a person being a writer of a document, and how to collect, package and mark a <b>disputed</b> <b>document</b> during the investigation. If the investigators use their knowledge of these concepts, it should enhance their investigative skills, and empower them to be become better equipped for the challenges they face in identifying, individualising and linking the perpetrators, in order to ensure successful prosecution and conviction.

40|$|An authorship {{authentication}} system {{was presented in}} this research to assess authorship authentication in short text that was extracted from sample posts of a social networking site. Authorship authentication {{is one of the}} trending security problems for social networking sites. Stylometry has been a well-known technology for authenticating an author to a <b>disputed</b> <b>document</b> in question. Authorship authentication in short text from social networking sites is a relatively newer domain to be explored. The goal of this research is to determine the degree to which social networking postings can be authenticated as coming from the purported user and not from an intruder. Facebook data was used for illustration. ^ The proposed research solution is an authorship {{authentication system}} that includes the use of 233 features (a combination of 227 stylometric features and 6 social network specific features), Support Vector Machine (SVM) Linear kernel function, and the Leave-One-Out method. Various sets of stylometry and ad hoc social networking specific features were developed to categorize short messages from thirty Facebook authors as authentic or non-authentic using SVM. ^ The challenges of applying traditional stylometry on short messages were discussed. The full set of 233 features achieved the best accuracy rate of 79. 6 % over any of its subsets. The social network-specific features showed marginal accuracy improvement when added to stylometric features. However, users who adopted these features were more distinguishable in writing styles. The test results showed the impact of sample size, features, and user writing style on the effectiveness of authorship authentication, indicating varying degrees of success compared to previous studies in authorship authentication in short text. The proposed stylometric features and method were also tested on 300 sample long book data. SVM showed better accuracy rate than k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) on Facebook data, while k-NN showed a better accuracy rate than SVM on book data. Finally, a comparison of a number of commonly used classification methods was tested on Facebook data to assess their performance for short text authorship authentication. Decision tree showed the best accuracy rate followed by SVM with a linear kernel function. ...|$|E
40|$|Document {{examination}} is a forensics field {{focused on}} the analysis of a <b>disputed</b> <b>document.</b> One way to analyze a document {{is to focus on}} the composition of the ink used or the materials from which documents are produced. Nowadays, three major classes of inks are studied: pen inks, inkjet printer inks, and toner. If the analysis of pen inks is already well developed in the literature and in the forensic lab, the analysis of inkjet printer inks is reported only to a limited degree and is principally focused on color inks. Fraudulent-minded people use more and more inkjet printer technology to produce falsified documents. So, it is a necessity to develop an analytical method for inkjet-printed document examination. Due to the particular chemical composition of these inks, different or more complicated analytical methods could and must be reviewed. Four analytical methods are evaluated in this thesis as possible tools for the analysis of inkjet-printed documents in terms of discriminating power, chemical information quality, and nondestructive capability: Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry coupled with Laser Desorption Ionization (LDI), Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI), and Desorption ElectroSpray Ionization (DESI). The results obtained from two color inkjet printer cartridges (either fresh or printed) show that Raman spectroscopy and MALDI (9 -aminoacridin as matrix) are the two most powerful methods for the analysis of color inkjet inks. Both methods have the advantage to perform analysis of inks directly on paper. The complementarity of the Raman spectroscopy and the MALDI-MS techniques is demonstrated based on the analysis of 10 different inkjet cartridges. The Raman method is a nondestructive approach while MALDI mass spectrometry has a better discrimination power and can also lead to information about some ink additives and paper composition. If it is necessary to determine the spatial distribution of one compound, then molecular imaging can be performed using Raman and (MA) LDI mass spectrometry. These techniques have been used successfully on a banknote or a stamp. Black inks are also under investigation in this work. The discrimination of black inkjet-printed documents is more difficult because of the common use of carbon black as the principal black pigment. LDI mass spectra recorded on black-printed inks give polyethylene glycol (PEG) peaks that are characteristics of a particular brand. Moreover, unknown characteristic peaks are detected in the low mass range of these spectra, giving additional information for discrimination of black inks. A software has been developed for a rapid and objective comparison of the low mass range of these positive mode LDI spectra...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} authorship {{attribution}} of documents given some prior stylistic {{characteristics of the}} author’s writing extracted from a corpus of known works, e. g., authentication of <b>disputed</b> <b>documents</b> or literary works. Although the pioneering paper based on word length histograms appeared {{at the very end}} of the nineteenth century, the resolution power of this and other stylometry approaches is yet to be studied both theoretically and on case studies such that additional information can assist finding the correct attribution. We survey several theoretical approaches including ones approximating the apparently nearly optimal one based on Kolmogorov conditional complexity and some case studies: attributing Shakespeare canon and newly discovered works as well as allegedly M. Twain’s newly-discovered works, Federalist papers binary (Madison vs. Hamilton) discrimination using Naive Bayes and other classifiers, and steganography presence testing. The latter topic is complemented by a sketch of an anagrams ambiguity study based on the Shannon cryptography theory. 1. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of authorship in <b>disputed</b> <b>documents</b> still requires human expertise, {{which is now}} unfeasible for many tasks owing to the large volumes of text and authors in practical applications. In this study, we introduce a methodology based on the dynamics of word co-occurrence networks representing written texts to classify a corpus of 80 texts by 8 authors. The texts were divided into sections with equal number of linguistic tokens, from which time series were created for 12 topological metrics. The series were proven to be stationary (p-value> 0. 05), which permits to use distribution moments as learning attributes. With an optimized supervised learning procedure using a Radial Basis Function Network, 68 out of 80 texts were correctly classified, i. e. a remarkable 85 % author matching success rate. Therefore, fluctuations in purely dynamic network metrics were found to characterize authorship, thus opening {{the way for the}} description of texts in terms of small evolving networks. Moreover, the approach introduced allows for comparison of texts with diverse characteristics in a simple, fast fashion...|$|R
