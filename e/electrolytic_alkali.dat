5|$|James Hargreaves (1834–1915) was {{a chemist}} and inventor, who, along with Thomas Bird, {{developed}} {{a process for}} the electrolysis of brine using asbestos diaphragms. In 1899, he became director of the newly opened General <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Alkali</b> Company at Middlewich.|$|E
5000|$|Richard {{opened the}} banking firm of Wilson Galloway & Co., which {{would later become}} R. T. Wilson & Co., the company first {{to take up the}} {{question}} of the New York Subway System. [...] Wilson served as a director of the American Cotton Oil Co., the Fourth National Bank, the Manhattan Trust Co., Castner <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Alkali</b> Co., the National Surety Co., Union Trust Co., the United States Casualty Co. and the Mathheson Alkali Works. He retired from business around 1906.|$|E
5000|$|With Thomas Bird, Hargreaves {{developed}} {{a process for}} the electrolysis of brine using asbestos diaphragms. In 1893 the General Electric Parent Company was established to develop this process. Bird died in 1895 and 1899 the General <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Alkali</b> Company was set up at Middlewich, with Hargreaves as a director and his son Luke as general manager. Hargreaves cells were also built in France, Norway and USA. [...] The process was in direct competition with the electrolysis of brine in mercury cells in the Castner-Kellner process but Hargreaves considered that mercury was too toxic a substance for workers to be exposed to.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of radiation–chemical transformations of chlorinated biphenyls in a hexane solution, isopropyl {{alcohol in the}} presence of alkali KOH is carried out. It includes 52 elementary reactions of radiolysis of hexane active particles (main component) with molecules of isopropyl alcohol and ion radicals OH− formed during <b>electrolytic</b> dissociation of <b>alkali</b> molecules. The kinetic curves of the conversion of PCB isomers in “Sovtol 10 ” (PCB 101, 138, 180, 194, PCB 18, and PCB 52) and products such as monochlorobiphenyls, biphenyls and Cl− at different absorbed doses were calculated. It is shown that some of the isomers are monotonously consumed with increasing doses, and a part of the kinetics is characterised by peaks. The calculated values of the radiation–chemical yields are agreed with the experimentally obtained values...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the origin of Zone IV (1) of the cur-rent vs. time curves obtained during <b>electrolytic</b> oloration of <b>alkali</b> halides with a pointed cathode and a flat metallic anode mechanically pressed against the crystal. Zone IV is not intrinsic and is not due to the crystal volume itself, but is related to processes occurring in the crystal metallic anode interface. Whenever these processes are inhibited, e. g., by using a vacuum evaporated metallic anode, Zone IV is suppressed and intrinsic current vs. time curves are obtained. These curves resemble those corresponding to space charge limited currents in insulators and semiconductors. The following anodic proc-esses are mentioned: An electrical arc was produced in the thin and irregular gap between the crystal and the anodic plate. The intensity of the light emitted from this arc correlates with electrical current during Zone IV and the spectral distribution shows a complicated multipeak structure. The num-ber and position of the peaks are quite independent of the alkali halide crys...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) {{material}} has been widely used in various scientific fields and has been successfully implemented in several devices. Herein, the electrochemical reduction of ITO electrode in an organic <b>electrolytic</b> solution containing <b>alkali</b> metal, NaI, or redox molecule, N-(ferrocenylmethyl) imidazolium iodide, was investigated. The reduced ITO surfaces were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and grazing incident XRD demonstrating {{the presence of the}} electrolyte cation inside the material. Reversibility of this process after re-oxidation was evidenced by XPS. Using a redox molecule based ionic liquid as supporting electrolyte leads to fellow electrochemically the intercalation process. As a result, modified ITO containing ferrocenyl imidazolium was easily generated. This reduction process occurs at mild reducing potential around − 1. 8 V and causes for higher reducing potential a drastic morphological change accompanied with a decrease of the electrode conductivity at the macroscopic scale. Finally, the self-reducing power of the reduced ITO phase was used to initiate the spontaneous reduction of silver ions leading to the growth of Ag nanoparticles. As a result, transparent and multifunctional active ITO surfaces were generated bearing redox active molecules inside the material and Ag nanoparticles onto the surface...|$|R
