50|$|The great lanternshark, <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>princeps,</b> {{also known}} as Rough Sagre Shark, is a shark of the family Etmopteridae found in the {{northeast}} and northwest Atlantic. Its name was given as {{at the time of its}} discovery, it was thought to be bioluminescent, but this has been challenged.|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} deep-water shark {{are present in}} the Rockall Trough and are {{vulnerable}} to the impacts of deep-sea fisheries. Shark numbers are declining and commercially important prey items are being fished out of the ecosystem, affecting a number of aquatic food-webs. This paper describes the dietary composition of the birdbeak dogfish (Deania calceus) and the greater lantern shark (<b>Etmopterus</b> <b>princeps)</b> collected from the Rockall Trough between 55 - 57. 6 °N and 9 - 14 °W. D. calceus was collected from 650 - 1050 m at different locations and fed mainly on teleosts and cephalopods. Diet composition varied with depth but was not influenced by site, gender or maturity as immature specimens were largely absent from the sample. Comparisons of diet composition with previous fmdings demonstrate a shift in prey assemblage which may be as a result of fishing. E. princeps was sampled at 1500 m along the continental slope and diet composition was dominated by crustaceans, cephalopods and some fish. Diet composition was very different to that of D. calceus and did not vary between genders or maturity level. Both species exhibit generalist diets which counteract the effects of competition with other deep-water sharks and also the impacts of fisheries.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{survey was}} carried out in October - November of 2000, in the Cape Verde archipelago, by the R/V ARQUIPÉLAGO. The main objective was to determine the species composition and relative abundance of the demersal fish resources living in the waters of the Cape Verde archipelago. A list of fishes caught with bottom longline during the survey is presented in this document, along with information about the area, depth limits and the relative abundance of the species in the catches. Ninety-seven different species from 49 families were identified from 20 long-line sets. To our knowledge, the following 12 species were recorded for the first time from the waters of Cape Verde islands: <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>princeps,</b> Etmopterus pusillus, Gymnothorax maderensis, Myroconger compressus, Laemonema robustum, Beryx splendens, Scorpaena elongata, Serranus atricauda, Taractes rubescens, Taracthichthys longipinnis, Pagrus africanus and Cathidermis sufflamen. The species Laemonema robustum, were new to the CLOFETA area...|$|E
40|$|Asthenocotyle azorensis n. sp. (Monogenea: Microbothriidae) is {{described}} from the dermal denticles {{of the great}} lanternshark <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>princeps</b> Collett off the Azores. The type-species of the genus, A. kaikourensis Robinson, 1961, is redescribed and additional observations are made on A. taranakiensis Beverley-Burton, Klassen & Lester, 1987. The generic diagnosis is revised. The new species is distinguished from its two congeners by the large size of the pharynx and fewer testes. The ejaculatory bulb of A. kaikourensis is much larger than those of A. taranakiensis and A. azorensis and is supplied with many ducts from an extensive field of male accessory gland-cells located outside the genital pouch and extending posteriorly to {{the region of the}} germarium and external seminal vesicle. Asthenocotyle taranakiensis is distinguished from the other two species by its copulatory sclerite, which forms a double loop, although {{this may not be the}} case when the copulatory organ is extended. The bodies of A. azorensis and A. kaikourensis are similar in shape, with the maximum width approximately 37 % and 25 %, respectively, of the total length from the anterior end. In addition to the relatively small size of the genital pouch and ejaculatory bulb in A. azorensis and A. taranakiensis, the vaginal opening is adjacent to the common genital opening. In A. kaikourensis, the vaginal opening is distant from and posterior to the common genital opening. The functional morphology of the copulatory organ of A. azorensis is considered. The relative importance, for the taxonomy of microbothriids, of the number of testes versus the anatomy of the copulatory complex is discussed. Graham C. Kearn, Ian D. Whittington, Paul Thoma...|$|E
40|$|The present survey {{took place}} {{over a period of}} 12 days in August 1997 along the eastern slope of Rockall Trough between 53 and 58 ºN {{including}} the Northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Fishing was carried out in six separate areas, in depths between 300 and 2, 925 meters. The primary objective of the survey was to obtain samples of chondricthyan and teleost fish for the Marine Institute (MI) deepwater research programme, for contaminant analysis of fish by the MI chemistry section and for food technology analysis at the Teagasc National Food Centre. The survey was carried out on the Norwegian commercial long-liner "Skarheim," using commercial deep-water autoline gear. In total over 70, 000 hooks were set during the trip and on average 80 % of these were baited. In total 20 species of chondricthyan and 18 species of teleost fish were taken. Among the most abundant species in the catch were leafscale gulper shark Centrophorus squamosus (36 %), bird beak dogfish Deania calcea (21 %), Portuguese dogfish Centrascyflium coefofepis (13 %), tusk, Brosme brosme (11 %) and mora, Mora mora (6 %). Over the entire survey, discarding was estimated as 30 % of the total catch. The main species discarded were bird beak dogfish and greater lantern shark <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>princeps.</b> Catch per 1, 000 hooks showed that highest abundances were found at 600 - 1, 100 metres throughout the whole fishing area. Three settings were made at depths between 2, 000 and 3, 000 meters. These shots gave valuable information about depth distribution of different species and also brought up species that have never been recorded in the Rockall Trough before...|$|E
