40|$|Leptospirosis of {{domestic}} animals {{is a very}} complex disease. This NebGuide examines its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Introduction Leptospirosis is an infectious disease of animals and man caused by a spiral-shaped organism (spirochete) of the genus Leptospira. The important serotypes recognized in livestock in the United States include Leptospira pomona, L. canicola, L. icterohaemorrhagiae, L. grippotyphosa and L. hardjo. These organisms have a wide host range, including man. Among <b>domestic</b> animals, <b>swine,</b> cattle, dogs, and horses are most frequently affected. Known wildlife hosts include many of the small rodents, raccoons, foxes, opossums, skunks, deer, and moose. Because {{of the nature of the}} disease, it should not be considered a problem of the individual animal but a problem of a population, either a herd or a species within the area. The disease can be controlled by proper management and the correct use of available vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Surgical {{treatments}} for early onset scoliosis (EOS) correct curvatures and improve respiratory function but involve many complications. A distractible, or ‘growing rod,’ implant construct {{that is more}} flexible than current metal rod systems may sufficiently correct curves in small children and reduce complications due to biomechanical factors. The purpose of this pilot {{study was to determine}} ranges of motion (ROM) after implantation of simulated growing rod constructs with a range of clinically relevant structural properties. The hypothesis was that ROM of spines instrumented with polymer rods would be greater than conventional metal rods and lower than non-instrumented controls. Methods Biomechanical tests were conducted on six thoracic spines from skeletally immature <b>domestic</b> <b>swines</b> (35 – 40  kg). Paired pedicle screws were used as anchors at proximal and distal levels. Specimens were tested under the following conditions: control, then dual rods of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) (diameter 6. 25  mm), titanium (4  mm), and cobalt-chrome alloy (CoCr) (5  mm). Lateral bending (LB) and flexion-extension (FE) moments were applied, and vertebral rotations were measured. Differences were determined by two-tailed t-tests and Bonferroni for four primary comparisons: PEEK vs control and PEEK vs CoCr, in LB and FE (α[*]=[*] 0. 05 / 4). Results In LB, ROM of spine segments after instrumenting with PEEK rods was lower than the non-instrumented control condition at each instrumented level. ROM was greater with PEEK rods than with Ti and CoCr rods at every instrumented level. Combining treated levels, in LB, ROM for PEEK rods was 35  % of control (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and 270  % of CoCr rods (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In FE, ROM with PEEK was 27  % of control (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 180  % of CoCr (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). At proximal and distal adjacent non-instrumented levels in FE, mean ROM was lower for PEEK than for either metal. Conclusions PEEK rods increased flexibility versus metal rods, and decreased flexibility versus non-instrumented controls, both over the entire instrumented segment and at each individual level. Smaller mean increases in ROM at proximal and distal adjacent motion segments occurred with PEEK compared to metal rods, which may help decrease complications, such as junctional kyphosis. Flexible growing rods may eventually help improve treatment options for young patients with severe deformity...|$|R
5000|$|The {{eradication}} {{efforts were}} nearly complete {{when it was}} discovered that populations of feral swine existed throughout the rural countryside. The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) worked in concert with the USDA to identify and eliminate feral swine populations which harbored the ASF virus in Haiti. Numerous feral populations were identified and one particular population north of Gonaives tested positive for the virus. SCWDS enlisted the use of American and Haitian hog-hunting dogs to reduce the populations. Wildlife Biologist and seasoned hog hunter Mark W. Hall lead the effort for SCWDS with able Wildlife Technician Matthew Knox. Dozens of feral swine were eliminated in the areas of Jacmel, Gonaives, Petit tru de Nips, and Cap-Haitien. Hall and Knox sampled a dead boar known as the [...] "Voodoo Hog" [...] that was killed by a hoard of brave Haitiens armed with machetes in a cane field west of Cap-Haitien.

5000|$|Trichinosis (trichinellosis) is {{a disease}} caused by tissue-dwelling roundworms of the species Trichinella spiralis. In the United States, the {{national}} trichinellosis surveillance system has documented a steady decline in the reported incidence of this disease. During 1947 to 1951, a median of 393 human cases were reported annually, including 57 trichinellosis-related deaths. During 1997-2001, the incidence decreased to a median of 12 cases annually, with no reported deaths. The decline in infection was largely associated with changes implemented by the U.S. pork industry that have resulted in reduced prevalence of Trichinella among <b>domestic</b> <b>swine.</b> [...] In the United States, Congress passed the Federal Swine Health Protection Act, restricting the use of uncooked garbage as feed stock for pigs, and creating a voluntary Trichinae Herd Certification Program. The Trichinae Herd Certification Program is a voluntary preharvest pork safety program that provides documentation of swine management practices to minimize Trichinella exposure. The goal {{of the program is}} to establish a system under which pork production facilities that follow good production practices might be certified as Trichinella-safe.In addition to the reduction in Trichinella prevalence in commercial pork, processing methods also have contributed to the dramatic decline in human trichinellosis associated with pork products. Through the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, the USDA has created guidelines for specific cooking temperatures and times, freezing temperatures and times, and curing methods for processed pork products to control postharvest human exposure to Trichinella. [...] Pork products meeting these guidelines are designated certified pork.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in feral swine are limited, and data for {{clinical}} manifestations and disease transmissibility are lacking. In this report, feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> were experimentally infected with FMDV (A 24 -Cruzeiro), and susceptibility and virus transmission were studied. Feral swine were {{proved to be}} highly susceptible to A- 24 Cruzeiro FMD virus by intradermal inoculation and by contact with infected domestic and feral swine. Typical clinical signs in feral swine included transient fever, lameness and vesicular lesions in the coronary bands, heel bulbs, tip of the tongue and snout. <b>Domestic</b> <b>swine</b> exhibited clinical signs of the disease within 24 h after contact with feral swine, whereas feral swine did not show clinical signs of FMD until 48 h after contact with infected domestic and feral swine. Clinical scores of feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> were comparable. However, feral swine exhibited a higher tolerance for the disease, and their thicker, darker skin made vesicular lesions difficult to detect. Virus titration of oral swabs showed that both feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> shed similar amounts of virus, with levels peaking between 2 to 4 dpi/dpc (days post-inoculation/days post-contact). FMDV RNA was intermittently detectable in the oral swabs by real-time RT-PCR of both feral and <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> between 1 and 8 dpi/dpc {{and in some instances}} until 14 dpi/ 12 dpc.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} shown that the {{inhibition}} of potassium ion conductance decreases defibrillation threshold. We postulated that if potassium conductance is a primary mechanism affecting defibrillation threshold values, then increasing potassium ion conductance will increase defibrillation values. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine if the ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channel opener pinacidil would increase defibrillation threshold values. The second objective was to prove that the observed changes were due to potassium conductance by using the KATP inhibitor, glyburide, to reverse the electrophysio-logic actions of pinacidil. The third objective was to determine if the electrophysiology actions of pinacidil correlate with changes in defibrillation threshold value. Methods and Results: <b>Domestic</b> farm <b>swine</b> (n = 14) were anesthetized and intubated.

MethodsIrreversible electroporation of the pancreas {{was performed in}} four <b>domestic</b> female <b>swine</b> using two monopolar probes spaced 9 – 15 mm apart. Ninety pulses of 1500 V/cm were delivered for each ablation. ResultsAll animals survived for their designated times of 2 h (n= 1), 2 days (n= 1) and 14 days (n= 2), respectively. No procedure-related complications occurred. Three animals in which probes had been spaced at intervals of 10 ± 1 mm showed evidence of irreversible ablation, with ablation height ranging from < 10 mm to 21 mm and ablation width ranging from < 10 mm to 16 mm by gross appearance and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The only animal in which probes had been spaced at intervals of 15 mm did not show evidence of irreversible ablation at 2 weeks. This may be secondary to the wider probe spacing and relatively low voltage, which results in a mostly reversible form of electroporation without cell death. ConclusionsIrreversible electroporation {{appears to be a}} safe method for pancreas tissue ablation. Staining with TTC can predict the zone of IRE ablation within 2 h of treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Kidney tissues were {{collected}} from 142 calves during a study of pre- and peri-natal mortality. Fifty-six calves had oxalate crystals in their renal tissue. Thirty-four of the 56 had either single or multiple congenital defects, mostly of the skeleton. Twenty-two of the 56 died of causes other than congenital defects. The renal oxalosis was more pronounced in those calves affected with congenital anomalies. Renal oxalosis (oxalate crystals in kidneys) results from a defect in the excretory phase of oxalate metabolism [3, 6]. In domestic herbivores, it results from ingesting excessive amounts of oxalates in plants, abnormal renal response secondary to injury, or a defect in metabolism.

Only the collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu; Tayassuidae) that inhabits the southwestern and south-central parts of the United States is native (Mayer and Brandt, 1982; Mayer and Wetzel, 1986). Feral swine (Sus scrofa) in the United States have originated from varieties of <b>domestic</b> <b>swine,</b> Eurasian wild boar, and their hybrids (Jones, 1959; Wood and Lynn, 1977; Rary et al., 1968; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991). <b>Domestic</b> <b>swine</b> {{were introduced to the}} United States as early as 750 - 1000 A. D. during the settlement of the Hawaiian Islands (Towne and Wentworth, 1950; Joesting, 1972; Smith and Diong, 1977). Christopher Columbus introduced <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> to the West Indies during the 1400 s, where they proliferated and became pests. In the 1500 s, Spanish explorers, such as DeSoto and Cortez, were the first to bring <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> to the United States mainland (Towne and Wentworth, 1950; Beldon and Frankenberger, 1977). By the 1960 s, <b>domestic</b> <b>swine</b> and Eurasian wild boar were established in 3 ̆e 20 states (McKnight, 1964). Swine introductions have intentionally or accidentally occurred by a variety of means, including: 1) translocation to establish populations for hunting, 2) escapees from shooting preserves or confinement operations, 3) avoidance of capture by domestic pigs in free-ranging livestock operations, 4) abandonment by their owners, and 5) dispersal from established feral populations (Gipson et al., 1997; Witmer et al., 2004). Feral swine are the most abundant free-ranging, exotic ungulate in the United States (McKnight, 1964; Decker, 1978) and have become widespread because of their reproductive potential and adaptability {{to a wide range of}} habitats. Like <b>domestic</b> <b>swine,</b> litter size depends on the sow’s age, nutrition, and time of year. Feral swine are capable of producing two litters per year with average litter size varying from 4. 2 to 7. 5 piglets (Taylor et al., 1998), but up to 10 piglets can be born during ideal conditions (Conquenot et al., 1996). Mayer and Brisbin (1991) and Mackey (1992) report feral swine populations in 23 states. A Southeastern Cooperative Disease Study (1994) and Nettles (1997) point out an additional 16 states with feral swine populations. An estimated population of 4 million feral swine currently occur in the United States (Pimentel et al., 2000) with the largest populations inhabiting Texas (1 to 1. 5 million; Pimentel et al., 2000), Florida (3 ̆e 500, 000; Layne, 1997), Hawaii (80, 000; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991), and California (70, 000; Barrett, 1993). Since 1965, feral swine have expanded their range from 15 (26...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de avaliar o fator de retardamento, coeficiente de dispersão-difusão e curva de efluente dos íons cálcio, magnésio, sódio e potássio das águas residuárias de origem doméstica tratada e de suinocultura, realizou-se um experimento em laboratório com colunas de solos Argissolo Vermelho Amarelo e Neossolo Regolítico. Com o auxílio de frascos de Mariotte cerca de dois volumes de poros de água destilada foram passados nas colunas; em seguida, interligou-se outro frasco contendo as águas residuárias, doméstica e da suinocultura, o que lixiviou 3, 75 volume de poros divididos em 25 alíquotas, totalizando 600 amostras. Os resultados permitiram concluir que os fatores de retardamento foram mais altos para o sódio no solo Argissolo Vermelho Amarelo e para o íon magnésio no Neossolo Regolítico, lixiviados com água residuária doméstica tratada. Em referência à água residuária da suinocultura, os maiores valores foram calculados para o íon magnésio, nos dois solos; quanto aos coeficientes de dispersão-difusão, os maiores valores foram registrados no Neossolo Regolítico, independentemente do tipo de água utilizada. With the {{objective}} of evaluating the parameters of transport retardation factor, dispersion-diffusion coefficient and effluent curves of the íons calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium, present in <b>domestic</b> and <b>swine</b> raising wastewater, an experiment was conducted in laboratory with columns of Red Yellow Argisol and Regolithic Fluvisol. With the aid of flasks of Mariotte around two pore volumes of distilled water were passed in the columns; soon after, another flask was interconnected containing the wastewaters which leached 3. 75 volume of pores divided in 25 aliqnot, totaling 600 samples. The obtained results lead to the conclussion that the retardation factors were higher for the sodium in the Red Yellow Argisol and for the magnesium in Regolithic Fluvisol leached with treated domestic wastewater. In reference to the swine raising wastewater, the largest values were calculated for the ion magnesium, in the two soils; as for the dispersion-diffusion coefficients, the highest values were observed for Regolithic Fluvisol, independent {{of the type of}} water...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} in 2009 {{of a novel}} A(H 1 N 1) v {{influenza virus}} of swine origin and the regular occurrence since 2003 of human cases of infection with A(H 5 N 1) avian influenza viruses underline the zoonotic and pandemic potential of type A influenza viruses. Influenza viruses from the wild aquatic birds reservoir usually do not replicate efficiently in humans. <b>Domestic</b> poultry and <b>swine</b> can act as intermediate hosts for the acquisition of determinants that increase the potential of transmission and adaptation to humans, through the accumulation of mutations or by genetic reassortment. The rapid evolution of influenza viruses following interspecies transmission probably results from the selection of genetic variations that favor optimal interactions between viral proteins and cellular factors, leading to an increased multiplication potential and a better escape to the host antiviral response. Whereas influenza viruses usually cause asymptomatic infections in wild aquatic birds, they may be highly pathogenic in other species. Molecular determinants of host-specificity and pathogenesis {{have been identified in}} most viral genes, notably in genes that encode viral surface glycoproteins, proteins involved in the viral genome replication, and proteins that counteract the host immune response. However, our knowledge of these numerous and interdependant determinants remains incomplete, and the molecular mechanisms involved are still to be understood...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) {{was identified}} as the etiological agent of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}}, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, <b>domestic</b> cats, <b>swine,</b> and rodents. A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs. We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge. Using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice. To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO 3 -S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO 3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV. icGD 03 -S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain. Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD 03 -S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV-challenged mice. VRP-N-induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses. This study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations. The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks...|$|R
