60|$|Old Tomah, the trapper, was abroad now, taking {{advantage}} of the spring hunger. The wolves often crossed his snow-shoe trail, or followed it swiftly to see whither it led. For a wolf, like a farm dog, is never satisfied till he knows the ways of every living thing that crosses his range. Following the broad trail Wayeeses would find here a trapped animal, struggling desperately with the clog and the cruel <b>gripping</b> <b>teeth,</b> there the flayed carcass of a lynx or an otter, and yonder the leg of a dog or a piece of caribou meat hung by a cord over a runway, with the snow disturbed beneath it where the deadly trap was hidden. One glance, or a sniff at a distance, was enough for the wolf. Lynxes do not go about the range without their skins, and meat does not naturally hang on trees; so Wayeeses, knowing all the ways of the woods, would ignore these baits absolutely. Nevertheless he followed the snow-shoe trails until he knew where every unnatural thing lay hidden; and no matter how hungry he was, or how cunningly the old Indian hid his devices, or however deep the new snow covered all traces of man's work, Wayeeses passed by {{on the other side and}} kept his dainty feet out of every snare and pitfall.|$|E
40|$|An {{expandable}} anchor assembly {{is provided}} for anchoring the threaded end portion of an elongated roof bolt in a borehole. The anchoring assembly includes a hollow outer sleeve {{in the form}} of a plurality of symmetrically arranged, longitudinal segmented wall portions with exterior <b>gripping</b> <b>teeth</b> and an inner expander sleeve {{in the form of}} a corresponding plurality of longitudinal wall portions symmetrically arranged about a central axis to define an inner threaded cylindrical section. The inner sleeve is captured within and moveable axially relative to the outer sleeve. As the threaded end portion of the elongated bolt is inserted into the inner threaded cylindrical section of the inner sleeve from the trailing end to the leading end thereof, the inner sleeve expands over and clamps around the threaded end portion of the elongated bolt. Thereafter, partial withdrawal of the elongated bolt from the borehole causes the inner sleeve to axially move relative to the outer sleeve from the leading end toward the trailing end of the outer sleeve in a wedging action to cause the outer sleeve to radially expand and force engagement of the <b>gripping</b> <b>teeth</b> against the sidewall of the borehole to thereby secure the expandable anchor assembly and therewith the threaded end portion of the elongated bolt within the borehole...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, I {{start with}} the {{somewhat}} controversial works of these researchers who propose that an association with fire, stretching back millions of years, {{played a central role}} in human evolution, resulting in many modern human adaptations and our own chain of speciation (Burton 2009, Wrangham 2009). I also describe a new mechanism for that speciation. Specifically, I propose that, for millions of years, active lava flows in the African Rift provided consistent, long term, but spatially isolated sources of fire. These burning islands in the African pyroscape provided small areas that would create very specific adaptive pressures and opportunities for very small isolated groups of hominins. Some of these episodes of isolation may have extended for hundreds of thousands of years, allowing these isolated groups of early hominins to develop adaptations that can be argued to be the result of living in proximity to fire, such as bipedalism, precision hand <b>grips,</b> smaller <b>teeth</b> and mouths, shorter intestines, larger brains, and perhaps a host of social adaptations.|$|R

Using an instrumented bar <b>gripped</b> between the <b>teeth,</b> the influence of variations in bite grip and bite-bar mass on movements of the head {{were found to be}} small up to a mass of 375 g. The repeatability of measures of seat-to-head transmissibility within a single subject and the variability in transmissibility across a group of twelve subjects have been determined with two seating conditions: a rigid seat with a backrest and the same seat with no backrest. Seat-to-head transmissibilities associated with vertical seat vibration are presented at frequencies up to 25 Hz for all six axes of head vibration both with and without a backrest. Head motion occurred principally in the fore-and-aft, vertical and pitch axes of the head. The backrest increased the magnitude of head vibration in most cases.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate tooth brushing management and ability of children in relation to age and gender. Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 45 children, who attended Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry at V. S Dental College and Hospital Bangalore. Children were divided into three groups according to age: Group I: 3 - 5 years, Group II: 6 - 8 years, and Group III: 9 - 11 years. Each child selected his/her favorite toothbrush and brushed his/her teeth under supervision of one instructor. The <b>grip</b> type during <b>tooth</b> brushing was recorded on a videotape and duration of tooth brushing also was noted. The data were analyzed in relation to the age and gender using the chi-square test. ANOVA was used to find if there is any significant difference between the mean brushing times in the different groups. Results: The results of statistical analysis showed that in all cases P&# 62; 0. 05 for grip preferences and P &# 60; 0. 001 between age groups 3 - 5 years and 9 - 11 years with respect to the mean brushing time.

40|$|The {{theme of}} dental hygiene of {{preschool}} {{children is a}} very current issue nowadays as ever growing importance is being ascribed to it. Regular and thorough removal of microbial dental plaque using appropriate technique plays an irreplaceable role {{in the prevention of}} dental caries, along with regular appointments with a dentist. The baccalaureate paper briefly maps the history and status quo of dental medicine, focusing primarily on the state of oral health of preschool children and prevention of dental caries. The theoretical chapter contains a description of teeth, the difference between temporary and permanent dentition, correct tooth cleaning technique, the frequency of tooth cleaning, and dental hygiene aids. The objective of the baccalaureate paper was to find out how and how often the nursery schools in the former district of Jindřichův Hradec attend to the dental hygiene of their pupils. Whether they are acquainted with the correct technique of tooth cleaning, the right <b>grip</b> of the <b>tooth</b> brush, and whether the subject of dental hygiene forms part of specialized lectures in these nursery schools were themes of my interest, too.

This time I leaped aside and struck downwards, and the blow fell upon his right leg and broke it, so that he could spring no more. Yet he ran at me on three feet, and, though the club fell on his side, he seized me with his teeth, biting through that leather bag, which was wound about my middle, into the flesh behind. Then I yelled with pain and rage, and lifting the Watcher endways, drove it down with both hands, as a man drives a stake into the earth, and that with so great a stroke that the skull of the wolf was shattered like a pot, and he fell dead, dragging me with him.
