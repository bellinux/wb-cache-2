25|$|In Livy’s account there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{the peace}} with the Samnites {{had been on a}} thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that Cales was in an {{important}} strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites’ southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC. The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years.|$|E
25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So {{what we have here is}} a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. Yet there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> what she did was not new.|$|E

She stated that the song is about the third person watching a happy and loving relationship: [...] "It's about lovers who appear to be happy and are living each day in their usual way. But there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> a third person is watching from a distance." [...] The song's title is loosely based on the album's title Loveppears, which was originally planned to be called [...] "Lovers Appear".|$|E
500|$|God of War: Ghost of Sparta was {{received}} positively by various media outlets. Nicole Tanner of IGN stated {{that in terms}} of gameplay, [...] "there's nothing unique here, but that's not a bad thing." [...] 1UP's Chris Pereira said that the controls are [...] "largely the same" [...] as Chains of Olympus, but it [...] "is still an extremely well-paced action game." [...] He said that it is put together so well that it is worth playing, [...] "unless you've become truly tired of the franchise". Joystiq's Randy Nelson stated that the scope of the game seems like it [...] "was planned for release on consoles", but [...] "if you were hoping for something really innovative, you're out of luck." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer stated that [...] "the other core fighting mechanics are familiar, but the tweaks {{go a long way toward}} improving gameplay". [...] stated [...] " [...] Sparta offers an immersive experience on par with many of the best PS3 games". Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the battle system as strong, however, he stated [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series" [...] and claimed that it is [...] "best enjoyed by newcomers" [...] or [...] "those yet to play" [...] God of War III.|$|E
500|$|Erika Ramirez and Andrew Hampp of Billboard {{felt that}} the song mixed [...] "uncanny" [...] styles and noted that as the chorus starts, {{listeners}} [...] "can see Beyonce singing this from the stage surrounded by smoke machines." [...] USA Today writer Elysa Gardner wrote that in [...] "Jealous" [...] along with [...] "Haunted", the singer [...] "embodies success and privilege on the surface, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> her contentment is fragile". Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci observed that the song [...] "treat relationships with the same raw instinct that suffuses her sex songs" [...] on the album. Writing for Clash magazine, Mike Diver praised Beyoncé's vocal performance noting, [...] "When Beyoncé truly unleashes her vocals on ballad-tempo moments... 'Jealous', she immediately casts long shadows over singers who might have tried to shift her from the top table of pop". Mike Wass of Idolator considered [...] "Jealous" [...] to be an update of the singer's [...] "If I Were a Boy", sung by a grown woman. He went on to praise the [...] "frank, honest and vulnerable" [...] characteristics the singer decided to showcase in the song, opposed to her other material where she was reluctant to discuss about them. Wass finished his review by noting that [...] "Jealous" [...] would be a [...] "dark horse for a radio single down the line". Brittany Spanos of The Village Voice described the song as a [...] "grown up version" [...] of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] with lyrics about [...] "persistent mistrust". Latifah Muhammad of BET deemed the song a [...] "distant cousin" [...] to [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] and stated that its turning point comes during several lines of the bridge.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} also {{received}} criticism because {{of problems with}} puzzles, weapons, and technical issues. Chains of Olympus was criticized by G4, who stated that the game [...] "occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops", {{and that some of}} the puzzles [...] "are so maddeningly difficult to solve". The game was also criticized for its lack of variety in enemies, its continued use of puzzles that require players to move boxes, and its relatively short story. God of War III also received some criticism. GameFront's Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. IGN complained about the game's weapons, and said [...] "that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large, they're more of the same." [...] Ghost of Sparta received criticism from Eurogamer, which said that the [...] "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" [...] and [...] that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series if you've played [...]" [...] Some reviewers stated that Ascensionss story was not as compelling as previous installments, with IGN stating that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, [...] "the Furies don’t quite cut it". The multiplayer received a mixed response. Although reviewers claimed gameplay translated well into the multiplayer, they were critical of the balance and depth of combat. Edge magazine approved of the multiplayer, stating it is an [...] "evolutionary step" [...] with [...] "some fine ideas ... that will form part of this genre's future template." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{described}} the track as [...] "eerie", Jason Newman from Fuse added it was suitable for softcore pornography with the singer being [...] "in her best coo". He further {{described it as}} an erotic ballad and a [...] "slow, creeping burn", noting that it sounded like Trent Reznor remixing Madonna's [...] "Justify My Love". [...] Claire Lobenfeld from Complex magazine described it as Beyoncé's version of [...] "Justify My Love". Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle {{described the}} song as [...] "ominous". Mike Wass from Idolator felt that the singer explored a new soundscape with [...] "Haunted" [...] with [...] "minimal beats hover like fog". Wass also praised Boots' production and noted that the singer declared her artistic integrity with the lyrics. In {{a review of the}} song, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times compared its break with Madonna's work during Ray of Light with a chopped and screwed sound characteristic for Houston. Melissa Locker from Time magazine stated that the lyrics of the song were one of the [...] "best humblebrags ever" [...] while also noting that they hinted at the singer [...] "dabbling in fiction". USA Today writer Elysa Gardner wrote that in [...] "Haunted" [...] along with another song on the album, [...] "Jealous", the singer [...] "embodies success and privilege on the surface, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> her contentment is fragile". Korina Lopez of the same publication stated that she seemed [...] "surprisingly in touch with the 9-to-5 grind, echoing her own career frustration". MTV News writer James Montgomery felt that Beyoncé showcased a [...] "newfound sense of self" [...] on the [...] "cold, coital" [...] song. Tim Finney of Complex magazine considered [...] "Ghost" [...] "a collision of opposites... less a song than a transfixing eye-hole glimpse into another, entirely separate world the singer could inhabit if she chose". Deeming the song a [...] "reepy mood piece", Jody Rosen of Vulture noted a lack of a music hook. In the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, [...] "Haunted" [...] was ranked at number 228.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} topographic lineament {{as described}} by Raisz is along the scarp on the northeast side of the Wallowa Mountains. [...] However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the trend of the faulting in that area turns more to the south; {{it has been suggested}} the faulting associated with the OWL takes a large step south to the Vale Fault Zone, which connects with the Snake River Fault Zone in Idaho.|$|E
2500|$|Clásico 71 [...] The [...] "4 a 1". On June 4, 2003, was {{the first}} time that Tigres and Rayados met in the {{semifinal}}s. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> whoever won this semifinal would have been the favorite for the championship. Tigres started the first game well, scoring very early 1-0, but 4 unanswered goals by Rayados turned the tide in the game and in the Semifinals.|$|R

2500|$|For {{many who}} opposed ritualism, the key concern was to defend {{what they saw}} as the {{fundamentally}} Protestant identity of the Church of England. Nor <b>was</b> this just <b>a</b> matter of an ecclesiological argument: for many, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Catholic worship <b>is</b> somehow [...] "un-English". Catholicism was deeply associated in many minds with cultural identities which, historically, many English people had commonly treated with suspicion, especially the Spanish, the French, and the Irish.|$|R
2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{qualitative}} style arguments, in the First Epistle to Timothy the task of preserving the tradition is entrusted to ordained presbyters; the clear sense of presbuteros {{as an indication of}} an office <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> to these scholars seems alien to Paul and the apostolic generation. Examples of other offices include the twelve apostles in Acts and the appointment of seven deacons, thus establishing the office of the diaconate. Presbuteros is sometimes translated as elder; by a longer route it is also the Greek root for the English word priest. (The office of presbyter is also mentioned in James chapter 5.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to domestic matters, the Review covers issues of international concern. In the 1980s, a British commentator noted: [...] "In the 1960s [...] opposed American involvement in Vietnam; more recently {{it has taken}} a line mildly Keynesian in economics, pro-Israeli but Anti-Zionist, sceptical of Reagan's Latin-American policy". The British newspaper The Independent has described the Review as [...] "the only mainstream American publication to speak out consistently {{against the war in}} Iraq." [...] On Middle East coverage, Silvers said, [...] "any serious criticism of Israeli policy will be seen by some as heresy, a form of betrayal. ... uch of what we've published has come from some of the most respected and brilliant Israeli writers ... Amos Elon, Avishai Margalit, David Grossman, David Shulman, among them. [...] What emerges from them <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> occupying land and people year after year can only lead to a sad and bad result." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics of deconstructivism {{see it as}} {{a purely}} formal {{exercise}} with little social significance. Kenneth Frampton finds it [...] "elitist and detached". Nikos Salingaros calls deconstructivism a [...] "viral expression" [...] that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement. Other criticisms {{are similar to those of}} deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism. Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer. Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.|$|E

50|$|On 18 July rumours reached Stauffenberg {{that the}} Gestapo had {{knowledge}} of the conspiracy and {{that he might be}} arrested at any time—this was apparently not true, but there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the net <b>was</b> closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another. At 10:00 on 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the Wolfsschanze for another Hitler military conference, once again with a bomb in his briefcase.|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it {{is not the end of}} the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
