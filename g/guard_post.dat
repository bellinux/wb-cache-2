5|$|Brownhills is {{situated}} on the ancient Watling Street and {{there is evidence of}} early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{played a}} part in the Civil War as the Roundheads saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a <b>guard</b> <b>post.</b> During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its large}} {{physical}} size and extensive armament, Fort Runyon {{was intended to}} be the primary fort defending the Long Bridge. Fort Jackson, located {{at the southern end of}} the bridge, received four cannon and was intended as a <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> for soldiers inspecting civilian traffic crossing the bridge and to detour any Confederate saboteurs that might attempt to destroy the bridge. To man the fort's four guns, 60 artillerymen were assigned, bringing the total garrison to 200 men.|$|E
50|$|The fort's {{artillery}} {{soldiers were}} responsible for manning the <b>guard</b> <b>posts</b> within the fort as well as serving on various duty positions on the island. Infantry troops were mainly responsible for manning <b>guard</b> <b>posts</b> along the seawall, which ran around the island. In August 1864, there were approximately 85 <b>guard</b> <b>posts</b> on the island that required about 255 men on each shift.|$|R

The security forces soon set up a <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{the role}} of the FPS officer has {{undergone}} further changes. The FPS has shifted its emphasis from the fixed <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> concept of security to a mobile police patrol and response. FPS contracts private security companies to guard fixed posts. FPS officers perform all duties attendant to the normal interpretation of a police officer function including maintaining law and order, preventing or deterring disturbances, and investigating both felonies and misdemeanors. The Civil Service Commission developed standards for FPS applicants, which included background investigations, and physical examinations.|$|E
25|$|On 9 October 2013, rebels {{seized the}} Hajanar <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> on the Jordanian border {{after a month}} of fierce fighting. Rebels were now in control of a swath of {{territory}} along the border from outside of Daraa {{to the edge of}} Golan Heights. The same day, Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite fighters, backed up by artillery, air-strikes and tanks, captured the town of Sheikh Omar, on the southern outskirts of Damascus. Two days later, they also captured the towns of al-Thiabiya and Husseiniya on the southern approaches to Damascus. The capture of the three towns strengthened the government hold on major supply lines and put more pressure on rebels under siege in the Eastern Ghouta area. On 14 October, SOHR reported that rebels captured the Resefa and Sinaa districts of Deir ez-Zor city, as well as Deir ez-Zor's military hospital.|$|E
25|$|During the Troubles, {{as part of}} its armed {{campaign}} against British rule in Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA had repeatedly used homemade mortars against targets in Northern Ireland. The most notable attack was the 1985 Newry mortar attack which killed nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The IRA had carried out many attacks in England, but had not used mortars there. However, in December 1988 items used in their construction and technical details regarding the weapon's trajectory were found during a raid in Battersea, South London by members of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch. In the late 1980s British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was top of the IRA's list for assassination, following the failed attempt on her life in the Brighton hotel bombing. Security around Downing Street had been stepped up at a cost of Â£800,000 following increased IRA activity in England in 1988, including the addition of a police <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> and security gates {{at the end of the}} street. Plans to leave a car bomb on a street near Downing Street and detonate it by remote control as Thatcher's official car was driving by had been ruled out by the IRA's Army Council owing to the likelihood of civilian casualties, which some Army Council members argued would have been politically counter-productive.|$|E

25|$|Attorney-General, Arthur Rylah, {{rejected}} a second plea to refer Ryan's {{case to the}} Full Court under Section 584 of the Crimes Act. A third attempt to save Ryan, {{in the form of}} a petition presented at the Crown Solicitor's office pleading for clemency, was also rejected. Close secrecy surrounded all government moves on the Ryan case. That evening, a former Pentridge prisoner, Allan John Cane, arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane in a new bid to save Ryan. An affidavit by Cane, which was presented to Cabinet, says he and seven prisoners were outside the cookhouse when they saw and heard a prison warder fire a shot from the No. 1 <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> at Pentridge Prison the day Hodson was shot. Police had interviewed these prisoners but none were called on at the trial to give evidence. Cane was immediately rushed into conference with his solicitor, Bernard Gaynor, who tried to contact cabinet ministers informing them of Cane's arrival. Gaynor telephoned Government House seeking an audience with the Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe. However, Gaynor was told by a Government House spokesman that nobody would be answering calls until 9am (one hour after Ryan's scheduled execution). Gaynor said Cane's mission had failed.|$|E

The entrance to the fort's headquarters building faced north, indicating that the main gate was on the north side, facing the eponymous promontory and the sea. The north wall has been lost to the sea, along with the adjoining part of the east wall {{and most of the}} west wall; the east wall is most complete and includes the remains of the eastern gateway and <b>guard</b> <b>post.</b> Parts of the surviving walls are all that remains of the fort above ground, and all have suffered from stone-robbing, especially near the south-western corner. The walls were originally faced with ragstone, but very little of this remains: otherwise only the cores of the walls are visible, consisting mostly of flint and concrete and standing only [...] high at their highest.|$|E

500|$|On 19 October 1943, Operation Reinhard was {{terminated}} by {{a letter from}} Odilo Globocnik. The following day, {{a large group of}} Jewish Arbeitskommandos who had worked on dismantling the camp structures over the previous few weeks were loaded onto the train and transported, via Siedlce and CheÅm, to SobibÃ³r to be gassed on 20 October 1943. Franz followed Globocnik and Stangl to Trieste in November. Clean-up operations continued over the winter. As part of these operations, Jews from the surviving work detail dismantled the gas chambers brick-by-brick and used them to erect a farmhouse {{on the site of the}} camp's former bakery. Globocnik confirmed its purpose as a secret <b>guard</b> <b>post</b> for a Nazi-Ukrainian agent to remain behind the scenes, in a letter he sent to Himmler from Trieste on 5 January 1944. A Hiwi guard called Oswald Strebel, a Ukrainian Volksdeutscher (ethnic German), was given permission to bring his family from Ukraine for [...] "reasons of surveillance", wrote Globocnik; Strebel had worked as a guard at Treblinka II. He was instructed to tell visitors that he had been farming there for decades, but the local Poles were well aware of the existence of the camp.|$|E
500|$|Second Lieutenant Leslie Averill, the {{intelligence}} officer for 4th Rifle Battalion, continued {{to investigate the}} defences. He was able to locate a route to {{a section of the}} ramparts that appeared unmanned and was not under fire from the defenders. He was ordered by Barrowclough to force an approach. With the benefit of covering mortar fire, Averill and a platoon of the battalion reserve company, managed to cross the moat and found themselves at the inner ramparts. With the aid of a [...] ladder supplied by the Divisional Engineers, Averill was able to ascend {{to the top of the}} ramparts, closely followed by the platoon commander. With his revolver, Averill fired at two Germans manning a <b>guard</b> <b>post,</b> forcing them to cover, and the rest of the platoon joined him. With an entrance through the defenses secured, Barrowclough and the rest of the battalion used the ladder and entered the town shortly afterwards. [...] At the same time, a party from 2nd Rifle Battalion, seized the gate guarding the road into Le Quesnoy from Valenciennes and began entering the town from the north; subsequently, the Germans quickly surrendered.|$|E
500|$|On 25 July 1830, {{the king}} signed the Ordinances of Saint-Cloud, {{removing}} the franchise {{from the middle}} class and dissolving the Chamber of Deputies. The decrees were published the following day. On 27 July, Parisians erected barricades throughout the city, and riots erupted. In defiance, the Chamber continued to meet. When Lafayette, who was at La Grange, heard what was going on, he raced into the city, and was acclaimed as a leader of the revolution. When his fellow deputies were indecisive, Lafayette went to the barricades, and soon the royalist troops were routed. Fearful that the excesses of the 1789 revolution were about to be repeated, deputies made Lafayette head of a restored National Guard, and charged him with keeping order. The Chamber was willing to proclaim him as ruler, but he refused a grant of power he deemed unconstitutional. He also refused to deal with Charles, who abdicated on 2 August. [...] Many young revolutionaries sought a republic, but Lafayette felt this would lead to civil war, and chose to offer the throne to the duc d'Orleans, Louis-Philippe, who had lived in America and had far more of a common touch than did Charles. Lafayette secured the agreement of Louis-Philippe, who accepted the throne, to various reforms. The general remained as commander of the National Guard. This did not last longâthe brief concord at the king's accession soon faded, and the conservative majority in the Chamber voted to abolish Lafayette's National <b>Guard</b> <b>post</b> on 24 December 1830. Lafayette went back into retirement, expressing his willingness to do so.|$|E

2500|$|The {{uprising}} {{began when}} the flagpole was cut down {{for the fourth time}} at dawn on Tuesday 11 March 1845.
