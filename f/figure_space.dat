Two features {{are added to the}} organization of the sequential file to arrive at this third file organization type. One additional feature is an index to the file to provide better random access; the other is an overflow area to provide a means to handle additions to the file. Figure 3 - 6 shows a particular example of an indexed-sequential file. We find in this figure the three important components: the sequential file, the index, and the overflow area.

40|$|The {{origins of}} the hot solar corona and the supersonically {{expanding}} solar wind are still {{the subject of much}} debate. This paper summarizes some of the essential ingredients of realistic and self-consistent models of solar wind acceleration. It also outlines the major issues in the recent debate over what physical processes dominate the mass, momentum, and energy balance in the accelerating wind. A key obstacle in the way of producing realistic simulations of the Sun-heliosphere system is the lack of a physically motivated way of specifying the coronal heating rate. Recent models that assume the energy comes from Alfven waves that are partially reflected, and then dissipated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, have been found to reproduce many of the observed features of the solar wind. This paper discusses results from these models, including detailed comparisons with measured plasma properties as a function of solar wind speed. Some suggestions are also given for future work that could answer the many remaining questions about coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ability to}} control the crystallographic {{orientation}} of both the seed layer and the electroplated copper grains is important in obtaining highly reliable Cu interconnects for ultra-large scale integration (ULSI) circuitry. One of the factors controlling film texture is the roughness of the deposition surface. In this paper the effects of dielectric roughness on the crystallographic texture of physical vapor deposited (PVD) copper seed layers and, subsequently, on the texture of electroplated (EP) copper have been investigated. Six relevant interlevel dielectric materials were examined: tetraethyloorthosilicate (TEOS), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), silane oxide, silicon nitride, SiLKTM (from the Dow Chemical Corporation), and polysilicon were deposited on 200 mm (001) Si wafers. The RMS surface roughness of these dielectric layers, measured by AFM, ranged from 0. 32 nm to 20. 51 nm. Texture was analyzed on a dedicated x-ray diffractometer equipped with a two dimensional detector collecting incomplete pole figures with a 1. 0 degree resolution in pole <b>figure</b> <b>space.</b> The orientation distribution functions (ODF) were calculated using the arbitrary defined cells method and the volume fractions of major fiber texture components were derived from the ODF. The predominant texture components of the PVD and EP copper were (111) and (511) fiber. It {{was found that the}} volume fraction of (111) fiber decreased as the dielectric surface roughness increased. One exception was with the SiLKTM dielectric, which produced significantl...|$|E

In a field study design with sales trainings, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the effects of spaced compared with massed practice on transfer quantity and quality, sales competence, and key <b>figures.</b> Design/methodology/approach <b>Spaced</b> and massed training are compared using behavioral and outcome criteria. A quasi‐experimental follow‐up research design with a sample of 64 bank employees (n= 32 in each training group) is used. Findings Spaced rather than massed training practice resulted in greater transfer quality, higher self‐reports of sales competence, and improved key <b>figures.</b> <b>Spaced</b> training did not surpass massed training in terms of transfer quantity. Research limitations/implications The present study is the first to demonstrate positive effects of technical training on job involvement, and of coaching on job satisfaction. In sum, validity of several developmental interventions is highlighted. Practical implications Organizations designing and implementing various developmental interventions should pay attention to the relative effectiveness of these interventions on various organizational‐relevant outcome criteria.

In this review we discuss mechanisms of magnetic field amplification due to instabilities induced by CRs. We derive CR kinetic and magnetohydrodynamic equations that govern cosmic plasma systems comprising the thermal background plasma, comic rays and fluctuating magnetic fields to study CR-driven instabilities. Both resonant and non-resonant instabilities are reviewed, including the Bell short-wavelength instability, and the firehose instability. Special attention is paid to the longwavelength instabilities driven by the CR current and pressure gradient. The helicity production by the CR current-driven instabilities is discussed in connection with the dynamo mechanisms of cosmic magnetic field amplification.

40|$|To {{reproduce}} the weak magnetic {{field on the}} polar caps of the Sun observed during the declining phase of cycle 23 poses a challenge to surface flux transport models since this cycle has not been particularly weak. We use a well-calibrated model to evaluate the parameter changes required to obtain simulated polar fields and open flux {{that are consistent with}} the observations. We find that the low polar field of cycle 23 could be reproduced by an increase of the meridional flow by 55 % in the last cycle. Alternatively, a decrease of the mean tilt angle of sunspot groups by 28 % would also lead to a similarly low polar field, but cause a delay of the polar field reversals by 1. 5 years in comparison to the observations.
