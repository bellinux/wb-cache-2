5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort Wayne, and connected to the Wabash River. This new canal made water transport possible from New Orleans to Lake Erie on an <b>internal</b> <b>route</b> rather than sailing around {{the whole of the}} Eastern United States and entering through Canada. Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} WMATA's <b>internal</b> <b>route</b> designations, the Blue Line service travels along the {{entirety}} of the J Route (from the terminus at Franconia-Springfield to the C & J junction just south of King Street), part of the C Route (from the C & J junction just south of King Street to Metro Center), part of the D Route (from Metro Center to the D & G Junction just east of Stadium-Armory) and the entire G Route (from the D & G junction past Stadium-Armory to the terminus at Largo Town Center). The Blue Line needs 23 six-car trains (138 rail cars) to run at peak capacity.|$|E

500|$|What is now NY 129 was {{developed}} in the early 20th century as part of a general project to improve access and transportation across the reservoirs. In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route2, an unsigned legislative route (an unsigned <b>internal</b> <b>route)</b> extending from the New York City line at Yonkers to the Columbia County village of Valatie. Route2 initially followed modern NY129, Croton Avenue, and NY35 between Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill; however, it was realigned on March1, 1921, to use what is now NY9A instead. NY129 was designated to most of its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally followed Croton Dam Road, the southern perimeter road around the New Croton Reservoir, while Croton Lake Road, the northern route, was designated as NY131 by the following year. The alignments of NY129 and NY131 {{in the vicinity of the}} reservoir were swapped [...] and the NY131 designation ceased to exist by the mid-1940s. With the route changes, NY129 was extended to terminate at NY100 at a traffic circle in Pines Bridge while NY118 terminated near Croton Lake. This extension lasted for over two decades until NY118 was extended over the alignment of NY129 to the traffic circle by 1969.|$|E

2500|$|The blood {{does not}} come into {{direct contact with the}} parenchymal cells and tissues in the body (except in case of an injury causing rupture of one or more blood vessels), but {{constituents}} of the blood first exit the microvascular exchange blood vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact with the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid that is formed when interstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system. The lymph is then moved along the lymphatic vessel network by either intrinsic contractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic compression of the lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g., the contractions of skeletal muscles), or by lymph hearts in some animals. The organization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body into external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the head, limbs, and body cavity walls follows an external route, and the lymphatic drainage of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cavities follows an <b>internal</b> <b>route.</b> [...] Eventually, the lymph vessels empty into the lymphatic ducts, which drain into one of the two subclavian veins, near their junction with the internal jugular veins.|$|E

50|$|Ladeco began {{operations}} in 1958 flying mostly <b>internal</b> <b>routes</b> between Chile's major cities and some international routes, {{and continued to}} run services until 1994 when LanChile (currently called Latam Chile) bought over 99% of the shares and merged Ladeco into its fleet. At the time of takeover, Ladeco was equipped mainly with Boeing 737 aircraft {{as well as some}} Boeing 727s and Boeing 757s. Ladeco then became exclusively an internal carrier between Chilean cities. Its name has since disappeared and most <b>internal</b> <b>routes</b> are covered by an affiliate of LAN Airlines called LAN Express. The airline's fleet included 20 Boeing 737-200, 7 Boeing 727, 4 BAC-111, 4 Boeing 707, 6 Douglas DC-6 B, 2 Boeing 757, 2 Douglas DC-8, 1 Airbus A300, 2 Boeing 737-300 and two Fokker 27 500 aircraft (Reg.

In 2010, a curve {{just east of the}} Route 32 intersection was reconstructed in front of the town's high school to take out the sharp curve that had originally been there, which placed the road slightly north of where it had originally been. The length of Route 319, however, has not been changed.|$|E

50|$|A few {{aircraft}} of {{this series}} entered service with French airlines in the 1920s. The main operator was Farman's own airline Lignes Farman who operated five aircraft between Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. Lignes Aeriennes Latécoère used the aircraft to operate passenger and mail routes between Casablanca and Dakar and also from Algiers to Biskra. Other operators used the aircraft on French <b>internal</b> <b>routes.</b> The Polish operator Aero acquired five F.70s in 1925.|$|R
50|$|The airline Noble Air {{was founded}} in 1989 by a joint British/Turkish company and in the {{beginning}} concentrated on charter flights from London to Turkey.
