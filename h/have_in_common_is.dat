5|$|Love darts, {{also known}} as {{shooting}} darts, or just as darts, are shaped in many distinctive ways which vary considerably between species. What all the shapes of love darts <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> their harpoon-like or needle-like ability to pierce.|$|E
25|$|What most touch pieces <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> {{that they}} have to be touched or in close {{physical}} contact for the power concerned to be obtained and/or transferred. Once this is achieved, the power is permanently present in the coin, which effectively becomes an amulet.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the efforts}} are truly {{synthetic}} but in others a precursor molecule found in nature is included. The key data are collected below. What all strategies <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> synthesis of the baccatin molecule followed by last stage addition of the tail, a process (except for one) based on the Ojima lactam.|$|E
50|$|Another {{feature the}} Amiga and Commodore 64 {{versions}} <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> {{the ability to}} add POKEs, or cheats. They also had a system for finding pokes called a Pokefinder, or trainer.|$|R
5000|$|... ǂ’Amkoe had {{previously}} been lumped in with the Tuu languages, perhaps over confusion with the dialect name ǂHȍȁn, {{but the only thing}} they <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>are</b> typological features such as their bilabial clicks.|$|R

25|$|Many machine models {{different}} from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models {{can be converted to}} another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> that the machines operate deterministically.|$|E
25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> {{a sense of}} the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E
25|$|What tribunals all <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> {{that they}} are created by statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E
5000|$|Quasi-criminal {{proceedings}} {{include a}} wide variety of matters, including prosecution for a violation of law or ordinance, psychiatric matters, motor vehicle law, status offenses, family court actions, and equity proceedings such as a Writ.

40|$|The paper briefly {{characterizes the}} two known {{terrestrial}} meteorite craters on trapp rock: (1) Lonar, India (diameter 1, 8 km) and Logancha, USSR (diameter 20 km). The features these craters <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>are</b> identified, and their differences from problems on {{other types of}} targets are indicated. The probable reasons for these differences are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Having {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Arista the sessions {{were the first}} recordings the band made for Virgin Records. They worked with producer Steve Hillage, who was a guitarist in the progressive rock band Gong. One thing Hillage and Simple Minds <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> a love of krautrock music. The band's previous three albums were produced by John Leckie.|$|R
25|$|Another protein, aequorin, {{found in}} certain jellyfish, {{produces}} blue {{light in the}} presence of calcium. It can be used in molecular biology to assess calcium levels in cells. What these biological reactions <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> their use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source. Though the structure of the molecules that produce luminescence is different for each species, they are given the generic name of luciferin. Firefly luciferin can be oxidized to produce an excited complex. Once it falls back down to a ground state a photon is released. It is very similar to the reaction with luminol.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{noticed that the}} {{elements}} in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron's are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, {{all of the other}} elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron's reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that all do <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and electrical insulator at room temperature, but a good conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E
50|$|Another {{point the}} three artists <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> their {{technical}} expertise. Like the Abstract Expressionists they were painterly, treating the paint itself {{and not just}} its color as a meaningful element, and they often experimented with new media. Zerbe helped revive the ancient Egyptian medium of encaustic, a mixture of pigment and hot wax, in the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|An earlier organization, Mensa International, {{was founded}} by Roland Berrill and Lancelot Ware, who noted from their first {{conversation}} that although they came from different backgrounds, {{they were able to}} communicate and <b>had</b> much <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> They hypothesized that what they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> intelligence, and decided to see if a society of people selected for intelligence (using the only means available, IQ tests) would also <b>have</b> much <b>in</b> <b>common.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Khatik {{are widely}} {{distributed}} community in North India, and each Khatik group, {{has its own}} origin myth. What they <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> that they were historically kshtriyas who were assigned to kill animals in yagas performed by kings.Also today,only khatiks has right to kill animals during bali offerings at Hindu temples. According to their traditions, the god Brahma assigned to them a goats skin, the bark of trees and lac- so they could graze cattle, dye skins of goat, and deer; and tan hides with bark and lac. Another tradition, claims that {{the origin of the}} word Khatik has been derived from the Hindi word khat, which, means an immediate killing. They relate this to early days when they used to supply mutton to the kings of Rajasthan. While other sources claim that the word khatik is said to have originated from the Sanskrit word kathika, which means to butcher or hunter.|$|E

Potter said that choosing to cover [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was easy {{because she is}} [...] "big-voiced". She elaborated: [...] "As I was watching the video, I was watching for the visual candy. Then I slowly began {{falling in love with}} the song."

50|$|In the 20th century, Catholic {{political}} movements became {{very strong in}} Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Ireland, France and Latin America. What these movements <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> a defense of the acquired rights of the Catholic Church (attacked by anticlerical politicians) and a defense of Christian faith and moral values (threatened by increasing secularization). Members of opposing schools of thought called such attempts clericalism.|$|R
50|$|Millennial Women is a 1978 {{science fiction}} anthology, edited by Virginia Kidd, {{in which all}} the stories are written by women and have a female {{character}} as the primary protagonist.

50|$|What {{most of the}} Lear sitcoms <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> {{that they}} were shot on {{videotape}} in place of film, used a live studio audience, and dealt with {{the social and political}} issues of the day. Maude, while reputedly based on Lear's wife, was actually the brainchild of series writer Charlie Hauck; however, Frances herself would acknowledge that the show's title character was based on her.|$|R

Carol wonders why Geico—an auto insurance company—has multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz [...] "Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear."

2500|$|The {{advent of}} air travel {{provided}} Puerto Ricans with an affordable and faster way of travel to New York. [...] The {{one thing that}} most migrants <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>was</b> that they wanted {{a better way of}} life than was available in Puerto Rico, and although each held personal reasons for migrating, their decision generally was rooted in the island's impoverished conditions as well as the public policies that sanctioned migration.|$|R
