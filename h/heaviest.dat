Here, we show a similar correlation for human muscle fibers (myosin <b>heavy</b> chain IIb>myosin <b>heavy</b> chain IIa≫myosin <b>heavy</b> chain I), suggesting isoform-specific differences between the kinetics of force-generating power strokes.

We explore the ramifications of a proposed symmetry that relates <b>heavy</b> diquarks to doubly <b>heavy</b> mesons.
