Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of <b>hot</b> <b>tea</b> on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks <b>hot</b> <b>tea</b> without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E
25|$|Many {{flavourings}} {{are added}} to varieties of tea during processing.

A great range of modern flavours {{have been added to}} these traditional ones. In eastern India, people also drink lemon tea or lemon masala tea. Lemon tea simply contains <b>hot</b> <b>tea</b> with lemon juice and sugar. Masala lemon tea contains <b>hot</b> <b>tea</b> with roasted cumin seed powder, lemon juice, black salt and sugar, which gives it a tangy, spicy taste.

500|$|A {{proud and}} practising Muslim, daily namāz and fasting during Ramadan were {{integral}} to Kalam's life. [...] His father, the imam of {{a mosque in}} his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children. His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled: [...] "Every evening, my father A.P. Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with <b>hot</b> <b>tea</b> and discuss the issues concerning the island." [...] Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in [...] "dialogue and cooperation" [...] among the country's religious, social, and political leaders. Moreover, since Kalam believed that [...] "respect for other faiths" [...] was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: [...] "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Landale {{also took}} part in the debates on the [...] "Young Plan" [...] during his service in the two Councils. The plan was named after the Governor of Hong Kong Sir Mark Young, who {{unveiled}} it in 1946. One of the major proposals as recommended in the plan was to establish a Municipal Council that would have a certain number of elected seats. Nevertheless, as the public opinion at the time could not agree on the breadth and depth of the constitutional reform, the plan was stalled for more than two years. It was already March 1949 when Landale moved a motion in the Legislative Council to revive the debate on the [...] "Young Plan". In the debate, he criticised the government for deliberately slowing down the pace of constitutional reform. He described the government as the [...] "Dormouse", a character in the novel Alice in Wonderland, which would wake up to disclose {{a little bit more about}} the whole story only when the [...] "Hatter" [...] pours <b>hot</b> <b>tea</b> upon its nose. Landale agreed that constitutional reform was needed for Hong Kong, but instead of supporting the [...] "Young Plan", he believed that reforming the Legislative Council would be a more practical alternative than setting up the Municipal Council. In June the same year, another unofficial member of the Legislative Council, Lo Man-kam, proposed his own reform plan, in which he argued that there should be more unofficial seats in the Legislative Council and some of these seats should be elected. This plan gained the support of all the unofficial members, who had by that time already made themselves clear that they opposed the [...] "Young Plan". Yet, having considered the regional instability and the lukewarm response from the general public, Young's successor, Sir Alexander Grantham, concluded that it was not an appropriate time to implement the reform plan. He particularly feared that Hong Kong would be drawn into the political row between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang if there was a constitutional reform. Finally, the British government told the Parliament in October 1952 that except for increasing the number of elected seats in the Urban Council, no major constitutional reform would take place in Hong Kong.|$|E
