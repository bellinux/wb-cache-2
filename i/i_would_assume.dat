No insiders. None outcast. Finally, and far more idiosyncratically, in Part IV I explore and expand on Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s thesis in light of a modestly serious and rather public dispute over religious equality that occurred at the College of William and Mary during my presidency there. A disagreement over the display of religious symbols in a public university, to my surprise, echoed more in traditional claims of equality and privilege than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>assumed.</b> <b>I</b> am candid in claiming that my own experiences suggest, perhaps unfortunately, that Nussbaum is rather acutely on to something {{when it comes to the}} central meaning of the protection of religious liberty in a diverse and democratic culture.

Of course as we see, the ruling kind usually reserved the right on the name raja and took affront to another cousin using the title while a raja was in power and complained, but then again, Ravi Varma in reality had some self-projection in mind, as we note.

40|$|I {{have never}} given {{much thought to}} where the {{rainwater}} collected from the roof goes. If pressed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>assumed</b> that it was piped {{into one of the}} many Victorian drains which take the runo from the moors safely away from the house. If pressed further <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have given that answer a high probability of being correct, using a process of elimination (where else could it go?). I now know that I was spectacularly wrong. A previous owner had piped this water directly into the septic tank; a practice which is both illegal and likely to cause problems as the tank is not designed to be swamped by excess water. (For the uninitiated, many old houses on the moors are not connected to a mains drainage network, so dirty water from the house is collected in a tank where the solids settle out, and then the grey water is treated in a soakaway.) We had to renew our soakaway and decided to replace it with a reed bed and living soakaway. The rainwater is now diverted into a new pond, which will undoubtedly be a topic of a future article. This puts me in mind of Donald Rumsfeld's comment at a press brie ng in 2002 when he was US Defense Secretary (since I disagree with so much that Rumsfeld did and stood for it pains me to use this quote, but it is a wonderful statement) : There are known knowns. There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don't know. To which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> add There are mistaken knowns. There are things we think we know, that we do not know. One such mistaken known, for me, is in my understanding of the legal concept of guilt `beyond a reasonable doubt'.
