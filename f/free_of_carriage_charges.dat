Mupirocin ointment has been used intranasally to eradicate S. aureus carriage in health human volunteers and health care workers. Chlorhexidine, an antiseptic with excellent antistaphylococcal activity, is widely used for handwashing and skin cleansing. METHODS: Anterior nares cultures were obtained from patients older than 18 years who were undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Patients with S. aureus nasal carriage {{were enrolled in the}} study. Axillae and groins were cultured. Patients were given mupirocin ointment intranasally twice per day for 7 days and chlorhexidine body scrubs daily for the first 3 days.

RESULTS: One day after completion <b>of</b> treatment nasal <b>carriage</b> was eradicated in 83 % of patients (15 / 18).

30|$|Dielectric {{properties}} of ionic composites consisted of cadmium octanoate matrix and semiconductor or metal nanoparticles have been investigated. The nanoparticles of different nature (semiconductor CdS, metal Au, and metal core-semiconductor shell Au-CdS) were chemically synthesized in the smectic A phase of (Cd+ 2 (C 7 H 15 COO)âˆ’ 2, CdC 8) {{that was used}} as a nanoreactor. These nanocomposites are very stable and well ordered; {{the size and shape of}} the nanoparticles (NPs) are well controlled during the synthesis. The main aim of the research was to examine the influence of nanoparticles on the dielectric {{properties of}} ionic matrix, which has smectic A ordered structure. Electrical characteristics were investigated at different temperatures, which correspond to different phases of the material. The conductivity of nanocomposites has an activation nature. The electrical conductivity anisotropy confirms the structural anisotropy of the nanocomposites. The conductivity of the nanocomposite along the cation-anion layers is higher by 2 orders of magnitude than that across the cation-anion layers. Basing on the experimental data, we proposed the simple model <b>of</b> the <b>charge</b> <b>carriage</b> process.|$|R

60|$|But {{the result}} might be, that {{the fall of}} price might not have an effect exactly equal, on the demand in the two countries. Suppose, for instance, that the fall of cloth in Germany owing to the saving of the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> did not {{increase}} the demand for cloth in Germany; but that the fall of linen in England from a like cause, did increase the demand for linen in England. The linen imported {{would be more than}} could be paid for by the cloth exported: the difference must be paid in money: the change in the distribution of the precious metals between the two countries would lower the price of cloth in England, (and consequently in Germany), while it would raise the price of linen in Germany, (and consequently in England). Germany, therefore, by the annihilation <b>of</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> would save in price more than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the cloth; England would save less in price than the cost <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> the linen.

40|$|Understanding how {{changes in}} {{antibiotic}} consumption affect {{the prevalence of}} antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is important for public health. In a number of bacterial species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, the prevalence of resistance has remained relatively stable despite prolonged selection pressure from antibiotics. The evolutionary processes allowing the robust coexistence of antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains are not fully understood. While allelic diversity can be maintained at a locus by direct balancing selection, {{there is no evidence}} for such selection acting in the case of resistance. In this work, we propose a mechanism for maintaining coexistence at the resistance locus: linkage to a second locus that is under balancing selection and that modulates the fitness effect of resistance. We show that duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> plays such a role, with long duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> increasing the fitness advantage gained from resistance. We therefore predict that resistance will be more common in strains with a long duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and that mechanisms maintaining diversity in duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> will also maintain diversity in antibiotic resistance. We test these predictions in S. pneumoniae and find that the duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> a serotype is indeed positively correlated with the prevalence of resistance in that serotype. These findings suggest heterogeneity in duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> is a partial explanation for the coexistence of sensitive and resistant strains and that factors determining bacterial duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> will also affect the prevalence of resistance...|$|R
