25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep</b> {{at the time}} of the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of}} the murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E

Featuring musical contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover of the Platters' [...] "Only You (And You Alone)", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's [...] "No No Song", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The John-written [...] "Snookeroo" [...] failed to chart in the UK, however, when issued there as the second single from the album. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, [...] "Don't You Remember When", and he inspired another De Paul song, [...] "If I Don't Get You the Next One Will", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep</b> in his office.|$|E

500|$|On May 29, 2017, Woods {{was arrested}} near Jupiter, Florida by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office at about 3:00 am EDT for {{driving under the}} {{influence}} of alcohol or drugs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep</b> in his car, which, although running, was stopped in a traffic lane. [...] He later stated that he was taking drugs prescribed to him and did not realize how they might interact together. On July 3, 2017 Tiger tweeted that he had completed an out of state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue. On August 9, 2017, Woods, who skipped his arraignment, entered a not guilty plea through his attorney Douglas Duncan and agreed to take part in a first time DUI offender program and hold another arraignment on October 25. At a hearing on October 27, Woods pled guilty to reckless driving. He received a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service along with regular drug tests, and was not allowed to drink alcohol during his time of probation. If he violated his probation, he would have been sentenced to 90 days in jail with an additional $500 fine.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep.</b> But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

2500|$|Captain Joseph Hazelwood, who {{was widely}} {{reported}} to have been drinking heavily that night, {{was not at the}} controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep</b> in his bunk. In light of the other findings, investigative reporter Greg Palast stated in 2008, [...] "Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled {{for more than a year}} before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate." [...] Exxon blamed Captain Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker.|$|E
2500|$|On March 21, 2005, Weise killed {{nine people}} before killing {{himself in a}} murder–suicide.

2500|$|The accuser's mother, Janet Arvizo, {{testified that}} on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she [...] "saw Michael licking Gavin's head" [...] while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep.</b> Before she testified about it, {{she turned to the}} jury and said, [...] "please don't judge me." [...] Jackson {{allegedly}} had an arm around the boy and licked his hair [...] "over and over" [...] while everyone else on the plane was asleep. Janet said she didn't tell any one what she'd seen, and she continued to let her children stay at Neverland, and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident, she still didn't have [...] "any concerns about Mr. Jackson at all". Star contradicted his mother when he testified that he had been awake to also witness Jackson lick Gavin's head on the plane; he didn't say anyone was asleep, just that the accuser was not feeling well and had leaned against Jackson's chest. Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant on that flight, said she had not seen Jackson [...] "cuddling" [...] with Arvizo during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson put his arm around the accuser while he was listening to music.|$|E

2500|$|The escaped terrorist, Mas Selamat Kastari, {{who escaped}} {{detention}} in Singapore in 2008, was nabbed by Bukit Aman and Johore Police while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep</b> in a secluded village house in Skudai, [...] northwest of Johor Bahru, Johore. He found a traditional kampung house on stilts in Kampung Tawakal, a tiny village {{with a population}} of less than 100. Located about 10km away from the North-South Expressway near the Kempas exit, {{it is almost impossible to}} locate for those not familiar with the area. The Singaporean terrorist, who captured world attention when he escaped from the republic's maximum security Whitley Detention Centre in February last year, could barely put up a fight in his shorts and T-shirt when caught during a dawn raid in April. At 6am, about 30 armed policemen surrounded the kampung house and ordered Mas Selamat to come out. Police broke through two doors and rushed in when he refused to surrender. He was arrested together with two others, Abdul Matin and Johar Hassan, by a PGK and police Special Branch officers following intelligence sharing with the police forces of Indonesia and Singapore. Police also seized documents and other paraphernalia that allegedly revealed their planned operation. This report was later confirmed by both the Singapore and Malaysian governments, with the date of capture given as 1 April 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Bu Zhi and Wei Jing {{settled in}} Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡), where they {{encountered}} an influential landlord, Jiao Zhengqiang (焦征羌), who allowed his retainers to behave lawlessly. As Bu Zhi and Wei Jing feared that Jiao Zhengqiang would seize {{the plot of}} land on which they farmed, they decided to offer him some of their produce as tribute. When they arrived at his residence, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep</b> {{so they had to}} wait outside. After some time, Wei Jing became impatient and wanted to leave, but Bu Zhi stopped him and said, [...] "We came here because we feared he would seize our land. If we come here to visit him and then leave without even meeting him, he might think that we're insulting him and we'll only end up antagonising him." [...] After a while, Jiao Zhengqiang woke up, saw them through the window, and instructed his servants to lay mats on the ground for them to sit outside while he remained indoors. Wei Jing was enraged but Bu Zhi remained calm and composed. When it was time for lunch, Jiao Zhengqiang feasted on tasty dishes and did not invite them to join him. Instead, he had scraps of food served to them in small bowls. Wei Jing, who received only vegetables and mushrooms, was so unhappy that he did not eat at all. In contrast, Bu Zhi finished all the food he got. They then bid farewell to Jiao Zhengqiang and left. Wei Jing later scolded Bu Zhi, [...] "How can you put up with this?" [...] Bu Zhi replied, [...] "We're of lowly status. He treated us in a manner befitting our status. What's there to be ashamed of?" ...|$|E
2500|$|McCreight next saw the Colonel in {{the main}} {{dining room of the}} Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was {{surprised}} at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about {{at the end of the}} long trail.” [...] McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>asleep,</b> but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped him to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” [...] Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.|$|E
