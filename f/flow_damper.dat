40|$|The {{driving and}} damping {{mechanism}} of plasma flow {{is an important}} issue because flow shear has a significant impact on turbulence in a plasma, which determines the transport in the magnetized plasma. Here we report clear evidence of the <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> due to stochastization of the magnetic field. Abrupt damping of the toroidal flow associated with a transition from a nested magnetic flux surface to a stochastic magnetic field is observed when the magnetic shear at the rational surface decreases to 0. 5 in the large helical device. This <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> and resulting profile flattening are much stronger than expected from the Rechester-Rosenbluth model. The toroidal flow shear shows a linear decay, while the ion temperature gradient shows an exponential decay.

40|$|Abstract. The {{physics of}} a locked {{magnetic}} island chain maintained in the pedestal of an H-mode tokamak plasma by a static, externally generated, multi-harmonic, helical magnetic perturbation is investigated. The non-resonant harmonics {{of the external}} perturbation are assumed to give rise to significant toroidal <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> in the pedestal, {{in addition to the}} naturally occurring poloidal <b>flow</b> <b>damping.</b> Furthermore, the <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> is assumed to relax the pedestal ion toroidal and poloidal fluid velocities to fixed values determined by neoclassical theory. The resulting neoclassical ion flow causes a helical phase-shift to develop between the locked island chain and the resonant harmonic of the external perturbation. Furthermore, when this phase-shift exceeds a critical value, the chain unlocks from the resonant harmonic, and starts to rotate, after which it decays away, and is replaced by a helical current sheet. The neoclassical flow also generates an ion polarization current {{in the vicinity of the}} island chain which either increases or decreases the chain’s radial width, depending on the direction of the flow. If the polarization effect is stabilizing, and exceeds a critical amplitude, then the helical island equilibrium becomes unstable, and the chain again decays away. The critical amplitude of the resonant harmonic of the external perturbation at which the island chain either unlocks or becomes unstable is calculated as a function of the pedestal ion pressure, the neoclassical poloidal and toroidal ion velocities, and the poloidal and toroidal <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> rates.

40|$|A four-field {{system of}} {{equations}} which includes the neoclassical <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> effects and the lowest-order finite-Larmor-radius (FLR) corrections is deduced from a system of gyrofluid equations. The FLR corrections to the poloidal <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> are calculated by solving a simplified version of the gyrokinetic equation. This {{system of equations}} {{is applied to the}} study of a chain of freely rotating magnetic islands in a tokamak, resulting from the nonlinear evolution of a resistive tearing mode, to determine the islands rotation velocity consistently with the fields radial profiles close to the resonant surface. The island rotation velocity is determined by imposing the torque-balance condition. The equations thus deduced are applied to the study of two different collisional regimes, namely the weak-damping regime and the intermediate damping regime. The equations reduce, in the weak damping regime, to a form already obtained in previous works, while an additional term, containing the lowest order FLR corrections to the poloidal <b>flow</b> <b>damping,</b> appears in the intermediate damping regime. The numerical integration of the final system of equations permits to determine the dependence of the island rotation velocity on the plasma collisionality and the islands width compared to the ion Larmor radius.

Rosenbluth and Hinton(R-H) have shown that the zonal flow level is inversely proportional to the plasma radial polarizability due to magnetic drift departure from a flux surface. In another calculation, Hinton and Rosenbluth (H-R) considered the weakly collisional case in the banana regime and calculated the neoclassical polarization and associated zonal <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> in the high frequency and low frequency limits. The work presented here extends R-H's calculation in several aspects. We calculate the neoclassical polarization for arbitrary radial wavelength zonal flows so that finite ion banana width and ion gyroradius are retained. We also add plasma shape effects into the R-H collisionless calculation and find the influence of elongation and triangularity on neoclassical polarization and zonal <b>flow</b> <b>damping.</b> In addition, we extend the H-R collisional calculation using an exact eigenfunction expansion of the collision operator to calculate neoclassical polarization for the entire range of frequencies.

The calculation involves the self-consistent determination of the pressure and scalar electric potential profiles {{in the vicinity of}} the associated magnetic island chain, which allows the chain's propagation velocity to be fixed. Two regimes are considered.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The noise {{problem in}} air {{conditioning}} systems is receiving ever increasing attention because {{of the importance of}} noise on a comfortable human environment. Some work has been done on the solutions to the noise problem by an investigation of a few system elements. The acourstical characteristics of dampers become more important with the present tendency to use high air velocity in the air distribution system, but this element has not been investigated. The experimental study presented here concerns the attenuation characteristics of the duct section and damper, and noise generation characteristics of a conventional single -blade damper and two proposed airfoil dampers with solid and perforated surfaces respectively. Air velocity in the duct, degree of damping, size, and damper configuration were chosen as variables for this study. During the performance of this experiment, two important preliminary studies were done on the characteristics of an acoustic plenum chamber and microphone windscreens. Because of the limited fan capacity available, the construction of an acoustic plenum chamber with acceptable performance was necessary. Because {{of the importance of the}} wind noise effect on noise measurement, the construction of a satisfactory windscreen was needed. In the study of noise attenuation without air flow, perforated airfoil dampers were found to be most effective in general. But, as the <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> increases, the effectiveness decreases at high frequencies. At high frequencies, the single -blade dampers were found most effective. Since high frequency noise control is much easier and more inexpensive than low frequency noise control, the airfoil damper is favorable as far as the attenuation without air flow is concerned. The attenuation spectrum did not change much at the middle frequency range regardless of the type of damper, and the degree of <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> was found to be the most significant variable in changing the attenuation spectrum. The rate of change of attenuation with respect to damper position was not a linear function for any damper. The attenuation for the perforated airfoil damper was not sensitive to changes in damper position or configuration. The results on noise generation showed that increasing the <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> causes high noise generation. This result was most evident for single -blade dampers. The increase in <b>flow</b> <b>damping</b> made the spectra smoother for all dampers tested. There existed a frequency range where the noise generation was most sensitive to the damper setting. The sound level distribution of the generated noise level was high at low frequency and low at high frequency, so the noise generation results in a problem of low frequency noise control. An increase in air velocity resulted in higher levels of noise generation, but this did not influence noise generation as strongly as the degree of damping. A result of this work showed that it might be possible to improve the acoustical characteristics of dampers by combining desirable property of both solid and perforated airfoil dampers. An airfoil damper with perforated surface on the upstream side and solid surface on the downstream side could show better acoustical properties. Further research on the acoustical properties of other types of dampers and other system elements should be done in the near future. The design criteria necessary to improve the aerodynamic air flow patterns should be a parallel study. Much research will be necessary to provide the engineering profession with the additional information needed to achieve a more comfortable human environment through better air conditioning design...|$|R
