5000|$|Taxi Shoulder Markings Taxiways, <b>holding</b> <b>bays,</b> and aprons are {{sometimes}} provided with paved shoulders to prevent blast and water erosion.

50|$|The sun's {{light is}} partly shining into the <b>holding</b> <b>bay,</b> the {{temperature}} {{at a crucial}} level. The technicians find melted metal that makes it necessary to drill in order to remove some components. The disarming is completed, {{the rotation of the}} city is restarted, Karger reverses his decision regarding a D&D on Earth II's nuclear weapons status, and the bomb is launched toward the Sun for disposal.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Lisa Karger (Hartley) doesn't {{want the}} bomb aboard, and is alarmed at Frank's intent to {{initiate}} a D&D on Earth II becoming a nuclear power. When someone tells her one way {{to dispose of the}} bomb is to fire it at the Sun, she blows the hatch cover on the <b>holding</b> <b>bay,</b> waits for the Sun to come into the view, and launches the bomb at it. The Earth's gravitational pull is greater however, and the bomb falls toward the Earth and will detonate over the Great Lakes region.|$|R

50|$|Lister, Kryten, Kochanski and the Cat make it (or rather, {{they think}} they've made it) to a <b>holding</b> <b>bay</b> and sneak aboard a Blue Midget; however, the {{attractive}} controller tells the Cat he needs clearance. In order {{to prove that}} he is capable of handling the ship, as well as impressing the woman, he begins an impromptu dance routine with Blue Midget as his partner. Amazingly, this ploy works and the flight controller agrees to a date with the Cat who is more than ready to stay behind and get ready before Lister forces them to leave.|$|R
50|$|The tug {{operator}} retrieves the warhead, but {{not before}} the warhead's casing disintegrates in the Earth's atmosphere. The bomb is brought back and put into the same <b>holding</b> <b>bay,</b> and station rotation is slowed {{as much as possible}} while a crew works to permanently deactivate the bomb. The city is still rotating enough to bring the Sun into view through the opening and the temperature is rising, threatening to melt safeties and detonate the bomb. A pilot takes a tug out and puts its nose against one of the main struts of the city, then fires its engines to stop rotation altogether.|$|R
5000|$|Misaki, in the <b>holding</b> <b>bay,</b> is seen screaming, {{and moving}} her stick handles {{that control the}} arms of the rampart armor up and down. The Specular image of the GHOUL is seen walking towards the rampart armor. The GHOUL opens its mouth, and blood is shown in it. Misaki sees visions of what {{happened}} to Luxandra, before, during, and after her murder by the GHOUL. The GHOUL is seen about to punch a hole through the RA (Rampart Armor), when an enraged Misaki, in near GHOUL form, catches itwith her hand, and turns the GHOUL to stone, killing it.|$|R

30|$|Despite anonymisation of {{patients}} and surgeons {{for the purposes of}} the study, only just over one half of all laparoscopic surgeries performed during the study period were examined. Reasons for this include a high turnover of theatre staff in the <b>holding</b> <b>bay</b> of theatre, as well as difficulty ensuring that surgeons completed the datasheets following emergency surgeries at night. As completion of the datasheet was voluntary, we did not anticipate data from all laparoscopic entries. However, because we had decided to anonymise the datasheet so that neither the patient nor the surgeon could be identified, we would have been glad of a greater recruitment of cases. There is a chance that more difficult laparoscopic entry cases or even entry complications were not recorded.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Public {{transportation}} plays a {{key role}} to socio-economic development of any nation. This service enhances people’s livelihood framework by facilitating mobility and accessibility to services. Moreover, there is clear global evidence that a well performing public transport is an important enabler of sustained economic prosperity. Rapid urbanization in developing countries has resulted in transport facilities and infrastructure failing to cope with demand resulting in congestion, movement delays, high travel costs, and construction of <b>holding</b> <b>bays</b> in order to decongest the city, which will contribute to an increased usage of non-renewable energy. This prompts implementation of non-comprehensive strategies such as partial deregulation of transportation systems that caused further deterioration in economic sustainability. An economically sustainable transport system advocates for mobility, resource, and operational efficiency. This research focuses on developing a bus investment conceptual framework of a public transport system that improves mobility, resource, and operational efficiency to aid in sustaining of public transportatio...|$|R
5000|$|This {{unit was}} {{designed}} for salvage missions {{at the bottom of}} the deepest oceans—while Stark's conventional suits function underwater, they were noisy, inefficient, and they leaked. The exact composition is unknown; it is assumed to be composed of the same layered [...] "flex-metal" [...] micro-scale suit tiles fabricated by genetically engineered metal-affinity bacteria which assemble themselves in specific orderly arrays and then expire, leaving behind various metallic deposits which form all the metal shapes and micro-electronic circuits. A new aligned-crystal production process allowed the construction of a large, semi-spherical headpiece, as transparent as glass. This unit possessed several ocean-specific weapons, such as the electric field of an electric eel, a camouflage 'ink cloud' and small 'manta ray' torpedoes. It also comprised an inner [...] "Escape Suit" [...] that could be jettisoned from the main suit in case of emergency (this inner suit possessed a Unibeam, 2 torpedoes, and the <b>holding</b> <b>bay).</b> Functions were controlled by cybernetic interface.|$|R

50|$|E. L. Evans House is a {{historic}} home located at South Boston, Halifax County, Virginia. It was built in 1892, and is a large two-story, five bay, balloon-frame High Victorian style dwelling.

5000|$|The GHOUL, materializing in the core, {{shoots a}} blast of energy so powerful, it is off the charts of the Skeleton Crew's power reader. A part of Watcher's Nest {{along with a few}} laser posts are obliterated. Lyar Von Ertiana's rampart is {{partially}} damaged, and she loses contact with everyone one of the soldiers except Kiri. Lyar relays instructions for both of them to accelerate into the core. Meanwhile, Luxandra, is shown unconscious in her rampart armor {{on the surface of the}} core, back on the surface. She wakes up, and gains her surroundings. She is able to move the arm of the rampart armor, as she tries to get back up. A shadowed object is shown walking towards the rampart armor, none other than the GHOUL. It is shown trying to break in, while Luxandra is screaming. The GHOUL breaks in, and begins to eat her alive. The picture taken with all 4 of them together is covered in blood, and the blood that drips off of the rampart armor splashes onto her face, blotting her out of the picture. The GHOUL leaves the scene, and the Specular soon appears in the <b>holding</b> <b>bay</b> of the rampart armors.|$|R

The 20-3 win gave Green Bay an 11-4 record and secured the Packers a spot in the playoffs.|$|R
