5|$|On 11 January 2010, {{shortly before}} an {{announcement}} that Red Football's debt had increased to £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United announced {{their intention to}} refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £500million. They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with a coupon rate of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with a coupon rate of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the carving out of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year in January, 1897 again in Baltimore, the railroad was reorganized into the Frederick and Northern Railroad Company. At that time, {{it was reported}} that the predecessor line was barely able to cover operating expenses and rarely turned a profit. It never earned the <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on its bonds, (Frederick city was the largest bondholder) and {{at the time of its}} foreclosure, the unpaid interest exceeded the principal. In March 1897, this new company was itself merged with other Pennsylvania-controlled railways (Littlestown Railroad Company and the Hanover and York Railroad Company) into the York, Hanover and Frederick Railroad Company, chartered under the general laws of Pennsylvania and Maryland.|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer {{purchased}} the 28.7percent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd {{in a highly}} leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800million (then approx. $1.5billion). Once the purchase was complete, the club {{was taken off the}} stock exchange. In July 2006, the club announced a £660million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30percent reduction in annual interest payments to £62million a year. In January 2010, with debts of £716.5million ($1.17billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509million owed to international banks. The annual <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on the bonds – which mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the [...] "Red Knights", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} countries, the {{majority}} investors were not individuals but institutions and large corporations. Industries, university endowments, local banks and even city governments were the prime {{investors in the}} war bonds. In part because of intense public pressure and {{in part due to}} patriotic commitment the bond drives proved extremely successful, raising approximately [...] marks in funds. Although extremely successful the war bond drives only covered two-thirds of war-related expenditures. Meanwhile, the <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on the bonds represented a growing expense which required further resources to pay it.|$|E

60|$|It came in my {{thoughts}} one morning that I {{would go to}} the bank myself, where I had often been to receive the interest of some bills I had, which had <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on them, and where I had found a clerk, to whom I applied myself, very honest and just to me, and particularly so fair one time that when I had mistold my money, and taken less than my due, and was coming away, he set me to rights and gave me the rest, which he might have put into his own pocket.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} the war, the <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on her debt {{amounted}} to upwards of seven millions sterling. M. de la Verdy, the last hope of the French finances, was called in, to aid in the reduction of an interest, so light to our author, so intolerably heavy upon those who are to pay it. After many unsuccessful efforts towards reconciling arbitrary reduction with public credit, he was obliged to go the plain high road of power, and to impose a tax of 10 per cent upon a very great part of the capital debt of that kingdom; and this measure of present ease, to the destruction of future credit, produced about 500,000l. a year, which was carried to their Caisse d'amortissement or sinking fund. But so unfaithfully and unsteadily has this and all the other articles which compose that fund been applied to their purposes, that they have given the state but very little even of present relief, since it is known to the whole world that she is behindhand on every one of her establishments. Since the year 1763, there has been no operation of any consequence on the French finances; and in this enviable condition is France at present with regard to her debt.|$|E
60|$|The {{only fair}} comparison, {{as it seems}} to me, which can be drawn between the two {{countries}} with reference to their debts, and the condition of each under its debt, should be made to depend on the amount of the debt and probable ability of the country to bear that burden. The amount of the debt must be calculated by the <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on it rather than by the figures representing the actual sum due. If we debit the United States government with seven per cent. on all the money borrowed by them, and presume that amount to have reached in July, 1863, the sum named by Mr. Spaulding, they will then have loaded themselves with an annual charge of 16,800,000 pounds sterling. It will have been an immense achievement to have accomplished in so short a time, but it will by no means equal the annual sum with which we are charged. And, moreover, the comparison will have been made {{in a manner that is}} hardly fair to the Americans. We pay our creditors three per cent. now that we have arranged our affairs, and have settled down into the respectable position of an old gentleman whose estates, though deeply mortgaged, are not over mortgaged. But we did not get our money at three per cent. while our wars were on hand and there yet existed some doubt as to the manner in which they might be terminated.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the market town is unknown, {{due to a lack}} of documents. It is thought that the first {{settlers}} were subjected to a tax from a local Prince, and that it refers to the <b>interest</b> rate <b>payable.</b> These farms were handed down through the generations, locally referred to locally as yards, with locals later referred to as the Lords of Irdning.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving native {{questions}} for the present, we must now return to the general affairs of the country. When President Burgers opened the special sitting of the Volksraad, on the 4th September, he appealed, it will be remembered, to that body for pecuniary aid to liquidate the expenses of the war. This appeal was responded to by the passing of a war tax, under which every owner of a farm was to pay 10 pounds, the owner of half a farm 5 pounds, and so on. The tax {{was not a very}} just one, since it fell with equal weight on the rich man, who held twenty farms, and the poor man, who held but one. Its justice or injustice was, however, to a great extent immaterial, since the free and independent burghers, including some {{of the members of the}} Volksraad who had imposed it, promptly refused to pay it, or indeed, whilst they were about it, any other tax. As the Treasury was already empty, and creditors were pressing, this refusal was most ill-timed, and things began to look very black indeed. Meanwhile, in addition to the ordinary expenditure, and the <b>interest</b> <b>payable</b> on debts, money had to be found to pay Von Schlickmann's volunteers. As there was no cash in the country, this was done by issuing Government promissory notes, known as [...] "goodfors," [...] or vulgarly as [...] "good for nothings," [...] and by promising them all booty, and to each man a farm of two thousand acres, lying east and north-east of the Loolu mountains; in other words, in Secocoeni's territory, which did not belong to the Government to give away. The officials were the next to suffer, and for six months before the Annexation these unfortunate individuals lived as best they could, for they certainly got no salary, except in the case of a postmaster, who was told to help himself to his pay in stamps. The Government issued large numbers of bills, but the banks refused to discount them, and in some cases the neighbouring Colonies had to advance money to the Transvaal post-cart contractors, who were carrying the mails, as a matter of charity. The Government even mortgaged the great salt-pan near Pretoria for the paltry sum of 400 pounds, whilst the leading officials of the Government were driven to pledging their own private credit in order to obtain the smallest article necessary to its continuance. In fact, to such a pass did things come that when the country was annexed a single threepenny bit (which had doubtless been overlooked) was found in the Treasury chest, together with acknowledgments of debts to the extent of nearly 300,000 pounds.|$|E

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 28). Internship {{is an integral part}} of BBA program. The objective of this program is to expose the students to organizational work environment. I got an opportunity to go through such a program. I was assigned to work as an intern in Janata Bank Limited- Mohammadpur Corporate Branch. The report is on “An enquiry into the financial feasibility of Janata Bank Limited, Mohammadpur Corporate Office”. The 1 st part of this report is concerned with my overall experience with this branch. The 2 nd part stands for the analysis. My focus was to answer how the branch is generating as well as increasing profit. Being a bank, it is supposed to do so by concentrating on banking activities. Non-banking activities are not considered to be avoided but the bank should not pay more attention to it than its core banking activities. The data represents year 2012, 2013 and 2014. Initially in 2012, total income consisted of more portion generated by banking activities. It was 53 %. After that, the total income has been made more from profit generated by non-banking activities. In my analysis part, I have taken the weighted average interest receivables on loans and weighted average <b>interest</b> <b>payables</b> on deposits. It is evident that, this branch takes on more deposits than it gives loans. For example, in the last year, total deposits taken were Tk. 235. 21. 66, 971 and total loans made were only Tk. 61, 82, 09, 510. However, the interest spreads were positive. Interests paid on deposits hold the largest portion of expenses. In my analysis, Midterm loans hold the highest portion for interest receivables (58 %- 92 %). Similarly, Weighted Average <b>Interest</b> <b>payables</b> for Midterm deposits are the largest. Midterm deposits have greater weights every year. After all the analysis, it can be said that, this branch is profitable but since 2012, it has been increasing it’s profit through non banking activities. It has been more focused on the wholesale funding. The reasons behind such attempt could be lacking of creditworthy client, interest in easy money making without default risk etc. Erham Ebne Abdur RahmanB. Business Administratio...|$|R

50|$|Unlike a {{traditional}} hire purchase, where the customer repays the total debt in equal monthly instalments over {{the term of}} the agreement, a PCP is structured so that the customer pays a lower monthly amount over the contract period (usually somewhere between 24 and 48 months), leaving a final balloon payment to be made {{at the end of}} the agreement.
