40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{deals with}} {{cryogenic}} treatment and cryogenic treatment combined with nitriding of hot working tool steels. Unlike traditional steel cold treatment generally {{conducted at the}} temperatures of about- 70 °C for several hours, cryogenic treatment at the temperature of about minus- 180 °C for several dozen hours was performed. Basing on a dilatometric and differential thermal analysis (DTA) the authors made an attempt to explain the process of changes resulting from cryogenic treatment. In addition, the authors, basing on test results, discussed comparatively the effect of cryogenic treatment on the resistance to wear at high temperatures and on the hot working tool steel hardness. The presented results confirm the rise of material durability of <b>drop</b> <b>forging</b> <b>dies</b> after cryogenic treatment or nitriding combined with cryogenic treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{efficiency}} of forging processes is significantly {{influenced by the}} tool and scrap costs which in their turn depend on the life time of <b>forging</b> <b>dies.</b> The tools used for hot forging are subject to process-related high mechanical, tribological, chemical and thermal-cyclic loads which usually interact with each other. In comparison to other manufacturing methods, the resulting load spectrum leads to extensive wear and thus {{to the failure of}} <b>forging</b> <b>dies</b> after a short tool life. To increase the wear resistance of <b>forging</b> <b>dies,</b> duplex treatments consisting of plasma nitriding and plasma deposition techniques were used to improve the surface properties and hence to increase the die life time. By basic investigation of the wear mechanisms the potentials of newly developed vanadium doped chromium nitride and boron containing titanium nitride coating systems were investigated.
