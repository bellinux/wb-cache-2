5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this <b>equation</b> <b>is</b> invariant under translations and rotations (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this <b>equation</b> <b>is</b> given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC.

5|$|The {{first term}} {{on the right}} hand side of the {{induction}} <b>equation</b> <b>is</b> a diffusion term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out.

5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified <b>equation</b> <b>is</b> a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré <b>equation</b> <b>is</b> an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
