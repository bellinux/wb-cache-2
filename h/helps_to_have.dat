25|$|Following the openers is the No. 3 or one-drop batsman. His {{job is to}} {{take over}} from the openers and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle down and it <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting against the best bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|E
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

Greenblatt said, [...] "The story outline called for making it a really great marching band sequence, and it usually <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the music ahead of time to board to, so we started searching around." [...] The writers {{were able to find}} music, as Nickelodeon has a library of royalty-free music. The writers listened to various marching band tunes. Greenblatt said, [...] "and the more we heard, it didn't seem terribly funny that the finale was just them playing marching band music well." ...|$|E
500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a bit of}} prayer in your back pocket. At {{the end of the}} day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E

She then took up canoeing, {{training at the}} Hamburg Canoe Club. [...] "From basketball", she said [...] "I learned to always have the sight set for a big goal. If something doesn’t turn out how it should, it’s {{not the end of}} the world. But it always <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a goal set in front of you." [...] According to her coach, Jens Kröger, [...] "It’s easy to motivate her. She’s fighting to reach a training target. She never gives up.” Her hard work paid off. Not only did she earn national team selection, but on 24 May 2105 she won silver in the women's KL1 200 m race at the 2015 ICF Canoe Sprint World Cup in Duisburg in a personal best time of 59.981 seconds, her first time below the one-minute mark. On 19 May 2016 at the 2016 ICF Canoe Sprint World Cup in Duisburg, she went one better, winning gold despite capsizing her canoe that morning during warm up.|$|E

2500|$|Some basic conventions, such as (1) that animal/human homolog (ortholog) pairs {{differ in}} letter case (title case and all caps, respectively) and (2) that the symbol is {{italicized}} {{when referring to}} the gene but nonitalic when referring to the protein, are often not followed by contributors to public health journals. Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only subject-matter experts (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among non-SMEs is that some official gene names have the word [...] "protein" [...] within them, so the phrase [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the gene) and [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the protein) are both valid. The AMA Manual gives another example: both [...] "the TH gene" [...] and [...] "the TH gene" [...] can validly be parsed as correct ("the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although {{it is easier to}} understand when explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) [...] "happens to use the same letter string" [...] that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase [...] "happens to" [...] implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it <b>helps</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of fact-checking as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call p53 protein [...] "TP53" [...] in humans or [...] "Tp53" [...] in rats, most authors call it [...] "p53" [...] in both (and even refuse to call it [...] "TP53" [...] if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, TP53, and may even do so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.|$|E
