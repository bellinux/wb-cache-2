Throughout his life, {{he wrote}} over 100,000 Chinese {{characters}} in the Han Shi Zhangju (韓詩章句) as a detailed commentary to Han Ying's version of the Classic of Poetry. However, he never accepted any student/apprentice(s) so he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to inherit his legacy.|$|E
25|$|Negative dialectics {{comprises}} {{a monument}} {{to the end of the}} tradition of the individual subject as the locus of criticism. Without a revolutionary working class, the Frankfurt School <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to rely on but the individual subject. But, as the liberal capitalist social basis of the autonomous individual receded into the past, the dialectic based on it became more and more abstract.|$|E
25|$|Spaniards: They were {{farmers and}} had trades {{that were in}} low demand. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in France who was {{interested}} in them. They were a burden for the French government and therefore they were encouraged, {{in agreement with the}} Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in Irún. From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for purification according to the Law of Political Responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|Geera, {{who was now}} {{the only}} child left on their {{escarpment}} home, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to play with and {{no one to talk}} to as her father was often away. Geera spent all day sitting, hunched over and watching the camps of the local Aboriginals and looking out to sea to her five sisters. Eventually she turned to stone, dust and leaves building up around her until she became a part of the escarpment. She is known today as Mount Keira.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in {{the fall}} of 1887, Willcox and Reid, after garnering {{interest}} in their fellow students throughout the year, helped Virginia put its first regularly organized team in the field. But in these early days they had <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to play. Fortunately, Pantops Academy, a boys' school founded just up the road from the UVA Grounds, agreed to a game on November 13, 1887. After playing to a scoreless tie, a rematch was scheduled for March 1888. The historic first touchdown was scored by quarterback Herbert Barry and the University won 26–0.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} decades after Reconstruction, when white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures, they began to make voter {{registration}} more complicated, to reduce black voting. With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites.|$|E

25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth hit {{his second}} quick knock against Glamorgan in a week, taking 71 runs off 37 balls to lift Somerset Sabres to a victory at Taunton. Along with Keith Parsons making 57 off 28, {{they made a}} dent in the theory that spinners are useful in Twenty20 cricket, as {{experienced}} off-spinner Robert Croft was dispatched for 50 runs in four overs. The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four, and Somerset made a total of 212 for 3. In reply, the visitors <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to pass 30 once Mike Powell went, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.|$|E
25|$|The fallout was swift. Gardiner, Higgs and Russell {{resigned}} from Cabinet {{and issued a}} press statement giving {{their views on the}} situation, which cleared the usually pro-government censors because Higgs temporarily held the Defence portfolio, due to George Pearce's absence in Western Australia, so Hughes was unable to prevent its publication. The government was threatened with collapse, with four of the nine members of the First Hughes Ministry having quit. The publicity about Hughes' peremptory move and its consequences was a disaster, coming {{on the eve of the}} poll, and the veneer of a unified and strong government under Hughes was destroyed. Hughes, distraught and overwrought, called the Governor-General at midnight, saying he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else to talk to, and the two men in the wee-hours of the morning, with Lord Novar offering sympathy and support to his old colleague, but ultimately both understood that the cause was probably lost.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Washington drove into the Bears red zone and sent their special teams unit to attempt a 35-yard field goal. Backup quarterback Jay Schroeder, who was the holder on the play, called an audible for a fake field goal, but due the roaring crowd at Soldier Field, his {{receivers}} didn't hear the call. As a result, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to throw to after the snap, and slipped on the 25-yard line while trying to run for a first down. Chicago then took over {{and drove to the}} Washington 14-yard line. But with just over nine minutes left in the game, McMahon's pass was intercepted by Barry Wilburn in the end zone. Later on, McMahon was intercepted again, this time by Dennis Woodberry at the Chicago 43. Three plays later, Washington attempted to put the game away with a quarterback sneak on fourth and inches, but Williams was stopped short with 1:13 left, giving the Bears one last chance to drive for a winning score. However, the Redskins defense again rose to the occasion, forcing Walter Payton out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker on fourth down and 8.|$|E

Accordingly, when the gold coin bill became law, Longacre apprised Patterson that he was ready to begin work on the gold dollar. The Mint Director agreed, and after viewing a model of the head on the obverse, authorized Longacre to proceed with preparation of dies. According to Longacre, ...|$|E

She thought maybe she could be that person. He also began to pressure her to join the Nation of Islam. In mid 1956, Sanders converted. Like many members of the Nation of Islam, she changed her surname to [...] "X", which represented the family name of her African ancestors that she could never know.|$|E

500|$|Conteh {{now found}} himself {{in the middle of a}} war zone, {{starving}} and homeless. He wandered about for several months and finally came to Kenema where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because [...] "they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to help them". Due to the war, most experts familiar with Lassa fever had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment. The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only Lassa fever isolation ward in the world. Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post. It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because they were afraid of catching Lassa fever. When the civil war ended in 2002, the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country.|$|E
