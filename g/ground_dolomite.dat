40|$|An area of Pinus radiata D. Don {{with extreme}} {{magnesium}} deficiency in southern Kaingaroa State Forest {{was treated with}} a mixture of <b>ground</b> <b>dolomite</b> (CaC 03. MgC 03) and Epsom salts to supply 100 kg Mg/ha. Recovery in tree appearance and growth was slow but by 2 years after treatment a strong response was noticeable. Over a 5 -year period trees treated with dolomite (750 kg/ha) and Epsom salts (200 kg/ha) grew 66 % more in height and 45 % more in diameter than untreated trees. Biomass determinations 5 years after fertiliser application showed that treated trees had taken up 29 kg Mg/ha more than untreated trees. Although magnesium was probably the major growth-limiting nutrient at this site, the particular amendments used to remedy the deficiency included other nutrients (calcium and sulphur) that may have been in short supply. The dolomite component may also have affected soil dynamics by its liming action. Slight boron deficiency was induced in the magnesium-treated pines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} grinding time on the production of submicron dolomite by using the impact and abrasion technique of high energy planetary ball mill. It is known that grinding process leads to surface activation other than exhibiting particle size reduction. Most of the energy applied during the process will be dissipated as heat {{that could lead to}} harmful effects to the structural pattern of the ground material. Thus in order to study the detrimental effects of grinding towards submicron <b>dolomite,</b> sample was <b>ground</b> at 400 rpm speed with various grinding time; 0. 5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 10 h and 20 h. It was confirmed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) method that the crystalline structure of dolomite did not deform even after 20 h of grinding time, thus maintained its crystallinity. The morphological structures of ungrind and <b>ground</b> raw <b>dolomite</b> were shown by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) morphology...|$|R
40|$|Lime is an {{important}} and versatile chemical used {{in a wide range}} of applications. The term lime, which is strictly calcium oxide (CaO), is applied to a range of products arising from the processing of limestone and dolomite. Many less developed countries do not have adequate lime production and this leads to problems associated with under-utilisation of lime. In particular, insufficient application of agricultural lime (aglime) can lead to soil acidification, with associated aluminium / manganese toxicity and poor crop yields. As part of the UK Government’s commitment to provide technical assistance to developing countries, a project was initiated to help solve this problem. The BGS / Department for International Development (DFID) project “Local development of affordable lime in Southern Africa” (R 6492) aimed to encourage the development of low-cost lime for agriculture and water treatment. As part of the project, carbonate resources were matched with appropriate lime production technology to provide a methodology for the establishment of local production units. This document is a compilation of reports, including the project deliverables. It is a companion document to the project summary report (WC/ 98 / 21). The project was undertaken in collaboration with the Zambian Geological Survey Department (GSD) and Intermediate Technology Zimbabwe (ITZ). It focused on aglime production in Zambia, following the recommendations of a recent survey of the lime industry of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region (AUSTROPLAN, 1990). The project was divided into three main activities: 1) 	Lime evaluation programme 2) 	Small-scale lime production research 3) 	Dissemination The aim of the lime evaluation programme was to identify carbonate resources suitable for use as lime close to the point of need. A ‘market survey’ was carried out to determine the demand for lime, its quality, quantity and where it is most needed. The findings indicated that Zambia has a suppressed demand for aglime, especially in the northern provinces and those provinces more heavily cultivated. Aglime consumption is held back by its poor availability and relatively high cost. A review of the carbonate resources of Zambia identified numerous dolomitic carbonates that are potentially suitable for the production of aglime. Most of the carbonates occur in the Basement Complex and the Katanga Supergroup, along the line of rail from Livingstone up to the Copperbelt and North-Western provinces, as well as smaller deposits in Luapula, Northern and Eastern provinces. Appropriate laboratory evaluation test methods were identified to determine the properties that are critical for the effective use of limestone and dolomite as aglime, as follows: i) 	Plant nutrient content, especially calcium and magnesium oxide content ii) 	Neutralising ability, important for amelioration of soil acidity iii) 	Particle-size distribution, a principal factor in controlling the effectiveness of aglime iv) 	Agronomic effectiveness, the rate at which aglime reacts to neutralise soil acidity v) 	Ease of pulverisation (or grindability), {{an important}} factor in the production of <b>ground</b> limestone and <b>dolomite</b> A carbonate-sampling programme resulted in the collection of 35 samples from approximately 20 sites across Zambia. All the samples were evaluated, firstly for their mineralogy and major element chemistry at the BGS, and secondly for their plant nutrient content, neutralising ability, agronomic effectiveness and ease of pulverisation at the GSD. The test results were used to “screen” the samples, those with Neutralisation Values higher than 80...|$|R
40|$|The paper reports results {{achieved}} in the first 30 years of a 45 -year-old field trial for fertilization and liming set up on acid sandy brown forest soil in the Nyírség region. The site was poor in all five major nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg). The following conclusions could be drawn: Fertilizer responses were time dependent. In the 1 st decade of the experiment N alone increased the potato and rye yields. In the 2 nd decade, the yield on N-plots declined near to control. In the studied last few years, the yields on N-plots were negligible, the soil lost its fertility and became leached and very acid. To maintain or increase the yields of crops NPKCaMg fertilization was needed. Fertile plots have a pH (KCl) 5. 5 - 6. 0, 120 - 150 mg/kg ammoniumlactate-soluble P 2 O 5 and K 2 O in ploughed layer and require the application of about 150 kg N and 1 t/ha <b>ground</b> <b>dolomite</b> yearly.

40|$|Forest liming has {{received}} increased {{attention in the}} 1980 s, when unusual needle yellowing and fall were observed in large parts of Europe and North America. This ‘new forest decline’ {{has been attributed to}} several causes acting individually or synergetically, amongst which were acidification, N saturation and nutritional imbalances. This time, liming did not aim at increased productivity, but as a counteracting measure to the soil acidification and to remove nutritional imbalances. 	The Belgian Ardennes were not exempt from this phenomena and symptoms of forest dieback were reported in 1983 by Weissen (Weissen et al., 1983). Soils are naturally poor in magnesium and the observed dieback {{was supposed to be the}} consequence of increased pollution exacerbating the deficiency in magnesium. A reduction in productivity and financial losses were predicted. Liming was suggested for prevention and correction, however possible side effects, in particular on soil solution (tree nutrition) and stream water chemistry (drinking water) needed to be evaluated. 	In this paper, we present results from a case study in four Picea abies watersheds in southern Belgium. The paired watersheds of approximately 80 ha were situated in the ‘Haute Ardenne’ and in the ‘Ardenne occidentale’ regions, on acid brown soils. One watershed of each pair was limed with 3 T/ha of fine <b>ground</b> <b>dolomite</b> ((Ca,Mg) CO 3) 55 / 40 and 200 kg/ha K 2 SO 4 in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Rainfall, throughfall and monolith lysimeter soil solution were analysed at monthly intervals, and runoff chemistry at two-weekly intervals (volume-weighed reconstructed daily samples). Time series intervention analysis was used as a tool to detect statistically significant changes in stream water chemistry due to the liming event, and fluxes were calculated to evaluate losses of the applied dolomitic lime to the catchment stream. 	Dolomite dissolution distinctively affected streamwater chemistry in the watershed situated in the Hautes Ardennes (Waroneu). Magnesium concentrations increased immediately after liming, most likely due to surface runoff. Four years after liming, concentrations were still higher than prior to liming. However, the proportions of magnesium lost were relatively low compared to the dose applied. Calcium concentrations did not change after liming in either catchment, nor did the concentrations of the major cations and anions measured. In the monolith lysimeters, magnesium concentrations increased immediately after liming under the organic horizons, and one year after liming under the mineral horizons. Calcium concentrations increased only three years after the application of lime under the organic and mineral horizons. These results led to the conclusions that for the soils under study and the doses applied, a major part of the lime was retained by the soil system, and that consequences on water chemistry were minor...|$|E
40|$|The {{reversible}} {{absorption of}} CO 2 by CaO at high temperature is a promising method for capturing and removing CO 2 from a hot gas stream. The main challenge facing {{the use of}} this method is the deterioration of CO 2 absorption capacity when the method is applied over a large number of CO 2 absorption/desorption cycles. Although various techniques have been proposed for improving the cyclic stability and performance of calcium based sorbents, a cost effective method is still needed for industrial applications. Therefore, two promising methods for improving the cyclic stability were selected for further investigation. One method is to optimize the preparation conditions applied to various particle sizes of CaO precursors while the second method involves incorporating an inert material, MgO, in the sorbent. While applying the first method, it was discovered that the absorption capacity and stability of a sorbent derived from limestone is dependent on many factors including the initial calcination atmosphere, temperature and time as well as particle size. It was found that both the absorption capacity and stability were greater for a sorbent derived from 11 ym limestone particles than for one derived from a much coarser material. It was also found that by calcining the 11 ym limestone at 1000 oC for 1 hr in 50 vol% CO 2, the resulting sorbent had an initial absorption capacity of 7 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent which only declined to 6. 3 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent over 80 cycles of CO 2 absorption/regeneration. A sorbent prepared by calcining calcium acetate at 1000 oC for 1 hr in an atmosphere containing from 50 to 100 % CO 2 exhibited the highest absorption capacity among the materials tested. It was also reasonably stable over 40 cycles tested. One of the most promising sorbents was prepared from plaster of Paris (calcium sulphate hemihydrate) by treating the material with a cyclic oxidation/reduction process at 1070 oC. This sorbent exhibited an increasing trend in absorption capacity throughout a 200 cycle test of CO 2 absorption and desorption. For the second method for improving the cyclic stability of the sorbent, small amounts of MgO were incorporated in a sorbent as an inert diluent and structural stabilizer. It appeared that addition of MgO improved the performance of the sorbent in some cases depending on both the source of MgO and calcination conditions. However, this method did not seem to offer an advantage over the use of dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) alone, especially when the particle size of the dolomite was reduced by grinding so that it was more nearly comparable to that of the 11 ym limestone. A sorbent prepared by calcining the <b>ground</b> <b>dolomite</b> at 1000 oC for 1 hr in N 2 had an absorption capacity in excess of 8 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent over 80 cycles of CO 2 absorption/desorption...|$|E
40|$|Forest liming has {{received}} increased attention since the 1980 s, when unusual needle yellowing and fall {{were observed in}} large parts of Europe and North America. This ‘new forest decline’ {{has been attributed to}} several causes acting individually or in synergy, amongst which were 'acid rain', nitrogen saturation and nutritional imbalances. Liming at moderate doses was suggested as a counteracting measure against soil acidification and to remove nutritional deficiencies. Another major forest management operation is whole tree harvesting. Both liming and clearcut may however affect the water quality leaving the treated areas. In particular, nitrate leaching is of major concern, as nitrate leaching may be linked to soil acidification, associated cation and/or aluminium release, and nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater. In this paper, I summarise main results of studies performed in the Belgian Ardennes. In this area, the acid brown soils are naturally poor in magnesium and the observed forest dieback symptoms were supposed to be the consequence of increased pollution exacerbating magnesium deficiency. Liming was suggested for prevention and correction. However, possible side effects, in particular on soil solution and stream water chemistry needed to be evaluated. Another major concern was the effects of clearcut operations on the streamwater quality in this area important for drinking water collection. The effects of dolomite lime were investigated at the watershed, plot and laboratory level. Paired watersheds of approximately 80 ha were mainly covered with Picea abies. One watershed of each pair was limed with 3 T/ha of fine <b>ground</b> <b>dolomite</b> and 200 kg/ha K 2 SO 4. Runoff chemistry was analysed for major cations and anions and time series intervention analysis was used to detect statistically significant changes in stream water chemistry. Results showed increased magnesium concentrations immediately after liming, but {{a major part of the}} lime was retained by the soil system, and consequences on water chemistry were minor. However, in the plot study, where 5 T ha- 1 of a dolomite lime suspension were applied to adjacent Quercus petraea and Picea abies stands, soil solution nitrate concentrations were significantly increased through liming in the Quercus plots. Increased net nitrification in the Quercus stand was confirmed by potential net nitrification measurements in the laboratory. The effects of tree harvesting on streamwater ion concentrations were investigated by clear felling 22 ha (9650 m 3 wood) of a 81 ha watershed. This area represented one third of the forested area, the remaining area being covered equally with young plantations and 70 - 100 year old Picea abies. First data indicate increased potassium, iron, lead and organic carbon concentrations, but no major change in streamwater nitrate concentrations. Results will be discussed in relation to literature data and known controlling factors of the nitrification process. This analysis reveals that the speed, extent and duration of a perturbation in nitrate leaching after liming or felling vary at different sites. Risks assessment for nitrate leaching is therefore difficult and prediction of nitrate leaching in response to a perturbation remains an important challenge for further studies. In particular, basic controls of the nitrification process and relation nitrification/immobilisation need further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{main effects}} of lime, aluminium, iron and {{manganese}} were studied in field and greenhouse grown tobacco; relations between soil and plant measurements were examined. Ground limestone, ground mixed lime, <b>ground</b> <b>dolomite</b> and slaked lime at rates equivalent to 1, 000 and 2, 000 lb. CaC 0 ₃/acre increased yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco both on Triassic and granite sands, whether applied early (February/March) or late (September); the highest rate and late application were often best. Yields increased with 4, 000 and 6, 000 lb. dolomite/acre applied late, but quality decreased when the pH was about 6. 0. Lime did not affect leaf maturity as reflected by nitrogen and reducing sugars concentration. Where leaf discolouration (slate) occurred, the best quality and least discoloured leaf had the lowest manganese concentration and was grown on limed soil. On a very acid and probably nitrogen deficient soil, lime, borax and nitrogen (nitrate only tested) reduced the discolouration and improved the quality, but potassium sulphate increased discolouration and decreased quality. Calcium concentration in the leaf was increased by lime, particularly calcitic materials, and magnesium concentration was increased by dolomite. Lime also increased the filling value and petroleum ether extract, but decreased manganese, boron, chloride and sometimes potassium, and {{had no effect on}} phosphorus, nitrogen, aluminium, iron, crude fibre, nicotine, reducing sugars and equilibrium moisture. The inorganic composition of greenhouse plants was similar; generally gypsum increased calcium concentration more than calcium carbonate but it did not affect manganese concentration, which was decreased by calcium carbonate. In the stem and roots of field grown plants (dolomite only tested), the concentration of magnesium was increased but the concentrations of calcium, potassium, aluminium and iron were unaffected. Although the concentration of nitrogen was increased and that of phosphorus was decreased in the stem, these were unaffected in the roots. Aluminium and iron behaved differently to other nutrient ions, being more concentrated in the roots than aerial plant parts. Boron and magnesium deficiencies were observed in a dry and wet year, respectively, suggesting that variable mineral deficiencies can affect responses to lime. Initially soil pH was affected more by source of lime, but later mostly by rates. Slaked lime increased the soil pH more than did ground limestone, mixed lime or dolomite. In a glasshouse experiment, pH was more important than calcium supply and in the field, the largest yields were often associated with the highest pH. In pot experiments, aluminium drastically reduced yields in nutrient solution but not in soils, whereas iron was more severe in soils; manganese had little effect on yield. Manganese was readily taken up and translocated to the tops, but aluminium and iron were mainly concentrated in the roots, as was found in field grown plants. Iron decreased manganese concentration in all plant parts and aluminium decreased calcium and manganese in nutrient solution only. Although aluminium and iron generally increased the concentration of phosphorus in the roots, they did not interfere with phosphorus transport in the plant. Manganese caused the leaf to become chlorotic and when no iron was present the upper leaves became yellow, and developed brown and white lesions. However, in soil grown plants, sufficient iron was present in the soil solution to prevent break down of tissue. Yellowing of the upper leaves also occurred when plants were grown in nutrient solution with aluminium and no iron; when both were present, the plants were darker in colour. Although aluminium damaged roots in nutrient solution, high rates of iron severely damaged leaves of plants grown in soil. Since the concentrations of aluminium, iron and manganese were decreased in the soil solution by liming, they were compared with plant growth and composition in 17 different soils, with and without lime. As was expected, lime increased soil pH. It also increased exchangeable calcium, but decreased exchangeable aluminium, iron and manganese; exchangeable magnesium and potassium and resin extractable phosphorus were not affected. As the Ratio Law does not hold for all Rhodesian soils, anion adsorption will be avoided if the soils are equilibrated with O. OOOSM CaC 1 ₂; the concentrations of the cations in solution were affected {{in the same way as}} exchangeable cations, but phosphorus was increased. There was no relationship between yield of tobacco and its chemical composition. The correlations between soil solution data and plant composition were poor, except for manganese and phosphorus; the relation between Mn ppm. in plant vsa (superscript) Mn/a (superscript) Ca + Mg (enclosed in square root sign √) in solution, and P% vs pH₂ P 0 ₄ or pH₂ P 0 ₄ +½ pCa, were both curvilinear. On the other hand, all measurements of exchangeable cations were poorly correlated with plant composition. Finally yield was poorly correlated with soil solution data, and pH was as satisfactory as any other measurement tested. Manganese toxicity was observed on three soils, and a probable manganese deficiency on one. It was not possible to define a limit above which manganese toxicity occurred, but manganese deficiency developed at about 63 ppm. manganese. Variations in pH and the availability of aluminium, iron and manganese occurred when soils were incubated at about field capacity, generally the main effects having developed within seven days. In all soils, there was an initial increase in soil pH and a maximum value was reached in one to four days, decreasing by variable amounts with longer periods of incubation. Although the concentration of aluminium was larger than that of iron, the relation between both ions and soil pH was curvilinear, their concentrations increasing with decreasing pH. Increased temperature of incubation increased pH with a resultant decrease in the concentration of aluminium, but in one soil it appreciably increased the availability of iron in the early periods of incubation. Autumn and spring ploughing did not affect subsequent pH or the concentration of aluminium and iron in the soil solution. Manganese concentration varied from soil to soil and was not related to soil pH. In most soils there was a decrease in manganese concentration with length of incubation and it decreased more rapidly the lower the initial concentration. Temperature effects were variable and moisture affected the behaviour of manganese more than temperature. These findings and the distribution of aluminium, iron and manganese in the plant helped to explain the poor correlations...|$|E
