The Inter-University Census Tract Committee was formed in 1955 and Oxford was divided into 48 tracts with an average population of 2,645 each.

While tracts composed of <b>enumeration</b> <b>districts</b> were later developed, these were not extensively used. Census tracts have, however, been constructed and used by British demographers.

40|$|AIMS—To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} social deprivation and causes of stillbirth and infant mortality.  METHODS—Stillbirths and infant deaths in 6347 <b>enumeration</b> <b>districts</b> in Wales were linked with the Townsend score of social deprivation. In 1993 - 98 there were 211 072 live births, 1147 stillbirths, and 1223 infant deaths. Poisson regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the magnitude of effect for associations between the Townsend score and categories of death by age and the causes of death. The relative risk of death between most and least deprived <b>enumeration</b> <b>districts</b> was derived.  RESULTS—Relative risk of combined stillbirth and infant death was 1. 53 (95 % CI 1. 35 to 1. 74) in the most deprived compared with the least deprived <b>enumeration</b> <b>districts.</b> The early neonatal mortality rate was not significantly associated with deprivation. Sudden infant death syndrome showed a 307 % (95 % CI 197 % to 456 %) increase in mortality across the range of deprivation. Deaths caused by specific conditions and infection were also associated with deprivation, but {{there was no evidence of}} a significant association with deaths caused by placental abruption, intrapartum asphyxia, and prematurity.  CONCLUSIONS—Collaborative public health action at national and local level to target resources in deprived communities and reduce these inequalities in child health is required. Early neonatal mortality rates and deaths from intrapartum asphyxia and prematurity are not significantly associated with deprivation and may be more appropriate quality of clinical care indicators than stillbirth, perinatal, and neonatal mortality rates. ...|$|R

However, users of census data {{need to be aware of}} the problems and limitations of these data, which include the format of the data, data modification and suppression, sampling error, and underenumeration. An important innovation of the 1991 census was that the census form included a question on the postcode of respondents; this allowed the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to produce a postcode-enumeration district look up table which overcomes many of the problems previously encountered in trying to assign postcodes to <b>enumeration</b> <b>districts.</b> The new look up table also includes the grid reference of postcodes, and this will improve the geographical referencing of census data...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{intentions}} was to avoid omissions and double counting {{by taking the}} census {{at the same time}} across the whole country and collecting the data as quickly as possible. The Civil Registration Districts were therefore subdivided into <b>enumeration</b> <b>districts</b> which were intended to be of a size where one person could collect the data from all households in a single day.
