25|$|Easements by prescription, {{also called}} {{prescriptive}} easements, are implied easements granted after the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> {{has used the}} property in a hostile, continuous and open manner for a statutorily prescribed number of years. Prescriptive easements differ from adverse possession by not requiring exclusivity.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the owner}} of parcel A holds an {{easement}} to use a driveway on parcel B {{to gain access to}} A's house. Here, parcel A is the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate,</b> receiving the benefit, and parcel B is the servient estate, granting the benefit or suffering the burden.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, an {{easement}} {{in gross}} benefits an individual or a legal entity, rather than a <b>dominant</b> <b>estate.</b> The easement can be for a personal use (for example, an easement to use a boat ramp) or a commercial use (for example, an easement to a railroad company to build and maintain a rail line across property). Historically, an {{easement in gross}} was neither assignable nor inheritable, but commercial easements are now freely transferable to a third party. They are divisible but must be exclusive (the original owner no longer uses it and exclusive to easement holder) and all holders of the easement must agree to divide. If subdivided, each subdivided parcel enjoys the easement.|$|E

We provide experimental evidence from Sweden indicating that the split of the surplus depends on the context and what is judged to be reasonable principles of a fair distribution. The <b>dominant</b> <b>estates</b> got a significantly higher share of the surplus because they could start the bargaining with a bid that only included compensation for cost, whereas the servient estate could not find any principle that would give them the whole surplus.

25|$|Despite the name, {{necessity}} {{alone is}} an insufficient claim to create any easement. Parcels {{without access to}} a public way may have an easement of access over adjacent land if crossing that land is absolutely necessary to reach the landlocked parcel {{and there has been}} some original intent to provide the lot with access, and the grant was never completed or recorded but is thought to exist. A court order is necessary to determine the existence of an easement by necessity. To obtain this generally the party who claims the easement files a lawsuit, and the judge weighs the relative damage caused by enforcing an easement against the servient estate against the damage to the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> if the easement is found not to exist and is thus landlocked.|$|E

40|$|Horizontal {{drilling}} and modern completion techniques have transformed the energy industry. As these techniques {{continue to evolve}} and improve, the Texas courts have already recognized that they must remain vigilant {{to ensure that the}} common law achieves sound public policy outcomes and does not frustrate oil production now made possible only through horizontal drilling. This judicial recognition is important because the <b>dominant</b> mineral <b>estate</b> common law, which was developed in the context of vertical wells, needs to be reformulated for the horizontal drilling practices of today. To better achieve sound public policy outcomes {{while at the same time}} providing equitable outcomes to surface owners, this paper argues that the Texas Supreme Court should adopt the following common law rule for horizontal wells: Proposed Common Law Reform: The reasonably prudent operator of a lease on a particular tract should have the same rights to drill a horizontal well on that tract as it would have to drill a vertical well on that tract regardless of whether production comes from beneath that tract, but if the horizontal well that is drilled extends off-tract, then the reasonably prudent operator must compensate the surface owner for any surface damages arising as a result of the drilling, development, and production activities related to this horizontal well. The above proposed common law rule seeks to protect the development rights of the reasonably prudent operator in the context of today’s horizontal drilling in unconventional shale formations. However, this common law rule also seeks to provide an equitable outcome for surface owners who find themselves burdened by the surface location of a horizontal well. The doctrine of the <b>dominant</b> mineral <b>estate</b> has not been a static doctrine. As detailed in the article, the Texas Supreme Court has reformulated the <b>dominant</b> mineral <b>estate</b> doctrine when that doctrine created a substantial and uncompensated interference of the surface estate. Consistent with this historical evolution, this article argues that the Texas Supreme Court’s decision in Moser v. U. S. Steel Corp. provides authority for the proposed common law reform set forth above. Given the importance of horizontal drilling, the Texas Supreme Court should now act to clarify the doctrine of the <b>dominant</b> mineral <b>estate</b> in the horizontal well context to promote the development activities of the reasonably prudent operator and to provide more equitable outcomes for surface owners...|$|R

50|$|Brachtenbach, {{while sitting}} as a Washington State Supreme Court Justice, wrote the opinion for Brown v. Voss, 105 Wash.2d 366, 715 P.2d 514 (1986). The issue in Voss was: {{to what extent}} can the owner of a private road {{easement}} traverse the servient estate to not only reach the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate,</b> but a parcel (subsequently acquired by the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> owner) adjacent to the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> when such usage does not increase the burden on the servient estate? While Brachtenbach stated the general rule that an easement appurtenant to one parcel of land may not be extended by the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> to an additional non-dominant parcel owned by the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> regardless of whether the additional parcel is adjacent to the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate,</b> and further declared that if an easement appurtenant serves a particular parcel of land, any extension of the easement is a misuse of the easement—Brachtenbach still ultimately allowed the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> to continue using the easement to access the additional, non-dominant estate because a grant of injunctive relief would be inappropriate in light of the circumstances. In short, Brachtenbach essentially found in favor of the Plaintiff by not granting the defendant injunctive relief (i.e. preventing the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> to continue to use the easement to access the adjacent non-dominant estate) although the plaintiff unlawfully extended the easement. Brachtenbach rationalized that a grant of injunctive relief under the circumstances would be inappropriate and against the principles of equity because (while no additional harm to the servient estate resulted from the extension of the easement) if injunctive relief was in fact given to the defendant, it would only serve to harm the plaintiff while not providing any benefit or protection to the defendant.|$|E
50|$|A {{servient estate}} (or servient {{premises}} or servient tenement) is contrasted with a <b>dominant</b> <b>estate</b> (or dominant premises).

40|$|The United States {{and other}} common law {{countries}} have a rich tradition of protecting property rights in land. In fact {{in earlier times}} these land rights included water {{as part of the}} right. Remnants of this are still visible in the riparian rights doctrine for surface water and in some ground water doctrines. Traditionally land use practices were protected even when they interfered with water usage. But in dry areas the dominance of land rights over water rights does not make sense. Water is more valuable than land in arid locations. Shouldn’t water be protected from land use practices that interfere with water uses? If water rights were dominate over land rights, would more water be conserved or would water be put to more efficient uses? Mineral rights can be severed from other land rights, and when they are the right to develop the mineral is included with the mineral right. This makes the mineral <b>estate</b> <b>dominant.</b> If water rights were dominant over land rights, land uses that impacted water would only be allowed if there was also an accompanying water right. The basis for this already exists in many western states where the state or the public is considered the original possessor of all water rights. Individual uses and rights are allowed but only under a state permit system. My paper examines the concept of the <b>dominant</b> water <b>estate</b> and explores what this would mean for increasing water supplies...|$|R

40|$|Since 2008, the German {{open-ended}} {{real estate}} fund (GOEREF) industry has experienced a critical phase of suspensions of redemption of fund shares, announced fund terminations and, eventually, introduction of a new regulation. With assets under management of over EUR 80 billion, GOEREFs are the <b>dominant</b> indirect real <b>estate</b> investment vehicle in Germany. Thus, it is extremely important to {{study the effects of}} this crisis on the risk and return characteristics of the respective funds. Both net asset values (NAVs) and potential secondary market prices of the shares of funds with suspended redemptions are used. The resulting total return patterns are analysed on an index basis for fund groups that best represent the most important investor groups for GOEREFs. Groups that comprised a higher number of funds with suspended redemptions were considerably worse off and less attractive in an asset allocation context than the others given the often much lower secondary market prices. However, changes in return and risk must also be considered in terms of NAVs. The fund group comprising co-operative savings banks' funds was virtually unaffected by the liquidity crisis and continued to be deliver stable and non-volatile returns, while the other fund groups exhibited a clear shift in their respective return profiles...|$|R

Whilst the fortunes of wealthy squatters and politicians have been traced in detail through official sources, the fate of ‘ordinary’ settlers on the Darling Downs has been somewhat overlooked. The concerns of one small community are addressed here, mainly through the ‘unofficial’ sources of knowledge that were identified by the British historian, Raphael Samuel. These include oral accounts and written memoirs from former residents, placename origins and family and community histories. An analysis of the placenames given by explorers, squatters, surveyors and ordinary settlers during the 19 th century sheds new light on the concerns of the first Europeans on the Darling Downs, and provides a background {{to the study of the}} Nandi/Kupunn/Broadwater district and its community. The residents themselves describe life during the early days of the 20 th century, on both the <b>dominant</b> freehold <b>estate,</b> Loudoun, and on the small selections nearby. Struggles with the environment, and the hardships of two World Wars and the Great Depression are recounted from the viewpoint of the ordinary resident in a close-knit and interdependent farming community. The effects of the post World War II era, which saw extensive land clearing, the fragmentation of the community and the intrusion of agribusiness interests, are also outlined. The personal accounts are enhanced by a collection of photographs from the 1870 s through to the present day, and a selection of maps. The memoirs of ordinary people are underpinned by official records and newspaper accounts, and can be set in the established historical framework. The personal experiences of settlers in that one small community help to facilitate a deeper understanding of rural Australia, as it is today, and its development through many generations.

40|$|The post-WWII {{period has}} seen a radical change in the growth {{patterns}} and composition of American cities, as a decentralized form of real estate development, conventional development, has become the <b>dominant</b> real <b>estate</b> development paradigm. As conventional development has become pervasive it has contributed {{to a host of}} negative economic, social, and environmental impacts. Growing dissatisfaction and concern over these negative impacts has given rise to development models that seek to accommodate the demand for new built space through alternative spatial forms, development locations, development practices, and development products. Collectively called "alterative development", these development models seek to minimize or eliminate potential negative social and environmental externalities caused by real estate development. While alternative development has gained some traction in the real estate development industry, it still faces significant barriers. Chief among these barriers is the lack of access to reasonably priced debt and equity capital. As the availability of financial capital {{is one of the key}} factors determining what gets built, when, and where, the lack of access to capital for alternative development has profound effects on the economic, social, and environmental health of our communities. (cont.) This thesis argues that one solution to overcoming the financing barrier, and expanding access to capital for alternative development projects, is through the development of a "real estate social investment" framework and the use of this framework to guide the investment decisions of capital delivery vehicles that can deliver reasonably priced capital to alternative development projects that produce financial returns plus social and environmental returns (the double bottom line). This thesis offers suggestions on what a real estate social investment framework might entail and how the financial, social, and environmental return components could be measured and evaluated. This framework is then used as a lens through which to examine the existing practice of double bottom line (DBL) real estate private equity investment funds. Through analyze of existing theory and practice surrounding social investing and double bottom line real estate private equity funds, recommendations are proposed to advance both the practice of DBL real estate private equity funds and the development and maturation of a real estate social investment industry. by Jeffrey Elliot Levy.
