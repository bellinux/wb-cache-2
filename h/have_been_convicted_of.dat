5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> murder.|$|E

25|$|Studies of pedophilia {{in child}} sex {{offenders}} often report that it co-occurs with other psychopathologies, such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and personality problems. It {{is not clear}} whether these are features of the disorder itself, artifacts of sampling bias, or consequences of being identified as a sex offender. One review of the literature concluded that research on personality correlates and psychopathology in pedophiles is rarely methodologically correct, in part owing to confusion between pedophiles and child sex offenders, as well as the difficulty of obtaining a representative, community sample of pedophiles. Seto (2004) points out that pedophiles who are available from a clinical setting are likely there because of distress over their sexual preference or pressure from others. This increases the likelihood that they will show psychological problems. Similarly, pedophiles recruited from a correctional setting <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> a crime, making it more likely that they will show anti-social characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Grace White Sherwood (1660–1740), {{called the}} Witch of Pungo, {{is the last}} person known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> {{witchcraft}} in Virginia.

She was charged with witchcraft several times; at her trial in 1706, Sherwood was accused of bewitching her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill, causing Hill to miscarry. The court ordered that Sherwood's guilt or innocence be determined by ducking her in water. If she sank, she was innocent; if she did not, she was guilty. Sherwood floated {{to the surface and}} may have spent almost eight years in jail before being released.|$|E
