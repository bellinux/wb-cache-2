50|$|Alternatively, one {{can enter}} {{inverted}} flight by performing half an <b>inside</b> <b>loop</b> or half an outside loop.|$|E
50|$|An {{outside loop}} follows {{the same path}} as an <b>inside</b> <b>loop,</b> but is {{performed}} with the pilot or cockpit {{on the outside of}} the circle the aircraft describes.|$|E
50|$|Outside loops {{generally}} {{require more}} power and a higher control input than <b>inside</b> <b>loops</b> to perform because the lift force is in an outwards direction, thus tending to pull the aircraft out of the loop.|$|R
50|$|Loop optimizations: These {{act on the}} {{statements}} which make up a loop, such as a for loop (e.g., loop-invariant code motion). Loop optimizations can {{have a significant impact}} because many programs spend a large percentage of their time <b>inside</b> <b>loops.</b>|$|R

50|$|Due to its simplicity, the <b>inside</b> <b>loop</b> {{is among}} the first {{aerobatic}} maneuvers a pilot learns. It is named after a 360 degree circle with the pilot {{on the inside of}} the loop. Simply applying power while pulling back on the elevator stick will cause the aircraft to loop upward into vertical flight, continue into inverted flight, continue into a dive, and return to horizontal flight. A well-performed <b>inside</b> <b>loop</b> will look like clean circle with the same entry and exit point, and this requires management of power to overcome the tendency of gravity to shorten the upward portion and lengthen the downward portion.|$|E
50|$|When Hyde Park was established, it was {{considered}} a distant suburb {{on the outskirts of}} the City of Houston. Located less than three miles from downtown and <b>inside</b> <b>Loop</b> 610, today it is considered part of central Houston.|$|E
25|$|The {{neighborhood}} schools for Downtown are {{outside of the}} loop. Almost all of Downtown (<b>inside</b> the <b>loop)</b> is zoned to Ben Milam Elementary School, with a small section zoned to Ignacio Zaragoza Elementary School. All residents of Downtown (<b>inside</b> the <b>loop)</b> are zoned to Alex W. Spence Middle School and North Dallas High School.|$|R
50|$|Since {{instructions}} <b>inside</b> <b>loops</b> can {{be executed}} repeatedly, it is frequently {{not possible to}} give a bound {{on the number of}} instruction executions that will be impacted by a loop optimization. This presents challenges when reasoning about the correctness and benefits of a loop optimization, specifically the representations of the computation being optimized and the optimization(s) being performed.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a one-dimensional loop of circumference L crossed by a constant magnetic flux Φ {{and connected to}} an infinite lead with coupling parameter ϵ. Assuming that the initial state ψ_ 0 of the particle is confined <b>inside</b> the <b>loop</b> and evolves freely, we analyse the time evolution of the nonescape probability P(ψ_ 0,L,Φ,ϵ,t), which is {{the probability that the}} particle will still be <b>inside</b> the <b>loop</b> at some later time t.

50|$|The S-12 was {{the most}} {{successful}} monoplane Sikorsky designed during his time in Russia and twelve examples were produced. In September 1913 an S-12 became the first Russian aircraft to perform an <b>inside</b> <b>loop</b> at the Kolomyazhskiy hippodrome north of St. Petersburg. Later an S-12 set an altitude record of 3680 m. During World War I and the Russian Revolution S-12s served with the Russian Air Force and some were still in service until 1922.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Kulbit" [...] (also {{known as}} the [...] "Frolov chakra") is an aerial {{maneuver}} developed by Russian pilots in which the aircraft performs an extremely tight loop, often not much wider than {{the length of the}} aircraft itself. It differs from the traditional <b>inside</b> <b>loop</b> as it uses post-stall maneuvering capabilities,a type of supermaneuverability. Like most post-stall maneuvers, it demonstrates pitch control outside the normal flight envelope wherein pitch control is made possible by having aerodynamic flow over the aircraft's elevators or stabilators.|$|E
50|$|I-69W and I-69E will merge {{just south}} of Victoria, Texas, where {{mainline}} I-69 will follow US 59 northeast to Fort Bend County. In the Houston area, I-69 follows US 59 (Southwest Freeway) from Fort Bend County to the west loop of I-610. I-69 then follows US 59 (Eastex Freeway) from the north loop of I-610 to the Liberty-Montgomery county line. The segment of US 59 <b>inside</b> <b>Loop</b> I-610, through downtown Houston, was approved for designation as I-69 by the FHWA on March 9, 2015 and approved for signage as I-69 by the Texas Transportation Commission on March 25, 2015.|$|E

Laura Ingalls later raised her loop record to 980. On 22 June 1931, before more than 50,000 spectators (and NAA officials), Florence took off from Wold Chamberlain Field at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Four and {{one-half}} hours later she landed, [...] "A trifle groggy and gagged by gas fumes," [...] with a verified record of 1,078 loops.|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} field {{approach to}} multi-loop calculations in gauge field theories is presented. A {{relation between the}} gauge-invariant effective action computed using this method and the effective action of the conventional functional approach is derived. Feynman rules are given and renormalization is discussed. It is shown that the renormalization programme {{can be carried out}} without any reference to fields appearing <b>inside</b> <b>loops.</b> Finally, as an explicit example, the two-loop contribution to the fl function of pure Yang-Mills theory is calculated using the background field method. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The Hunter {{commenced}} its display with a {{low pass}} along the runway from south to north, turning for a second pass in the opposite direction. As it neared the airport, it pulled up into an <b>inside</b> <b>loop.</b> This manoeuvre started from a height of 200 feet m, which David Learmount later said [...] "left no room for misjudgement". The loop should have been started at a height of 500 ft and a speed of at least 350 kn indicated airspeed, attaining a height of 4000 ft and 150 kn {{at the top of}} the loop. Only 2700 ft and 105 kn were achieved from an initial entry speed of 310 kn.|$|E
5000|$|The Thunderbirds were {{practicing}} at Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field, Nevada (now Creech Air Force Base) for {{a performance}} at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. Four T-38As, Numbers 1-4, comprising the basic diamond formation, hit the desert floor almost simultaneously on Range 65, now referred to as [...] "The Gathering of Eagles Range". The pilots were practicing the four-plane line abreast loop, in which the aircraft climb in side-by-side formation several thousand feet, pull over in a slow, <b>inside</b> <b>loop,</b> and descend at more than 400 mph. The planes were meant to level off at about 100 ft; Instead, the formation struck the ground at high speed.|$|E
50|$|The viruses of this genus have segmented, bipartite genomes {{that add}} up to 7,500-19,500 {{nucleotides}} in length. Their genomes also code for proteins that do not form part of the virion particles as well as structural proteins. The Universal Virus Database describes that their genome sequences near their 3'-ends are capable of hairpin-loop formation and also believe that their 5'-ends may have methylated caps. Each of the viral RNA molecules contains four hair-pin structures and a pseudoknot in the 3'UTR. The pseudoknot is unusual in that it contains a small stem-loop structure <b>inside</b> <b>loop</b> L1. In the related genus Closterovirus, these secondary structures {{have been found to}} be important in viral RNA replication.|$|E
