5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How <b>it</b> <b>Feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could be made in editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to know how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an ornament. I had nothing to do in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating {{the man who has}} wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd put myself first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' for me to come home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to her performances of the song on television and at award ceremonies, [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was included on the set lists of Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour (2009–10) and I Am... Yours revue. It was subsequently included on her live albums, I Am... World Tour and [...] Prior {{to the performance of}} the song at the tour, outtakes of its music video were used. Beyoncé later appeared performing [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] wearing Ray-Bans, a leather breastplate, aviator shades and a bulletproof-looking one-piece further asking the crowd to sing along the track. During the bridge of the song, she included excerpts from Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and Tupac Shakur's [...] "California Love" [...] while imitating a male person with her moves. Alice Jones of The Independent wrote in her review that Beyoncé [...] "whip up a quasi-feminist singalong." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone noted that the singer channeled her [...] "ferocious onstage persona", Sasha Fierce. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times compared Beyoncé's wardrobe and dancing with that of Ciara. In May 2012, Beyoncé performed [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] during her [...] revue at Revel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Before Beyoncé started to sing, she noted that [...] " [...] how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hurt and lied to". During the performance, she mashed Goo Goo Dolls' [...] "Iris" [...] (1998) and reworked the rhythm of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] to fit with the cover. Elysa Gardner of USA Today noted that the ballad [...] "became a jangly guitar-pop number" [...] during the show. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the most attention-grabbing moments of the night... came when she dipped into other artists' catalogs". In 2013, [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was included in the set list of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour where it featured the string motif from The Verve's [...] "Bitter Sweet Symphony" [...] (1997).|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, {{the language of the}} novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit on a park bench like bookends", and ponder how strange <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E

500|$|The ballad [...] "I Miss You" [...] was {{performed}} {{in front of an}} electronic backdrop in which a male dancer was silhouetted in kinetic, black-and-white stripes. A re-arranged version of [...] "Resentment" [...] followed with an acoustic guitar used for its musical backbone. Beyoncé opened the performance of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] saying [...] "We all know how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hurt and lied to" [...] and later turned it into a guitar-pop song, in which elements of Goo Goo Dolls' adult-alt ballad [...] "Iris" [...] were used. An acoustic cover of [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] originally performed by Lauryn Hill followed. [...] "Flaws and All" [...] featured Beyoncé making facial expressions as she dedicated the song to her fans, singing the lines, [...] "I don't know why you love me/And that's why I love you." [...] During the performance of [...] "Irreplaceable", she asked from the crowd to sing the lines [...] "to the left" [...] along with her and made a competition in singing between sections. The first verse and the chorus were sung solely by the crowd. The intro of [...] "Countdown" [...] began with Beyoncé's ululations and moans, the Boyz II Men sample used in the song, and the opening drum crack and continued with the song's music video being projected on the screen. Brief snippets of Beyoncé performing Destiny's Child's [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'" [...] (2000) followed. [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{was performed}} with a march choreography and a funky version of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] followed. During the end, the song's beat got transformed into an extended outro. Prior {{the end of the show}} a home-video sequence showing Beyoncé biking, drinking a pint of Guinness, going whale-watching and holding her daughter Blue Ivy Carter with a voice-over was shown. Referencing her song [...] "I Was Here" [...] which was played in the background, she said [...] "When I leave this world I'll leave no regrets. I will leave my mark, so everyone will know I was here". Beyoncé went on to perform [...] "Halo" [...] in a red dress which she opened with a performance of Whitney Houston's [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a tribute to her following her death. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] which featured a Bob Fosse-inspired choreography and a singalong with the crowd.|$|E

2500|$|Captain Williamson in his Oriental Field Sports {{wrote of}} how sloth bears rarely killed their human victims outright, but would suck and chew on their limbs till they {{were reduced to}} bloody pulps. One specimen, known as the sloth bear of Mysore, was singlehandedly {{responsible}} for the deaths of 12 people and the mutilation of 24 others before being shot by Kenneth Anderson. Although sloth bears have attacked humans, they rarely become man-eaters. Dunbar-Brander's Wild Animals of Central India mentions a case in which a sow with two cubs began a six-week reign of terror in Chanda, a district of the Central Provinces, during which more than one of their victims had been eaten, while the sloth bear of Mysore partially ate at least three of its victims. R.G. Burton deduced from comparing statistics that sloth bears killed more people than Asian black bears, and Theodore Roosevelt considered them to be more dangerous than American black bears. In Madhya Pradesh, sloth bear attacks accounted for the deaths of 48 people and the injuring of 686 others between 1989 and 1994, probably due in part to the density of population and competition for food sources. A total of 137 attacks (resulting in 11 deaths) occurred between April 1998 and December 2000 in the North Bilaspur Forest Division of Chhattisgarh. The majority of attacks were perpetrated by single bears, and occurred in kitchen gardens, crop fields, and in adjoining forests during the monsoon season. One Mr. Watts Jones wrote a first-hand account of how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attacked by a sloth bear, recalling when he failed to score a direct hit against a bear he had targeted: ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the week}} ending on June 11, comScore and its PreAct service noted that new social media conversations {{for the film}} were second only to Black Panther and its new trailer; Homecoming was then the number one film {{in the next two}} weeks.

The app also provided an [...] "AR Suit Explorer" [...] {{to learn more about the}} technology in the Spider-Man suit, and use photo filters, GIFs and stickers of the character. Sony and Dave & Buster's also announced an arcade game based on the film, playable exclusively at Dave & Buster's locations. A tie-in comic, Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude, was released on June 20, collecting two prelude issues. On June 28, in partnership with Thinkmodo, a promotional prank was released in which Spider-Man (stuntman Chris Silcox) dropped from the ceiling in a coffee shop to scare customers; the video also featured a cameo appearance from Lee. Sony also partnered with the mobile app Holo to let users add 3D holograms of Spider-Man, with Holland's voice and lines from the film, to real-world photos and videos. Before the end of June, Spider-Man: Homecoming—Virtual Reality Experience was released on the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive for free, produced by Sony Pictures VR and developed by CreateVR. The virtual reality experience allows users to experience how <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Spider-Man, with the ability to hit targets with his web shooters and face off against the Vulture. It was also available at select Cinemark Theatres in the United States and at the CineEurope trade show in Barcelona.|$|E
