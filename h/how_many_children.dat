In 1348 {{he was sent}} by Algirdas to Khan Jani Beg to negotiate a coalition against the Teutonic Knights, but was handed over to Moscow for ransom. He died about 1363. It is uncertain <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> he had: the number varies between four and nine.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} of the 1219 treaty with Galicia–Volhynia {{it is noted that}} Mindaugas took {{the wife of}} Vismantas from the Bulionis family for himself. It is assumed that Vismantas' wife and Morta are the same woman. It is known that Vismatas died in 1252 in a battle against Mindaugas; however the date of Mindaugas and Morta's wedding is unknown. There is no consensus on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> Morta had. The chronicles mention two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, in 1261. In 1263 two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the same two sons, whose name got distorted by scribes, or they are four sons. There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination, except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas; it would indicate that, whether there were two or four sons, they had perished in their youth.|$|E
5|$|The {{family had}} reached a {{significant}} position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter's members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda's father, Vornic David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery. Proud of this tradition, it was her who insisted for her son {{to pursue a career}} in the Church. According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836. The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei). The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>children</b> they had together. At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as Nică, a hypocorism formed from Ion, or more formally as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru", occasionally Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei).|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} {{questions}} still unanswered. For example, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> license-exempt <b>child</b> care programs exist nationwide, and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> young <b>children</b> {{are enrolled in}} those programs. It is important that researchers not simply assume that all child care centers are licensed by the local or federal government, because regulatory exemptions may be present in many localities. Therefore regulation level or license-exempt status should be considered an important variable in future research focused on child care quality. If researchers are able to identify and assess license-exempt programs in their child care quality analyses, accounting for this important characteristic will reduce measurement error, and effect sizes may increase for other variables that enable examination of relationships between child care quality and child outcomes. License-exempt status should be more transparent for both researchers and families, and policy makers should consider carefully whether all child care centers need to be regulated by governmental authorities to ensure safe and developmentally-supportive environments for all young children.|$|R
