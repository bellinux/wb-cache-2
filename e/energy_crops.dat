5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops,</b> such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} and supply structures of <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> markets {{have not been}} established. Establishing the likely price and supply of <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> biomass in a region is a complex task because biomass is not an established commodity as are oil, natural gas, and coal. In this study, the cost and supply of short-rotation woody crop (SRWC) and switchgrass biomass for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) region-a 276 -county area that includes portions of 11 states in the southeastern United States - are projected. Projected prices and quantities of biomass {{are assumed to be}} a function of the amount and quality of crop and pasture land available in a region, expected <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> yields and production costs on differing soils and land types, and the profit that could be obtained from current conventional crop production on these same lands. Results include the supply curves of SRWC and switchgrass biomass that are projected to be available from the entire region, the amount and location of crop and pasture land that would be used, and the conventional agricultural crops that would be displaced as a function of <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> production. Finally, the results of sensitivity analysis on the projected cost and supply of <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> biomass are shown. In particular, the separate impacts of varying <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> production costs and yields, and interest rates are examined...|$|R

25|$|Biogas from {{sewage sludge}} {{treatment}} is sometimes {{used to run}} a gas engine to produce electrical power, {{some or all of}} which can be used to run the sewage works. Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – <b>energy</b> <b>crops,</b> food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000MW.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the prehistoric origins of switchgrass, its mid-twentieth century adoption as a crop, and late-twentieth century {{efforts to develop}} it into an <b>energy</b> <b>crop.</b> The species probably first appeared about 2 million years ago (MYA) and has continued to evolve since, producing two distinct ecotypes and widely varying ploidy levels. We build the case that all existing switchgrass lineages must be descended from plants that survived the most recent glaciation of North America and then, in just 11, 000 years, re-colonized the eastern two-thirds of the continent. Moving to historic times, we discuss how switchgrass was first considered as a crop to be grown in monoculture only in the 1940 s. Based on scientific reports indexed in a well-known database, interest in switchgrass grew very slowly from the 1940 s until it began being considered by the US department of energy (DOE) as a potential <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> in the 1980 s. The history of how switchgrass became Doe’s ‘model’ herbaceous <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> species is recounted here. Also chronicled are the early research efforts on switchgrass-for-energy in the US, Canada, and Europe and the explosive growth {{in the last decade}} of publications discussing switchgrass as an <b>energy</b> <b>crop.</b> If switchgrass—still very much a ‘wild’ species, especially compared to several domesticated grasses—truly attains global status as a species of choice for bioenergy technologies, it will have been a very remarkable evolution...|$|R
