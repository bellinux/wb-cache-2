50|$|The address {{listed by}} UTA for {{the station is}} 1349 East 500 South (East University Boulevard/SR-186). However, the station's two side {{platforms}} are actually located immediately east of a one-way (southbound only) section of University Street (SR-282). The station is easily accessible from both 400 South and 500 South, but not University Street (except at the two previously indicated streets). Situated on {{the western edge of}} the University of Utah Campus, the station is just west of the University's Rice-Eccles Stadium with the stadium's parking lot in between. (Rice-Eccles Stadium was the site of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics, as well as home of the Real Salt Lake major league soccer team 2005-2008.) The area west of the station is older residential housing; southeast of the station is the Mount Olivet Cemetery. As part of the UTA's Art in Transit program, the station features a woven bronze sculpture created by Michael Stutz entitled <b>Flame</b> <b>Figure.</b> Installed in December 2001, the sculpture was commissioned by the Salt Lake City Arts Council to commemorate the 2002 Winter Olympics. Unlike most TRAX stations, Stadium does not have a Park and Ride lot. The station is part of a railway right of way that was created specifically for the former University Line. The station was opened on 15 December 2001 as part of the former University Line and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAir {{traffic is}} one of the main sources of man's impact on the atmosphere. Emission of soot {{particles}} by airplanes has a significant influence on the climate. Soot particles affect climate directly by the formation of longlived contrails and indirectly by acting as nuclei for cirrus clouds formation. There are some experiments focused on ice nucleation on soot, yet no definitive conclusion has been reached. Most likely one of the reasons behind these discrepancies resides in the different physico-chemical properties of soot particles produced in different conditions, e. g. with respect to fuel or combustion techniques. The aim of our work is to investigate the influence of the combustion conditions on the structure of generated soot. We have used Raman microscopy (514 and 785 nm excitation) to study the spectral parameters of the first-order Raman band of various soot samples, collected from three different sources in the frame of the MERMOSE project ([URL] PowerJet SaM- 146 turbofan (four engine regimes), CAST generator (propane fuel, four different global equivalence ratios), and Kerosene laboratory <b>flame.</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 shows typical Raman spectra recorded for some of these samples...|$|E

40|$|Objective– To {{evaluate}} {{the prognosis of}} canine cutaneous mast cell tumors using immunohistochemical detection of Ki 67, MAC 387, Factor 8 and MMP- 9 and using Patnaik and Kiupel grades and histological information concerning vessel invasion, infiltration of the surrounding tissue, amount of collagen, presence of lymphocytes, amount of edema, ulceration of the skin, location of the tumor, necrosis and <b>flame</b> <b>figures.</b> Samples– 33 mast cell tumors (MCTs) of different grades from 33 dogs submitted from different Dutch veterinary clinics from 2008 - 2010 to the pathology department of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University, The Netherlands. The population consisted of 14 male and 19 female dogs, representing a variety of breeds. Procedures–The mast cell tumors were histologically graded with Patnaik and Kiupel grading schemes. Additional histologic information was noted concerning vessel invasion, infiltration of the surrounding tissue, amount of collagen, presence of lymphocytes, amount of edema, ulceration of the skin, location of the tumor within the skin, necrosis and <b>flame</b> <b>figures.</b> Ki 67, MAC 387, Factor 8 and MMP- 9 antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry. The relationships between the immunohistochemistry, the histology and the clinical follow-up data were investigated. The clinical data was used to compute overall survival time(OST) and the progression free survival(PFS). Results– Parameters significantly correlated to the Patnaik and Kiupel grades are: tumor size, degree of tumor excision, vessel invasion, infiltration of the surrounding tissue, lymphocytes, ulceration of the skin, necrosis, <b>flame</b> <b>figures,</b> KI 67 and Factor 8 (blocks). Significant relationships between the parameters and OST/PFS {{with the use of}} the Kaplan-Meier test were found with the parameters: tumor size, vessel invasion, lymphocytes, ulceration, necrosis, <b>flame</b> <b>figures,</b> KI 67 and Factor 8 (blocks). Conclusions and clinical relevance– The parameters of tumor size, the amount of excision of the tumor and the presence of vessel invasion, lymphocytes, ulceration and necrosis should be evaluated when histologically examining MCTs. For further evaluation, extra immunohistochemistry for Ki 67 and Factor 8 are useful for determining the prognosis for dogs with MCTs...|$|R

Beneath him, in every direction were the cabins of men. But not many men were visible. A blanket of smoke filled the valleys and turned the gray day to melancholy twilight. Smoke arose from a thousand holes in the snow, where, deep down on bed-rock, in the frozen muck and gravel, men crept and scratched and dug, and ever built more fires to break the grip of the frost.

At the airport, Davey forces the couple's hand by pretending that they are his parents and that they are abandoning him. When security attempts to intervene, Davey tells the guard the proof is the game cartridge he knows they have. Cornered, the couple kidnaps Davey at gunpoint and commandeers a plane, unaware that Davey has brought with him a bomb which the spies had meant to use to kill Kim. Unwilling to listen to Davey about the bomb, the couple requests a pilot. Meanwhile, Hal has arrived at the airport with Kim's mother, and after hearing about the hostage situation, he volunteers to be the pilot. As the plane moves to the runway, Davey tries to summon Jack for help; his father hears him and identifies himself as [...] "Jack Flack" [...] and calls Davey to the cockpit.

40|$|The porous media {{combustion}} {{technology is}} an effective solution to stable combustion and clean utilization of low heating value gas. For observing the combustion characteristics of porous media burners under various back pressures, investigating <b>flame</b> stability and <b>figuring</b> out the distribution laws of combustion gas flow and resistance loss, so as to achieve an optimized design and efficient operation of the devices, a bench of foamed ceramics porous media combustion devices was thus set up to test the cold-state resistance and hot-state combustion characteristic of burners in working conditions without back pressures and with two different back pressures. The following results are achieved from this experimental study. (1) The strong thermal reflux of porous media can preheat the premixed air effectively, so the flame can be kept stable easily, the combustion equivalent ratio of porous media burners is {{lower than that of}} traditional burners, and its pollutant content of flue gas is much lower than the national standard value. (2) The friction coefficient of foamed ceramics decreases with the increase of air flow rate, and its decreasing rate slows down gradually. (3) When the flow rate of air is low, viscosity is the dominant flow resistance, and the friction coefficient is in an inverse relation with the flow rate. (4) As the flow rate of air increases, inertia is the dominant flow resistance, and the friction coefficient is mainly influenced by the roughness and cracks of foamed ceramics. (5) After the introduction of secondary air, the minimum equivalent ratio of porous media burners gets much lower and its range of equivalent ratio is much larger than that of traditional burners...|$|R

Every now and then Harry extended his own line, moving always forward toward Gangoil as he did so, though {{he and his men}} were always on Brownbie's territory. He had no doubt but that where he could succeed in destroying the grass for a breadth of forty or fifty yards he would starve out the inimical flames. The trees and bushes without the herbage would not enable it to travel a yard. Wherever the grass was burned down black to the soil, the fire would stop. But should they, who were at work, once allow themselves to be outflanked, their exertions would be all in vain. And then those wretches might light a dozen fires. The work was so hard, so hot, and often so hopeless, that the unhappy young squatter was more than once tempted to bid his men desist and to return to his homestead. The flames would not follow him there. He could, at any rate, make that safe. And then, when he had repudiated this feeling as unworthy of him, he began to consider within himself whether he would not do better for his property by taking his men with him on to his run, and endeavoring to drive his sheep out of danger. But as he thought of all this, he still worked, still fired the grass, and still controlled the flames. Presently he became aware of what seemed to him at first to be a third fire.

It was the sugar planter from the mill and with him his foreman.|$|R
40|$|Leaves play a {{vital role}} in the {{development}} of a plant, as they are major resource collectors. Adequate representations of leaves are therefore required for the modelling of plants. Such representations may be important to generate a realistic visualisation, or they may be used to study biological processes such as photosynthesis and canopy light environment. Accurate leaf surface representations are rarely found in the plant modelling community. This paper aims to show how detailed, accurate representations of leaf surfaces can be created from data; representations that may then be used as parts of virtual plants for applications in fields as diverse as the arts, agriculture or computer games. The techniques used here are mathematical methods of surface fitting applied to data that has been sampled from real leaves with a laser scanner (Polhemus FastSCAN 3 D). These methods are interpolating finite element techniques, one using linear triangular elements, the other piecewise cubic triangles. The size of a laser scanned data set can be enormous and it may be important to represent the surface with significantly fewer points. An incremental algorithm is therefore used to identify significant points that result in a surface fit that approximates the entire data set to a pre-specified accuracy. The algorithms are applied to two examples, a Frangipani leaf and a <b>Flame</b> Tree leaf. <b>Figure</b> 1 visualises results for the Flame Tree leaf. The images represent (a) a photo of this particular leaf, (b) the complete set of more than 5000 digitised data points, (c) positions of data points after application of the incremental algorithm for the piecewise cubic approach with an accuracy of 1 %, (d) the same rotated to show the shape of the surface represented by these points, (e) the resulting triangulation and (f) the surface fit. From these point locations, guidelines are deduced describing where data points should be positioned, for example for measurement by lower resolution devices such as a sonic digitiser. The reduced point sets contain about one tenth of the number of points in the original data set. The research presented in this paper is the first to model detailed and accurate leaf surfaces based on three-dimensional data points captured from real leaf surfaces. It provided a basis on which further research can be built. For example, detailed and accurate surface representations may be used in the simulation of pesticide deposition on leaf surfaces to determine the effectiveness of a treatment and help develop improved pesticide application techniques...|$|R

The first thing that sensibly touched him in this his unregenerate state, were fearful dreams, and visions of the night, which often made him cry out in his sleep, and alarm the house, as if somebody was about to murder him, and being waked, he would start, and stare about him with such a wildness, as if some real apparition had yet remained; and generally those dreams were about evil spirits, in monstrous shapes and forms, that presented themselves to him in threatening postures, as if they would have taken him away, or torn him in pieces. At some times they seemed to belch flame, at other times a continuous smoke, with horrible noises and roaring. Once he dreamed he saw the face of the heavens, as it were, all on fire; the firmament crackling and shivering with the noise of mighty thunders, and an archangel flew in the midst of heaven, sounding a trumpet, and a glorious throne was seated in the east, whereon sat one in brightness, like the morning star, upon which he, thinking {{it was the end of}} the world, fell upon his knees, and, with uplifted hands towards heaven, cried, O Lord God, have mercy upon me! What shall I do, the day of judgment is come, and I am not prepared! When immediately he heard a voice behind him, exceeding loud, saying, Repent. At another time he dreamed that he was in a pleasant place, jovial and rioting, banqueting and feasting his senses, when a mighty earthquake suddenly rent the earth, and made a wide gap, out of which came bloody <b>flames,</b> and the <b>figures</b> of men tossed up in globes of fire, and falling down again with horrible cries, shrieks, and execrations, whilst some devils that were mingled with them, laughed aloud at their torments; and whilst he stood trembling at this sight, he thought the earth sunk under him, and a circle of flame enclosed him; but when he fancied he was just at the point to perish, one in white shining raiment descended, and plucked him out of that dreadful place; whilst the devils cried after him, to leave him with them, to take the just punishment his sins had deserved, yet he escaped the danger, and leaped for joy when he awoke and found it was a dream.' ...|$|R
40|$|Hollow Glass Microspheres (HGM) {{is not a}} new technology. All one has to do is go to the {{internet}} and Google{trademark} HGM. Anyone can buy HGM and they have a wide variety of uses. HGM are usually between 1 to 100 microns in diameter, although their size can range from 100 nanometers to 5 millimeters in diameter. HGM are used as lightweight filler in composite materials such as syntactic foam and lightweight concrete. In 1968 a patent was issued to W. Beck of the 3 M{trademark} Company for 'Glass Bubbles Prepared by Reheating Solid Glass Particles'. In 1983 P. Howell was issued a patent for 'Glass Bubbles of Increased Collapse Strength' and in 1988 H. Marshall was issued a patent for 'Glass Microbubbles'. Now Google{trademark}, Porous Wall, Hollow Glass Microspheres (PW-HGMs), the key words here are Porous Wall. Almost every article has its beginning with the research done at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). The Savannah River Site (SRS) where SRNL is located has a long and successful history of working with hydrogen and its isotopes for national security, energy, waste management and environmental remediation applications. This includes more than 30 years of experience developing, processing, and implementing special ceramics, including glasses for a variety of Department of Energy (DOE) missions. In the case of glasses, SRS and SRNL have been involved in both the science and engineering of vitreous or glass based systems. As a part of this glass experience and expertise, SRNL has developed a number of niches in the glass arena, one of which is the development of porous glass systems for a variety of applications. These porous glass systems include sol gel glasses, which include both xerogels and aerogels, as well as phase separated glass compositions, that can be subsequently treated to produce another unique type of porosity within the glass forms. The porous glasses can increase the surface area compared to 'normal glasses of a 1 to 2 order of magnitude, which can result in unique properties in areas such as hydrogen storage, gas transport, gas separations and purifications, sensors, global warming applications, new drug delivery systems and so on. One of the most interesting porous glass products that SRNL has developed and patented is Porous Wall, Hollow Glass Microspheres (PW-HGMs) that are being studied for many different applications. The European Patent Office (EPO) just recently notified SRS that the continuation-in-part patent application for the PW-HGMs has been accepted. The original patent, which was granted by the EPO on June 2, 2010, was validated in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The microspheres produced are generally in the range of 2 to 100 microns, with a 1 to 2 micron wall. What makes the SRNL microspheres unique from all others is that the team in Figure 1 {{has found a way to}} induce and control porosity through the thin walls on a scale of 100 to 3000 {angstrom}. This is what makes the SRNL HW-HGMs one-of-a-kind, and is responsible for many of their unique properties and potential for various applications, including those in tritium storage, gas separations, H-storage for vehicles, and even a variety of new medical applications in the areas of drug delivery and MRI contrast agents. SRNL Hollow Glass Microspheres, and subsequent, Porous Wall, Hollow Glass Microspheres are fabricated using a <b>flame</b> former apparatus. <b>Figure</b> 2 is a schematic of the apparatus...|$|R
