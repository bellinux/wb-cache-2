This would make <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E

25|$|Eight whiskey distilleries {{opened on}} 7th Street Road {{after the end}} of prohibition, and Louisville {{attempted}} to annex them to increase its tax base. Not wanting to pay city taxes, the whiskey companies persuaded the Kentucky General Assembly to pass the Shively Bill, which made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for Louisville to annex additional areas. The distilleries used Kentucky's existing laws (which favored the mostly rural communities in the state) to form a Â½ square-mile city named Shively in 1938. Shively grew to include residential areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{scarcity}} of Indian {{women in the}} Caribbean {{may not have been}} completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many Coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.|$|E
25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of them want to remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E
25|$|According to a Gallup poll, 43% of Bulgarians {{regarded}} the media {{reporting on the}} protests as objective, while 30% characterized the electronic and printed media outlets as displaying subjectivity in their coverage. Of the latter respondents, 19% considered the bias to be pro-protest and 11% identified it as pro-government. The electronic and print media in Bulgaria are generally regarded as tending {{to shy away from}} publishing materials explicitly critical of governments, but businessman and direct democracy supporter Petar Klisarov insists that the main media were passive and relatively objective in their reporting of the 2013 anti-Borisov protests while from the very beginning they unequivocally took the side of the protesters in their coverage of the anti-Oresharski movement. According to academic Orlin Spasov, the protests saw significantly more intra-societal cleavages (Russophiles vs. Russophobes, communists vs. anti-communists and so on) compared to the winter discontent against Borisov's cabinet that mainly juxtaposed the political elites against the people, which made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for the media anchors to cover them.|$|E

25|$|Aedes females {{generally}} {{drop their}} eggs singly, much as Anopheles do, {{but not as}} a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is {{the wall of a}} cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and they may have to withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of Aedes eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly {{over an extended period of}} time. This makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some Anopheles species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.|$|E
25|$|Reverse swing {{tends to}} be {{stronger}} than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball's trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batsmen experience it less often, they generally find <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batsman. This {{can be done in}} two ways one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an 'S' trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batsman. In the first instance, he is already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, his stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave him vulnerable to LBW, being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final.|$|E

[...] This stringent standard made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for public officials to win libel cases. He did not, however, go as far as Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, who suggested that all libel laws were unconstitutional. In Street v. New York, Harlan wrote the opinion of the court, ruling that the government could not punish an individual for insulting the American flag. In 1969 he noted that the Supreme Court had consistently [...] "rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Battle of Tsushima, Knyaz Suvorov was {{the lead}} ship in the Russian battle line and she opened fire at the , {{flagship}} of Admiral TÅgÅ HeihachirÅ at 14:05. Mikasa began to return fire about five minutes later, joined by the battleship [...] and the armored cruiser [...] The battleship [...] joined the others firing at Knyaz Suvorov around 14:20, which had been set on fire by hits from the other ships. At 14:35, Rozhestvensky and the ship's captain were wounded by splinters that entered the conning tower. Shortly afterwards, Rozhestvensky was knocked unconscious by a splinter in the skull and flames made the conning tower untenable so that the ship had to be steered from her auxiliary control position. Around 14:52, another hit jammed the steering gear after a four point turn to starboard had been ordered and caused the ship make nearly a full circle before she could be steered by her engines. Splinters from numerous shell hits shredded water hoses and made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to put the numerous fires out. By this time Knyaz Suvorovs aft 12-inch gun turret had been destroyed by an explosion that blew its roof off onto the quarterdeck, her forward funnel had fallen down and her mainmast had been shot away.|$|E
2500|$|Suppression is {{explained}} by the fact that [...] "organizations sometimes suppress persistent differences in performance".
