40|$|Introduction The current {{opinion is}} that split {{thickness}} skin grafts are not suitable to reconstruct a <b>degloved</b> foot sole. The tissue is too fragile to carry full bodyweight; and therefore, stress lesions frequently occur. The treatment of choice is the reuse of the avulsed skin whenever possible, or else {{the use of a}} full thickness fascio-cutaneus flap. Presentation of the case A young male sustained a crush injury to his right foot with deglovement of the plantar surface and part of the dorsum. Discussion Split thickness skin grafts are not suitable for full weight bearing, but in special circumstances, certain patients, {{a lot of time and}} patience, early mobilization and gradual increasing partial weight bearing it is worthwhile to try. To toughen the foot sole pressure distribution is necessary and can be reached in several ways, soft and springy materials of the inlay, but also socks, orthopedic shoes, casting, orthotics or walking aids. Conclusion This case-report illustrates that the reconstruction of a <b>degloved</b> foot sole with split-thickness skin grafts can be successful; a silicon inner sole was used to prevent stress lesions...|$|R

He had background history of predisposition to depressive illness, a current diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, and had had two attempted suicidal episodes in the last 3 months prior to this event. The clinical finding shows a patient with sad affect, feeling of hopelessness, and worthlessness; however, the vital signs remained fairly stable. At examination under anesthesia, the testes were exposed and the right already self-castrated.

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} long tail of most rodents is {{a feature}} that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which subsequently suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated <b>degloving</b> response. Rodent tails, particularly in rat models, has been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the Muridae family (in contrast to the bushier tails of the Squirrel/Sciuridae family). The tail is hairless and thin-skinned, but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient counter-current heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three dimensional environment. Lastly, murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed [...] "degloving" [...] which allows for escape from predation through {{the loss of the}} outermost integument layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that {{have been the subject of}} investigation.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>degloving</b> {{injuries}} {{affect the}} extremities and limbs. Any injury which would induce <b>degloving</b> {{of the head}} or torso {{is likely to be}} lethal. However, controlled facial <b>degloving</b> is often featured in plastic surgery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Degloving</b> {{injuries}} invariably require major surgical interventions. Treatment {{options include}} replantation or revascularization of the degloved skins, or when {{these are not}} possible, skin grafts or skin flaps. While {{the preservation of the}} extremities and limbs is normally preferred, in some cases amputations may be advised or required. Post-operative physiotherapy is of particular importance for <b>degloving</b> injuries involving the hand.|$|E
40|$|Over an 8 -year period 31 {{children}} in the Winnipeg area were admitted to hospital with lawnmower injuries. The accidents were always preventable and were caused by patient or parent carelessness. The wounds were severe, often resulting in amputation of a portion of an extremity. Infection was common; prophylaxis with a broad-spectrum antibiotic and human antitetanus globulin is recommended. Radiography, débridement of the wound with thorough exploration under general anesthesia, and defatting and reapplication of <b>degloved</b> skin should be done initially, then the wound should be reinspected and redressed at 2 to 3 days, and finally closed or skin grafted at 6 to 8 days. Children must be educated {{about the dangers of}} lawnmowers and prevented from riding on tractor mowers. The grass catcher should be used and the path cleared of missiles. Hand controls should be mounted on the mower's handle and the blade should be kept sharp so that the machine's speed can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Tensile distracting forces {{caused by}} {{elements}} such as a muscle pull can cause widening of scars in the tissue during the wound healing process. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether induced immobilization of the urethral muscle using botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) enhances wound healing and also reduces the amount of scar formation in an experimentally induced urethral injury in a male rat model. Methods: Prepubertal male albino rats were divided into 2 groups: 20 rats in the BTX-A group received BTX-A injection treatment during surgery and 10 rats in the control group received 0. 9 % saline solution injection. The penile skin was incised circumferentially and <b>degloved.</b> To make the urethral injury at a location ap-proximately 15 mm proximal to the external meatus, the urethra was cut transversally with scissors, from the 2 -o’clock to the 10 -o’clock position and then sutured by a single suture at the 6 -o’clock position. To evaluate chronic inflammation and fibrosis, the rats were killed, and the injured portions of the urethras were harvested for histopathologic examination after a follow-up period of 21 days...|$|R
40|$|Replantation of ring {{avulsion}} injuries is {{a challenge}} because of the long segment damage to the vessels and intrinsic damage caused to soft tissues at the proximal edge of the amputation. Eight patients with total ring avulsion amputations underwent microsurgical replantation in the period 1994 to 2002. Arterial repair was done by direct vessel suture in three patients, interposition vein grafts in two and cross anastomosis of the digital arteries in three patients. Venous anastomosis {{was carried out by}} mobilization and direct suture in seven patients and vessel transfer from the adjacent finger in one patient. Seven of the eight replantations were successful, while one patient had a partial failure. At a minimum follow-up of one year, these patients showed good functional and cosmetic recovery. All successful patients were happy with the outcome and none have requested for amputation, even those whose results were not functionally adequate. However, in addition to technical factors, it is important to evaluate the patient&#x 0027;s motivation to undergo not only the long surgery, but also multiple secondary procedures and regular supervised physiotherapy. We also describe a simple method which prevents the soft tissues inside the <b>degloved</b> digit from becoming wrapped around the K wire during bony fixation, thus making one step of this technically challenging procedure a little easier...|$|R

50|$|A <b>degloving</b> {{injury is}} a type of {{avulsion}} in which an extensive section of skin is completely torn off the underlying tissue, severing its blood supply. It is named by analogy to the process of removing a glove.|$|E
40|$|Kinesthesia is {{the sense}} of limb movement. It is {{fundamental}} to efficient motor control, yet its neurophysiological components remain poorly understood. The contributions of primary muscle spindles and cutaneous afferents to the kinesthetic sense have been well studied; however, potential contributions from muscle sensory group responses that are different than the muscle spindles have not been ruled out. Electrophysiological recordings in peripheral nerves and brains of male Sprague Dawley rats with a <b>degloved</b> forelimb preparation provide evidence of a rapidly adapting muscle sensory group response that overlaps with vibratory inputs known to generate illusionary perceptions of limb movement in humans (kinesthetic illusion). This group was characteristically distinct from type Ia muscle spindle fibers, the receptor historically attributed to limb movement sensation, suggesting that type Ia muscle spindle fibers may not be the sole carrier of kinesthetic information. The sensory-neural structure of muscles is complex {{and there are a number}} of possible sources for this response group; with Golgi tendon organs being the most likely candidate. The rapidly adapting muscle sensory group response projected to proprioceptive brain regions, the rodent homolog of cortical area 3 a and the second somatosensory area (S 2), with similar adaption and frequency response profiles between the brain and peripheral nerves. Their representational organization was muscle-specific (myocentric) and magnified for proximal and multi-articulate limb joints. Projection to proprioceptive brain areas, myocentric representational magnification of muscles prone to movement error, overlap with illusionary vibrational input, and resonant frequencies of volitional motor unit contraction suggest that this group response may be involved with limb movement processing...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} and report on our variant of penile corporoplasty, the double-breasted' corporoplasty, with penoscrotal and infrapubic access not requiring circumcision. The medicolegal aspects of treatment are also discussed. Patients and Methods Between February 1995 and October 2012, double-breasted corporoplasty {{was performed in}} 93 patients with congenital ventral penile curvature. Preoperative assessment comprised RigiScan monitoring, prostaglandin E 1 injection with photographic documentation and measurement of penile angulation, administration of the International Index of Erectile Function- 5 (IIEF- 5) questionnaire, and biothesiometry up until 5 years ago when it was substituted with the Genito Sensory Analyser for testing sensitivity. Dorsal infrapubic access {{was used in the}} patients with ventral curvature. After preparation and incision of Colles' fascia, the penis is <b>degloved</b> and double-breasted corporoplasty is performed at the site established at preoperative assessment. The tunica albuginea is prepared, an incision is made, and the cavernous tissue is isolated from the albuginea to obtain two flaps that are then overlaid and sutured asymmetrically with interrupted 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl (R)) sutures. After the free edge of the albuginea is sutured with a running polyglactin 910 suture, a non-absorbable monofilament and uncoated suture made of polypropylene (Premicron (R)) suture is placed at the point of maximum traction. Results Complete correction of penile curvature was achieved in 96 % of patients; recurrence occurred in 4 %. No major complications were reported, nor were there neurovascular lesions or change in erectile function. Palpable subcutaneous irregularities {{at the site of the}} corporoplasty, without functional or aesthetic impairment, were reported by 35 % of patients. There was no change in the appearance of the penis as circumcision was not performed and the residual scar was barely noticeable as it was hidden in the infrapubic fold. The corporoplasty technique can adequately restore the patient's psychophysical integrity, making it, from a medicolegal perspective, one of the most reliable procedures in the surgical repair of penile curvature. Conclusions This original technique is associated with low morbidity, a low recurrence rate and excellent aesthetic results. The results show that it is safe and effective. When indicated for the surgical treatment of penile curvature, the choice of the technique satisfies the criteria of diligence and prudence for the surgeon's conduct...|$|R
50|$|<b>Degloving</b> and {{avulsion}} injuries {{involve the}} removal of the penis skin, which is a serious medical emergency.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{avulsion}} injury, skin avulsions usually occur during motor vehicle collisions. The severity of avulsion ranges from skin flaps (minor) to <b>degloving</b> (moderate) and amputation of a finger or limb (severe). Suprafascial avulsions {{are those in}} which {{the depth of the}} removed skin reaches the subcutaneous tissue layer, while subfascial avulsions extend deeper than the subcutaneous layer. Small suprafascial avulsions can be repaired by suturing, but most avulsions require skin grafts or reconstructive surgery.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{species of}} lizard can detach ("cast") their tails from their bodies. This {{can help them}} to escape predators, which are either distracted by the wriggling, {{detached}} tail or left with only the tail while the lizard flees. Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time, though the replacement is typically darker in colour than the original. Various species of rat demonstrate a similar function with their tails, known as <b>degloving,</b> in which the outer layer is shed {{in order for the}} animal to escape from a predator.|$|E
50|$|Though African spiny mice {{originated}} in the deserts of Africa, they are frequently kept as exotic pets {{in other parts of}} the world, particularly Western nations such as the United States. In the pet trade, they are most commonly referred to as Egyptian spiny mice or, more simply, spiny mice. Though these animals are similar to pet mice and rats, the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate. Therefore, the spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a <b>degloving</b> injury. Their diet is also rather hard to maintain because their bodies have odd reactions to certain foods.|$|E

50|$|For {{those that}} are {{determined}} to be medically cleared for surgery, the anatomical location {{and size of the}} perforation must be determined. This is often done with a combination of a CT scan of the sinuses without contrast and an endoscopic evaluation by an Ear Nose and Throat doctor. Once dimensions are obtained the surgeon will decide if it is possible to close the perforation. Multiple approaches to access the septum have been described in the literature. While sublabial and midfacial <b>degloving</b> approaches have been described, the most popular today is the rhinoplasty approach. This can include both open and closed methods. The open method results in a scar on the columella, however, it allows for more visibility to the surgeon. The closed method utilizes an incision all {{on the inside of the}} nose. The concept behind closure includes bringing together the edges of mucosa on each side of the perforation with minimal tension. An interposition graft is also often used. The interposition graft provides extended stability and also structure to the area of the perforation. Classically, a graft from the scalp utilizing temporalis fascia was used. Kridel, et. al., first described the usage of acellular dermis so that no further incisions are required; they reported an excellent closure rate of over 90%. Overall perforation closure rates are variable and often determined by the skill of the surgeon and technique used. Often surgeons who claim a high rate of closure choose perforations that are easier to close. An open rhinoplasty approach also allows for better access to the nose to repair any concurrent nasal deformities, such as saddle nose deformity, that occur with a septal perforation.|$|E
5000|$|This {{internal}} {{dialogue is}} mixed with descriptions of Jessie's more and more desperate attempts {{to get out of}} the handcuffs, first by trying to break the headboard she was cuffed to then by trying to slip off the bed and pushing the bed to the bureau where the keys were placed. Finally, she does escape after one of the voices in her head tells her that if she stays another night, The Space Cowboy, who she dreamed of as a manifestation of Death, will more than likely take a part of her to add to its trophy [...] "fishing creel" [...] filled with jewelry and human bones, killing her in the process. Jessie escapes the handcuffs by slicing her wrist open all the way around on a broken glass and giving herself a <b>degloving</b> injury in order to lubricate her skin enough for the cuffs, which were made for men and not women and thus almost loose enough for her to slip out normally, to slide off her right hand. She is then able to move behind the bed, push it over to the bureau and use one of the keys to unlock her left handcuff. However, she has lost a lot of blood and passes out shortly after. When she awakens, it is now nighttime, and the Space Cowboy has made his way back into the house. Jessie confronts him and throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along, then turns and runs out of the house. She is able to make it into her car and finally escape the house, but is terrified to discover the Space Cowboy sitting in the backseat of the car.

40|$|Objective: Two {{different}} rat {{models for}} <b>degloving</b> injury were {{described in the}} literature. Our aim {{in this study is}} to compare these rat models to determine which one is more reliable and reproducible. Methods: We surgically induced <b>degloving</b> injury on tails and left hindlimbs of Wistar albino rats (n =  8), and sutured the avulsed tissues back in their original positions after a waiting period. We observed the changes in the avulsed flaps every other day for 10 days. At the end of follow-up period we evaluated the lesions in avulsed flaps by macroscopic measurement of necrosis and histological ulcer scoring using the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) Scale. Results: The average length of necrosis in avulsed tail flaps was 28. 42  ±  3. 04  mm, whereas there was no necrosis in avulsed hindlimb flaps (p <  0. 05). The average ulcer score of the lesions in tail and left hindlimb were 3. 42  ±  0. 78, and 1. 28  ±  0. 48, respectively (p <  0. 05). Despite the lack of visible necrosis TUNEL staining revealed an increased amount of apoptotic cells in avulsed hindlimb flaps. Literature review revealed a significant variability in previous studies in terms of the amount of necrosis observed in tail <b>degloving</b> injury model. Conclusion: Tail <b>degloving</b> injury model proved to be a more reliable animal model for <b>degloving</b> injuries.
