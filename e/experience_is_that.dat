25|$|A forced {{marriage}} {{qualifies as a}} form of human trafficking in certain situations. If a woman is sent abroad, forced into the marriage and then repeatedly compelled to engage in sexual conduct with her new husband, then her <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of sex trafficking. If the bride is treated as a domestic servant by her new husband and/or his family, then this is a form of labor trafficking.|$|E
25|$|Mexico {{remains the}} {{destination}} {{country of the}} greatest number of children abducted from or wrongfully retained outside the United States by parents or other relatives. Despite coordinated efforts undertaken by the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Central Authority, and senior Department of State officials to press for more expeditious processing and resolution of cases, the systemic problems in Mexico's handling of Convention applications that were detailed in the 2002 Compliance Report persisted during the reporting period. The Department’s <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> relative to the large number of pending Convention cases in Mexico, the number of cases resolved annually in Mexico is quite small. Most Convention return applications remain pending and never progress to the point of a definitive adjudication. Among the U.S. Central Authority's greatest concerns is Mexico's inability to locate children. Other problems include long delays in adjudication of return applications, the Mexican Central Authority's lack of adequate resources to perform its role effectively, the absence of implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system, and an apparent lack of understanding of the Convention among many Mexican judges, which has resulted in Convention cases being treated as custody matters or mishandled in other ways.|$|E

[...] Minister Brough argues that 100-year leases will not extinguish Native Title over the land.|$|E

[...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely."

2500|$|... “Abstinence in Overeaters Anonymous is {{the action}} of refraining from {{compulsive}} eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.” [...] This concept of abstinence {{has been criticized for}} its lack of specificity. While in AA abstinence means not drinking alcohol, some argue that {{it is not possible to}} set out specific foods, because OA's <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> different people have different food triggers (i.e. foods and food behaviors that cause them to eat compulsively). [...] While it is often said that alcoholics don't have to drink, but compulsive eaters still have to eat, Overeaters Anonymous responds by pointing out that alcoholics do have to drink, but cannot drink alcohol, just as compulsive eaters do have to eat, but cannot eat foods which cause compulsive eating.|$|E
2500|$|Wonga {{has said}} that most {{applicants}} are not credit-worthy enough to obtain a loan from the firm and it only lends to those with a good credit record. Some commentators, however, have warned that taking a loan from a payday lender can damage the customer's credit record {{and their ability to}} obtain a mortgage, even where the loan was repaid years ago. Ray Boulger of John Charcol, for instance, told BBC Newsnight that [...] "Our <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> mortgage lenders will often turn down requests for people who have had a payday loan...", and Robert Sinclair, Chief Executive of the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries, said [...] "From a consumer perspective, anybody who takes out a payday loan is clearly showing some financial distress and existing lenders will think these consumers may be maxed out." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Macedonski also {{discarded}} {{the concept}} of [...] "social poetry" [...] not long after postulating it, its spirit, Tudor Vianu believes, can still be found in his later contributions. This, the critic notes, was owed to his [...] "social temperament", whose [...] "fundamental <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the social." [...] Discussing this sociable and extrovert character, other critics see in the poet's life and work the imprint of [...] "quixotism". Also according to Vianu, this contrasted with Macedonski's failures in communicating with the public, an experience which made him [...] "misanthropic" [...] and contributed to his ultimate vision of death as freedom. Literary historian Pompiliu Constantinescu concluded: [...] "Macedonski could not resign; his one martyrdom was for Art, as the sole liberation from a tormented life." [...] Other commentators have defined the poet's perspective on life {{as a result of}} [...] "neurosis".|$|E

An alternative, which can be verified through one's own direct <b>experiences,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> consciousness <b>is</b> always a subject and body is only its object.

2500|$|HR {{holds that}} the {{therapeutic}} [...] "working through" [...] of personal issues from the past to achieve wholeness is unnecessary. According to the HR model, people are already whole and healthy. The traumas of the past are only important {{to the extent that}} the individual lets them influence his or her thoughts in the present. According to HR, one's [...] "issues" [...] and memories are just thoughts, and the individual can react to them or not. The more the clients' <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they themselves are creating their own painful feelings via their own [...] "power of Thought," [...] HR suggests, the less these feelings bother them. Sedgeman has compared this to what happens when we make scary faces at ourselves in the mirror: because we know it is just us, it is impossible to scare ourselves that way.|$|E

[...] CIU applied to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for an injunction that required the AFL–CIO laborers to return to work. On February 7, Judge John Keating Regan ruled that AFL–CIO workers had participated in a secondary boycott. By February 11, AFL–CIO resumed work on the arch, and an AFL–CIO contractor declared that ten African Americans were apprenticed for arch labor. The standstill in work lasted a month.
