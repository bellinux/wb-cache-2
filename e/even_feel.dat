Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E

He was not a teacher, educator or instructor. But he was an outstanding personality, magnificent fighter and great operational pilot. He had an astonishing sixth sense—an intuition that permitted him to see and <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> where other aircraft were. It was like a personal radar system.

In 1992, at the age of 90, he published his memoirs, The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner with Andrew Szanton. In it, Wigner said: [...] "The full meaning of life, the collective meaning of all human desires, is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp. As a young man, I chafed at this state of affairs. But by now I have made peace with it. I <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> a certain honor to be associated with such a mystery."

Prefix Magazines David Padula commented that it [...] "centers around a jazzy {{keyboard}} lick that dips regularly into more lush surroundings. The crisp percussion is a highlight, but the winning point is the soulful croons and general smoothness of Ocean." [...] Mike Powell's Spin praised Ocean's writing abilities, musing [...] "my 'TV ain't HD, that's too real', the narrator of 'Sweet Life' complains, then returns to his swimming-pool floatie. If the song wasn't so pretty — Ocean's velvety voice, soft jazzy accompaniment — you might <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> bad for him." [...] Killian Fox of The Observer reported that the song {{was one of the}} few times on the album when Ocean was actively courting heavy radio play, describing Sweet Life as a [...] "near-perfect distillation of every blissed-out summer jam from Stevie Wonder onwards."

500|$|The game {{is set in}} 1986 in fictional Vice City, {{which is}} based heavily on the city of Miami. Vice City {{previously}} appeared in the original Grand Theft Auto (1997); the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase. They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary, unlike Grand Theft Auto IIIs Liberty City. The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to New York City—the inspiration of Liberty City—eventually leading them to Miami, which producer Leslie Benzies describes as [...] "a party town, all sun and sea and sex, but with that same dark edge underneath". Sam Houser called it [...] "the grooviest era of crime because it didn't <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> like it was crime... it was a totally topsy-turvy back-to-front period of time". The team intended to make Vice City a [...] "living, breathing city", for the player to feel like [...] "life still goes on" [...] while the character is inside a building.|$|E

500|$|Richards was {{surprised}} by the quality of The Age of Kings graphics, considering they were all bitmapped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also called the sound of The Age of Kings as a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game's overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added [...] "an amazing amount of detail to the actual game". IGN's main criticism was for the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked [...] "why can't they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent?" [...] Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are [...] "so grand you'll <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> guilty about burning them to the ground". Werner agreed; [...] "the most noticeable graphical advancements", he wrote, were [...] "the sheer size and scale of things". Game Revolution stated [...] "AOE2 is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now".|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} Enterprise would be {{successful}} in its mission was planned {{from the start of}} the development of the year-long storyline. However, the producers and writing team would joke that there would be a [...] "bizarre twist" [...] such as the crew returning to Earth and discovering that it was now ruled by giant cockroaches. The writers decided against a Xindi-based cliffhanger and sought an unusual twist. Braga said that [...] "I can't remember who said 'Nazis,' but we just somehow ended up with Nazis. Then that didn't <b>even</b> <b>feel</b> like enough, so we decided to make them alien Nazis." [...] He expected it would make the returning episode in season four [...] "really interesting", and wanted to end the series on something [...] "wacky". Most of the cast were not given the final few pages of the script until they were already in production. Actor Dominic Keating, who portrays Malcolm Reed on Enterprise, called the ending a [...] "lovely twist... that just makes you scratch your head and wonder at what you've just seen." [...] The twist was wrapped up at the start of season four with the two-part episode [...] "".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to the evaluation of active surveillance as an option for selected men with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Active surveillance (AS) entails an active observation policy for men with presumably curable prostate cancer (PCa) at diagnosis.

Upon returning to his own office, Myron tells his receptionist to send home the waiting patients claiming he is sick. The receptionist has had enough of his self-loathing and quits. Myron goes out and dismisses his patients, claiming he's going to do missionary work with Eskimos. In reality, however, he makes the decision to kill himself.|$|R

This is particularly notable in the south-eastern corner. This is explained with the open coastline and low temperatures in the Baltic sea. Øresund is both narrow and shallow and gets warmer faster. The most common Scanian tree, the beech, leafes usually during the last days in April or first days of May.

In universal scapegoating, the speaker blames everyone for the problem, so the audience associates and <b>even</b> <b>feels</b> sorry for the victim, because it includes themselves. In fractional scapegoating, the speaker blames a specific group or a specific person for their problems. This creates a division within the audience.
