30|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rate policy should conform to the fundamental principle of <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy dominance. The {{first order of business}} is to strengthen the RMB exchange rate flexibility. The essence of {{foreign exchange}} rate is the relative price of two currencies. Since China is a fast growing large economy, simplistically pegging RMB to the US dollar or any other single currency will would cause distortions and resource misallocations. In such case, even though <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy autonomy could be maintained by foreign exchange market intervention utilizing the abundant foreign exchange reserves, the prices of that would be too great and the practice would be unsustainable. The lesson of the 2015 reform was simple and clear that the tremendous amount of foreign exchange reserves cannot guarantee the overcome of the dilemma. Although the 3.3 billion US dollar official exchange reserves are still sufficient, they are not enough to maintain <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy autonomy while defend the strong RMB.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} many of the exaggerated claims that {{globalization}} has been an important factor in lowering inflation in recent years just do not hold up. Globalization does, however, have the potential to be stabilizing for individual economies and has been a key factor in promoting economic growth. The paper then examines four questions about the impact of globalization on the monetary transmission mechanism and arrives at the following answers: (1) Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps and thus to <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy? No. (2) Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation? No. (3) Can <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output? Yes. (4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy? Yes. ...|$|R

50|$|Accordingly, the {{management}} of the exchange rate will influence <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions. To maintain its monetary policy target, the central bank will have to sterilize or offset its foreign exchange operations. For example, if a central bank buys foreign exchange (to counteract appreciation of the exchange rate), base money will increase. Therefore, to sterilize that increase, the central bank must also sell government debt to contract the monetary base by an equal amount. It follows that turbulent activity in foreign exchange markets can cause a central bank to lose control of <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy when it is also managing the exchange rate.|$|R

40|$|Proponents of {{flexible}} exchange rates have long claimed {{that one of the}} main advantages of a flexible exchange rate regime is that It allows a nation to pursue an Independent monetary policy. Under a system of fixed exchange rates, the actions of the <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> authorities are limited by their ability to finance a balance of payments deficit. Whether a nation is small (in the sense that its monetary authorities cannot control the nominal money supply) or large (in the sense that its actions can affect the world money supply) fixed exchange rates prevent the <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> authorities from continually expanding the domestic component of the money supply at a rate greater than the rate of growth of the demand for domestic money. As a flexible exchange rate eliminates the reserve constraint, It also gives the <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> authorities control over the domestic money supply. Yet the term "independent monetary policy " connotes more than sinqple control over the nominal money supply. One such connotation is that disturbances in the domestic money market are Isolated from disturbance...|$|R

40|$|In {{assessing}} Alexander Swoboda’s {{great influence}} on economics, two themes stand out: {{the determinants of}} global inflation, particularly in the 1970 s, and the choice of an exchange rate regime consistent with <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> and fiscal policies. Although seemingly narrowly focused on China, our contribution to Alexander’s fete straddles both themes.

40|$|This article proposes an {{alternative}} monetary model for examining {{the effects of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> shocks on the exchange rate and the balance of payments. Using an output-expenditure framework, it shows that <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> shocks can {{drive a wedge between}} national expenditure and production and generate incipient current account imbalances with exchange rate and balance of payments implications. Contrary to previous monetary approaches, the model suggests a new chain of causality that runs from domestic money to the exchange rate to the price level, rather than from money to the price level to the exchange rate. It also shows that under fixed rates external adjustment is consistent with money market equilibrium and price level stability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{empirical}} model for analyzing {{the behavior of}} nominal interest rates in a semi-open economy is developed. The model explicitly incorporates both the role of open economy factors (i. e., world interest rates, expected rate of devaluation) and <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions in explaining interest rates movement. The model is tested using quarterly data for Colombia for 1968 - 1982. The results obtained indicate that the semi-open characterization is adequate for the case of Colombia, and that world interest rates, the rate of devaluation and <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> conditions have affected domestic nominal interest rates during the period under consideration. The results also indicate that unanticipated increases in the nominal quantity of money have exercised {{a negative effect on}} nominal interest rates in Colombia. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a market-determined exchange rate regime, the fear of floating must be overcome. Empirical studies suggest most countries, especially emerging market economies, try to smooth exchange rate fluctuations by foreign exchange market intervention or adjust interest rates {{out of fear of}} floating when experience shocks, although they claim to have floating exchange rate regime (Calvo & Reinhart 1982; Patnaik & Shah 2010). Patnaik and Shah (2010) showed that this phenomenon was widespread in Asian countries, China and India included. The fear of floating is more prominent during crises, highlighted by the fear of currency depreciation. Since international capital movements are procyclical, the fear of floating means the monetary authorities would channel the procyclical of international capital movements into <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policies, which is forsaking <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> policy autonomy to some extent and against of the principle of counter-cyclical <b>regulation</b> of <b>monetary</b> policy.|$|R
40|$|Prevailing {{approaches}} {{to the politics of}} monetary policy in the United States are based on closed economy assumptions, which is appropriate for analyzing the period before about 1980.

The major policy effect is that the transmission channels of monetary policy now include the exchange rate. The major political effect is that the exchange rate has become a focus of concern for well-organized industries in the traded goods sector and, by extension, for Congress. This paper presents statistical evidence showing that the forces driving congressional activity on monetary policy have changed dramatically with the international financial integration of the U. S. economy. Exchange rates, as opposed to interest rates, now largely determine congressional attentiveness to monetary policy and the Federal Reserve. ...|$|R
