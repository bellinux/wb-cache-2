50|$|During the Napoleonic wars {{the economy}} of the area did well, and exports to Britain {{steadily}} increased until 1815. However, from then on a recession set in, evictions and unemployment increased, prices rose and the number of poor in dire straits rose sharply. To add to the woes, the weather in 1816 was exceptionally bad, heavy rains prevented proper harvesting and the potato crop, upon which the poor in particular depended, was neither good nor plentiful. The ensuing poverty and unemployment led to disease and hunger. These factors added to the tensions that already existed between landlord and tenant with regard to <b>grazing,</b> <b>rent</b> disputes, evictions, land-grabbing, paying tithes and so on. The vast majority of Catholics were still disenfranchised, so they could not try to solve their problems politically—even the (Protestant) Irish Parliament had been abolished in 1800.|$|E
30|$|In {{the initial}} days of British {{administration}} {{in the early nineteenth}} century, farmers were encouraged to keep their land under pasture by providing them two kinds of incentive. The first, ayen pillu (remission in tax) was reduction of three-fourths of the assessment on lands held for grazing, such reduction being limited to one-fifth of the farmers' holding. The other was paravu pillu, which was a <b>grazing</b> <b>rent,</b> but it was rather a mode of assessment than a remission; public wasteland could be held for grazing at one-fourth the assessment so long as no one wished for the land for cultivation at the full rate (Nicholson 1887).|$|E
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsRodney D. JonesAfter {{remaining}} {{stable for}} several decades, corn price has recently had unprecedented price increases and volatility. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts an average corn price of $ 5. 80 per bushel for 2008, which is 232 % of its 28 -year (1980 - 2007) {{average price of}} $ 2. 50. The record increase in corn price {{was the result of}} increased starch-based ethanol production associated with increased energy costs, and other factors such as a declining value in the United States dollar, and increased global commodity demand. High corn prices have impacted the profitability of the livestock feeding industry. It was less clear how the record high corn prices would affect the cow-calf industry since corn is not a significant input for cow-calf enterprises. This study quantified the relationship between cow-calf profitability and corn price. Because feed costs for a cow-calf producer are among the highest variable costs for the operation, both grazing and non-grazing feed costs were estimated as a function of corn price. Models were estimated to determine if a relationship between corn price and Returns Over Variable Costs (ROVC) at the cow-calf level could be identified. Corn price from 1978 - 2007 explained none of the variability in grass grazing rental rate, however when the projected 2008 corn price was included in the analysis, corn price explained 10 % of the variation in grass grazing rates. Year (linear time trend) and corn price from 1978 - 2008 explained 88 % of historical grass grazing rental rate variability, 71 % of alfalfa price variability, and 63 % of other hay price variability in Kansas. These results suggest that the new corn market paradigm likely will increase the relationship between corn price and feed costs at the cow-calf level. Several models were evaluated using bulk diesel fuel price, feeder calf price, corn price, alfalfa price, other hay price, and grass grazing rental rate to estimate Kansas cow-calf producer ROVC. Models that included diesel fuel price, feeder calf price, <b>grazing</b> <b>rent,</b> and one of the harvested feeds (corn, alfalfa, or other hay) price explained 90 - 91 % of the variability in ROVC. Models that included diesel fuel price, feeder calf price, and either <b>grazing</b> <b>rent</b> or corn price explained less of the variability in ROVC; using <b>grazing</b> <b>rent</b> explained 89 % and using corn price explained 79 %. Including grass grazing rental rate along with corn price, feeder calf price, and bulk diesel fuel price improved the model's ability to predict ROVC, explaining 91 % of the variability. While cow-calf producers might use very little corn directly in their operations, this research shows that corn price is an important determinant of cow-calf production returns, and corn price can be used by producers to plan for future rising costs in order to maximize returns...|$|E

In 1829 Louis sent his son Carolus to graze their cattle along the Black Kei River, then the northern boundary of British Kaffraria. In 1833 (or 34) Louis also crossed the neutral zone to join his son. Here a substantial boer community, {{at odds with the}} colonial government, was already living in exile. With Louis acting as their leader, colonel Harry Smith deemed him an agitator of the sixth Xhosa war, and planned to arrest him. Tregardt however moved his family and livestock to grazing land between the Caledon and Orange Rivers, just outside the colony, where he resided in 1835.|$|R

30|$|The {{territory}} used by landless transhumant herders in the Malakand {{region of}} Northern Pakistan {{is divided into}} three parts: (1) the lowlands below 1250 m towards the south, (2) the intermediary zones from 1250 to 3000 m, and (3) the uplands above 3000 m towards the north. The lowland and {{a large portion of the}} intermediary zones are mostly occupied by the Yousafzai Afghans, while the uplands and a small portion of the intermediary zone are occupied by the Kohistani Dards. Lowlands and intermediary zones have multi-seasonal irrigated cropping and mono- and bi-seasonal rain-fed agriculture, while the only type of agriculture in the uplands is mono-seasonal and irrigated. The irrigated lands are used by landowners while the rain-fed and <b>grazing</b> lands are <b>rented</b> out. Pastures are rented under a communal regime, while cropping is on an individual tenancy basis (Rahim and Viaro, 2002). Herders usually assign a contractor to negotiate the rental contract with landowners on a yearly basis. A sub-let is then arranged for each herder individually on a per-animal basis. As the number of animal increases, the cost per animal decreases.|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that based on rainfall differences alone, herders in Ilmotiok should migrate {{to one of three}} places: north to Kirimun, where rainfall is 0.2  cm higher; southwest to Rumuruti, where rainfall is 1  cm higher; and south to Segera-Endana, where rainfall is about 0.7  cm higher (Figure  12). On the other hand, herders in Tiamamut should ideally all migrate to Rumuruti, since that is the only migration patch with significantly improved rainfall (approx. 1  cm higher). Mpala is the only other patch with significantly different rainfall than Tiamamut. Grazing on Mpala, however, is only open to those <b>renting</b> <b>grazing</b> for cattle, so goat and sheep herds are generally not allowed in, except under extreme duress. Herders from Tiamamut should not migrate to Kirimun, Sukuton-Naibor, or Segera-Endana based on rainfall differences, since rainfall and, therefore, vegetation conditions are likely to be similar if not worse on average than in the home patch. Results of analyses of livestock movement records from 2008 to 2011 indicate that there are significant differences between group ranches in where they move their livestock during dry seasons or droughts to access forage and water resources, with a few exceptions.|$|R
30|$|Lastly, our {{conceptual}} framework of pastoral livelihoods predicts {{a high degree}} of mixing among private and public landowners in recent years. Pastoralists who live in group ranches (communal ranches) also live adjacent to private ranchers and farmers. These households subsequently gain assistance in the form of grants, employment, rations, mobile clinics, and emergency transportation from private neighbouring ranches. In turn, private ranchers use these assistance networks to negotiate with pastoral neighbours for developing wildlife conservancies and eco-tourism and holistic management of grazing patches. We hypothesize that out of necessity, pastoralists and ranchers must engage in shared negotiations in order to find mutually acceptable solutions to the problem of shared access to local resources, particularly traditional grazing patches. In many parts of East Africa, pastoral families must compete with endangered species conservation and eco-tourism (Gadd 2005; Muthiani et al. 2011; Wambuguh 2007) for access to grazing. When forage dries up or droughts arise, families have to either <b>rent</b> <b>grazing</b> land from their neighbours or risk migrating across private/public parcels to distant pastures in western and southern highlands (Herren 1988; Huho et al. 2009; et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|We used a {{spatially}} explicit {{model of}} forest dynamics, supported by empirical field data and socioeconomic data, {{to examine the}} impacts of human disturbances on a protected forest landscape in Kyrgyzstan. Local use of 27 fruit and nut species was recorded and modeled. Results indicated that {{in the presence of}} fuelwood cutting with or without grazing, species of high socioeconomic impor- tance such as Juglans regia, Malus spp., and Armeniaca vulgaris were largely eliminated from the landscape after 50 – 150 yr. In the absence of disturbance or in the presence of grazing only, decline of these species occurred at a much lower rate, owing to competi- tive interactions between tree species. This suggests that the current intensity of fuelwood harvesting is not sustainable. Conversely, cur- <b>rent</b> <b>grazing</b> intensities were found to have relatively little impact on forest structure and composition, and could potentially play a positive role in supporting regeneration of tree species. These results indicate that both positive and negative impacts on biodiversity can arise from human populations living within a protected area. Potentially, these could be reconciled through the development of participatory approaches to conservation management within this reserve, to ensure the maintenance of its high conservation value while meeting human needs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Blair Brothers are {{a family}} {{livestock}} and grazing operation, {{we have one}} full time employee. The rest of the labor and decision making is made by family members. We market private treaty over 300 commercial angus bulls a year and are looking to expand that to 500 {{in the next two}} years. Blair Brothers is a total AI operation, what I mean by that is any cow that doesn’t stick AI in two cycles are sold. We have eighty six percent of our mature cows bred AI in 26 days. Twenty percent of our cow herd is turned over every year, to keep upgrading our genetics. Our bottom end calves are back grounded at home then sent to Kansas to be finished and are then sold on US Premiums Beef (USPB) grid. The steers consistently grade 100 % choice 65 % CAB and 15 % prime. These calf feds will gain 3. 6 pounds a day and convert 5. 4 pounds of feed to pound of gain. The ranch has a calf buyback program for our customers. We partner with major Kansas feed yards where all the steers are finished and then they are sold on USPB grid of which Blair Brothers is a founding member. The ranch also operates a short duration <b>grazing</b> system and <b>rents</b> summer pasture within a 100 miles radius for yearling cattle. History I would like to share a little history of the Blair family and how our operation has passed down through 3 generations. In 1906 my great grandfather George told my then 19 year old grandfather Enos Blair to go find a place for the family to settle. He looked at places in Oklahoma and South Dakota, settling on a place in the northern Black Hills between Sturgis and Rapid City. Enos then brought out his 3 younger brothers, sister and his parents. With the family homesteading, buying land and cattle the original Blair Brothers amassed some 60, 000 acres of land and Hereford cattle by the mid 1940 ’s. When my father and his cousins came home from World War II, the original partners split up their holdings. The story that I was told is all the brothers sat down at a table one afternoon and divided up the land and the cattle according to their personal interest in the operation...|$|R
