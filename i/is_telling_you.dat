500|$|Through {{the final}} storyline of the film, set in 2012, Kohli wanted to {{demonstrate}} a modern romance, which mostly happens through SMS, instant messaging apps, and Internet chat. Kohli described it by saying, [...] "Today people flirt, communicate and connect through smses and you get that feeling of being with somebody even when you are not with that person because that person <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> everything that is happening in their life. You are constantly updating the other person with your thoughts {{and that is what}} keeps you connected to that person." ...|$|E
500|$|The title Wildlife is not {{derived from}} lyrics from the album, but from themes that connect the songs. Dreyer regards {{wildlife}} as [...] "an all-encompassing word to sum everything up", {{and he has}} said that [...] "we all witness tragedy and change. It's the summation of our existence." [...] On the inside of the album cover the words [...] "To – for everything" [...] are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out. It has been speculated by some that the word is the name 'Helen'. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt when asked about the dedication replied [...] "That’s Jordan’s story to tell, and not mine. [...] It does have significance to a story he <b>is</b> <b>telling.</b> <b>You</b> will probably hear {{a little bit more about}} that in future work, Jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dave Golder of SFX says [...] "If, {{while your}} brain <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you,</b> 'This is crap!' {{your heart is}} still doing backflips then it's your kind of episode. 'Journey's End' is almost a two fingers up at technobabble; there's {{certainly}} tons {{of it in the}} episode, but it's largely irrelevant." [...] He praises the action sequences and the portrayal of Davros, Donna, Rose and the Doctor, but remarks that the overcrowding of minor characters made parts of the script seem [...] "underdeveloped" [...] and describes the Daleks as mostly [...] "annon fodder". [...] " [...] plot does hang together, but only just". [...] Overall, he describes the episode as [...] "exceptional" [...] but [...] "not perfect".|$|E
2500|$|Command {{hallucinations}} {{are sometimes}} used {{in defense of}} a crime, often homicides. In essence, it is a voice that one hears and it tells the listener what to do. Sometimes the commands are quite benign directives such as [...] "Stand up" [...] or [...] "Shut the door." [...] Whether it is a command for something simple or something that is a threat, it is still considered a [...] "command hallucination." [...] Some helpful questions that can assist one in figuring out if he/she may be suffering from this include: [...] "What are the voices telling you to do?", [...] "When did your voices first start telling you to do things?", [...] "Do you recognize the person who <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> to harm yourself (or others)?", [...] "Do {{you think you can}} resist doing what the voices are telling you to do?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kanarick of All Game Guide {{also gave}} Virtual Springfield a {{three out of}} five rating. He praised the game for its {{references}} to the television series, noting that [...] "The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, {{there is not enough}} here to warrant purchase of The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield." [...] Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, [...] "it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for younger kids. If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, you do at times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners. The rest of the time you are just moving where the computer <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> to." ...|$|E

I suppose that every lady I have ever spoken to, when I have been with you at entertainments, has thought me exceptionally stupid; and I am sure I am, in most things, only I suppose I have got a fair share of common sense, and a habit of thinking for myself.

60|$|Is it, or not, a misfortune that a man, {{himself of}} a candid disposition, and disposed, like our friend Pen, to blurt {{out the truth}} on all occasions, begins life by believing all that is said to him? Would it be better for a lad to be less trustful, and so less honest? It {{requires}} no small experience {{of the world to}} know that a man, who has no especial reason thereto, <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> lies. I am not sure whether it is not best to go on being duped for a certain time. At all events, our honest Pen had a natural credulity, which enabled him to accept all statements which were made to him, and he took every one of Captain Macheath's figments {{as if they had been}} the most unquestioned facts of history.|$|E

6000|$|A man {{may spend}} a long {{hour in the}} upper tiers of the Palaces, but still far from the roof-tops, in looking out across the desert. There are Englishmen in these wastes, who say gravely {{that there is nothing}} so {{fascinating}} as the sand of Bikanir and Marwar. [...] "You see," [...] explained an enthusiast of the Hat-marked Caste, [...] "you are not shut in by roads, and you can go just as you please. And, somehow, it grows upon you as you get used to it, and you end, y'know, by falling in love with the place." [...] Look steadily from the Palace westward where the city with its tanks and serais is spread at your feet, and you will, in a lame way, begin to understand the fascination of the Desert which, by those who have felt it, is said to be even stronger than the fascination of the Road. The city is of red sandstone and dull and sombre to look at. Beyond it, where the white sand lies, the country is dotted with camels limping into the Eiwigkeit or coming from the same place. Trees appear to be strictly confined to the suburbs of the city. Very good. If you look long enough across the sands, while a voice in your ear <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> of half-buried cities, old as old Time, and wholly unvisited by Sahibs, of districts where the white man is unknown, and of the wonders of far-away Jeysulmir ruled by a half-distraught king, sand-locked and now smitten by a terrible food and water famine, you will, if it happen that you are of a sedentary and civilised nature, experience a new emotion--will be conscious of a great desire to take one of the lobbing camels and get away into the desert, away from the last touch of To-day, to meet the Past face to face. Some day a novelist will exploit the unknown land from the Rann, where the wild ass breeds, northward and eastward, till he comes to the Indus.|$|E
60|$|For bear in mind, that St. Paul {{does not}} say, if one member suffers, {{all the rest}} ought to suffer with it: he says that they do suffer with it. He does not say merely, {{that we ought to}} feel for our fellow townsmen; he says, that God has so {{tempered}} the body together as to force one member to have the same care of the others as of itself; that if we do not care to feel for them, we shall be made to feel with them. One limb cannot choose whether or not it will feel the disease of another limb. If one limb be in pain, the whole body must be uneasy, whether it will or not. And if one class in a town, or parish, or county, be degraded, or in want, the whole town, or parish, or county, must be the worse for it. St. Paul is not preaching up sentimental sympathy: he <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> of a plain fact. He is not saying, 'It is a very fine and saintly thing, and will increase your chance of heaven, to help the poor.' He is saying, 'If you neglect the poor, you neglect yourself; if you degrade the poor, you degrade yourself. His poverty, his carelessness, his immorality, his dirt, his ill-health, will punish you; for you and he are members of the same body, knit together inextricably for weal or woe, by the eternal laws according to which the Lord Jesus Christ has constituted human society; and if you break those laws, they will avenge themselves.'--My friends, do we not see them avenge themselves daily? The slave-holder refuses to acknowledge that his slave {{is a member of the}} same body as himself; but he does not go unpunished: the degradation to which he has brought his slave degrades him, by throwing open to him. the downward path of lust, laziness, ungoverned and tyrannous tempers, and the other sins which have in all ages, slowly but surely, worked the just ruin of slave-holding states. The sinner is his own tempter, and the sinner is his own executioner: he lies in wait for his own life (says Solomon) when he lies in wait for his brother's. Do you see the same law working in our own free country? If you leave the poor careless and filthy, you can obtain no good servants: if you leave them profligate, they make your sons profligate also: if you leave them tempted by want, your property is unsafe: if you leave them uneducated, reckless, improvident, you cannot get your work properly done, and have to waste time and money in watching your workmen instead of trusting them. Why, what are all poor-rates and county-rates, if you will consider, but God's plain proof to us, that the poor are members of the same body as ourselves; and that if we will not help them of our own free will, we shall find it necessary to help them against our will: that if we will not pay a little to prevent them becoming pauperized or criminal, we must pay a great deal to keep them when they have become so? We may draw a lesson--and a most instructive one it is--from the city of Liverpool, in which it was lately proved that crime--and especially the crime of uneducated boys and girls--had cost, in the last few years, the city many times more than it would cost to educate, civilize, and depauperize the whole rising generation of that city, and had been a tax upon the capital and industry of Liverpool, so enormous that they would have submitted to it from no Government on earth; and yet they had been blindly inflicting it upon themselves for years, simply because they chose to forget that they were their brothers' keepers.|$|E
