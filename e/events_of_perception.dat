40|$|This {{research}} paper explores the philosophical, conceptual and technical relations that surround {{and support the}} idea of photo-audience: the hearing of light through technologically mediated sensory expansion. Key ideas are presented through examples from both philosophy and contemporary arts practice, elaborating on the ways in which sensory experience is inherently inter-modal, and becomes further enhanced through the introduction of technological mediation. The examples presented in this paper are drawn from diverse sources including the experiential philosophies of Michel Serres and William James, Michel Chion’s understanding of mediated perceptions, and the scientific philosophies of Gaston Bachelard and Gilbert Simondon. The artists discussed in relation to these theories include David Haines and Joyce Hinterding, Robin Fox, Evelina Domnitch and Dmitry Gelfand, Michael Vorfeld and Stephen Vitiello. The body of work that has been developed through this candidature attempts to open up a shift in attention, expanding the edges of what is available to perception by presenting experiences and recordings of photo-audient transductions of subtle light phenomena. These include the scintillations of starlight and the tiny flashes of bioluminescent marine algae. These works bring light and sound together, correlated into <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> that are mediated through high-resolution technologies and open up experience and understanding through transduction and transformation.

40|$|The hard problem – {{focusing}} essentially on vision here – is in {{fact the}} problem of the origin of our image of the external world. This formulation in terms of the “image” is never seen stated, for the forms populating our image of the world are considered computable, and not considered qualia – the “redness” of the cube is the problem, not the cube as form. Form, however, cannot be divorced from motion and hence from time. Therefore we must examine the classical, spatial metaphysic of space and time, for practical purposes initiated by Galileo, wherein the real has been equated with the quantitative and wherein quality has been stripped from the material world. In this metaphysic, which sees form as quantitative or computable, the origin of qualia is problematic, with a problem of even greater primacy becoming the “memory” that supports the transforming <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception,</b> e. g., rotating cubes, buzzing flies, twisting leaves. It is this memory, supporting time-extended, flowing events, that necessarily supports all qualia. The concept of storage of “snapshots” of time-flowing events, a notion which the classic metaphysic engenders, is unworkable as a solution to the perception of these flows. Form, in fact being dynamic and defined over flowing fields, equally is a quality, equally requires this memory, and since forms populate the image, the origin of the entire image is indeed a problem. The counter-proposal becomes Bergson’s temporal metaphysic wherein motion is indivisible (or non-differentiable), the global motion of the universal field itself then carrying an intrinsic form of memory. In this framework, with this field viewed as holographic, Bergson provides a unique solution – one that leaves the problem of representation behind – as to how the brain specifies the qualitative image of the dynamically transforming external world...|$|E

40|$|Integration {{of emotion}} {{in a virtual}} agent is a topic of {{research}} to depict human-like behavior in a simulated environment. For the last few decades, many researchers are {{working in the field}} of incorporating emotions in a virtual agent. In the emotion model, the behavior of an agent depends upon how the event is perceived by the agent with respect to the goal. Hence, <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the <b>event</b> while considering the past experience, importance <b>of</b> <b>event</b> towards achieving goal, agent’s own capabilities and resources is an important process which directly influences the decision making and action selection. The proposed models, till date, are either too complex to adapt or are using a very few parameters to describe the event. So, in this paper, we propose an extension <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> process in an existing emotion model, EMIA and suggest the formalization <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> and appraisal processes to make it adaptable.

40|$|Music can {{be studied}} in an {{objective}} way. Perceived music, however, is not reducible to its acoustic qualities, but {{can be considered as}} a collection of sound/time phenomena, which have the potential of being structured. What we hear at every moment, however, is only a small temporal window on the perceptual flux, a “now-moment” that can be extended in time. The delimitation of this extension is shaped by psychological and ecological constraints and is dependent upon mechanisms of sense-making and attentional strategies. Two mechanisms are discussed: the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> with events being defined as sequences of stimuli that are extended in time and that can be described in terms of their invariants, and the ecological concept <b>of</b> affordance. The <b>events</b> can be considered as the units <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and memory.

40|$|Human {{error is}} {{commonly}} differentiated into three different types. These are: errors in perception, errors in decision and errors in sensation. This analysis {{is based on}} classical psychophysics (Fechner, 1860) and describes the errors <b>of</b> detection and <b>perception.</b> Decision- making errors are evaluated {{in terms of the}} theory of signal detection (McNicholson, 1974), and errors of sensation or sensitivity are evaluated in terms of proprioceptive information (van Beers, 2001).

Each of the described errors types are interdependent of each other in such a manner that observable stress in behaviour may be caused due to: the inadequate performance of a task due to the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the person (i. e. from right to left for a right-handed person); performing a task that requires attentive decision-making to be performed too hastily; undertaking a task that does not correspond to the prevailing disposition of the person. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between pointing production in infants and two types <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> factors: spatial localization (e. g. eccentricity <b>of</b> visual <b>events</b> with respect to an initial fixation point) and salience of targets (addition to visual <b>events</b> <b>of</b> sound or object translation through space). Three experiments revealed that target characteristics, such as internal movement, sound, vanishing and translation through space (including disappearance) significantly influenced the incidence and latency of pointing, whereas the main effect of target localization was to determine which hand does the gesture. In particular, there was an advantage to the right side of the visual field in eliciting pointing when there is competition between targets. Finally, for events involving auditory-visual stimulation females made more right-handed points than males. The general advantage of the right hand for pointing may offer further evidence for a specific link between pointing, cerebral dominance and the transition to speech...|$|R

When we meditate we acquire skills related to thought that allow us to observe how we perceive and signify interaction with the other, which distances us from the response to the meaning <b>of</b> this <b>perception.</b> This way <b>of</b> attending to <b>events</b> can {{have a negative effect on}} the tendency to make dispositional attributions, which are generally more conflictive, since the person making the attribution blames the other for the unpleasant situation he or she is experiencing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop an instructional method utilizing event perception to affect the graphic abilities <b>of</b> young children. <b>Event</b> <b>perception</b> has been described by E. J. Gibson as the detection of invariant properties over a temporalspatial sequence of stimulation. This involves attending to aspects of permanence in an object's size, shape, ratios, proportions or other distinguishing characteristics over continuous transformations in time and space. The detection of these invariant properties facilitates the constant identification of visual phenomena as well as unifying sequential information. The instructional strategy in this study employed event perception training as a means to aid children in their development of drawing skills. The sample was comprised of fifty-seven third grade students in three intact classes in a private New York City elementary school. One group received perceptual training in the detection of invariant properties of moving objects undergoing transformation in time and space; a second group received traditional drawing instruction in composition and drawing techniques, while the third group received no treatment and served as a control section. Students in all three groups were pre- and post-tested using the Frostig Developmental Test <b>of</b> Visual <b>Perception</b> (DTVP) and the Event Perception Drawing Test (EPDT). The DTVP consisted of five sub-tests designed to test and measure a specific type of perceptual ability. These abilities were operationally defined as: eye-hand coordination, figure ground <b>perception,</b> constancy <b>of</b> shape, position in space and spatial relationships. The EPDT was used to assess ability to perceive and draw invariant properties in visual information undergoing apparent transformation in time and space. The test task involved the sequenced illustration <b>of</b> a narrated <b>event</b> and was completed in five consecutive drawings. The pre and post-test drawings of the subjects in all three groups were subjected to a critique by three independent judges using a test scale designed for the study. The scale consisted of six criterion items associated with the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> an event; size transformation, shape transformation, spatial transformation, kinetic occlusion, movement and causality. Data gathered during this investigation was subjected to analysis of covariance techniques and, when significant ratios were obtained, t-tests were conducted. The confidence level for testing the null hypotheses was set at an alpha of. 05. Review of the data led to the following conclusions:(A) Subjects receiving drawing instruction which included the observation and recognition of physical invariants in moving, temporarily occluded objects achieved significantly higher drawing scores than subjects in the Traditional Drawing and Control Groups. The resulting data indicated that the treatment incorporating event perception training was more successful than drawing instruction in composition and materials. (B) Group performance on the Developmental Test <b>of</b> Visual <b>Perception</b> remained unchanged. The effect of the experimental treatments was inconclusive in this instance. While this investigation made no attempt to assess the aesthetic effects <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> treatment, it does point out that data acquired through visual perceptual activity may serve as a resource for creative work. More research is required to examine the aesthetic effects <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> training in general perceptual development. The findings suggest, however, that the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> tasks may stimulate perceptual inquiry, and can thereby aid children in developing the necessary drawing skills to represent changes occurring over time and space. The results of this study also seem to confirm that a source of visual information for art is dependent upon an observer's ability to engage in perceptual inquiry. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} were (1) to {{investigate}} two forms <b>of</b> <b>event</b> perception: <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> movement and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> sudden appearance, (2) to develop event perception procedures which {{could be applied to}} testing clinical populations, and (3) to relate event perception to abnormalities shown by neuroimaging. In addition issues relevant to each of the particular clinical populations involved were addressed. Event perception tasks used stimuli consisting of a background of randomly selected dots of light. In one task a dot was added to the display (appearance), in the other a dot started to move (movement onset). Four laboratory experiments were conducted examining the ability to detect and locate these events under varying conditions in healthy controls. Results indicated that neuronal coding strategies were different for appearances and movement onset. Laboratory tasks were adapted for clinical application and administered to groups of patients with different neurological conditions. Five studies were conducted to assess sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> the <b>Event</b> <b>Perception</b> tasks in clinical settings. The groups studied were chronic solvent abusers, detoxified alcoholics, patients suffering from optic neuritis, and patients with traumatic brain injury. Event Perception tasks were found to be differentially sensitive to neurological conditions and showed dissociations and double dissociations both within and between neurological conditions. Relationships with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) were investigated in patients with head injury. Patterns of brain damage differed significantly for patients with impaired performance on the movement task. It is concluded that <b>Event</b> <b>Perception</b> tasks are <b>of</b> value in the assessment of neurological patients: They allow assessment of functions which are not usually evaluated in neuropsychological examinations, facilitate detection of subtle deficits and deficits which may present at an early stage, and offer greater specificity and sensitivity than many traditional neuropsychological test procedures. Event Perception tasks are easy to administer and do not suffer from training effects on repeated administration to the same degree as many traditional measures. It is also argued that tests with a theoretical basis are better suited to clinical research in neuropsychology than many traditional tasks because they potentially allow a more precise explanation and assessment of the abnormal processes under investigation...|$|R

30|$|If {{stressful}} events are {{more accessible to}} memory and more often recovered, they might assume a central position in a person’s identity. This could alter the tendency for a more positive life events narrative (Boals, 2010), making way for traumatic events that come to be central to exert negative impacts on mental health (Berntsen et al. 2011). The negative experiences turn into a point of reference for further <b>perceptions,</b> interpretation <b>of</b> new <b>events</b> and everyday inferences. Consequently, {{it is likely that}} the person will overestimate the frequency <b>of</b> such <b>events</b> and the possibility of experiencing them, and happenings alike, in the future. The overestimation yields unnecessary concerns and precautions, such as avoiding certain classes <b>of</b> <b>events</b> because <b>of</b> the <b>perception</b> that they may lead to specific risks (Berntsen & Rubin 2006 a, b). Corroborating with these hypotheses, the EC is associated with posttraumatic (Berntsen & Rubin 2006 a, b) and depressive (Boals, 2010) symptoms, contradicting the widespread view that the traumatic memory is poorly integrated into one’s life. Instead, enhanced or overintegration appears to be the case (Berntsen & Rubin, 2007).|$|R
40|$|L’Education sentimentale may be {{construed}} as an historical novel at least insofar as it addresses questions of social change and enduring value as they are related to those of history and individual memory. As in Balzac and later in Proust, what {{is true for the}} individual applies to society. There is an especially Flaubertian understanding of movement in society and movement across time that remains tied more to demands of diegetic coherence than to laws of historical necessity, however. Singulative narration as it appears in the novel is a kind of smoke screen hiding a more pervasive iteration whereby the recounting <b>of</b> <b>events</b> and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> spring from an identical understanding of time. Yet, there is more to it than purely narratological concerns. Neither historical nor psychological (as that term might be understood, as in Proust, to describe a dynamism), time for Flaubert is an affective by-product <b>of</b> <b>events</b> filtered through conscious memory. To be sure, time as an external agent of change does exist; Mme Arnoux’s hair will turn grey, after all. What matters more than this, though, is the sense of time generated by the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>events.</b> To better understand this relationship, we will focus on Flaubert’s representation of social dynamism that has as its backdrop and point of comparison the social dynamism portrayed in La Comédie humaine and particularly the works of the early to mid- 1830 s. Flaubert, of course, is explicit in this, and it has often been pointed out that, with Le Père Goriot especially, Balzac provides one of the principal intertexts for L’Education sentimentale. Notwithstanding the excellent critical studies already devoted to the topic of Flaubert and, Balzac, the backdrop remains an instructive one, not only for the purposes of dramatic irony, characterization and narrative voice, but because Balzac’s understanding of value in modern society as tied to social expression does not hold in narrative time, at least not as understood by Flaubert. We will first have a look at Flaubert’s early use of Balzac in a context of parody, and then sketch out how parody develops into the deeper thematic concern of repetition as cliche and its translation into an idiom of time, memory and affect...|$|R

30|$|The {{current work}} is, to our knowledge, {{the first to}} combine a study of perceptual-cognitive skills with event {{perception}} and it is, therefore, mainly of an explorative nature. We took theoretical research out {{into the real world}} and investigated the role of top-down factors on event completion by testing three groups with a differing level of interest and experience (novices, players, and FIFA referees) on a simple event-completion task (Strickland &amp; Keil, 2011). Although there is considerable evidence that expertise in sports domains is connected to superior perceptual-cognitive skills, our results indicate no influence of these skills on event perception. They rather support a recent publication by Firestone and Scholl (2015 b), who concluded that perception may be largely independent of top-down influences. Such a proposition not only challenges our theoretical understanding <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception,</b> but also has substantive practical implications for fairness in sports by strongly advocating the increased use of technology instead of perceptual training programs for match officials.|$|R
30|$|Hypotheses In {{the current}} study, we conceptually {{replicated}} the design by Strickland and Keil (2011) and tested two expert groups (football players and FIFA referees) and {{a control group}} (students with no interest in football).

Based on the currently most prominent model <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception,</b> the event segmentation theory (EST; Zacks, Speer, Swallow, Braver, & Reynolds, 2007), prediction errors occur and an event boundary is perceived when certain event features change (e.g., situational features such as spatial location and characters: Zacks, Speer, & Reynolds, 2009). If online predictions of experts are more detailed, {{it may be more}} likely that the missing ball contact is actually reported to be perceived as a missing situational feature in the schema, and, thus, not perceptually filled in. More specifically, a more detailed representation would result in a lower false-alarm rate in referees and players.|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{measured the}} efficiency of monitoring complex scenes composed of changing objects, or events. All events lasted about 4 s, but in a given block of trials, could be of a single type (single task) or of multiple types (multitask, with a total <b>of</b> four <b>event</b> types). Overall accuracy <b>of</b> detecting target <b>events</b> amid distractors was higher for single event types relative to multiple types. Multiple event types were processed reasonably well when each event type was restricted to its own region, and much worse when event types were mixed in location. In most task conditions, observers reached an optimal level of performance (optimal attentional set). After one target was identified, performance for other targets dropped markedly and then recovered to optimal levels. However, set was not optimized when task locations were intermixed. The results {{support the idea that}} attentional set determines the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>event</b> <b>perception</b> in complex scenes. Although single event set was most efficient, there can be a reasonably efficient set for multiple event types...|$|R
