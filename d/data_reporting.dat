The complaint included preparing the JAACAP article about study 329, exaggerating paroxetine's efficacy while downplaying the risks, and using the article to promote the drug for adolescent use, which was not approved by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|Edison/Mitofsky {{conducted}} an exit poll {{on behalf of}} the National Election Pool which is the only source of data on voter demographics in California in the 2008 election. The statistical trends from the exit poll of 2,240 voters suggested that an array of voters came out both in opposition to and in support of Proposition 8, with no single demographic group making up most of either the Yes or No vote. The National Election Pool poll showed that support for Proposition 8 was strong amongst African American voters, interviewed in the exit poll with 70% in favor, more than any other racial group. Their support was considered crucial to the proposition's passing, since African Americans made up an unusually larger percentage of voters that year, due to the presence of Barack Obama on the ballot. Polls by both the Associated Press and CNN mirrored this <b>data,</b> <b>reporting</b> support among black voters to be at 70% and 75%, respectively. A later study by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), examining the black vote only from five counties within the state, suggested that black support was closer to 58%.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, biological sciences converged with previously differentiated new and classic disciplines like Physics into research fields like Biophysics. [...] Advances were made in analytical chemistry and physics instrumentation including improved sensors, optics, tracers, instrumentation, signal processing, networks, robots, satellites, and compute power for data collection, storage, analysis, modeling, visualization, and simulations. [...] These technology advances allowed theoretical and experimental research including internet publication of molecular biochemistry, biological systems, and ecosystems science. [...] This enabled worldwide access to better measurements, theoretical models, complex simulations, theory predictive model experimentation, analysis, worldwide internet observational <b>data</b> <b>reporting,</b> open peer-review, collaboration, and internet publication.

2500|$|On November 8, 2012, {{university}} officials {{announced that they}} had misreported admissions data on their student body for over a decade. Specifically, it overstated {{the number of students}} who had graduated from high school in the top ten percent of their classes by twenty percentage points. Officials made the assumption that students with top standardized test scores and high grade point averages were in the top tenth of their class when secondary schools did not provide class rank (roughly two-thirds of American high schools do not rank their students). Consequently, U.S. News & World Report removed the school from its rankings. It had been ranked in a three-way tie for the 51st position among national universities but following revelation of the misreporting U.S. News altered the GW entry to read [...] "George Washington University has changed from being a ranked school in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges to an unranked school, based on a <b>data</b> <b>reporting</b> error."
