5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|On a short trip, Chidambaram {{reveals his}} {{identity}} to Vishwanathan's daughters, who agree to play along. Viswanathan, believing Ashok {{is the only}} heir of a millionaire, asks Kanchana's consent to marry him. When Kanchana rejects the proposal, Viswanathan asks Nirmala, who happily accepts. Sachidanandam, who is buying a nearby estate, is referred to Viswanathan and arrives in Chinnamalai. They meet and discover that they are childhood friends. Thinking <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to marry off his younger daughter while the elder one is still unmarried, Viswanathan arranges Kanchana's marriage to Vasu, who meets his father is unable to reveal his true identity to prevent getting caught. When Sachidanandam returns to Chennai to make the wedding preparations, he finds {{that there has been}} no word from his son, who left for Coimbatore weeks before. Sachidanandam almost cancels the marriage when Vasu makes a telephone call {{in the nick of time}} and approves the marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Ian McKellen {{was offered}} the role, but he turned it down, having played the similar {{character}} Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as feeling <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to take Harris's role, as Harris had called McKellen a [...] "dreadful" [...] actor. Harris's family had {{expressed an interest in}} seeing Peter O'Toole being chosen as his replacement.|$|R
50|$|The British {{government}} disagreed on {{the grounds}} that it was honouring its own citizens who only happened to be Canadians as well. It held that it <b>was</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the Prime Minister of Canada to advise the Queen of the United Kingdom, just as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the British Prime Minister to advise the Queen of Canada on Canadian domestic affairs.|$|R
25|$|Even {{if there}} was a {{quantitative}} and incremental increase in guilt or mischief associated with trafficking in just over 15grams of diamorphine as opposed to just under 15grams, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to respond to this with a qualitative and non-incremental increase in the prescribed penalty.|$|E
25|$|At {{the martial}} {{exhibition}} where the Kaurava and Pandava princes demonstrate their skills before their elders, their guru Drona {{and the people}} of the kingdom, the great effulgent warrior Karna appears and challenges Arjuna, who is considered by Drona to be the best of the warrior princes. But Karna is humiliated when Kripa asks him to ascertain his caste, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for unequals to compete.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on hold for a time.|$|E

The Outback is a place where an astronomer's dreams come true. Imagine the uninterrupted views of the Universe...|$|R
50|$|When {{discussing}} why Forte {{did not use}} any {{of their}} celebrity status in their commercial, Lisa inadvertently insulted Trump when she stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for Dayana and Penn to star in the commercial as lovers, given the 31-year difference in their ages. Trump, while taking the remark in good spirits, pointed out that he is 26 years older than his wife Melania.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, in 2003 a {{controversy}} arose in Sudbury {{when the city}} government voted against flying the flag at Tom Davies Square for St-Jean-Baptiste Day, claiming that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the city government to display on public property a symbol representative of {{only a portion of}} the city's population. In 2006, new mayor John Rodriguez reversed that decision, permitting the flag to be flown, but was again criticized by some voters for acting unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|Working {{with the}} ALARP principle, before {{a patient is}} exposed for a nuclear {{medicine}} examination, {{the benefit of the}} examination must be identified.

25|$|Bamber {{attended}} St Nicholas Primary, {{followed by}} Maldon Court, a private prep school, then from September 1970 Gresham's School, {{a boarding school}} in Norfolk. Claire Powell writes that Nevill felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to send the boy to a local school for the village children, when he might one day have to employ them on the farm. This led, writes Powell, to {{a situation in which}} Bamber felt increasingly alienated from his family and their life in the countryside, as did his sister, who was also sent to boarding school.|$|E

40|$|It {{seems to}} me that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>inappropriate</b> to confine this paper to a {{discussion}} on the role of workers 2 ̆ 7 representatives at top management level. Management is a function which occurs at all levels in a firm, from the activities of a firstline supervisor on the shop floor to those of a general manager. This is why so many people prefer the phrase industrial democracy, conveying the idea, as it does, of a lifestyle, a manner of approach, more profound than the particular and varying institutions which give it expression...|$|R
25|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a number of}} firsts in the British version's history: {{the first time a}} candidate was fired outside of the final boardroom; and the first time a project manager did not have a choice on who to bring back to the final boardroom. In addition, after the world economy experienced a severe downturn following this series, Sir Alan admitted that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for the series to continue to be filmed in exotic locations. Production staff subsequently filmed later series within the UK, and within the European Union on rare occasions, up until filming began for the ninth series.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Sir Keith Holyoake, {{a former}} National Party Prime Minister and a serving Minister of State was {{controversially}} appointed as Governor-General. It was suggested by many commentators that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to entrust {{the office to}} a former party leader or anyone who is closely allied with a political party. However, despite his background, Holyoake could {{not be said to}} have discharged his duties in a partisan way, and he served for only three years. Since the 1970s, the Prime Minister has always confided with the Leader of the Opposition during the nomination process, in an attempt to reduce partisan influence.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 {{the issue}} of the {{abolition}} of capital punishment was brought before parliament. A clause within the Criminal Justice Bill called for an experimental five-year suspension of the death penalty. When war broke out in 1939 the bill was postponed. It was revived after the war and to everyone's surprise was adopted by a majority in the House of Commons (245 to 222). In the House of Lords the abolition clause was defeated but the remainder of the bill was passed. Popular support for abolition was absent and the government decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for it to assert its supremacy by invoking the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 over such an unpopular issue.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Juergensmeyer {{describes}} {{the teachings of}} Islam as ambiguous about violence. He states that, like all religions, Islam occasionally allows for force while stressing that the main spiritual goal is one of nonviolence and peace. [...] Ralph W. Hood, Peter C.

25|$|The director, Manmohan Desai, {{altered the}} ending of Coolie after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's {{character}} was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate,</b> said Desai, {{for the man who}} had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.|$|R
30|$|The three {{distinct}} segments of high-technology focused VCs exhibit a substantial variation in strategies relied on by them {{to address the}} information asymmetry risks involved in technology investing. Not only are the DVCs different from the FVCs in this regard, but the latter also exhibit a considerable variation among themselves. Naturally, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>inappropriate</b> to categorize FVCs into a single uniform segment. Categorizing them as separate segments based on their high-tech focus enables us to capture the non-linearities {{with respect to their}} strategy usage therein.

On 1 January 1949, as ceasefire was implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, {{and as it}} was becoming too late to honour the war heroes from 1947–1948 Indo-Pak War, Prime Minister Nehru forwarded the draft to Governor General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari to [...] "institute the awards as your own". But Rajagopalachari felt that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>inappropriate</b> for him to institute the awards, which {{did not have the}} King's approval, and India still being a dominion.

Asserting that ABC {{had made a}} [...] "big mistake" [...] by airing it {{as a part of}} their Wonderful World of Disney series, she thought that it was [...] "often nightmarish", harking back to the original Grimm version more than the better-known Disney adaptation; in particular, she singled out the [...] "evil queen/witch" [...] and [...] "satanic messenger who grants wishes." [...] However, she praised David Brisbin's set design, remarking that he had created a kingdom which was [...] "equal parts gingerbread baroque and David Lynch" [...] and that Caroline Thompson [...] "clearly relishes" [...] in this universe. Noting that the [...] "magnificently villainous performance" [...] from Miranda Richardson [...] "virtually steals the show" [...] from the [...] "doe-eyed" [...] Kristin Kreuk, she believes that the latter does [...] "little to upgrade" [...] the image of Snow White as the most victimized of fairytale characters.|$|E
