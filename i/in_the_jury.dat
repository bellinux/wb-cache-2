5|$|The {{defendants}} alleged in {{an affidavit}} that only {{women who were}} members of the Illinois League of Women Voters and who had completed a jury training class (taught by a local prosecutor) were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool.

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura out of the window, but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> system.|$|E

500|$|One {{important}} {{variation is}} [...] "group dynamics analysis". Some jury selection {{is concerned with}} the attitudes and bias of individuals.
