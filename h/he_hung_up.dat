5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Carson's {{death in}} 2005, Rivers {{said that he}} had never spoken to her again. In 2008, during an {{interview}} with Dr. Pamela Connolly on television's Shrink Rap, Rivers claimed she did call Carson, but <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on her at once and repeated the gesture when she called again.|$|E
25|$|Balaskas took nine wickets {{in three}} Tests against Australia the {{following}} winter, and playing for Transvaal took 8–60 against Western Province in 1937/38, {{but there was}} to be only one further international appearance, against England at Cape Town in 1938/39, and a return of 0–115, together with the coming of World War II, sealed his fate as a Test cricketer. He resumed his domestic cricket career after the war, and enjoyed a fine 1945/46 season when he took 47 wickets at 15.95, but after a couple of matches the following year <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> his bat for good.|$|E

25|$|Muster {{reached his}} last {{top-level}} tournament final in Estoril (on clay) in 1998, losing to Alberto Berasategui. At the 1998 French Open, Muster reached the quarterfinals, before losing to Félix Mantilla in four sets, with Mantilla getting revenge for his 1998 Italian Open defeat. Muster's 1998 results faded after the spring, {{as he reached}} just one semifinal (Mallorca), and one quarterfinal (Boston), {{for the remainder of}} the year. Muster opened 1999 with a semifinal showing in Sydney, but then struggled over the next few months, winning just 2 of his 12 matches after Sydney. Following his first-round loss to Nicolás Lapentti at the 1999 French Open, <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> his racquet at the age of 31. Muster remains the only world no. 1 singles player who has never managed to win a men's singles match at Wimbledon throughout his whole career.|$|E
500|$|With Brown gone, halfback Leroy Kelly {{became the}} team's primary rusher in 1966. Kelly, an eighth-round draft choice who saw limited playing {{time in two}} years as a backup, ably filled his predecessor's shoes. Cleveland missed the playoffs in 1966, but {{made it to the}} postseason the {{following}} year after a realignment of the NFL's divisions that placed the Browns in the new Century Division. The Browns, however, lost the 1967 eastern conference championship to the Dallas Cowboys. After a year in which he made just 11 of 23 field goal attempts, placekicker Lou Groza, the last remaining player from the inaugural 1946 Browns team, retired {{before the start of the}} 1968 season. Groza, who had been on the roster for 21 seasons and was 44 years old when <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> his spikes, said in his memoir that retiring was [...] "the saddest day of my football life." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Burnett {{made several}} {{phone calls to}} his wife {{beginning}} at 09:30:32 from rows24 and 25, though he was assigned a seat in rowfour. Burnett explained that the plane had been hijacked by men claiming to have a bomb. He also said that a passenger had been stabbed with a knife and that he believed the bomb threat was a ruse to control the passengers. During one of Tom Burnett's calls, his wife informed him of {{the attacks on the}} World Trade Center and he replied that the hijackers were [...] "talking about crashing this plane.... Oh my God. It's a suicide mission." [...] He began pumping her for information about the attacks, interrupting her {{from time to time to}} tell the others nearby what she was saying. Then <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> He ended his last call by saying, [...] "Don't worry, we're going to do something." [...] An unknown flight attendant attempted to contact the United Airlines maintenance facility at 09:32:29. The call lasted 95 seconds, but was not received as it may have been in queue. Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called the maintenance facility at 09:35:40 from row33. She reported the flight had been hijacked by men with knives who were in the cabin and flight deck and had stabbed another flight attendant, possibly Debbie Welsh.|$|E

50|$|His {{overthrow}} apparently {{occurred in}} a spontaneous uprising caused by years of cruelty and hardship shortly after he made somebody eat his own nose (Interesting Times). Following this rebellion, <b>he</b> was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> by his 'figgin'. Lord Vetinari's rise to power is still undocumented.|$|R
500|$|Unfortunately, {{their journey}} {{does not pay}} off well. The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E
2500|$|The {{standoff}} with police lasted for approximately four hours. Poplawski's friend Edward Perkovic {{said he got}} a call at work from Poplawski during which he said, [...] "Eddie, I am going to die today. ... Tell your family I love them and I love you." [...] Perkovic said [...] "I heard gunshots and <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> ... He sounded like he was in pain, like he got shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the last}} season in which Hitchman served as Shore's defence partner. [...] The 1934 season proved his last, and slowed by injuries, he retired mid-season. [...] His last match was February 22 against Hitchman's old Senators team, after which the Bruins {{announced}} that his #3 jersey would be permanently retired, the second professional sports team to do so, after the Maple Leafs retired Ace Bailey's #6. [...] He played a handful of games {{at the end of}} the 1934 season for the minor league Boston Cubs, after which <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> his skates for good.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990 {{a number}} of left-wing representatives within the Labour Party, led by Michael D. Higgins, {{approached}} Browne and suggested {{that he should be}} the party's candidate in the presidential election due later that year. Though in failing health Browne agreed. However the offer horrified party leader Dick Spring and his close associates for two reasons. Firstly, the leadership had secretly decided to run former senator and barrister Mary Robinson. Secondly, many around Spring were [...] "appalled" [...] at the idea of running Browne, believing he had [...] "little or no respect for the party" [...] and [...] "was likely in any event to self-destruct as a candidate." [...] When Browne was informed by Spring by telephone that the party's Administrative Council had chosen Robinson over him, <b>he</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on Spring. Browne spent the remaining seven years of his life constantly criticising Robinson—who had gone on to win the election, thus becoming the seventh President of Ireland, and who was considered highly popular during her term. During the campaign he also indicated support for the rival Fine Gael candidate, Austin Currie.|$|E

50|$|Hilaire began {{painting}} {{from a young}} age. Already at fifteen, he discovered the work of Albrecht Dürer in the Metz city library and began making copies of it.

It was thus that he enrolled at Beaux-Arts.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{accounts}} of cell phone conversations, Glick, along with Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham and Tom Burnett, formed {{a plan to}} take the plane back from the hijackers, and led other passengers in this effort.
