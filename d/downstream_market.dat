50|$|Vertical mergers are mergers between {{firms that}} operate at {{different}} but complementary {{levels in the}} chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an upstream market for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a <b>downstream</b> <b>market</b> for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product. In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same relevant market. As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either relevant market. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other. Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.|$|E

40|$|According to many {{academic}} researches, {{the development}} of marketing capabilities can enhance organizational performance. Similarly, <b>downstream</b> <b>marketing</b> capabilities {{have an important role}} in accomplishment the organizational goals. Particularly the <b>downstream</b> <b>marketing</b> capabilities identified in this research are the Marketing Communication, Selling, Marketing implementation, and Market information management. These four capabilities are summarized under the following abilities. First, the ability to manage customers’ opinion regarding the offered value from the organization. Second, the ability of the organization to obtain orders from new and established customers. Third, the ability of aligning and translate the marketing strategy into an operating action plan along with the deployment of the organizational resources. Forth, the continuous process of gathering and managing information about the markets. Moreover, the literature review of this research shed light on the elements that compose the <b>downstream</b> <b>marketing</b> capabilities. Specifically, this research examined the downstream processes and the required information required to control these processes based on the American Productivity and Quality Center’s Process Classification Framework. Furthermore, the literature review examined some of the technological tools that are used in marketing processes, and also some managerial implication regarding the management of the <b>downstream</b> <b>marketing</b> employees. Along with the investigation of <b>downstream</b> <b>marketing</b> capabilities, the literature review investigated the utilization and the benefits of Component Business Model and Process Classification Framework, as they are defined by the organizations that developed them. Besides this initial study, the research presents how the examined organization is using the two frameworks together by cross-referring them. Finally, the research presents the optimal deployment of the collected downstream capabilities elements in the current organizational structure. The optimal deployment has been grounded on the information collected from the literature review but also from internal documentation, provided from the examined organization. By comparing the optimal deployment and the current condition on the organization, the research exhibits some points for improvement, but also some of the projects that are currently in progress inside the organization and eventually will provide solutions to these downsides...|$|R
5000|$|An {{economic}} theory {{referred to as}} ICE (Internalizing Complementary Externalities) suggests that when a monopolist seeks to expand their monopoly into other market levels, such an expansion is pro-competitive, {{because there is no}} reason for a monopolist to expand into an upstream or <b>downstream</b> <b>market</b> unless they are more efficient than competitors. This is because in a multi-level market, customers only gain a single final product, and are willing to pay only one [...] "monopoly price" [...] for this good. If a monopolist already owns one level of the market, then they can extract the entire monopoly price by increasing the prices on their level and expanding into other levels of the market since they are already getting the entire monopoly prices. To make it clearer, the total profits a monopolist can earn if it seeks to leverage its monopoly in one market by dominating a complementary market are theoretically no greater than the extra profits it could earn in an unregulated environment simple by charging more for the monopoly product itself. However,these measures which monopoly adopts to promote competition in complementary market might increase the total demands for the products through multi-level market.|$|E

The antitrust implications of the model depend on the relative degree of oligopoly rivalry in the upstream and down- stream markets. Firms strategically precommit to setting prices in the less rivalrous market, which serves to soft- en competition in the more rivalrous market, resulting in anticompetitive effects. Bertrand prices emerge in equilibrium when the markets are equally rivalrous, while Cournot outcomes arise with upstream monopsony or <b>downstream</b> monopoly <b>markets.</b> The slope of firm reaction functions depends on relative rivalry, a feature we use to derive testable hypotheses for antitrust analysis {{of a wide variety}} of industry practices...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a network industry {{characterized by an}} upstream natural monopoly with cost uncertainty, regulated through an access price mechanism, and an unregulated <b>downstream</b> <b>market</b> with Cournot competition. The upstream monopolist can acquire information on the upstream cost while the information acquisition is prohibitively costly for the regulator and downstream firms. The information acquisition is also unobservable. I investigate how the presence of costly and socially valuable information on the upstream cost affects the desirability of allowing the upstream monopolist to produce in the <b>downstream</b> <b>market</b> (integration) rather than excluding it (separation). I show that when the upstream monopolist is regulated only through an access price cap, the information acquisition problem provides an argument in favour of vertical integration. However, when the regulator also obliges the upstream monopolist to share her access profits with consumers, a bias emerges in favour of separation via {{the impact of the}} access-profit sharing plan on the upstream monopolist's incentives to transmit information to her rival in the <b>downstream</b> <b>market.</b> access price cap mechanisms, integration, separation, information acquisition. ...|$|E
