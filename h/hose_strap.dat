5000|$|A <b>hose</b> <b>strap</b> (also {{known as}} a rope hose tool) {{is a piece of}} {{firefighting}} equipment. It can be [...] "a short length of rope with an eye loop at one end and a metal hook at the other" [...] or a piece of [...] "flat nylon webbing sewn into a four-foot loop". Such a tool is routinely carried by firefighters in their structural turnout gear as a standard piece of personal equipment. [...] While the variety with a metal hook may be more versatile, the nylon loop weighs less, is less expensive, and can be safely carried in a pocket. The <b>hose</b> <b>strap</b> has been a firefighting tool in common use since at least 1918, and appears as early as 1898 in an inventory list of Seattle, Washington municipal firefighting equipment.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the terms}} {{may be used}} for a family of similar tools, they share a wide variety of {{established}} uses, including carrying un-charged fire hose, opening doors, closing doors, securing hoselines, dragging victims, and even carrying boots. [...] The use that gives the tool its name, however, is securing a charged hoseline, allowing a firefighter to better control and maneuver the line while flowing water. To use a <b>hose</b> <b>strap</b> in that manner, a firefighter secures the tool to the hoseline three to five feet behind the nozzle, using either the hook or a girth hitch, and loops {{the other end of the}} tool around his or her opposite side shoulder. [...] Since the tool is attached several feet behind the firefighter, its use will not hinder a firefighter wearing a Self-contained breathing apparatus. For larger attack lines, such as a 2+1/2 in hand line, second or third firefighters can use additional hose straps to secure the hose farther behind the nozzle operator, to provide additional leverage against the water pressure. Since multiple hose straps will typically be available to a team of firefighters, they can be used in combination to handle a variety of other tasks. For example, if a task requires greater length than that of a single <b>hose</b> <b>strap,</b> two hose straps may be connected via girth hitch.|$|E
60|$|All night Myles's {{sleep was}} more or less {{disturbed}} by dreams in which he was now conquering, now being conquered, and before the day had fairly broken he was awake. He lay upon his cot, keying himself up for the encounter which he had set upon himself to face, and it would not be the truth to say that the sight of those knives hidden in the straw the night before had made no impression upon him. By-and-by he knew the others were beginning to awake, for he heard them softly stirring, and as the light grew broad and strong, saw them arise, one by one, and begin dressing in the gray morning. Then he himself arose and put on his doublet and <b>hose,</b> <b>strapping</b> his belt tightly about his waist; then {{he sat down on the}} side of his cot.|$|R

This study investigated the influence of wearing the Oxylog mask, and heart rate monitor while the Oxylog instrument is supported in a stand versus that of wearing the Oxylog mask, heart rate monitor, and the Oxylog instrument on the estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and heart rate during a graduated submaximal step test protocol. The Oxylog instrument which includes a <b>hose,</b> <b>straps,</b> and mask adds approximately 4. 31 kgs (9. 5 lbs.) of weight to the individual when being worn in a study. Additionally, the influence of wearing the Oxylog mask, heart rate monitor, and Oxylog instrument versus that of just wearing a heart rate monitor on the heart rate of test participants in a graduated submaximal box lifting protocol was studied. Seventeen males, who were conditioned manual material handlers, participated in the study. Two step tests were completed by each participant, one with the instrument being supported in a stand and the participant just wearing the Oxylog mask and heart rate monitor, the second where the participant wore the Oxylog mask, heart rate monitor, and supported the Oxylog instrument. The tests were done in an order dictated by a Latin Square. The two lifting tests were also included in the Latin Square design, and required the participant to wear the Oxylog mask, heart rate monitor, and Oxylog instrument for one test and just a heart monitor for the second test. An estimated V 02 max was obtained for each participant through regression analysis of the step test data. Results from the two investigations indicate that {{there was no significant difference}} in the estimated maximal oxygen consumption (p = 0. 1 384), and no significant difference in the heart rate between the two lift tests. The analysis did show that the 4 th stage of the step tests indicated a statistically significant difference, (p= 0. 0259 for oxygen consumption, and p = 0. 0465 for heart rate). The results of this study indicate that for a short submaximal test the added weight and restrictions of the Oxylog has no significant effect on the participants until they began to approach 85 % of their maximum heart rate in stage 4 of the step tests. Further research is suggested with a larger sample population to substantiate the results since a large portion of the participants in this study did not complete the 5 stages...|$|R
