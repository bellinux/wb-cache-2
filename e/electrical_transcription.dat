50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>transcriptions</b> {{were made}} {{practical}} {{by the development}} of electrical recording, which superseded Thomas Edison's original purely mechanical recording method in the mid-1920s. Marsh Laboratories in Chicago began issuing electrical recordings on its obscure Autograph label in 1924, but it was Western Electric's superior technology, adopted by the leading labels Victor and Columbia in 1925, which launched the then-new microphone-based method into general use in the recording industry.|$|R

In contrast, commercially available 78 RPM records lasted for only 3-4 minutes per side and [...] "had very poor frequency response." ...|$|R
