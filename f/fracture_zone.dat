5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone,</b> and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together. The Mendocino <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone</b> (also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates. To the south, the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault, and to the north, the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north-south compression at the Mendocino Fault.|$|E

These potato-sized concretions of manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000meters, are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the Pacific nodule province) lies in international {{waters of the}} Pacific Ocean, stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, an area of more than 3 million km². The abyssal Clarion-Clipperton <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone</b> (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.|$|E

5|$|South {{of where}} the Chile Rise intersects the Peru-Chile Trench, the trench disappears as it is {{increasingly}} buried by sediments. However, subduction is still active {{as evidenced by the}} converging motion of the Antarctic Plate and the South America Plate and the volcanic activity. Only around 52° does the convergence change into strike-slip faulting at the Shackleton <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone.</b> Subduction in that area commenced 17 million years ago, and the Antarctic slab has not sunk deep into the mantle. At shallow depth, magma generation is dominated by anatexis of the slab. The mantle ahead of the edge of the subducting slab may be dominated by a large slab window.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Cape Mendocino {{earthquakes}} (or 1992 Petrolia earthquakes) occurred {{along the}} Lost Coast of Northern California on April 25 and 26. The three largest events were the M7.2 thrust mainshock that struck near the unincorporated community of Petrolia midday on April 25 and two primary strike-slip aftershocks measuring 6.5 and 6.6 that followed {{early the next}} morning. The sequence encompassed both interplate and intraplate activity that {{was associated with the}} Mendocino Triple Junction, a complex system of three major faults (including the Cascadia subduction zone, San Andreas Fault, and Mendocino <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone)</b> that converge near Cape Mendocino. The total number of aftershocks that followed the events exceeded 2,000.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} California's most seismically active regions and, in a 50-year period, the area {{including}} the Mendocino <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone</b> at the southern flank of the Gorda Plate generated about 25 percent of all seismic energy unleashed in the state. The Mendocino Triple Junction (strike-slip/strike-slip/trench) formed 29–30 mya at 31° N (west of present-day Baja California) when the Pacific-Farallon spreading center initially approached the subduction zone {{off the coast of}} western North America. Simultaneously, the Rivera Triple Junction shifted to the southeast to its current position at 23° N. Once the Pacific Plate and North American Plate connected the boundary became that of a transform fault (San Andreas) due to the northwestward motion of the Pacific Plate relative to the North American Plate. The San Andreas Fault continues to lengthen to the northwest and the southeast as the two triple junctions continue their transient motion.|$|E
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} tectonic fabric was delineated by narrow-beam bathymetric {{profiles in}} a 180 -km 2 {{area of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge crest at lat 26 °N. Features of the tectonic fabric are a continuous rift valley offset by small (< 10 -km) transform faults and minor <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> expressed as valleys with intervening ridges that trend normal and oblique to {{the two sides of}} the rift valley. The discharge zone of a postulated sub-sea-floor hydrothermal convection system is focused by faults on the southeast wall of the rift valley and driven by intrusive heat sources beneath the rift valley. The rift valley has a double structure consisting of linear segments, bounded by ridges, and basins at the intersections of the minor <b>fracture</b> <b>zones.</b> The double structure of the rift valley acts like a template that programs the reproduction of the tectonic fabric. The minor <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> form an asymmetric V about the rift valley at variance with the symmetric small circles formed by major <b>fracture</b> <b>zones.</b> To reconcile the asymmetry of minor <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> with the symmetry of major <b>fracture</b> <b>zones,</b> it is proposed that the minor <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> have been preferentially reoriented by an external stress field attributed to interplate and intraplate motions. Major <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> remain symmetric under the same stress field owing to differential stability between minor and major structures of oceanic lithosphere...|$|R

The flexure is modelled and compared with predicted depths with five bathymetric profiles which cross the two <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> at different ages. The model uses a thin elastic plate overlying an incompressible fluid half-space, and incorporates a temperature-dependent effective elastic thickness. Several conclusions were derived from this study. First, {{it is found that}} no significant slip on the fossil fault planes of the Mendocino and Pioneer <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> exists. In addition, the flexural amplitude is determined to increase with age. Finally, it is concluded that there is elastic coupling between the Mendocino and Pioneer <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> since the separation is less than a flexural wavelength...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the large}} shift, {{the change in}} {{direction}} was never recorded by magnetic declinations, <b>fracture</b> <b>zone</b> orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a continental collision have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend in the chain. To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|E

Seismic reflection and refraction studies indicate that the crust becomes anomalously thin near <b>fracture</b> <b>zones,</b> but reference must be made to the boundary between residual upper mantle peridotites and overlying cumulate rocks in order to assess potential variations in the magma budget.

30|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} mud logging and well logging {{data from the}} sedimentary cover of several geothermal wells at the Soultz site in the URG reveals the presence of <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> in the Triassic sedimentary formations. These <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> are made of individual or complex structures. The complex structures most likely represent faulted zones cross-cutting the deepest sediments of the Tertiary basin. Based on mud loss occurrences, {{it has been shown}} that fracture permeability is associated mainly with complex <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> located in the Middle Muschelkalk limestones and Middle Buntsandstein sandstones. At the borehole scale, many <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> are sealed due to the occurrence of secondary precipitated mineral, which most likely reduce the permeability.|$|R
40|$|Some {{components}} of extensometers in the Yasutomi Observation Tunnel at Yamasaki Faultcross the <b>fractured</b> <b>zones.</b> From {{the analysis of}} continuous records of them, it was shown that thetidal strain across <b>fractured</b> <b>zone</b> is larger than that on the neighboring unfractured zone. In this paper, we have analyzed data of same extensometers and found out some character-istics of the <b>fractured</b> <b>zone</b> on the strain seismograms of teleseismic surface waves. The strain variation generated by teleseismic surface waves across the <b>fractured</b> <b>zone</b> is alsolarger than that on the unfractured zone, {{and the effect of}} amplification on long period surfacewaves is more notable than that on earthtide. We have calculated the strain seismograms at Yamasaki Fault from the displacement seismo-grams at the Abuyama Seismological Observatory and compared them with observed ones atYamasaki Fault. The amplitude of observed ones on unfractured zone is larger than that of calculat-ed ones. These results suggest that the existence of the <b>fractured</b> <b>zone</b> gives some significant effectson the strain field in the comparatively wide region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe forces acting upon a rock mass {{can result}} in {{physical}} changes {{on either side of}} the fault plane that are known as <b>fracture</b> <b>zones.</b> This tectonic activity will lead to a difference in the density of <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> from the density of surrounding rocks. This condition can be detected using gravity method. The changes of rocks density in contrast to <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> are relatively small, so a rigorous technique of gravity data processing to detect its presence is required. This research has developed and implemented the gravity gradient technique as one of the processing and acquisition techniques of gravity data which is found to have a high accuracy to detect the boundaries of rock density contrast changes. For the purposes of analyzing the gravity responses in identifying <b>fracture</b> <b>zones,</b> the characteristics of the gravity and its gradient responses of <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> in a strike-slip fault system were analyzed based on the forward and inverse modeling results. Furthermore, the gradient and gravity anomaly inversions were applied to the gravity data towards Palu-Koro strike-slip fault, a segment of the Palu City, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The measurement results show that the gravity gradient anomaly has a higher sensitivity compared to its gravity anomaly in detecting the <b>fracture</b> <b>zones.</b> In addition, the inversion result of the gravity gradient anomaly shows that the boundaries of lateral changes in the distribution of density contrast of <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> can be identified more accurately...|$|R
25|$|The {{deep water}} masses (>1600 m) are {{recirculated}} within the Greenland Sea {{due to the}} Jan Mayen <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone.</b> Here, the deep water encounters the Jan Mayen Ridge and are deflected eastward towards {{the interior of the}} Greenland Sea Gyre.

25|$|The various geyser basins {{are located}} where {{rainwater}} and snowmelt can percolate into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt {{at the surface}} as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are {{where most of the}} large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular <b>fracture</b> <b>zone</b> around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau's high elevation the average boiling temperature at Yellowstone's geyser basins is 199°F (93°C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest geyser). Water erupting from Yellowstone's geysers is superheated above that boiling point to an average of 204°F (95.5°C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators. Because of the high temperatures of the water in the features it is important that spectators remain on the boardwalks and designated trails. Several deaths have occurred in the park as a result of falls into hot springs.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there must be some other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the recirculation of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone</b> helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The seismic {{structure}} of crust found within <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> falls outside {{the range of}} velocity structures observed for normal oceanic crust in the North Atlantic. The crust in <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> is frequently very thin and is characterized by low crustal velocities and by the conspicuous absence of a refractor with a velocity typical of oceanic layer 3. Anomalous crust is present in both large- and small-offset <b>fracture</b> <b>zones.</b> Since {{they are among the}} most common tectonic features in the ocean basins, and are particularly closely spaced on slow-spreading ridges, <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> represent a major source of seismic crustal heterogeneity. We interpret the anomalous crust as a thin, intensely fractured, faulted and hydrothermally altered basaltic and gabbroic section overlying ultramafics that, in places, are extensively serpentinized. The unusually thin crust found within <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> and the gradual crustal thinning over a distance of several tens of kilometres {{on either side of the}} <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> can be explained by two main processes; firstly the cold lithosphere edge opposite the spreading centre at the ridge-transform intersection modifies the normal intrusive and extrusive processes of the spreading centre leading to the accretion of an anomalous and thin igneous section; and secondly each spreading ridge segment is fed from a separate subcrustal magma supply point, so as the magma flows laterally down the spreading centre it generates a crustal section of decreasing thickness, culminating in the very thin crust of the <b>fracture</b> <b>zones</b> at either end of the ridge segment...|$|R

500|$|A {{variant of}} the land bridge {{hypothesis}} has been proposed {{in an attempt to}} explain both how a land bridge could have formed, and why other mammalian orders failed to cross it. [...] Geological studies have shown that following the collision of India and Asia, the Davie <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone</b> had been pushed up by tectonic forces, possibly high enough to create a land bridge. [...] Indeed, core samples along the Davie <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone</b> suggest that at least parts of the Mozambique Channel were above sea level between 45 and 26mya, or possibly as early as 55mya. [...] Following the Indian-Asian collision, the fault type changed from a strike-slip fault to a normal fault, and seafloor spreading created compression along the Davie <b>Fracture</b> <b>Zone,</b> causing it to rise. [...] By the early Miocene, the East African Rift created tension along the fault, causing it to subside beneath the ocean. [...] The divergence dates of many Malagasy mammalian orders formerly fell within this window. [...] Old World monkeys, dogs, and cats did not diverge or arrive in Africa until later in the Miocene. [...] However, more recent dating of divergence of the Malagasy mammalian clades falls outside of this land bridge window, and a much greater diversity of mammal groups would be expected on Madagascar had the land bridge been present during that stretch of time.|$|E
