40|$|Societal {{developments}} have forced universities all over Europe to replace their ‘professional’ strategies, structures, and values by organizational characteristics {{that could be}} stereotyped as ‘private sector’ features. This trend is known as ‘managerialism’. Since university employees generally stick to professional values, a conflict may emerge between professional employee values and managerial organization values. This conflict can result in lower organizational commitment and, consequently, lower quality of <b>job</b> <b>performances.</b> Since managerialism is, however, aimed at efficient and effective quality improvement, this situation is what we regard as a managerialism contradiction. Affecting university employees' performances may solve or reduce such a contradiction. Since levels of managerialism differ among countries, this paper examines which factors {{affect the quality of}} <b>job</b> <b>performances</b> of 1, 700 university employees in low-, middle- and high-managerialism countries. The analyses reveal that there are large differences and some similarities between the countries regarding which human resource management (HRM) practices affect the quality of employees' <b>job</b> <b>performances.</b> Furthermore, it appears that there are clear differences among the countries regarding how the HRM practices affect the quality of their <b>job</b> <b>performances.</b> The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|To achieve {{efficient}} and effective quality improvement, European universities have gradually adopted organizational strategies, structures, technologies, management instruments, and values that are commonly found in the private business sector. Whereas some {{studies have shown that}} such managerialism is beneficial to the quality of <b>job</b> <b>performances</b> of university employees, others have argued that managerialism is largely counterproductive and that it results in lower performances. The latter situation is called a ‘managerialism contradiction’. This paper tests two lines of reasoning underlying a potential contradiction governing the relationship between managerialism and <b>job</b> <b>performances,</b> while using university employee survey data from six European countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, UK). The results tend to support the assumption that managerialism, in these six countries at least, has a positive effect, albeit a modest one, on the quality of performances. The most important conclusion is therefore that there is no managerialism contradiction at work in European universities. ...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves <b>job</b> <b>performance.</b> This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to <b>job</b> <b>performance,</b> as well. Hence, <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Job</b> {{satisfaction}} and <b>performance</b> {{are of interest}} to many organizational researchers because they contribute to a healthy organization. After a merger, employees’ levels of <b>job</b> {{satisfaction and}} <b>performance</b> typically decrease. Although the goal of merging usually is to (re) gain financial success, this goal is often not reached due to employees’ merger-related stress reactions (e. g. Terry et al., 1996). Previous studies found that employees’ perception of organizational change due to a merger is negatively associated with employees’ identification with the newly merged organization (e. g. van Knippenberg & van Leeuwen, 2002). In other organizational research, identification with one’s organization {{has been found to}} be associated with both <b>job</b> satisfaction and <b>performance</b> (e. g. Mathieu & Zajac, 1990). In the current study, we investigated whether the relationship between employees’ perception of organizational change and changes in their <b>job</b> satisfaction and <b>performance</b> was mediated by emotions. The research was conducted in a recently merged professional mental health organization. Eighty-four employees filled out a questionnaire regarding their perception of organizational change, their emotions and their levels of <b>job</b> satisfaction and <b>performance.</b> We hypothesized that the perception of organizational change would be positively related to negative emotions and negatively related to positive emotions.
