25|$|Itochu is {{a member}} of the Mizuho <b>keiretsu.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of keiretsu: {{vertical}} and horizontal. Vertical <b>keiretsu</b> illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal <b>keiretsu</b> shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>keiretsu</b> {{were each}} {{centered}} on one bank, which lent {{money to the}} keiretsu's member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the <b>keiretsu</b> and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge {{the power of the}} banks.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{recession}} in the 1990s had profound effects on the <b>keiretsu.</b> Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This {{had the effect of}} blurring the lines between the keiretsu: Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Additionally, many companies from outside the <b>keiretsu</b> system, such as Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{being part}} of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, it is also a part of Mitsubishi <b>keiretsu,</b> {{formerly}} the biggest industrial group in Japan, through the corporation's minority 20% stake in Mitsubishi Motors, and the company was originally formed in 1970 from the automotive division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{corporations}} developed {{strategies that}} contributed to their immense growth. Growth-oriented corporations that took chances competed successfully. Product diversification became an essential ingredient of the growth patterns of many <b>keiretsu.</b> Japanese companies added plant and human capacity ahead of demand. Seeking market share rather than quick profit was another powerful strategy.|$|E
25|$|New major {{stockholder}} Phoenix Capital {{followed suit}} the following month, selling all but 50million of its 575million shares to JPMorgan on December 9, 2005, {{and once again}} the investment bank offloaded their purchase {{within a few days}} for {{tens of millions of dollars}} in profit. In both cases, the eventual buyers were part of the Mitsubishi <b>keiretsu,</b> returning MMC to Japanese ownership.|$|E
25|$|Idemitsu is {{the second}} largest {{petroleum}} refiner in Japan, after Nippon Oil. It was ranked as the 262nd largest {{company in the world}} by revenue in Fortune Global 500 (2008). It is number 26 in petroleum refining. Only publicly traded since 2006, Idemitsu Kosan is not listed on the Nikkei 225 stock index or the Topix 100, but instead in Topix Mid 400. The company {{is a member of the}} Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFJ) <b>keiretsu.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite DaimlerChrysler's involvement, debts at Mitsubishi {{continued}} to accumulate. A torporous economy in Japan dragged down the company's domestic performance in 2003, while {{the same year}} the after effects of a disastrous credit scheme in the U.S. saw Mitsubishi Motors North America suffer a US$454million loss. By 2004 the automaker owed ¥1.14trillion, and a ¥700billion rescue plan was put to shareholders in April. Other companies within the <b>keiretsu</b> of Mitsubishi which owned 23 percent of MMC were committed to the plan, and the Japan Development Bank had also been approached for support.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, car {{production}} was very limited before World War II. Only {{a handful of}} companines were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or {{were the result of}} partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under <b>keiretsu</b> legislation.|$|E
500|$|Japan ranks 27th of 189 {{countries}} in the 2014 ease of doing business index and {{has one of the}} smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: <b>keiretsu</b> enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods like [...] "The Toyota Way", and shareholder activism is rare. Japan's top global brands include Toyota, Honda, Canon, Nissan, Sony, Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), Panasonic, Uniqlo, Lexus, Subaru, Nintendo, Bridgestone, Mazda and Suzuki.|$|E
500|$|A major {{land reform}} was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky of MacArthur's SCAP staff. Between 1947 and 1949, {{approximately}} , or 38% of Japan's cultivated land, was purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program, and [...] was resold to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, 89% of all agricultural land was owner-operated and only 11% was tenant-operated. MacArthur's efforts to encourage trade union membership met with phenomenal success, and by 1947, 48% of the non-agricultural workforce was unionized. Some of MacArthur's reforms were rescinded in 1948 when his unilateral control of Japan was ended by the increased {{involvement of the}} State Department. During the Occupation, SCAP successfully, if not entirely, abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the Zaibatsu, which had previously monopolized industry. Eventually, looser industrial groupings known as <b>Keiretsu</b> evolved. The reforms alarmed many in the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, who believed they conflicted {{with the prospect of}} Japan and its industrial capacity as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, these causes {{gave rise}} to a strong notion in the {{business}} community that the old <b>keiretsu</b> system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of <b>keiretsu</b> alliances. While the <b>keiretsu</b> still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily [...] "bailed out" [...] by their banks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent shareholders.|$|E

2500|$|Itoh was {{headquartered}} {{near the}} site of Chubei Itoh's historical headquarters in Osaka until 1967, when it upgraded its Tokyo branch to the status of a co-headquarters. In the 1970s, the company became part of the [...] "Kawasaki Group" [...] within the <b>keiretsu</b> of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (now Mizuho Corporate Bank), eventually displacing Nissho Iwai as the keiretsu's dominant trading company. Itoh's affiliation with the <b>keiretsu</b> was significantly looser than other keiretsu-affiliated trading companies, and many firms within the DKB group did not use Itoh's services at all.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] {{is a set}} of {{companies}} with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of business group. The prototypical <b>keiretsu</b> appeared in Japan during the [...] "economic miracle" [...] following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled vertical monopolies called zaibatsu. The Allies dismantled the zaibatsu in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the zaibatsu were reintegrated. [...] The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, <b>keiretsu</b> companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well. [...] In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.|$|E
2500|$|The Moxie brand [...] was {{purchased}} in 1966 by the Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta. In 2007 Monarch {{sold it to}} its current owner, Cornucopia Beverages of Bedford, New Hampshire, {{which is owned by}} the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England, a subsidiary of the Kirin Brewery Company, which is a subsidiary of Kirin Company, Limited, which is a subsidiary of Kirin Holdings Company, Limited, based in Tokyo, Japan (a member of the Mitsubishi <b>keiretsu).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Control and {{ownership}} structure {{refers to the}} types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due {{to the existence of}} e.g. dual-class shares, ownership pyramids, voting coalitions, proxy votes and clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders. Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights. Researchers often [...] "measure" [...] control {{and ownership}} structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving corporate groups include pyramids, cross-shareholdings, rings, and webs. German [...] "concerns" [...] (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese <b>keiretsu</b> (系列) and South Korean chaebol (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding are an essential feature of <b>keiretsu</b> and chaebol groups [...] Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.|$|E
2500|$|The logo {{of three}} red diamonds, shared with over forty other {{companies}} within the <b>keiretsu,</b> predates Mitsubishi Motors itself by almost a century. It {{was chosen by}} Iwasaki Yatarō, the founder of Mitsubishi, as it was suggestive of the emblem of the Tosa Clan who first employed him, and because his own family crest was three rhombuses stacked atop each other. The name [...] consists of two parts: [...] "mitsu" [...] meaning [...] "three" [...] and [...] "hishi" [...] (which becomes [...] "bishi" [...] under rendaku) meaning [...] "water caltrop" [...] (also called [...] "water chestnut"), and hence [...] "rhombus", which {{is reflected in the}} company's logo..|$|E
2500|$|The new {{millennium}} {{also saw a}} fresh wave of live drum and bass bands. [...] The likes of Reprazent and Red Snapper had performed live drum and bass during the 1990s, but the re-creation of London Elektricity as a live band focussed renewed interest on the idea, with acts like The Bays, <b>Keiretsu,</b> Southampton based Gojira, Step 13, Deadsilence Syndicate, and U.V Ray (feat. Yuval Gabay) as well as Birmingham's PCM, pursuing this avenue. In addition the popular Breakbeat Kaos label has begun to focus {{more and more on}} bringing a live sound into drum and bass, both in the records they release and in the live band (music played on live acoustic instruments, including guitar) night the previously signed group Pendulum have hosted in London (e.g. October 2006 at the Fabric club).|$|E

50|$|<b>Keiretsu</b> also fostered an {{attitude}} shift among Japanese managers that tolerated low {{profits in the}} short-run because <b>keiretsu</b> were less concerned with increasing stock dividends and profits and more concerned about interest payments. Approximately only two-thirds of the shares of a given company were traded, cushioning <b>keiretsu</b> against market fluctuations and allowing <b>keiretsu</b> managers {{to plan for the}} long-term and maximize market shares instead of focusing on short-term profits.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{aspect of}} a {{horizontal}} <b>keiretsu</b> (also known as financial <b>keiretsu)</b> {{is that it is}} set up around a Japanese bank through cross-shareholding relationships with other companies. The bank assists these companies with a range of financial services. The leading horizontal Japanese <b>keiretsu,</b> also referred to as the “Big Six”, include: Fuyo, Sanwa, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Mizuho Financial Group [...] Horizontal <b>keiretsu</b> may also have vertical relationships, called branches.|$|E
50|$|Sony has a {{weak tie}} to the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) <b>keiretsu,</b> the {{successor}} to the Mitsui <b>keiretsu.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the heart}} of the <b>keiretsu</b> conglomerates' success lay city banks, which lent generously, formalizing cross-share {{holdings}} in diverse industries. The <b>keiretsu</b> spurred both horizontal and vertical integration, locking out foreign companies from Japanese industries. <b>Keiretsu</b> had close relations with MITI and each other through the cross-placement of shares, providing protection from foreign take-overs. For example, 83% of Japan's Development Bank's finances went toward strategic industries: shipbuilding, electric power, coal and steel production. <b>Keiretsu</b> proved crucial to protectionist measures that shielded Japan's sapling economy.|$|E
50|$|Vertical <b>keiretsu</b> (also {{known as}} {{industrial}} <b>keiretsu)</b> {{are used to}} link suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors of one industry. One or more subcompanies are created to benefit the parent company (for example, Toyota or Honda). Banks have less influence on distribution <b>keiretsu.</b> This vertical model is further divided into levels called tiers. The second tier constitutes major suppliers, followed by smaller manufacturers, {{who make up the}} third and fourth tiers. The lower the tier, the greater the risk of economic disruption; moreover, due to low position in the <b>keiretsu</b> hierarchy, profit margins are low.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, a {{different}} model of conglomerate, the <b>keiretsu,</b> evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate {{consists of a}} single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a <b>keiretsu</b> are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo are some of Japan's best known <b>keiretsu,</b> reaching from automobile manufacturing {{to the production of}} electronics such as televisions.|$|E
5000|$|Harvard Law School {{professor}} J. Mark Ramseyer and University of Tokyo professor Yoshiro Miwa {{have argued}} that the postwar <b>keiretsu</b> are a [...] "fable" [...] created by Marxist thinkers in the 1960s so as to argue that monopoly capital dominated the Japanese economy. They point to the sparsity and tenuousness of cross-shareholding relationships within the <b>keiretsu,</b> the inconsistency in members' relationships with the [...] "main banks" [...] of each <b>keiretsu,</b> and the lack of power and reach of the zaibatsu alumni [...] "lunch clubs" [...] which are often argued to form a core of <b>keiretsu</b> governance.|$|E
50|$|The major <b>keiretsu</b> {{were each}} {{centered}} on one bank, which lent {{money to the}} <b>keiretsu</b> member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each bank had great control over the companies in the <b>keiretsu</b> and acted as a monitoring and emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge {{the power of the}} banks.|$|E
50|$|In December 2004, Toshiba quietly {{announced}} it would discontinue manufacturing traditional in-house cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions. In 2006, Toshiba terminated production of in-house plasma TVs. To ensure its future competitiveness in the flat-panel digital television and display market, Toshiba has made a considerable investment in {{a new kind of}} display technology called SED. Before World War II, Toshiba {{was a member of the}} Mitsui Group zaibatsu (family-controlled vertical monopoly). Today Toshiba is a member of the Mitsui <b>keiretsu</b> (a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings), and still has preferential arrangements with Mitsui Bank and the other members of the <b>keiretsu.</b> Membership in a <b>keiretsu</b> has traditionally meant loyalty, both corporate and private, to other members of the <b>keiretsu</b> or allied <b>keiretsu.</b> This loyalty can extend as far as the beer the employees consume, which in Toshiba's case is Asahi.|$|E
5000|$|Toyota is {{considered}} {{the biggest of the}} vertically integrated <b>keiretsu</b> groups. [...] The banks at the top are not as large as normally required, so it is actually considered to be more horizontally integrated than other <b>keiretsu.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early-stage {{investing}} {{carries a}} high degree of risk. To help minimize that risk, the <b>Keiretsu</b> Forum members have developed a thorough and comprehensive due diligence process that is applied to all companies prior to member investment. The due diligence process is now available in The <b>Keiretsu</b> Forum Due Diligence Process Handbook, which represents more than 15 years of knowledge and best practices vetted by over a 2,500 <b>Keiretsu</b> Forum investor members world-wide.|$|E
50|$|Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group (Hankyū Hanshin Tōhō Gurūpu) is a Japanese <b>keiretsu</b> (association of businesses) {{centered}} on Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, H2O Retailing and Toho. The <b>keiretsu</b> historically included Sanwa Bank, {{now part of}} Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and is still closely linked to MUFG.|$|E
50|$|A <b>keiretsu</b> (extra=literally system, series, {{grouping}} of enterprises, order of succession) {{is a set}} of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings.
