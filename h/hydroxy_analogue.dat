40|$|Due {{to their}} promotory {{action on the}} {{transport}} of some drugs through various membranes (lipophilic barriers), oxo derivatives of bile acids have recently been increasingly used in biopharmacy. These compounds exhibit also a lower membranolytic (toxic) activity than their <b>hydroxy</b> <b>analogues.</b> Because of {{that it is of}} special importance to find out the descriptors that would adequately describe the structure of bile acids and their biological activity and be used to model the quantitative structure-activity relationship. In view of this, the present work is concerned with the application of the chromatographic parameter RM 0 obtained by normal-phase thin-layer chromatography in the solvent system toluene-butanol and silica gel as stationary phase to describe the lipophilicity of bile acids. Also, the work introduces a new molecular descriptor (ND) that reflects both 2 D and 3 D topological characteristics of the molecule. Between the retention constant, RM 0 and the descriptor ND there is a good correlation, and both RM 0, and ND describe sufficiently well the structural (conformational) changes that arise in the process of oxidation of the OH group of the steroid skeleton to an oxo group.

Rate of gain with the basic amino acid diet containing a mixture of methionine and cystine was about 90 % of the rate noted with a practical type diet.

Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an important enzyme of the folate cycle; inhibition of DHFR inhibits growth and causes cell death. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DHFR revealed a glycerol tightly bound close to the binding site for the substrate dihydrofolate; this glycerol-binding motif is absent from the human enzyme. A series of pyrimidine- 2, 4 -diamines was designed with a two-carbon tether between a glycerol-mimicking triol and the 6 -position of the heterocycle; these compounds also carried aryl substituents at the 5 -position. These, their diastereoisomers, <b>analogues</b> lacking two <b>hydroxy</b> groups and <b>analogues</b> lacking the two-carbon spacing linker were synthesised by acylation of the anions derived from phenylacetonitriles with ethyl (4 S, 5 R) - 4 -benzyloxymethyl- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane- 4 -propanoate, ethyl (4 S, 5 S) - 4 -benzyloxymethyl- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane- 4 -propanoate, tetrahydrooxepin- 2 -one and 2, 3 -O-isopropylidene-D-erythronolactone, respectively, to give the corresponding α-acylphenylacetonitriles.

40|$|Branched chain sugars {{display a}} varied and {{valuable}} range of biological activities. This thesis concerns {{the synthesis of}} 3, 5 -di-C-methyl-D-glucose, a potential inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), and therefore a proposed therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes. Chapter 1 looks at the occurrence of branched sugars {{in the natural world}} and current therapies for type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of GP is explored, and the molecular modelling studies which led to the design of the project target. Chapter 1 also looks into the development of new foodstuffs, the chemistry and biochemistry of imino sugars and branched <b>hydroxy</b> proline <b>analogues.</b> In Chapter 2, a range of different approaches to 3, 5 -di-C-methyl-D-glucose are investigated. Most of the initial investigations were carried out on the L-enantiomer, a readily available test system deriving from 2 -C-methyl-D-ribono lactone. 2 -C-Methyl-D-ribono lactone is synthesised rapidly from D-glucose in a one-pot reaction; as the key starting material for this work, the scalability of this process was investigated. One of the attempted syntheses of di-C-methyl glucose lead {{to the development of a}} route towards 3, 5 -di-C-methyl fructose, a novel dibranched ketose sugar. It was envisaged that through an enzymatic transformation, it might be possible to produce 3, 5 -di-C-methyl glucose stereoselectively. Synthesis of both enantiomers of 3, 5 -di-C-methyl glucose and mannose are reported, alongside results of GPb inhibition studies. Analysis of the preferred ring size of a range of di-C-methyl branched sugars and sugar lactones generated in this work is also presented. Chapter 3 explores the chemistry of 2, 4 -di-C-methyl-L-arabinono lactone, a key intermediate in the synthesis of 3, 5 -di-C-methyl-L-glucose. From this lactone a novel deoxy sugar, 2 -deoxy- 2, 4 -di-C-methyl-L-arabinono lactone, was generated. Routes towards a selection of imino sugars were explored, resulting in the synthesis of a methyl branched isofagomine analogue. A substituted aziridine was synthesised, from which a route to a di-C-methyl branched piperidine was proposed, and a pyrrolidine. Also presented is a synthesis of a dihydroxy di-C-methyl branched proline analogue. Detailed NMR analysis of several of the sugars generated in this work was carried out by Dr M. Wormald, of the University of Oxford Biochemistry department. The results of these investigations are presented in the Appendix. Throughout this work, the presence of quaternary centres has posed a problem with the assignment of relative configuration.

Nevertheless, its potency as a source of me-thionine activity for the chick remains a controversial question. Some workers (Gor-don and Sizer, 1955; Machlin and Gor-don, 1959; Bruggemann et al., 1962) have found it to be equivalent to DL-methionine, whereas others (Sullivan and Bird, 1957; Calet and Melot, 1961) report that it is less potent. All of these workers used diets containing intact protein ranging from 12 % to optimal levels in the diet. There also appears to be a lack of agree-ment on the relative potencies of the L-, D-and DL-isomers of methionine. It has been reported that the D-isomer is as well uti-lized as the L- form when tested with purified diets in which the other amino acids are all in the L- form (Marrett et al., 1964) but not when the diet contains other amino acids in the D- form (Marrett and Sunde, 1965).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) {{catalyse}} the biosynthesis {{of complex}} polyketides {{using a different}} set of enzymes for each successive cycle of chain extension. Directed biosynthesis starting from synthetic diketides is a potentially valuable route to novel polyketides. We have used a purified bimodular derivative of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase (DEBS 1 -TE) to study chain extension starting from a variety of diketide analogues and, in some cases, from the alternative acyl-CoA thioester substrates. Results: Chain initiation in vitro by DEBS 1 -TE module 2 using a synthetic diketide analogue as a substrate was tolerant of significant structural variation in the starter unit of the synthetic diketide, but other changes completely abolished activity. Interestingly, a racemic β-keto diketide was found to be reduced in situ on the PKS and utilised in place of its more complex <b>hydroxy</b> <b>analogue</b> as a substrate for chain extension. The presence of a diketide analogue strongly inhibited chain initiation via the loading module. Significantly higher concentrations of diketide N-acetylcysteamine analogues than their corresponding acyl-CoA thioesters are required to achieve comparable yields of triketide lactones. Conclusions: Although a broad range of variation in the starter residue is acceptable, the substrate specificity of module 2 of a typical modular PKS in vitro is relatively intolerant of changes at C- 2 and C- 3. This will restrict the usefulness of approaches to synthesise novel erythromycins using synthetic diketides in vivo. The use of synthetic β-keto diketides in vivo deserves to be explored...|$|E

The present study was conducted to investigate further the role of DL-methionine (DLM) and its <b>hydroxy</b> <b>analogue,</b> DL- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylthiobutanoic acid (DL-HMTBA), on zootechnical performance and oxidative status of broiler chickens. Male broiler chickens were reared on two diets differing in crude protein (CP) content (low-protein, 18. 3 % v. high-protein, 23. 2 % CP) and were supplemented either with 0. 25 % DLM or 0. 25 % DL-HMTBA. Reducing the dietary protein content resulted in an impaired body weight gain (P < 0. 0001). However, supplementation of DL-HMTBA to the low-protein diet partially alleviated these negative effects (P = 0. 0003). This latter phenomenon could be {{explained by the fact that}} chickens fed DL-HMTBA-supplemented diets displayed a better antioxidant status as reflected in lower lipid peroxidation probably as a consequence of their higher hepatic concentrations of total and reduced glutathione compared with their DLM counterparts. On the other hand, within the high protein levels, uric acid might be an important antioxidant to explain the lower lipid peroxidation of high-protein DL-HMTBA-supplemented chickens. Hepatic methionine sulfoxide reductase-A gene expression was not significantly affected by the dietary treatments. In conclusion, the present study indicates that there are interactions between dietary protein content and supplementation of methionine analogues with respect to broiler performance and antioxidant status, also suggesting a causal link between these traits.

Treatments included 1) a roughage-based diet fed at 2. 75 % of body weight (ROUGH), 2) a corn-based diet fed at 1. 5 % of body weight (CORN 1. 5), 3) a corn- based diet fed at 2. 25 % of body weight (CORN 2. 25), 4) a soybean hull-based diet fed at 1. 5 % of body weight (SH 1. 5), 5) a soybean hull-based diet fed at 2. 25 % of body weight (SH 2. 25), 6) SH 1. 5 top-dressed with 11. 4 g/head daily MHA, 7) SH 2. 25 top-dressed with 11. 4 g/head daily MHA, 8) SH 2. 25 top-dressed with 7 g/head daily rumenprotected betaine, and 9) SH 2. 25 top- dressed with 250 g/head daily CSB. Supplemental MHA, betaine, and CSB did not change feed intakes, gains, or feed efficiencies for cattle fed soybean hulls. Heifers fed soyhulls at 2. 25 % of body weight gained 27 % slower (P<. 01) than heifers fed the corn-based diet at similar intakes and were 25 % less efficient (P<. 01). Similar results were observed for cattle fed soybean hulls and corn at 1. 5 % of body weight. Cattle fed soybean hulls at 2. 25 % of body weight had gains {{similar to those of}} cattle receiving the roughage-based diet at 2. 75 % of body weight, but feed efficiencies tended to be better (P= 0. 11) for the cattle receiving soybean hulls because less feed was consumed.

40|$|Histamine H 1 -Receptor (H 1 R) Ligands: Developing highly potent and {{selective}} histamine H 1 -receptor (H 1 R) agonists {{has been an}} arduous task for several decades. Highly potent {{and selective}} H 1 R agonists are in demand for pharmacological and molecular investigation. Recently, the histaprodifens, a family of 2 -(3, 3 -diphenylpropyl) -substituted histamine derivatives, have been established as new class of potent and selective H 1 R agonists. On this basis, new analogues of histaprodifen with polar side chains have been stereoselectively synthesized and evaluated as H 1 R agonists. As a key transformation the asymmetric aminohydroxylation has been used and successfully realized {{for the first time}} on an imidazole derivative. While all chiral analogues proved to be weak H 1 R antagonists, an achiral keto derivative of histaprodifen turned out to be the first 2 -acylated histamine congener displaying partial H 1 R agonism. Moreover, the <b>hydroxy</b> <b>analogue</b> of this keto histaprodifen also showed partial H 1 R agonism indicating the potential of the 2 -position in the histaprodifens for further modification. Histamine H 3 -Receptor (H 3 R) Ligands: The therapeutic importance of H 1 R and H 2 R agonists and especially antagonists is unquestioned since long. Antagonists that target H 1 R or H 2 R and are used in the treatment of allergic conditions, such as rhinitis, or of gastric acid release disorders, have been �blockbuster� drugs for many years. In view of this blockbuster status of the H 1 R and H 2 R antagonists, current expectations for the therapeutic potential of drugs that target the H 3 and H 4 receptors are high. Recent developments in the medicinal chemistry field of H 3 R antagonists have generated numerous compounds that are highly active in vitro and also in vivo. Looking at the extensive history of structure-activity relationships of H 3 R antagonists, rigid antagonists fulfil many criteria, display very high potency, and have apparently reached clinical studies. Keeping this view in mind, many diverse and conformationally restricted compounds have been developed. Moreover, the synthesis of a series of cyclopropanated analogues with different linker has been described in an efficient way. All novel compounds were screened for H 3 R antagonistic activity on guinea-pig ileum. It has been shown that attempts to rigidize flexible H 3 R antagonists, such as FUB- 372 and/or iodoproxyfan, have ultimately led to a more or less severe attenuation of H 3 R affinity...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se determinar se a biodisponibilidade de metionina análoga ácido livre (MHA-AL) é igual ou {{superior}} a 65 %, na base de produto, para poedeiras leves no período de 24 a 40 semanas de idade. Durante quatro períodos experimentais de 28 dias, utilizaram-se 640 poedeiras comerciais com 24 semanas de idade, em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com dez tratamentos, oito repetições e oito aves por unidade experimental. Os tratamentos consistiram de uma ração basal farelada deficiente em metionina, contendo 2. 830 kcal de energia metabolizável (EM) /kg, 14, 5 % de proteína bruta (PB) e 0, 23 % e 0, 21 % de metionina total e digestível, respectivamente, suplementada com DL-metionina 99 %, DLM (0, 0325; 0, 05; 0, 065; 0, 0975; 0, 10 ou 0, 15 %) e com MHA-AL 88 % (0, 05; 0, 10 e 0, 15 %). As características avaliadas foram peso corporal (kg), produção de ovos (%), massa de ovos (g), peso médio dos ovos (g), consumo de ração (g) e conversão alimentar (g de ração/g de ovo). Com base nos dados de produção de ovos, massa de ovo e conversão alimentar, a biodisponibilidade da MHA-AL foi calculada em 74, 66; 73, 97; e 71, 17 %, respectivamente, conferindo à MHA-AL biodisponibilidade média de 73, 22 % em relação à DLM, na base do produto. A biodisponibilidade da MHA-AL é superior a 65 % na base do produto. The {{objective of}} the study was to determine whether bioavailability of methionine <b>hydroxy</b> <b>analogue</b> free acid (MHA-FA) is higher than 65 %, in product basis, for 24 to 40 week-old laying hens. Six hundred and forty 24 -week commercial laying hens were used in four 28 -day experimental periods in a randomized complete design with ten treatments, eight replications and eight birds per experimental unit. The treatments were based on a basal feed deficient in methionine, containing 2, 830 kcal metabolizable energy (EM) /kg and 14. 5 % crude protein (CP), with 0. 23 % and 0. 21 % total and digestible methionine, respectively, supplemented with DL-methionine 99 % - DLM (0. 0325; 0. 05; 0. 065; 0. 0975; 0. 10 and 0. 15 %) and MHA-FA (0. 05; 0. 10 and 0. 15 %). The following variables were assessed: body weight (kg), egg production (%), egg mass (g), egg weight (g), feed intake (g), feed conversion (g/feed/egg). Based on the egg production evaluation, egg mass and feed conversion, the bioavailability of MHA-FA was estimated at 74. 66, 73. 97 and 71. 17 %, respectively, giving MHA-FA an average bioavailability of 73. 22 % compared to DLM on product basis.
