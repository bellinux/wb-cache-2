Traditionally, ancient Egyptians cut stone blocks by hammering into them wooden wedges, which were then soaked with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack.

40|$|In June 2003 a WIDER {{discussion}} paper on ‘The EU's Everything But Arms Initiative and the Least Developed Countries' was released. This paper used a {{computable general equilibrium}} simulation model and partial equilibrium simulations, based on the SMART model to ‘assess the aggregate worldwide distribution of gains and losses of the EBA initiative' for least developed countries and other developing countries under a range of scenarios. The study shows ‘moderate welfare gains from the EBA initiative' with the largest gains being recorded for sub-Saharan Africa. These largely arise from access to the high-priced EU sugar market. The paper notes that the effects on the EU itself are minimal, since the increased access for LDC sugar is {{at the expense of}} ‘other preference-receiving countries'. The paper acknowledges that given the modelling techniques used ‘the analysis does not fully account for non-tariff barriers that may preclude LDCs from increasing their exports to the extent predicted by our analysis'. It notes also that ‘in the longer term supply-side constraints rather than market-access limitations may be the more important factors' and recommends that urgent attention be paid to these factors by the international community. Comment: The benefits which LDCs have gained form the EBA initiative in the sugar sector would largely disappear with the implementation of a ‘fall in price' option for sugar-sector reform. Commission estimates suggest that total imports from ACP developing countries under such an option are likely to be little more than 200, 000 tonnes once sugar-sector reform has been fully implemented. While these imports are all likely to come from least developed ACP countries this is far below the 2 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> from LDCS predicted by the International Sugar Organisation {{at the time of the}} launching of the EBA initiative.

40|$|German {{companies}} {{participating in}} the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) analyse the consequences of climate policy on their competitiveness {{in a variety of}} ways. When asked whether global climate policy - e. g. decisions adopted at UN climate negotiations - negatively impacted on their competitiveness, 39 per cent of the respondents gave a positive response. 53 per cent of companies expect European climate protection rules, such as the EU ETS, to {{have a negative impact on}} competitiveness. Climate policy at the national level, the turnaround in German Energy Policy (the so-called energy transition), for example, is perceived as being potentially damaging by 59 per cent of companies. This is one of the findings of the KfW/ZEW CO 2 Barometer 2015, an annual survey conducted by KfW bank in cooperation with the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), since 2009. The survey analyses the impact of the EU ETS on the companies regulated. The variation in the ways in which companies estimate the impact of climate policy on their competitiveness, is particularly pronounced amongst companies which are in international competition. Only around 15 per cent of the firms regulated by EU ETS, however, assume that the impending 2015 UN climate negotiations held in Paris this December, will lead to a binding international agreement. In view of the continuous fall in the price of carbon allowances, the EU has adopted a market stability reserve (MSR) in order to reduce the surplus of carbon credits (estimated at over 2 billion). In the course of this initiative, in the second half of 2014 and in the first half of 2015, the price of carbon allowances slightly increased. The price recorded in August 2015 was approximately <b>EUR</b> 8 per <b>tonne</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 - the highest price recorded since November 2012. In view of this trend, German-based companies involved in this survey have, in comparison with last year 2 ̆ 019 s survey, adjusted their short, middle, and long-term price expectations upwards. The inflation-adjusted price is accordingly expected to stand at EUR 7. 82 per <b>tonne</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 in December 2015. It is estimated, that the price will increase to EUR 15. 92 by 2020, and reach EUR 25. 45 by 2030. As price expectations remain below <b>EUR</b> 30 per <b>tonne</b> <b>of</b> CO 2, the surveyed companies still consider it unlikely that any real incentives to sustainably cut emissions will be created. In 2014, a majority of 76 per cent of companies, invested in the reduction of carbon emissions or shifted to green production processes. As previous studies have shown, however, only ten per cent of the responding companies actually had the objective of cutting carbon emissions. Process optimisation and investments in energy efficiency were the main motivations for any climate commitments made. The KfW/ZEW CO 2 Barometer is a joint project between KfW bank and ZEW. Since 2009, the project has served to analyse the impact of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on companies in Germany. Around 800 companies are invited to participate in the annual survey. On average, 140 companies each year provide information about their current situation and future strategies...|$|R

Sesame seeds contain about 50 – 60 % edible oil, which is consumed as a traditional health food for its specific antihypertensive effect and antioxidative activity (Coulman et al. 2005; Mochizuki et al. 2010; Jan et al. 2011). The global sesame production is estimated at 4 million tonnes and still steadily growing. China ranks first in sesame production (Data from FAO: 2001 – 2010) and sesame is a cash crop for exportation. However, the annual sesame consumption in China has substantially increased to 0.8 million tonnes in recent years, which is beyond the domestic production capacity. Therefore, more than 0.2 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> sesame were <b>imported</b> each year to meet domestic demand (Yang and Huang 2009).
