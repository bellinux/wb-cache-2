Special {{attention has been paid}} to logically heterogeneous object-oriented databases - where heterogeneity arises through independent design. We have focussed on supporting multiple integration views over the participating databases - as different users have different reasons for integration and the same user may need to integrate the same set of local <b>integration</b> <b>units</b> in various ways to suit different roles or tasks.

40|$|Deinococcus radiodurans R 1 {{and other}} members of this genus are able to repair and survive extreme DNA damage induced by {{ionizing}} radiation and many other DNA-damaging agents. The ability of R 1 to repair completely > 100 double-strand breaks in its chromosome without lethality or mutagenesis is recA dependent. However, during the first 1. 5 h after irradiation, recA+ and recA cells show similar increases in the average size of chromosomal fragments. In recA+ cells, DNA continues to enlarge to wild-type size within 29 h. However, in recA cells, no DNA repair is observed following the first 1. 5 h postirradiation. This recA-independent effect was studied further, using two slightly different Escherichia coli plasmids forming adjacent duplication insertions in the chromosome, providing repetitive sequences suitable for circularization by non-recA-dependent pathways following irradiation. After exposure to 1. 75 Mrad (17, 500 Gy), circular derivatives of the <b>integration</b> <b>units</b> were detected in both recA+ and recA cells. These DNA circles were formed in the first 1. 5 h postirradiation, several hours before the onset of detectable recA-dependent homologous recombination. By comparison, D. radiodurans strains containing the same E. coli plasmids as nonrepetitive direct insertions did not form circular derivatives of the <b>integration</b> <b>units</b> before or after irradiation in recA+ or recA cells. The circular derivatives of the tandemly integrated plasmids were formed before the onset of recA-dependent repair and have structures consistent with the hypothesis that DNA repair occurring immediately postirradiation is by a recA-independent single-strand annealing reaction and may be a preparatory step for further DNA repair in wild-type D. radiodurans...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} practices identified in Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is argumentation, which has been researched in P- 12 science education for the previous two decades but {{has yet to be}} studied within the context of P- 12 engineering education. This research explores how elementary and middle school science teachers incorporated argumentation into engineering design-based STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) <b>integration</b> curricular <b>units</b> they developed during a professional development program. To {{gain a better understanding of}} how teachers included argumentation in their curricula, a multiple case study approach was conducted using four STEM <b>integration</b> <b>units.</b> While evidence of argumentation was found in each curriculum, the degree to which it appeared in each case varied. The strongest potential for argumentation occurred when students were required to explain and justify their final engineering design solutions to the client; certain guiding questions and discussions also promoted argumentation, depending on their structure. Additionally, argumentation was found to support engineering concepts such as the process of design, engineering thinking, communication in engineering contexts, and the application of science, mathematics, and engineering content. These findings support the idea that argumentation can be integrated into P- 12 engineering education contexts in order to support students’ STEM learning...|$|R

40|$|Evaluating the {{effectiveness}} of integration formations requires an integrated approach that combines the use of both quantitative and qualitative indicators. Existing methods for analyzing {{the effectiveness}} of economic processes can not be formally applied {{to the problem of}} assessing {{the effectiveness of}} the implementation of the <b>integration</b> <b>units</b> for many reasons. Application of statistical analysis of historical data or case law causes difficulties due to the uniqueness of integration activities and the impossibility of duplicating administrative decisions due to the specifics of the internal environment of organizations, market instability, the effect of different environmental factors that necessitated the economic and mathematical modeling, expert assessments of the effectiveness of the <b>integration</b> <b>units</b> (EIF) with using linguistic variables and methods of the theory of fuzzy numbers. Selected mathematical tools used in the proposed model the theory of fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to analyze the qualitative variables, manipulate the input data and fuzzy linguistic criteria, as well as to model complex systems and to compare them with each other. Economic-mathematical model provides an assessment of EIF in two stages. At first defined the generalized evaluation of each of the nine blocks that characterize the contribution of block EIF, the second integral evaluation performed EIF. Conclusion on the integrated assessment of EIF can be obtained by analyzing the values of integrated assessments, reflecting the impact of the block. Recent consider, in turn, that comprehensive evaluations were obtained from the analysis values of the indicators. It is necessary to ensure the fulfillment of the requirement to increase the value of each evaluation index, or was coupled with an increase in value of EIF. This requirement is satisfied when the transition to the linguistic values. The algorithms implementing the steps vary the transitional linguistic variables qualitative indicators and values of linguistic variables estimated EIF, the rest of the algorithms are identical.
