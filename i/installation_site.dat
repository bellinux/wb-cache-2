Thus, typically there is an aim to make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations for this, including space available at the <b>installation</b> <b>site</b> and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes are difficult to take out and replace.|$|E

2500|$|As {{competition}} in the wind market increases, companies are seeking ways to draw greater efficiency from their designs. One of the predominant ways wind turbines have gained performance is by increasing rotor diameters, and thus blade length. Retrofitting current turbines with larger blades mitigates the need and risks associated with a system-level redesign. By incorporating carbon fiber into parts of existing blade systems, manufacturers may increase {{the length of the}} blades without increasing their overall weight. For instance, the spar cap, a structural element of a turbine blade, commonly experiences high tensile loading, making it an ideal candidate to utilize the enhanced tensile properties of carbon fiber in comparison to glass fiber. Higher stiffness and lower density translates to thinner, lighter blades offering equivalent performance. [...] In a 10-MW turbine—which will become more common in offshore systems by 2021—blade lengths may reach over 100 m and weigh up to 50 metric tons when fabricated out of glass fiber. A switch to carbon fiber in the structural spar of the blade yields weight savings of 20 to 30 percent, or approximately 15 metric tons. [...] The compressive properties of carbon fiber do not differ significantly from those of glass fiber. [...] It is therefore economical to replace glass fiber components under compression with carbon fiber components. [...] Improving performance through weight reductions rather than increasing scale also has advantages in transportation. [...] The size of a wind turbine, its blades and tower, are all limited by the height and width clearances, and turning radius, of the route used to transport the components to the <b>installation</b> <b>site.</b> The scale of these pieces has in some cases forced the adoption of Schnabel trailers.|$|E
