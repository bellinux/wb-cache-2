The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to <b>deserve</b> <b>it.</b> The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E

However, the Long Range Aviation command officer said that Igor Sikorsky is not responsible for the activities of his military aircraft. In 2013, Flying magazine ranked Sikorsky number 12 on its list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.|$|E

Cosimo later called at Wright's studio where he commissioned {{a portrait of the}} Duke of Albemarle from Wright. On 3 March 1673, perhaps some time after Wright had painted his state picture of Charles II (now in the Royal Collection), a strange letter was sent from an obscure [...] "Mairie Lady Hermistan" [...] (evidently a fellow Roman Catholic) to Cosimo, asking him to intercede with the King to grant Wright a baronetcy.

She didn't even read or write it!" [...] Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman with the comment, [...] "I suspect that Carla's reaction may be shared by other young people who worked in the Nixon campaign". Nixon assistant Charles E. Stuart replied to Reinecke, stating, [...] "Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign, or even because she made the sign, but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon" [...] and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans.|$|E

She seems to have inherited traits from both her parents, like her mother's [...] verbal tic and her father's aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge certain people, but she is not above commending them when they truly <b>deserve</b> <b>it.</b> Sarada is a central character of Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, searching for her estranged father while feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada felt hurt and betrayed when she suspects being Karins's biological child as the two wear similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family {{is not a matter of}} blood, Sarada later learns that Sakura is her biological mother as Karin explained that she was Sakura's midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage one day. She finds Boruto annoying, but is later hinted to have a mutual crush on him. Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese. While in the English version, she is voiced by Laura Bailey in , and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances.|$|E

The Croppers, especially Roy, were the thing that really turned public opinion [...] around to being positive." [...] Grace Dent of The Guardian commented on Becky's wedding describing her appearance as: [...] " [...] Oil-stained pink princess frock carrying a two litre bottle of street-drinker fuel, shouting football chants, with the words eruditely swapped to honour the groom. Becky's beehive lurched like a detonated high rise, her lip colour swept westward on to her earlobe, a Regal King Size blazed in her gob." [...] With their wedding ruined, Dent commented that although it was karma, they didn't <b>deserve</b> <b>it</b> because [...] "Viewers want Steve and Becky to be together".
