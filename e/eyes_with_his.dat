2500|$|Ali {{later said}} in round five {{he could only}} see a faint shadow of Liston {{during most of the}} round, but by {{circling}} and moving frantically he managed to avoid Liston and somehow survive. At one point, Ali was wiping his <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> right hand while extending his left arm—"like a drunk leaning on a lamppost" [...] Bert Sugar wrote—to keep Liston at bay.|$|E
2500|$|After several {{tours in}} support of the album Very Proud of Ya, Kresge decided to leave the group. His spot was filled by Hunter Burgan for the {{remaining}} Very Proud of Ya tour dates. Burgan went on to help AFI record Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes (1997) and was invited to become the full-time bassist. Future AFI guitarist Jade Puget also provided background vocals on Shut Your Mouth and Open Your <b>Eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> name credited as 'Jade [...] "The Playah" [...] Puget', making it the first album to feature all four current members of the band. The release of Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes is also notable because AFI started to gather a larger following.|$|E
2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fingers through his face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking {{the ball into the}} end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important—like a league game or something." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{young man}} met his sister's {{somewhat}} peremptory <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> bright, contented glance. [...] "Yes, it {{certainly will be}} pleasanter," [...] he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... (Pausing for a reply, {{he opened}} <b>his</b> right <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand, {{and stuck his}} glass in it, in that {{inflammatory}} manner that his eye began watering dreadfully.) ...|$|R

60|$|Striking {{the man a}} blow in the <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{disengaged}} hand, {{he kicked}} upward an instant later, hitting the tramp fairly {{on the back of}} the head as he involuntarily sprang backwards from the effects of the pain.|$|R
60|$|When {{he looked}} up, Mr Springett, alone, was wiping his <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> green-and-yellow pocket-handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|Mr. May {{wiped his}} <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{handkerchief}} which had unfortunately mopped up his whiskey.|$|E
60|$|The man obeyed. He {{covered his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hand, for a moment, {{as though in}} pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, that's {{the best}} plan," [...] Fothergill agreed, [...] "but it's {{not so easy}} to follow. That fellow very nearly poked out my <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> stick, and no one's going to stand that if he can help it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} her <b>with</b> <b>his</b> round <b>eyes,</b> playing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> locket.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cannister {{stood up}} and touched his {{forehead}} over <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> finger, in respectful salutation of Elfride, gave half as much salute to Stephen (whom he, in common with other villagers, had never for a moment recognized), then sat down again and resumed his discourse.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, {{breathing}} irregularly. He {{squeezed his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> knuckles and sat {{waiting for an}} answer.|$|E

50|$|De Luca's {{position}} {{of choice is}} as a Centre. He can also operate at Full-back and Wing.

6000|$|Then {{he bowed}} low, {{and when he}} rose he was eleven feet high. As he swelled out past me he covertly pulled down the corner of <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> finger and muttered part of that defiled refrain, [...] "Oh, tears, ah, tears, oh, sad sweet tears!name in General Orderspersonal mention to the King, you see!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He climbed ashore, and I follered ’im to {{the gate}} and {{unlocked}} it.
