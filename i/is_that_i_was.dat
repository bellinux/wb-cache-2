25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told that the cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened {{as far as the}} viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

All I can say <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so sports-unaware that I didn't know about the earlier logo. I feel like a total idiot now that I didn't know about it. I'm flabbergasted." ...|$|E

2500|$|Colonel Giuseppe Montezemolo's {{incredible}} courage under torture {{that included}} having his nails and teeth pulled out, became legendary. Another was General Simone Simoni , {{a war hero}} aged 64, who had endured torture with a blowtorch. The old soldier had replied to his captors, [...] "My only regret <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not younger because {{there was so much}} more I could have done [...] ". Neither man ever talked or in any way betrayed their network.|$|E
2500|$|... "I do not regret {{trying to}} get the message out to {{corporate}} America about unfair pricing and restrictive trade practices. That was the impetus for doing what I did; that's the reason I jammed HBO; that's the reason I sent them a polite message. What I do regret <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young and fairly naïve in the ways of the media. I didn't grasp the fact that no one understood my motives and that everyone would make assumptions. Had I known that up front I would have been much more fervent in explaining my motivations. I had no animus and I had no malice in my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Fat EP was {{recorded}} in March 1981 at Music Lab studios in Hollywood with producer Spot, and was released later that year by New Alliance Records. [...] "Weinerschnitzel", titled after the fast-food chain, is the shortest song on the EP at 10 seconds, with Lombardo {{playing the role of}} the restaurant's counterman while Aukerman shouts his food order at him. The 16-second [...] "I Like Food" [...] also takes food as its topic, with Aukerman shouting out the names of various foodstuffs. Several other songs about food were written, but did not make it onto the EP. [...] "We were never organized enough to have concepts", recalled Stevenson in 2013. [...] "The fact of the matter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 250 pounds and obsessed with chili burgers and stuff. And Frank was a little overweight at the time, too. So we were embracing our gluttony". [...] "Mr. Bass" [...] {{tells the story of a}} bass being caught during a fishing trip on board the Orca and being mounted on the fisherman's wall. Navetta drew the illustrations for the front and back cover of the EP.|$|E
50|$|Transferring from Middlebury College in Vermont, Knowles {{graduated}} from the Pratt Institute in 1956. Since {{her father was a}} professor at Pratt, she was able to enroll in the school at no cost. During night classes, Knowles studied painting with abstract expressionist Adolph Gottlieb. She admired Helen Frankenthal and had acquaintance with the work of Jackson Pollock. Franz Kline also taught some of the painting courses. During the day, Knowles studied graphic design and commercial layout. A class taught by painter Richard Lindner proved very influential for Knowles. “What <b>I</b> learned there <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an artist. What I should have learned there <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a painter,” said Knowles in a 2006 interview.|$|R

In my speech at UN, {{the first thing}} <b>I</b> said <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> for conversion, but not from one {{organised}} religion to another, but from misery to happiness, from bondage to liberation."

6000|$|... "The cold fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only {{afraid you}} wouldn't take me. It's a big {{inducement}} {{to know that}} one has a reasonable supply of provisions in hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{learned the}} hard way how deflating it can be to get too excited by a {{prospect}} before you know for sure that it will come off. The worst aspect of this fiasco <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> now not only jobless but homeless." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Carlos Lozano's biography, Sex, Surrealism, Dalí, and Me, {{produced}} with the collaboration of Clifford Thurlow, Lozano {{makes it clear}} that Dalí never stopped being a surrealist. As Dalí said of himself: [...] "the only difference between me and the surrealists <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a surrealist".|$|R
5000|$|Drew {{explained}} his stage name during {{an appearance on}} USA Today in 2007, stating, [...] "The whole reason for calling myself Plan B <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing this sweet-boy Justin Timberlake shit, but I never felt comfortable... when I started rapping, {{it was easier for}} me to feel comfortable." ...|$|R
60|$|As for the City Bard, or Knight Physician, I {{hear his}} quarrel to me <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{the author of}} Absalom and Achitophel, which he thinks is a little hard on his fanatic patrons in London.|$|E
60|$|What is not {{generally}} known <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there myself. I appeared,--in rivalry with Prince Luis Fernando--dressed as a Bombay soda water bottle, with aerial opalescent streaks of light flashing from the costume which was bound with single wire.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{am certain}} of any thing," [...] he thought, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never {{a person who}} would kick a poor old man. I will leave this place. I was {{transformed}} from nothing that I see here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Campese later confessed that, [...] "The chief talking-point <b>was</b> {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> awarded a try which I never touched down properly. It {{was not a}} score.

5000|$|Russians call me German, Germans call me Russian, Jews {{call me a}} Christian, Christians a Jew. Pianists call me a composer, composers call me a pianist.

6000|$|... 'Why, really,' {{replied the}} clergyman, 'it's a very slight affair; {{and the only}} excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a young man at the time. Such as it is, however, you shall hear it, if you wish.' ...|$|E

60|$|Dr. Chambers {{has just}} been here, and does not think me quite as well as usual. The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather excited and tired {{yesterday}} by rather too much talking and hearing talking, and suffer for it to-day in my pulse. But I am better on the whole.|$|E
50|$|The reason I {{had such}} a deep {{interest}} in economic reform and devoted myself to finding ways to undertake this reform <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> determined to eradicate the malady of China’s economic system at its roots.

5000|$|The {{subject matter}} of Fantastic Art may {{resemble}} the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist Richard Dadd {{spent much of his}} life in mental institutions. Salvador Dalí famously said: [...] "the only difference between me and a madman <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not mad". [...] Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of hallucinogenic drugs.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah! that is {{the worst}} part of my behaviour,' said Elizabeth; 'that abominably unfair account which I gave you, at Mr. Turner's door, of Helen's objections.

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{criticism}} of his passion about {{the coming of the}} Messiah and, his urging people to do all they could to bring about the redemption by adding in the observance of Torah and Mitzvahs, <b>was</b> something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> known to him.
