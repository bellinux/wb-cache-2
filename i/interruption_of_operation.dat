40|$|A {{concept is}} {{proposed}} of the thermally driven Josephson effect in superfluid helium. Heretofore, the Josephson effect in a superfluid {{has been recognized}} as an oscillatory flow that arises {{in response to a}} steady pressure difference between two superfluid reservoirs separated by an array of submicron-sized orifices, which act in unison as a single Josephson junction. Analogously, the thermally driven Josephson effect is an oscillatory flow that arises in response to a steady temperature difference. The thermally driven Josephson effect is partly a consequence of a quantum- mechanical effect known as the fountain effect, in which a temperature difference in a superfluid is accompanied by a pressure difference. The thermally driven Josephson effect may have significance {{for the development of a}} high-resolution gyroscope based on the Josephson effect in a superfluid: If the pressure-driven Josephson effect were used, then the fluid on the high-pressure side would become depleted, necessitating periodic <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> to reverse the pressure difference.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{following}} paper we consider {{a problem of}} fault detection for a mobile robot. The robot which our work is related to, {{is based on a}} new type of the steering principle [1]. The crucial part of the steering system are axle position sensors. A failure of one of them might result in an <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and/or serious damages to hardware and environment elements. To avoid the risk of such events, a reliable fault detection system has to be implemented. Fault detection is facilitated by incorporating measurements from various sensors located on board of the robot (incremental encoders, absolute encoders, sonar, cameras, compass, GPS). In our work we consider the Bayesian approach (Kalman filter [2, 3] and particle filters [4, 5, 6]) to create a diagnostic system of the robot. Due to the limited resources of the computing unit it is necessary to strongly optimize the efficiency of applied algorithms. In our work we plan to perform simulations to find the best suited algorithm for our vehicle. Accordingly, we build a numerical tool in MATLAB to simulate mobile robot navigation and fault diagnosis tasks. We also present the construction of our robot and explain how a reliable fault detection system is important for the proper functioning and safety of the mobile robot. We introduce the fault detection algorithms which we plan to apply in the described hardware solution. At the end, we summarize our work and provide an outlook on our future research plans...|$|E

40|$|Ground-based {{gravitational}} wave interferometers {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) are susceptible to high-magnitude teleseismic events, which can interrupt their operation in science mode and significantly reduce the duty cycle. It can take several hours for a detector to stabilize enough to return to its nominal state for scientific observations. The down time can be reduced if advance warning of impending shaking is received and the impact is suppressed in the isolation system {{with the goal of}} maintaining stable operation even at the expense of increased instrumental noise. Here we describe an early warning system for modern gravitational-wave observatories. The system relies on near real-time earthquake alerts provided by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hypocenter and magnitude information is generally available in 5 to 20 minutes of a significant earthquake depending on its magnitude and location. The alerts are used to estimate arrival times and ground velocities at the gravitational-wave detectors. In general, 90 % of the predictions for ground-motion amplitude are within a factor of 5 of measured values. The error in both arrival time and ground-motion prediction introduced by using preliminary, rather than final, hypocenter and magnitude information is minimal. By using a machine learning algorithm, we develop a prediction model that calculates the probability that a given earthquake will prevent a detector from taking data. Our initial results indicate that by using detector control configuration changes, we could prevent <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> from 40 - 100 earthquake events in a 6 -month time-period...|$|E
40|$|A new multivariate risk-based fault {{detection}} and diagnosis technique targeting the safety issues {{of a process}} system is being proposed. In contrast to typical {{fault detection}} methods which only aim to detect operational faults that affect the control objectives of the process, this method targets {{the safety of the}} process. Typical fault detection and diagnosis methods are inadequate as none of the methods considers the consequences of the fault on process safety, integrity and the environment. However the proposed method provides a dynamic process risk indication based on the probability of occurrence of a fault and its consequences. In this method, the consequence is expressed in economic value that demonstrates the potential economic impact of the fault on the process, equipment, workers and the environment. Through this approach, warning system and risk management strategies may be activated when the risk of operation exceeds the acceptable threshold. This is an important concept because it can direct the attention and effort of operators to the faults which poses the most operational or safety risk. Both model based and history based fault detection and diagnosis techniques have been extended to a risk-based fault detection and diagnosis framework. Application of this new risk-based approach provides early warnings and early activation of safety systems prior to the fault impacting the system. This multivariate technique provides much early warning compared to the univariate methods. It has more power in discerning between operational changes and abnormal conditions which have potential to cause accidents. The main benefits of this approach are improved safety, minimum <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> better alarm management or early warning system and higher availability of process. The novelties and contributions of this work are development of multivariate dynamic risk assessment methodology using history based and model based methods for linear and nonlinear models combined with a newly developed economic consequence analysis methodology. This methodology makes the severity of the faults more sensible by quantifying consequences in economic terms. This new economic consequence methodology helps to integrates real time process state to accident scenarios via loss functions. The proposed framework when implemented on a process could serve as a real-time process risk monitor. This would help to take preventive actions in order to minimize process risks...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{proposed and}} verified an innovative method {{to identify and}} locate structural damage using only the response of operational vibration, that is the displacement acquired by a non-contact optical method. The most efficient and economical way to detect damage within the structure is to monitor its structural health while in operation. However, the uncertainties and the randomness of ambient vibrations due to the operation and environments cause a challenge in conducting the operational analysis. Current technology limits the ability {{to collect data on}} the properties of the structure without the <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Frequencies and mode shapes have been widely used in structural damage detection, but they are not sensitive enough and cannot provide sufficient information for identifying damage locations and their quantification. Therefore, the goal of this research is to design and verify a method to detect the damage, as well as its location and severity, of structures in operation without any physical contacts for data acquisition (i. e., non-contact based structural health monitoring (SHM)). Three algorithms are integrated into this SHM process. The first algorithm is the determination of structural characteristics (frequencies and mode shapes) of a vibrating structure from output-only data. Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) method is applied to measured displacements over time to extract the structural characteristics. The second algorithm is to estimate the scaling factor. The mode shapes obtained from the output-only model analysis are unscaled due to the absence of the information of input excitation forces. Mass Change Modal Scale (McMS) algorithm is used to estimate the modal scaling factors and determine the scaled mode shapes. The third algorithm is to estimate the structural system matrices (i. e., mass and stiffness matrices) and assess the damages. A Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU) is applied and the system matrices are updated from frequencies and scaled mode shapes. The damage within the structure can then be detected by analysing changes in mass and stiffness matrices. All three phases are verified by numerical simulation and laboratory experiments with deflections acquired by non-contact optical methods through video system. At last, to achieve the non-contact based SHM, a modal scaling method based on temperature change is proposed and verified by numerical simulation. Experimental program reveals that the proposed algorithm using McMS method is applicable to detect damage locations and their mass losses. With proposed non-contacted based SHM, the limitations of contact based sensor can be addressed, and the structural damage can be assessed without any interruption of structure operation...|$|E
40|$|The German small {{satellite}} TET- 1 {{has been}} {{launched into a}} low-Earth orbit on July 22 nd, 2012, from the launch site in Baikonur, Kazakhstan. The satellite carries various technology demonstration payloads, among them the Navigation and Occultation Experiment NOX. This payload consists of a geodetic-grade GPS receiver (Septentrio PolaRx 2), which is connected via an antenna selector to two Sensor Systems GPS L 1 /L 2 patch antennas. One of the antennas is mounted on the satellite’s zenith panel and receives signals primarily used for precise orbit determination (POD) experiments. The second antenna is pointed towards the anti-flight direction of the satellite for collecting measurements of low elevation satellites for ionospheric or even tropospheric occultations. The antenna switch allows to select either the POD or the occultation antenna for signal reception. The PolaRx 2 receiver is based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics and has been complemented with a rapid electronic fuse to protect against single-event latch-up effects. Furthermore, the unit has been qualified in vibration, thermal-vacuum and total-ionizing radiation tests to ensure a proper operation in a space environment. The receiver is operated with a dedicated firmware version without height and velocity limitations. Furthermore, the Doppler search window has been increased to 45 kHz to facilitate satellite acquisition under the high dynamics of the space-borne scenario. The receiver provides GPS pseudorange as well as C/N 0 measurements for C/A-code on L 1 and P(Y) code on L 1 and L 2 for up to 16 satellites. Carrier-phase and Doppler observations are provided for L 1 C/A-code and L 2 P(Y) code. The receiver settings can be changed via ground command, which gives full flexibility to adjust the configuration for the required operation mode for POD or occultation measurements. Being part of the satellite's experimental payload instead of the bus system, the NOX receiver is not operated continuously but instead during dedicated experimental slots, in general once per week for 12 - 24 hours. So far, no latch-up effects or other radiation-induced failures have occurred during {{the operation of the}} payload. The time-to-first-fix (TTFF) after receiver activation has been measured to range from 90 - 180 seconds. These results confirm previous results of a signal simulator test for an orbit scenario with an identical receiver and firmware [1]. A short TTFF is particularly relevant for the use of space-borne COTS-technology, since a radiation-induced receiver failure only leads to a short <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The carrier-to-noise spectral density ratio in boresight direction is approximately 47 dB-Hz (+/- 2 dB-Hz) for L 1 C/A and 32 dB-Hz (+/- 2 dB-Hz) for P(Y). These results are slightly lower than expected from pre-launch ground tests and {{can be attributed to the}} use of a simple patch-antenna without choke-ring. At a zero-degree elevation mask the receiver was able to track up to 14 GPS satellites simultaneously, which is significantly higher than other space-borne receivers with a typical limit of 8 - 12 satellites. The advantages are a higher robustness of the POD especially in kinematic processing as well as higher chances to detect and eliminate measurement outliers in the data screening. Using an empirically calibrated phase-center variation pattern for the POD antenna, the carrier-phase residuals for reduced-dynamic POD can be reduced to 9 mm, which is slightly higher than the noise typically obtained for other space-borne dual-frequency receivers. Pseudorange noise of the receiver is approximately 70 cm for the ionosphere-free dual-frequency combination. The receiver's navigation solution is computed from dual-frequency data and has an error of approximately 2 meter 3 D rms compared to a highly-precise carrier-phase-based POD solution. The final paper includes a detailed description of the TET satellite and the NOX payload. The receiver's tracking performance and the accuracy of the navigation solution is analyzed. Finally, tracking results of the occultation antenna are presented and the suitability of COTS receiver technology for GNSS radio science investigations is assessed.
