25|$|Near-sightedness, {{also known}} as {{short-sightedness}} and myopia, is a condition of the eye where light focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. This causes distant objects to be blurry while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and <b>eye</b> <b>strain.</b> Severe near-sightedness {{increases the risk of}} retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|People {{with early}} {{keratoconus}} typically notice a minor blurring of their vision {{and come to}} their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of keratoconus may be no {{different from those of}} any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), <b>eye</b> <b>strain</b> from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{literature}} review writes that studies in several nations {{have found a}} relationship between myopia and higher IQ and between myopia and school achievement. Several, but not all, studies have found hyperopia {{to be associated with}} lower IQ and school achievements. A common explanation for myopia is near-work. Regarding the relationship to IQ, several explanations have been proposed. One is that the myopic child is better adapted at reading, and reads and studies more, which increases intelligence. The reverse explanation is that the intelligent and studious child reads more which causes myopia. Another is that the myopic child have an advantage at IQ testing which is near work because of less <b>eye</b> <b>strain.</b> Still another explanation is that pleiotropic gene(s) affect the size of both brain and eyes simultaneously. A study of Chinese schoolchildren found that after controlling for age, gender, school, parental myopia, father’s education, and books read per week, myopia was still associated with high nonverbal IQ. Nonverbal IQ was a more important explanation than books read per week.|$|E

500|$|Bates' {{techniques}} {{have never been}} scientifically established to improve eyesight. Several of Bates' techniques, including [...] "sunning", [...] "swinging", and [...] "palming", were combined with healthy changes to diet and exercise in a 1983 randomized controlled trial of myopic children in India. After 6 months, the experimental groups [...] "did not show any statistically significant difference in refractive status", though {{the children in the}} treatment group [...] "subjectively … felt relieved of <b>eye</b> <b>strain</b> and other symptoms".|$|E
500|$|U2 {{developed}} {{a style of}} editing in their previous concert films that involved fast cutting between shots, which Owens wanted to retain in U2 3D. Because fast cutting in 3D would lead to motion sickness or <b>eye</b> <b>strain,</b> the film was edited to incorporate dissolves of at least four frames between shots. Many of the transitions were created by layering several frames of footage {{on top of one}} another into composite images. Each of the layered frames featured a different depth of field to enhance the 3D effects, and up to five images were layered together in a single shot. This made U2 3D the first 3D film to feature composite images with more than two layers, and the first to be edited specifically to prevent the viewer from experiencing motion sickness or <b>eye</b> <b>strain.</b> Software did not exist at the time to layer the 3D images, so new software had to be developed. [...] Because the project was captured in high-definition video, each frame used nearly 20 megabytes of data on 3ality Digital's servers, and the entire film used almost a petabyte (1015 bytes). The 3D editing process took longer than Owens expected, and consequently, the project went over budget, costing $15million to produce. Video editing took 17months, and the final film was cut to a length of 85minutes—seven shorter than originally announced.|$|E
500|$|Brett Elston at GamesRadar {{thought the}} {{gameplay}} was [...] "fairly basic", but still enjoyed the game, calling it unusually well made. Nintendo Life's Dave Frear enjoyed the game, but wished it had included some puzzle elements {{rather than focusing}} entirely on combat; he did however find the strategic thinking involved in going back to earlier areas and {{figuring out how to}} save time to make up for this to some extent. Meanwhile, Jason Moore of N64 Magazine wished it had included role-playing elements. Frear enjoyed the replayability resulting from the multiple characters and difficulty settings. GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz called it [...] "excellent [...] solidly designed" [...] {{to the point where he}} would keep playing it despite the <b>eye</b> <b>strain</b> the Virtual Boy would give him.|$|E

500|$|Cloth {{has been}} used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. The {{predecessor}} company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of baize that is dyed green, and is made from 100% worsted wool, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table [...] The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass, and has been so colored since the 16th century. However, as in green eyeshades, the color also serves a useful function: Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color, so green cloth permits play {{for longer periods of time}} without <b>eye</b> <b>strain.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following a {{childhood}} accident, Stainer {{had lost the}} use of one eye. There is some confusion about this and he may merely have had a lazy eye, but {{for a brief period}} in 1875 he feared he was losing the sight of the other eye. This proved not to be the case, but he suffered from <b>eye</b> <b>strain</b> and impairment to his vision for much of his life. This was a major reason for his decision to retire from St Paul's Cathedral in 1888, while still in his forties. As Bumpus was to write, [...] "Such honours as are at the disposal of his fellow musicians have been freely showered upon him, for he is universally beloved and esteemed, but his many onerous duties, his organistship of this, his presidency of that, and his incessant hard work as an examiner, have all involved responsibility and constant application, and the result is that his sight and general health have given way under the severe strain of sheer hard work." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{producers}} Jon and Peter Shapiro {{created a}} 2D IMAX concert film titled All Access, which featured live performances of several musicians. [...] Due {{to the difficulty}} of using conventional IMAX film stock that had to be replaced every three minutes of shooting, the Shapiros wanted to use digital technology for their next project, which could easily be upscaled to the IMAX format without loss of quality. [...] Noting how 3D films out-performed 2D films, they also wanted their next project to be in the IMAX 3D format. [...] While looking for a new digital 3D technology medium, the Shapiros met producer Steve Schklair, founder of Cobalt Entertainment in 2000. Schklair had recently developed a digital 3D filming technique known as [...] "active depth cut", which allowed for smooth cuts between shots that would normally not line up when filmed in 3D. This was done using motion control photography and real-time image processing to create a realistic 3D experience without subjecting the viewer to excessive motion sickness or <b>eye</b> <b>strain.</b> It was intended to be an inexpensive and effective way to shoot live events such as concerts or sports. With the help of John and David Modell, former owners of the Baltimore Ravens American football team, the digital 3D technology was tested at several National Football League (NFL) games in the 2003 season, including Super Bowl XXXVIII. Cobalt showed the footage to the NFL, hoping to create an NFL-based 3D IMAX film. While waiting for a response, the Shapiros proposed the idea of creating a 3D concert film for IMAX theaters. Although All Access had showcased several artists, the Shapiros now wanted to focus on a single act, and being U2 fans, suggested the band as a potential subject. Schklair felt U2 would be a good choice for the film due to their large concert setups and their constant movement while performing, both of which would provide good depth of field for 3D effects.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with his}} musical gifts, Rachmaninoff possessed {{physical}} gifts {{that may have}} placed him in good stead as a pianist. These gifts included exceptional height and extremely large hands with a gigantic finger stretch (he could play the chord C E G C G with his left hand). This and Rachmaninoff's slender frame, long limbs, narrow head, prominent ears, and thin nose suggest {{that he may have}} had Marfan syndrome, a hereditary disorder of the connective tissue. This syndrome would have accounted for several minor ailments he suffered all his life, including back pain, arthritis, <b>eye</b> <b>strain,</b> and bruising of the fingertips, although others have pointed out that this was more likely because he was playing the piano all day long. This Marfan speculation was proposed by Dr. D. A. B. Young (formerly principal scientist of the Wellcome Foundation) in a 1986 British Medical Journal article. Twenty years later, an article in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, by Ramachandran and Aronson differed greatly from Young's speculation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Corrective lenses {{are used}} to correct {{refractive}} errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (Hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one may need a [...] "stronger", (i.e. more [...] refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which {{is caused by the}} eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Corrective lenses, to bring the image back into focus on the retina, are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. [...] A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. [...] Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from <b>eye</b> <b>strain,</b> such as headaches or squinting.|$|E

5000|$|Generally speaking, {{when people}} are working on {{computers}} their eyes move from the screen, to the background and to adjacent visual attractions. Each time the eye moves, it adjusts to the new lighting level. If the degree of adaptation between visual tasks is too great, <b>eye</b> <b>strain,</b> fatigue and stress result. Similarly, a significant cause of <b>eye</b> <b>strain</b> for computer users is reflected light from poorly placed light fixtures on glass screens. Glare and brightness ratios provide guidelines for lighting schemes within libraries to minimise <b>eye</b> <b>strain.</b> Considering these ratios in balancing different light sources can be complicated considering a library's various uses, from computer-screen use and microfiche, to reading and browsing, but is important in creating a productive and safe library atmosphere for all patrons.|$|E
