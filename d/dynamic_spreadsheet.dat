40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{there has}} been a growing focus on central {{statistical}} ideas or ‘big ideas’ in statistical reasoning such as centre, distribution, and variability in research studies. To date, however, there is a paucity of assessments that integrate three statistical reasoning using information technology, i. e. reasoning about centre, spread, and distribution for high school students. Thus, a statistical reasoning assessment instrument concerning these domains is developed in order to enhance tenth-grade students’ statistical reasoning abilities during the instruction. Its content was validated by three experts in related fields. There are five statistical reasoning tasks in the assessment instrument which have been created based on the initial statistical reasoning framework. Each item is associated with the sub-processes of four key constructs, i. e. describing data, organizing and reducing data, representing data, and analyzing and interpreting data. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> of GeoGebra software is used as a technological tool in solving tasks. This statistical reasoning assessment instrument can be utilized by instructors and researchers for further investigation in future studies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a spreadsheet-based {{approach}} to teaching simulation. The objective is to introduce spreadsheets as a powerful simulation tool for educational purposes. The spreadsheet simulation facilitates the familiarisation with basic simulation concepts apart from simulation software. The paper deals with basic types of simulation models suitable for spreadsheets. The static stochastic or Monte Carlo simulation models are introduced through a sample model for lead-time demand distribution evaluation. The two main types of <b>dynamic</b> simulation <b>spreadsheets</b> models are overviewed as well. The discrete-event system simulation basic concepts are introduced by simulating a two-server system with a single queue. A population dynamics simulation model presents the System Dynamics concepts. The basic simulation model types that are available on spreadsheets {{make it possible to}} study simulation concepts, methodology, and techniques as well as to use spreadsheets for on-hand simulation in business games, case studies, engineering, etc. The overviewed experiences in using spreadsheets for teaching simulation result in indication of spreadsheets as an alternative simulation software...|$|R

40|$|GeoGebra is an {{open-source}} educational mathematics software tool, {{with millions}} of users worldwide. It {{has a number of}} features (integration of computer algebra, <b>dynamic</b> geometry, <b>spreadsheet,</b> etc.), primarily focused on facilitating student experiments, and not on formal reasoning. Since including automated deduction tools in GeoGebra could bring a whole new range of teaching and learning scenarios, and since automated theorem proving and discovery in geometry has reached a rather mature stage, we embarked on a project of incorporating and testing a number of different automated provers for geometry in GeoGebra. In this paper, we present the current achievements and status of this project, and discuss various relevant challenges that this project raises in the educational, mathematical and software contexts. We will describe, first, the recent and forthcoming changes demanded by our project, regarding the implementation and the user interface of GeoGebra. Then we present our vision of the educational scenarios that could be supported by automated reasoning features, and how teachers and students could benefit from the present work. In fact, current performance of GeoGebra, extended with automated deduction tools, is already very promising—many complex theorems can be proved in less than 1 second. Thus, we believe that many new and exciting ways of using GeoGebra in the classroom are on their way...|$|R

The massive expansion {{of the state in}} post-war Europe has rested on a greatly enlarged fiscal base, yet little is known about how that fiscal base has evolved. This is surprising {{in view of the fact}} that the questions of how governments get money, and from whom they get it, are seen to be two of the most important political issues faced in any modern political economy. While most studies of fiscal history try to provide answers to the first question by analyzing the ideological, political and administrative inputs to tax policy, the project's aim was to provide answers to the second question. The project focused on the outcomes of tax policy; what different households across Western Europe have paid in taxes (income tax and social security contributions) at all points on the income scale since 1958. Since such information is not in the public domain we have used national tax rules and wage rates were used in order to infer what households with particular characteristics would have paid in direct taxes each year since 1958. Using the <b>dynamic</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> EuroPTax, details of the effective rates of income tax and social security contributions paid by different households in all the major European democracies since 1958 are provided for the first time as part of the project. Main Topics : The dynamic Excel spreadsheets, known as EuroPTax, enable the user to calculate the income tax at both national and local level as well as the social security contributions paid by a hypothetical household of a specified structure on a specified income, in one of nine different countries in Western Europe over the period 1958 - 2007. The countries included in EuroPTax are: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The calculations are derived from the national tax rules published by the following sources: HMSO (Board of Inland Revenue); Tolley's Income Tax; International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation; Coopers and Lybrand; OECD; and German Ministry of Finance. The wages used are multiples of the average production worker's wage found in National Year Books and in the International Labour Organisation. Social Security statistics are mainly derived from Social Security Programs throughout the world of the Social Security Administration of the United States Dept of Health Education and Welfare. In those countries where local taxation is levied, the rates used are the average for the country. <br...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Energy, Environment and Society, 2010 Today {{there are}} 2. 4 billion people {{exclusively}} {{dependent on the}} combustion of low quality biomass fuels in open fires and inefficient traditional stoves for household cooking. When compared to higher quality fuels and modern technologies, these methods come with many negative and avoidable consequences {{in the areas of}} public health, global climate change, environmental degradation, and poverty. Improved Cookstoves (ICS) can {{be a part of the}} solution to many of these widespread problems. ICSs, when properly designed and utilized, can improve public health, reduce global warming and deforestation, and help the world???s poorest families climb out of the poverty trap. ICS dissemination efforts have been underway since the 1970 s with limited success, and today there is a growing interest and focus on tapping into the power of the market to distribute ICSs throughout the world. While the market presents a prodigious opportunity for increasing the penetration of ICS worldwide, there are a number of barriers that have inhibited this pathway from becoming a viable alternative to donation-based dissemination models. In this thesis I identify and discuss many of these barriers and focus on information gaps that are inhibiting key players in ICS manufacturing and marketing sectors from more effectively designing, manufacturing and marketing stoves. Through the lens of the Do??a Dora ICS case study in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, I demonstrate a set of tools and methods to estimate economic viability using tradition financial metrics including net present value, internal rate of return, time to payback and benefit to cost ratio. One of the outcomes of this work is the Cookstove Calculator, a <b>dynamic</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> tool. With this tool, and a short household survey, cookstove manufacturers and marketing programs can quickly analyze the feasibility of an investment in any stove for any family. The Cookstove Calculator can also be combined with data from a random household survey to estimate total market demand. In this thesis I demonstrate this tool and these methods to estimate that the Do??a Dora ICS is a net positive investment for roughly 40, 000 households in rural Quetzaltenango. I also show how these tools and methods can be used to identify critical thresholds in stove parameters, such as fuel savings, sales price, and product lifetime that determine investment viability.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a specification for a computer based modelling system in geography. The modelling system will be for use in upper secondary school geography classes. The classroom approach to geography reflects the developments within the broader academic discipline. By adopting a systems analysis approach, it is possible to represent models on the computer, from the full range of geographical approaches. The essence of geographical modelling {{is to be able to}} use a computer based environment to manipulate, and create, the inter-relationships of the components of a geographical system. The development of the specification for the modelling system, follows an eleven step methodology. This has been adapted and modified from the Research and Development Methodology. It includes a formative evaluation of the prototypes in classroom trials. The possible forms of representation of geographical ideas on the computer are considered. Procedural and declarative models are developed, as prototypes, on a range of software tools. The software tools used, for the initial developments, are the <b>Dynamic</b> Modelling System, <b>spreadsheets</b> and the language, Prolog. The final prototype is developed in a Smalltalk environment. Consideration is also given to the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods of modelling. Model templates are identified which give an underlying structure to a range of geographical models. These templates allow the students to build new models for different geographical areas. Proposals are made for a staged approach which addresses the introduction and use of modelling in the geography classroom. These stages move through the use of simulation, through the modification of the underlying model, to the transfer of the model template to different areas and finally, the building of new models...|$|R
