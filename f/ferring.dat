This estuary became blocked with shingle by the eastward drift of the tides, pushing the Adur towards Shoreham-by-Sea, while the Arun broke out at Worthing, Goring and <b>Ferring</b> at various times, until it formed its present estuary at Littlehampton between 1500 and 1530.|$|E

25|$|Lying on {{the south}} coast of England, Worthing is {{situated}} on a mix of two beds of sedimentary rock. The {{large part of the}} town, including the town centre is built upon chalk (part of the Chalk Group), with a bed of London clay found in a band heading west from Lancing through Broadwater and Durrington. There are no major rivers within the borough, however the culverted Teville Stream begins as a spring in what is now allotments in Tarring, runs along Tarring Road and Teville Road north of the town centre, passing to the east through Homefield Park and Davison High School before meeting the sea at Brooklands where the Broadwater Brook meets the sea. To the west and also in parts culverted, <b>Ferring</b> Rife rises in Durrington near Littlehampton Road, passing through Maybridge, then west of <b>Ferring</b> into the sea.|$|E
40|$|Root iron {{mobilization}} {{genes are}} induced by iron deficiency downstream {{of an unknown}} signaling mechanism. The <b>FER</b> gene, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix domain protein and putative transcription factor, is required for induction of iron mobilization genes in roots of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). To study upstream regulatory events of <b>FER</b> action, we examined the control of <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein expression in response to iron nutritional status. We analyzed expression of the <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein in wild-type plants, in mutant plants with defects in iron uptake regulation, and in 35 S transgenic plants that overexpressed the <b>FER</b> gene. An affinity-purified antiserum directed against <b>FER</b> epitopes was produced that recognized <b>FER</b> protein in plant protein extracts. We found that the <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein were consistently down-regulated in roots after generous (100 μm, physiologically optimal) iron supply compared to low (0. 1 μm) and sufficient (10 μm) iron supply. <b>FER</b> gene and <b>FER</b> protein expression were also occasionally down-regulated at sufficient compared to low iron supply. Analysis of <b>FER</b> protein expression in <b>FER</b> overexpression plants, as well as cellular protein localization studies, indicated that <b>FER</b> was down-regulated by high iron at the posttranscriptional level. The <b>FER</b> protein was targeted to plant nuclei and showed transcriptional activation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). <b>FER</b> protein regulation in the iron accumulation mutant chloronerva indicated that <b>FER</b> protein expression was not directly controlled by signals derived from iron transport. We conclude that <b>FER</b> is able to affect transcription in the nucleus and its action is controlled by iron supply at multiple regulatory levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{bacterial}} strainMagnetospirillum gryphiswaldenseMSR- 1 {{does not}} produce siderophores, but it absorbs {{a large amount of}} ferric iron and synthesizes magnetosomes. We demonstrated previously the presence of six types of ferric reductase isozymes (termed <b>FeR</b> 1 through <b>FeR</b> 6) inMSR- 1. Of these isozymes, <b>FeR</b> 5 was the most abundant and <b>FeR</b> 6 showed the highest ferric re-ductase activity. In the present study, we cloned the <b>fer</b> 5 and <b>fer</b> 6 genes fromMSR- 1 and expressed them separately in Escherichia coli. <b>FeR</b> 5 and <b>FeR</b> 6 were shown to be bifunctional enzymes through analysis of amino acid sequence homologies, structural pre-dictions (using data fromGenBank), and detection of enzyme activities. <b>FeR</b> 5 is a thioredoxin reductase and <b>FeR</b> 6 is a flavin re-ductase, in addition to being ferric reductases. To elucidate the functions of the enzymes, we constructed two single-gene-dele-tion mutant strains (<b>fer</b> 5 andfer 6 mutants) and a double-gene-deletion mutant strain (<b>fer</b> 5 <b>fer</b> 6 [fer 56] mutant) along with its complemented strains (C 5 and C 6). An evaluation of phenotypic and physiological properties did not reveal significant differences between the wild-type and single-gene-deletion strains, whereas the double-gene-deletion strain showed reduced iron absorption and nomagnetosome synthesis. Complementation of the double-gene-deletion strain using either <b>fer</b> 5 or <b>fer</b> 6 resulted in the partial recovery of magnetosome synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of <b>fer</b> 5 and <b>fer</b> 6 transcriptional levels in the wild-type and complemented strains demonstrated consistent transcription of the two genes and confirmed that <b>FeR</b> 5 and <b>FeR</b> 6 are bifunctional enzymes that play complementary roles during the process of magnetosome synthesis in MSR- 1.

60|$|The {{interior}} is virtually a blank, the old apart- ments having been chopped up into small modern rooms; {{it will have}} to be completely reconstructed. A worthy woman, with a military profile and that sharp, positive manner which the goodwives who show you through the chateaux of Touraine are rather apt to have, and in whose high respectability, to say nothing of the frill of her cap and the cut of her thick brown dress, my companions and I thought we discovered the particular note, or nuance, of Orleanism, - a com- petent, appreciative, peremptory person, I say, - at- tended us through the particularly delightful hour we spent upon the ramparts of Amboise. Denuded and disfeatured within, and bristling without with brick- layers' ladders, the place was yet extraordinarily im- pressive and interesting. I should confess that we spent a great deal of time in looking at the view. Sweet was the view, and magnificent; we preferred it so much to certain portions of the interior, and to oc- casional effusions of historical information, that the old lady with the prove sometimes lost patience with us. We laid ourselves open to the charge of pre- <b>ferring</b> it even to the little chapel of Saint Hubert, which stands on the edge of the great terrace, and has, over the portal, a wonderful sculpture of the mi- raculous hunt of that holy man. In the way of plastic art this elaborate scene is the gem of Amboise. It seemed to us that we had never been in a place where there are so many points of vantage to look down from. In the matter of position Amboise is certainly supreme among the old houses of the Loire; and I say this with a due recollection of the claims of Chau- mont and of Loches, - which latter, by the way (ex- cuse the afterthought), is not on the Loire. The plat- forms, the bastions, the terraces, the high-perched windows and balconies, the hanging gardens and dizzy crenellations, of this complicated structure, keep you in perpetual intercourse with an immense horizon. The great feature of the-place is the obligatory round tower which occupies the northern end of it, and which has now been, completely restored. It is of astounding size, a fortress in itself, and contains, instead of a staircase, a wonderful inclined plane, so wide and gradual that a coach and four may be driven to the top. This colossal cylinder has to-day no visible use; but it corresponds, happily enough, with the great circle of the prospect. The gardens of Am- boise, perched in the air, covering the irregular rem- nants of the platform on which the castle stands, and making up in picturesqueness what they lack in ex- tent, constitute of come but a scanty domain. But bathed, as we found them, in the autumn sunshine, and doubly private from their aerial site, they offered irresistible opportunities for a stroll, interrupted, as one leaned against their low parapets, by long, con- templative pauses. I remember, in particular, a certain terrace, planted with clipped limes, upon which we looked down from the summit of the big tower. It seemed from that point to be absolutely necessary to one's happiness to go down and spend the rest of the morning there; it was an ideal place to walk to and fro and talk. Our venerable conductress, to whom our relation had gradually become more filial, per- mitted us to gratify this innocent wish, - to the extent, that is, of taking a turn or two under the mossy tilleuls. At the end of this terrace is the low door, in a wall, against the top of which, in 1498, Charles VIII., ac- cording to an accepted tradition, knocked his head to such good purpose that he died. It was within the walls of Amboise that his widow, Anne of Brittany, already in mourning for three children, two of whom we have seen commemorated in sepulchral marble at Tours, spent the first violence of that grief which was presently dispelled by a union with her husband's cousin and successor, Louis XII. Amboise was a fre- quent resort of the French Court during the sixteenth century; it was here that the young Mary Stuart spent sundry hours of her first marriage. The wars of re- ligion have left here the ineffaceable stain which they left wherever they passed. An imaginative visitor at Amboise to-day may fancy that the traces of blood are mixed with the red rust on the crossed iron bars of the grim-looking balcony, to which the heads of the Huguenots executed on the discovery of the con- spiracy of La Renaudie are rumored to have been suspended. There was room on the stout balustrade - an admirable piece of work - for a ghastly array. The same rumor represents Catherine de' Medici and the young queen as watching from this balcony the noyades of the captured Huguenots in the Loire. The facts of history are bad enough; the fictions are, if possible, worse; but there is little doubt that the future Queen of Scots learnt the first lessons of life at a horrible school. If in subsequent years she was a prodigy of innocence and virtue, it was not the fault of her whilom ??? mother-in-law, of her uncles of the house of Guise, or of the examples presented to her either at the windows of the castle of Amboise or in its more pri- vate recesses.|$|E

5000|$|Prise de <b>fer</b> is a {{movement}} used in fencing in which a fencer takes the opponent's blade into a line and holds it there in preparation to attack. Translated from French, the phrase prise de <b>fer</b> means [...] "taking-the-blade" [...] or [...] "taking-the-steel". Alternate spellings include the plural Prises de <b>Fer</b> or [...] "Les Prises de Fer", and (incorrectly) Praise de <b>Fer.</b> There are four prise de <b>fer</b> actions: opposition, croisè, bind, and envelopment. However, each fencing master and fencing doctrine has a separate view of prise de <b>fer.</b> William Gaugler lists all four actions under Prise de <b>Fer</b> in his dictionary of fencing terminology, while Roger Crosnier in his book Fencing with the Foil only mentions the croisé, the bind, and the envelopment as prise de <b>fer</b> actions. Any prise de <b>fer</b> action requires that the blades be engaged, and it works best against an opponent who uses and maintains a straight arm. Additionally, a successful action demands surprise, precise timing, and control.|$|R

40|$|Platelet endothelial {{adhesion}} molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) {{is a part}} of intercellular junctions and triggers intracellular signaling cascades upon homophilic binding. The intracellular {{domain of}} PECAM- 1 is tyrosine phosphorylated upon homophilic engagement. However, it remains unclear which tyrosine kinase phosphorylates PECAM- 1. We sought to isolate tyrosine kinases responsible for PECAM- 1 phosphorylation and identified <b>Fer</b> as a candidate, based on expression cloning. <b>Fer</b> kinase specifically phosphorylated PECAM- 1 at the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Notably, <b>Fer</b> induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP- 2, which is known to bind to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of PECAM- 1, and <b>Fer</b> also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab 1 (Grb 2 -associated binder- 1).
