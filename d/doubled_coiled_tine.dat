Because of the continuous improvement requirements of switch，in order to mak this actuator faster and more powerful closing，this paper proposes a <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> parallel driven permanent magnet actuator at a high speed. This paper expounds the working principle of single and <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> parallel driven permanent magnet actuator. It uses Ansoft building model and contrasts test results. In prance we designed and produced the single and <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> parallel driven permanent magnet actuator for experimental study. The simulation and experiment results show that <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> parallel driven permanent magnet actuator，compared with single coil parallel driven permanent magnet actuator，has a better and faster action performance.

40|$|Surface {{eddy current}} probes {{are widely used}} for {{measuring}} crack depth, coating thickness and corrosion effects in metals. In most applications, single (absolute) coils are used, and the coil impedance is monitored. Information concerning inhomogeneities is extracted from changes in the <b>coils</b> impedance. <b>Double</b> probes consist of a driving coil and a smaller concentric pickup coil. In this case the induced voltage in the pickup coil is measured. This work describes {{the application of the}} finite element method to the analysis and design of both single and <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> surface probes. <b>Double</b> <b>coil</b> probes are shown to be superior for the applications mentioned above because of better linearity of the lift off curve and wider useful range. The rate of change of the induced voltage in a <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> probe is shown to be larger than the rate of change of the impedance in single coil probes for given parameter changes. This clearly indicates a higher sensitivity. Moreover, in the case of corrosion depth measurement, the noise generated by lift off changes can be suppressed by use of an appropriate <b>double</b> <b>coil.</b> The results presented are also verified experimentally...|$|R

40|$|A magnetorheological (MR) damper {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{advanced}} devices used in a semiactive control system to mitigate unwanted vibration because the damping force can be controlled by changing the viscosity of the internal magnetorheological (MR) fluids. This study proposes a typical <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> MR damper where the damping force and dynamic range were derived from a quasistatic model based on the Bingham model of MR fluid. A finite element model was built to study the performance of this <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> MR damper by investigating seven different piston configurations, including the numbers and shapes of their chamfered ends. The objective function of an optimization problem was proposed and then an optimization procedure was constructed using the ANSYS parametric design language (APDL) to obtain the optimal damping performance of a <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> MR damper. Furthermore, experimental tests were also carried out, and the effects of the same direction and reverse direction of the currents on the damping forces were also analyzed. The relevant results of this analysis can easily be extended to the design of other types of MR dampers...|$|R

These surface-mount components, comprising of a cofired multilayered ferrite and coil, have been developed in the ceramic coprocessing technology.

The inductance and impedance of coils embedded in low permeability or high permeability ferrite material are calculated and compared.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, several {{families}} of hyperbolic knots {{have been shown}} to have both volume and λ 1 (first eigenvalue of the Laplacian) bounded in terms of the twist number of a diagram, while other {{families of}} knots have volume bounded by a generalized twist number. We show that for general knots, neither the twist number nor the generalized twist number of a diagram can provide two–sided bounds on either the volume or λ 1. We do so by studying the geometry of a family of hyperbolic knots that we call <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> knots, and finding two–sided bounds in terms of the knot diagrams on both the volume and on λ 1. We also extend a result of Lackenby to show that a collection of <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> knot complements forms an expanding family iff their volume is bounded. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEddy current {{testing is}} a kind of {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) method based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The probe is the key of eddy current non-destructive inspection and its design or combination of form will influence detectability. A complete set of eddy current testing system is designed for standard testing copper and defect copper. Under the same lift-off distance and the same high frequency excitation signal, designed three types of probe, which are single probe single <b>coil,</b> single probe <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> and <b>double</b> probe <b>double</b> <b>coil,</b> are used to carry out NDT experiment. Experimental results show that sensitivity and resolution of detection system are obvious difference among the different form of eddy current sensor probe.

Experimental results show that detectability is enhanced significantly...|$|R
40|$|Small {{capacity}} Stirling cryocoolers (almost-equal-to 1 W at 80 K) for space-borne applications generally use linear electromagnetic drives (also called linear motors) for long, maintenance-free {{life and}} high reliability. Usually, such motors employ a single moving coil. Recent trends, however, favour a <b>double</b> <b>coil</b> configuration for higher motor efficiency. Earlier, in free piston, free displacer (FPFD) Stirling cryocoolers the displacer {{was driven by}} the pressure pulses from the compressor. The latest units have a split configuration, with the displacer also being driven by a small capacity linear motor, giving better control over its mean position, stroke and phase lead over the compressor piston.

40|$|Linear motors {{are widely}} used in {{cryogenic}} fields to drive Stirling-type cryocoolers. Generally the Joule heat loss associated with copper lead is considered as the main loss in motors while the iron loss is ignored at a lower frequency operation, not only because it’s regarded as small enough but also it’s difficult to measure or calculate. This paper introduces an experimental method to measure the iron loss for linear motors. Two kinds of moving-magnet linear motors have been tested, one is known as single coil and magnet linear motor, and the other as <b>double</b> <b>coils</b> and magnets linear motor. Dependence of iron loss on frequency and displacement are investigated. Results {{show that there is}} a 1. 6 power exponent relation between iron loss and frequency in the single-coil moving-magnet linear motor, and its iron loss come to be the same as copper loss at 75 Hz, it even grows to 1. 65 times of copper loss at 100 Hz. As for the <b>double</b> <b>coils</b> and magnets linear motor, there is a 1. 3 power exponent relation between iron loss and frequency, and its iron loss percentage is only 15 % at 120 Hz compared with 68 % in the single-coil linear motor. Iron loss is proved to be significant in linear motors especially at higher frequency...|$|R
