5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between {{the two world wars}} he was a staunch advocate of mechanization {{at a time when the}} idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance <b>from</b> <b>conservative</b> gunners.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge <b>from</b> <b>conservative</b> doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E

5|$|The new President invited several Liberals to {{join the}} Conservative ranks and {{went so far as}} to name some as ministers. One of these was Paranhos, who took the Foreign Affairs portfolio. He was still in Montevideo when he learned that Carneiro Leão had succeeded in having him elected a general deputy in 1853. The new cabinet, albeit highly successful, was plagued from the {{beginning}} by strong opposition <b>from</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party members who repudiated the new recruits from the Liberal side, believing that these did not truly share the party's ideals and were mainly interested in gaining public offices. Despite the mistrust, Carneiro Leão demonstrated great resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} at West Point, Devers was {{selected}} to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924, and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd {{in the class of}} 258, which was topped by Dwight Eisenhower. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, this time as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. Among the officers he worked with was Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number of innovative artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques that would later be successfully used during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the inter-war period. The idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance <b>from</b> <b>conservative</b> gunners.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in the Republican primary election <b>from</b> <b>conservative</b> Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, {{most of the state}} and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 4% of the vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|E

5|$|The first Trades Union Congress {{was held}} in Manchester in 1868, and as of 2015 trade union {{membership}} in Northern England remained higher than in Southern England, although it is lower than in the other Home Nations. Since the Thatcher era, the Conservative Party have since struggled to gain support in the area. Today, Northern England is generally described as a stronghold of the Labour Party – although the Conservatives hold some rural seats, they have almost no urban seats and as of the 2016 local elections there are no Conservative councillors on Liverpool City Council, Manchester City Council, Newcastle City Council or Sheffield City Council. Historically the region was also a heartland for the Liberals, and between the 1980s and the 2010s their successors in the Liberal Democrats benefitted <b>from</b> <b>Conservative</b> unpopularity by positioning themselves as the centrist alternative to Labour in the North.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Berry was {{mentioned}} as a possible nominee for U.S. Secretary of the Interior, a position obtained by Ken Salazar. President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Berry {{as director of the}} Office of Personnel Management on March 3, 2009, and did so on March 4. The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition <b>from</b> <b>conservative</b> activists based on Berry's homosexuality. In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E
