40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the validity of acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) {{as an indicator of}} indigestible nitrogen. In Trial 1, eight non-forage plant protein sources were treated to produce <b>heat-damage.</b> Apparent nitrogen digestibilities were reduced in all sources by heat treatment; however, ADIN analysis underestimated nitrogen digestibility. In Trial 2, seven dried distillers grains were evaluated for nitrogen digestibility. Although the ADIN contents varied among feeds, no differences were observed in nitrogen digestibility. It appears ADIN in non-forage protein sources predicts more damage than what was indicated by in vivo nitrogen digestibility. ^ Four studies {{were conducted to}} evaluate growth efficiency and nitrogen digestibility of heat-damaged protein. In Trial 1, corn gluten meal (CGM), control (CGM-C) or heat-damaged (CGM-H), was fed to lambs at 5 levels along with a urea control. Gain averaged 43 g/d for lambs fed the urea control and 118 and 86 g/d for those fed the highest level of CGM-C and CGM-H. The <b>heat-damage</b> in CGM depressed protein efficiency by 46 %. In Trial 2, nitrogen digestibility of CGM was depressed 22 % by <b>heat-damage.</b> Depression in protein efficiency was twice the depression in nitrogen digestibility of heat-damaged CGM. In Trial 3, dried distillers grains (DDG), control DDG (DDG-C) or heat-damaged DDG (DDG-H), were fed to cattle at 5 levels along with a urea control. Gain for cattle fed the urea control was. 40 kg/d, whereas the highest levels of DDG-C and DDG-H produced. 84 and. 72 kg/d. Protein efficiency of DDG was depressed 34 % by <b>heat-damage.</b> In Trial 4, nitrogen digestibility of DDG fed to cattle was only depressed 7 % by <b>heat-damage.</b> These data suggest that some of the nitrogen in heat-damaged protein was absorbed post-ruminally but was not used for growth by growing ruminants. The depression in animal performance by heat-damaged protein appears to be due to the reduction in metabolizable lysine content of these feeds. ...|$|E
40|$|Meat {{meals are}} highly {{variable}} in protein quality {{and this may}} be due in part to <b>heat-damage.</b> This possibility was investigated by estimating the available lysine content of meat meals by chick growth assay. In addition, the combined urinary and faecal excretion of dietary amino acids by chicks, fed a meat meal as the sole source of protein, was determined, and by subtraction from the amount consumed, values for the apparent retention of dietary amino acids were obtained. In a second part of the study, the mechanism of <b>heat-damage</b> to pure proteins was investigated. Since cross-linkages may form during <b>heat-damage</b> of proteins, enzymatic digests were examined for the presence of peptides with enzyme-resistant linkages. Samples of unheated and heat-damaged haemoglobin or globin were digested with either trypsin, or exhaustively, using several proteolytic enzymes. Chick growth assay for lysine. A chick growth assay for lysine was developed using wheat gluten as the protein source in a semi-purified diet. The meat meals were added to the basal diet either at the expense of starch or by isonitrogenous substitution of wheat gluten. Estimated potencies based on weight gain varied with the method of meat meal addition to the basal diet. This variation was probably due to an effect on the appetite of the chicks as estimates based on food conversion efficiency did not differ significantly with the method of meat meal inclusion. The percentage of lysine biologically available in eight meat meals ranged from 61 to 105 %, suggesting that some meals had been heat-damaged. Apparent retention of dietary amino acids. Estimates of the apparent retention of essential amino acids in six meat meals ranged from 79 to 100 %. The apparent retention of lysine was generally much higher than the estimated potencies by chick growth assay. The difference in the two biological estimates indicated that other factors, apart from digestibility, and absorption and urinary excretion of peptides and amino acids, must be responsible for the reduced availability of lysine in heat-damaged proteins. Tryptic digests of unheated and heated haemoglobin and globin. Several large fragments were isolated from digests of heated globin which were not present in digests of unhealed globin. The fragments had more than one amino-terminal but individual peptides could not be separated. It was not possible to determine if cross-linkages were present. Exhaustive enzyme digests of unheated and heated globin. A peptide was isolated from digests of heated globin which was not present in unheated globin digests. Results obtained indicated that the peptide was a cyclic tetrapeptide composed of equal quantities of lysine and aspartic acid. It was suggested that the peptide was the result of cross-linkages formed during <b>heat-damage</b> of globin, between the β-carboxyl groups of aspartic acid and the E-amino groups of lysine. It is considered that the formation of covalent bonds with the E-amino groups would account for an appreciable proportion of the decreased availability of lysine in heat-damaged proteins...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Clostridium {{perfringens}} type A {{food poisoning}} {{is caused by}} enterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A isolates that typically possess high spore heat-resistance. The molecular basis for C. perfringens spore heat-resistance remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated the role of small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASPs) in heat-resistance of spores produced by C. perfringens food poisoning isolates. Results Our current study demonstrated the presence of all three SASP-encoding genes (ssp 1, 2 and 3) in five surveyed C. perfringens clinical food poisoning isolates. β-Glucuronidase assay showed that these ssp genes are expressed specifically during sporulation. Consistent with these expression results, our study also demonstrated the production of SASPs by C. perfringens food poisoning isolates. When the heat sensitivities of spores produced by a ssp 3 knock-out mutant of a C. perfringens food poisoning isolate was {{compared with that of}} spores of the wild-type strain, spores of the ssp 3 mutant were found to exhibit a lower decimal reduction value (D value) at 100 °C than exhibited by the spores of wild-type strain. This effect was restored by complementing the ssp 3 mutant with a recombinant plasmid carrying wild-type ssp 3, suggesting that the observed differences in D values between spores of wild-type versus ssp 3 mutant was due to the specific inactivation of ssp 3. Furthermore, our DNA protection assay demonstrated that C. perfringens SASPs can protect DNA from DNase I digestion. Conclusion The results from our current study provide evidences that SASPs produced by C. perfringens food poisoning isolates play a role in protecting their spores from <b>heat-damage,</b> which is highly significant and relevant from a food safety perspective. Further detailed studies on mechanism of action of SASPs from C. perfringens should help in understanding the mechanism of protection of C. perfringens spores from <b>heat-damage.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Aging wiring {{has become}} a {{critical}} issue to DoD, NASA, FAA, and Industry. The problem is that insulation on environmentally aged wire becomes brittle and cracks. This exposes the underlying conductive wire to the potential for short circuits and fire. The difficulty is that techniques to monitor aging wire problems focus on applying electrical sensing techniques that are not very sensitive to the wire insulation. Thus, the development of methods to quantify and monitor aging wire insulation is highly warranted. Measurement of wire insulation stiffness by ultrasonic guided waves is being examined. Initial laboratory tests were performed on a simple model consisting of a solid cylinder and then a solid cylinder with a polymer coating. Experimental measurements showed that the lowest order axisymmetric mode may be sensitive to stiffness changes in the wire insulation. To test this theory, mil-spec wire samples MIL-W- 81381, MIL-W- 22759 / 34, and MIL-W- 22759 / 87 (typically found in aircraft) were heat-damaged in an oven, {{in a range of}} heating conditions. The samples were 12, 16, and 20 gauge and the <b>heat-damage</b> introduced material changes in the wire-insulation that made the originally flexible insulation brittle and darker in color. Axisymmetric mode phase velocity increased for the samples that were exposed to heat for longer duration. For example, the phase velocity in the 20 -gauge MIL-W- 22759 / 34 wire changed from a baseline value of 2790 m/s to 3280 m/s and 3530 m/s for one-hour exposures to 3490 C and 3990 C, respectively. Although the <b>heat-damage</b> conditions {{are not the same as}} environmental aging, we believe that with further development and refinements, the ultrasonic guided waves can be used to inspect wire-insulation for detrimental environmental aging conditions...|$|E

Methods: Thirty-two male SD rats were divided into control group and experimental group, and fed 2 mg/d GSS and equal-quantity of distilled water respectively for 7 days. Eight rats of each group were exposed to (42 ± 1) ℃ for one hour. The binding activities of GR in brain, thymus, lung and liver cytosols in rats were detected by radioligand binding assay. The expression levels of GR mRNA in brain and liver cytosols were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone (CS) concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Results: The binding activities of GR in brain, lung and liver cytosols, and the expression levels of GR mRNA in brain and liver cytosols were all higher in the GSS-treated and <b>heat-damaged</b> rats than those in the untreated <b>heat-damaged</b> rats (P＜ 0. 05 or P＜ 0. 01).

40|$|When hay {{is first}} baled stored, it may {{go through a}} “sweat”, an {{increase}} in bale temperature. This increase in bale temperature {{is a combination of}} plant, bacteria, yeast, and fungi respiration. Plant soluble carbohydrates, principally sugars, are the source of energy for this respiration and increase in heat.

Round bales that are stored unprotected may weather on the outer edges; six inches of weathered hay may represent as much as 31 % of the total bale.

Whereas various laws protect the quality and genuineness of fresh pasteurised milk, {{in the case of}} UHT milk there is not any regulation about minimal quality requirements. With the aim to determine the level of <b>heat-damage</b> of UHT milk marketed in Italy the following indices were quantified by HPLC techniques: furosine (Ministerial Decree 16 - 05 - 1996), lactulose (ISO 11868 : 2007 /IDF 147 : 2007) and b-lactoglobulin (ISO 13875 : 2005 //IDF 178 : 2005). A total of 43 samples of UHT milk (24 at the purchase time and 19 at the best before date) from 8 different producers, among which 2 foreign ones, was analysed. The same parameters were also determined in 15 samples of pasteurised milk (fresh and microfiltered) and in 13 samples of high-pasteurised milk from 4 italian producers. In the case of UHT milk the following results were obtained: 163, 91 ± 62, 48 mg/ 100 g of protein for furosine, 338, 05 ± 173, 56 mg/l for lactulose and 445, 21 ± 221, 14 mg/l for b-lactoglobulin. In the case of furosine, as expected, statistically significant differences were registered between values from samples analysed at the purchase time and values from samples analysed at the best before date. The results obtained revealed wide ranges of values for the examined parameters, showing that for the UHT milk marketed in Italy there is not an homogeneous level of quality.

30|$|Nonetheless, using GFRP jackets {{with the}} lower {{confinement}} modulus proved to be, compared to CFRP jackets, less efficient in enhancing the axial behavior of the <b>heat-damaged</b> columns.|$|R

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} using fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets in confining <b>heat-damaged</b> columns, 15 circular RC column specimens were tested under axial compression. The effects of heating duration, stiffness and thickness of the FRP wrapping sheets were examined. Two specimen groups, six each, were subjected to elevated temperatures of 500  °C for 2 and 3  h, respectively. Eight of the <b>heat-damaged</b> specimens were wrapped with unidirectional carbon and glass FRP sheets. Test results confirmed that elevated temperatures adversely affect the axial load resistance and stiffness of the columns while increasing their ductility and toughness. Full wrapping with FRP sheets increased the axial load capacity and toughness of the damaged columns. A single layer of the carbon sheets managed to restore the original axial resistance of the columns heated for 2  h yet, two layers were needed to restore the axial resistance of columns heated for 3  h.

30|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin plays {{a prominent}} role in regulating acclimation to high temperature in plants, and high temperature boosts the level of free auxin (Sun et al. 2012; Wit et al. 2014; Zheng et al. 2016). In Arabidopsis seedlings, a moderately high temperature stimulates the elongation of hypocotyls by activation of auxin biosynthesis (Gray et al. 1998). The results of Franklin et al. (2011) indicated that increase levels of auxin were required in an adaptive response to heat stress. However, in the developing anthers of barley and Arabidopsis, endogenous auxin levels significantly decreased under heat stress leading to spikelet sterility, and exogenous auxin reversed this damage, suggesting that auxin can alleviate <b>heat-damage</b> in reproductive organs (Sakata et al. 2010). In rice, significantly decreased auxin levels were found in spikelets under heat stress, resulting in abnormal floret differentiation and increase in spikelet degradation (Fu et al. 2015 b; Zhang et al. 2017). However, the role of auxin in pollen tube elongation under heat stress has seldom been previously reported. It is reported that pollen tube growth in the styles is strongly inhibited by temperature above 35  °C, and the yield of cotton decreased due to the effect of high temperature during floral bud (square) development (Song et al. 2015). Accordingly, we inferred that changes in auxin level might be involved in abnormal pollen tube growth in the pistil of rice under heat stress, as the auxin levels in the pistil of a cultivar with heat sensitive genotype were significantly decreased under heat stress, and thus the spikelet sterility was significantly increased. Additionally, pretreatment of the flowering plants with NAA could prevent spikelet sterility caused by high temperature stress, suggesting that heat stress-induced disruption of auxin metabolism might be the main factor leading to spikelet sterility by inhibiting pollen tube growth. In this experiment, two rice genotypes with different heat tolerance were subjected to heat stress at anthesis pretreated with NAA and the auxin synthesis inhibitor L-aminooxyphenylpropionic acid (AOPP) (Soeno et al. 2010) to evaluate the role of auxin in pollen tube growth in the pistil and spikelet fertility under heat stress, as well as its underlying mechanism. Also, the relationships among auxin, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidase (POD) involved in pollen tube growth in the pistil under heat stress will be discussed.|$|E

30|$|An {{extensive}} {{variety of}} repair and strengthening techniques {{can be implemented}} to rehabilitate fire-damaged concrete elements and structures. Traditional repair schemes for deficient or damaged concrete columns involve the use of concrete or steel jackets (Lin et al. 1995; Campione 2012; Ramirez et al. 1997; Xiong et al. 2011) which incurs additional weight and interrupts {{the function of the}} structure during the somewhat lengthy repair process. Compared to more conventional repair materials, the use of externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites offers numerous advantages including, but not limited to, their high strength-to-mass ratio, high stiffness-to-mass ratio, excellent corrosion resistance, adaptability, non invasive nature and ease of application which minimizes functionality interruption. As such, the numerous applications of FRP composites in repairing reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements have been widely investigated over the past three decades. Very few experimental investigations have recently examined the potential of using FRP composites to repair <b>heat-damaged</b> RC columns (Yaqub and Bailey 2011 a, b, 2012; Yaqub et al. 2011, 2013; Bisby et al. 2011; Bailey and Yaqub 2012; Tahir et al. 2013; Al-Nimry et al. 2013; Roy et al. 2014, 2016; Al-Kamaki et al. 2015). Most of the test columns were unstressed during heating, cooling and testing despite the fact that columns are expected to be stressed up to 50 % of their capacity during any fire incident. To this end, Al-Kamaki et al. (2015) applied an axial compressive loading of 30 % of the maximum compressive strength at ambient temperature while exposing the test columns to elevated temperatures. Available research results (Yaqub and Bailey 2011 a, b, 2012; Yaqub et al. 2011, 2013; Bisby et al. 2011; Bailey and Yaqub 2012; Tahir et al. 2013; Al-Nimry et al. 2013; Roy et al. 2014, 2016; Al-Kamaki et al. 2015) indicated that jacketing <b>heat-damaged</b> columns with unidirectional FRP sheets may, depending on the cross sectional shape, restore the axial strength of the columns. FRP jacketing has been found efficient in enhancing the ductility, deformation and energy dissipation capacities of <b>heat-damaged</b> columns. To restore the original axial strength of square <b>heat-damaged</b> RC columns; Al-Nimry et al. (2013) proposed the use of externally bonded longitudinal FRP plates confined with circumferential carbon FRP sheets over the full column height. Glass and carbon FRP jacketing showed no significant effect on the axial stiffness of wrapped <b>heat-damaged</b> columns (Yaqub and Bailey 2011 a, b, 2012; Yaqub et al. 2011, 2013; Bisby et al. 2011; Al-Nimry et al. 2013). Yaqub et al. (2013) proposed the use of both ferrocement and FRP jackets to restore the strength, stiffness and ductility of fire-damaged RC columns. Compared to the confinement strengthening systems provided by high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete, ferrocement and steel plate jacketing; Roy et al. (2016) found that FRP jacketing was the most effective in restoring the compressive strength and energy dissipation of <b>heat-damaged</b> RC short columns.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{feasibility}} of using external FRP confinement in restoring or enhancing the axial strength and stiffness of circular RC columns that {{have been exposed to}} a pre-defined heat level. Effects of the heating duration/level, stiffness and thickness of the unidirectional FRP sheets used to confine the <b>heat-damaged</b> columns were among the parameters investigated.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{increasing}} {{the thickness of}} the CFRP jackets adversely affected the ductility of the <b>heat-damaged</b> specimens {{as can be seen in}} Fig.  10 d. Compared to columns repaired using a single layer of the CFRP sheets, ductility of the CH 2 and CH 3 specimens repaired using a double-layered jacket decreased by about 12.2 and 13 %, respectively.|$|R

Exclusion of dairy products from the diet produced a considerable improvement in her previously aggressive disease...|$|R
