40|$|Classical work in {{the field}} of {{high-resolution}} radar often assumes that an echo signal is made of a number of components that can be decomposed via Fourier analysis. Adjacent components are said to be resolved in the frequency domain if the intensity between them drops at least 3 decibels. This working definition is an extension of Lord Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> for optical resolution. The problem with this approach is that whereas Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> assumes signal incoherence, a high-resolution radar signal is often the coherent sum of sinusoids. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the consequences of using Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> in the analysis of radar signals. Specifically, computer simulations using a complex signal is analyzed via the periodogram as the relative phase between the two components of the signal is allowed to change. The net effect introduced by this phase variation is to reduce or increase the spacing and intensity between two adjacent spectral peaks. These changes are due to constructive or destructive interference of spectral cross terms that cannot be ignored when attempting to resolve frequency components from one another. Thus, the use of Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>criterion</b> to define the resolution of a high-resolution radar system is inappropriate since phase difference information determines the relative range and relative doppler of a multi-component target. ...|$|R

The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the diagnostic value of biochemical parameters together with Light%u 2019 <b>s</b> <b>criteria</b> to differentiate exudative from transudative effusions. Material and Method: The LDH, total protein, albumin, adenosine deaminase (ADA), apolipoprotein A 1, apolipoprotein B, Lipoprotein-A, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels of patients with unknown etiology were measured both in plasma and pleural fluid. Mann-Whitney U was used to compare the groups and p < 0. 05 was accepted as statistical significance. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for each biochemical parameter. The ROC analysis was used to estimate the optimum cut-off value for the highest sensitivity and specificity. Results: Pleural LDH (p= 0. 001), total protein (p= 0. 001), albumin (p= 0. 001), triglyceride (p= 0. 001), total cholesterol (p= 0. 001), HDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 042), VLDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 001), LDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 001), apolipoprotein A 1 (p= 0. 021), and HDL-cholesterol/LDL-cholesterol ratio (p= 0. 048) were found significant in differentiating exudative from transudative effusions.
