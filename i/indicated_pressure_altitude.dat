40|$|A {{computer}} program written {{to calculate the}} static pressure position error of airspeed systems contains five separate methods for determining position error, of which the user may select from one to five at a time. The program uses data from both the test aircraft and the ground-based radar to calculate the error. In addition, some of the methods require rawinsonde data or an atmospheric analysis, or both. The program output lists the corrections to Mach number, altitude, and static pressure that are due to position error.

The system is preferably embodied in a portable, pager-sized device that can be carried or worn by an individual. A microprocessor calculates the <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> from signals generated by a calibrated pressure transducer and a temperature sensor that compensates for temperature variations in the signals generated by the pressure transducer. The microprocessor is programmed to generate a warning or alarm if a cabin <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> exceeding a predetermined threshold is detected. Preferably, the microprocessor generates {{two different types of}} warning or alarm outputs, a first early warning or alert when a first <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is exceeded. and a second more serious alarm condition when either a second. higher <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is exceeded, or when the first <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> has been exceeded for a predetermined period of time. Multiple types of alarm condition indicators are preferably provided, including visual, audible and tactile. The system is also preferably designed to detect gas concentrations and other ambient conditions, and thus incorporates other sensors, such as oxygen, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ammonia sensors, to provide a more complete characterization and monitoring of the local environment...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine thermal and pressure-drop performance and the operational characteristics of a Stewart-Warner model 906 -B combustion heater. The performance tests covered a range of ventilating-air flows from 500 to 3185 pounds per hour, combustion-air pressure drops from 5 to 35 inches of water, and <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> from sea level to 41, 000 feet. The operational characteristics investigated were the combustion-air flows for sustained combustion and for consistent ignition covering fuel-air ratios ranging from 0. 033 to 0. 10 and <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> from sea level to 45, 000 feet. Rated heat output of 50, 000 Btu per hour was obtained at <b>pressure</b> <b>altitudes</b> up to 27, 000 feet for ventilating-air flows greater than 800 pounds per hour; rated output was not obtained at ventilating-air flow below 800 pounds per hour at any altitude. The maximum heater efficiency {{was found to be}} 60. 7 percent at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 050, a sea-level <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude,</b> a ventilating-air temperature of 0 F, combustion-air temperature of 14 F, a ventilating-air flow of 690 pounds per hour, and a combustion-air flow of 72. 7 pounds per hour. The minimum combustion-air flow for sustained combustion at a <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 25, 000 feet was about 9 pounds per hour for fuel-air ratios between 0. 037 and 0. 099 and at a <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 45, 000 feet increased to 18 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 099 and 55 pounds per hour at a fuel-air ratio of 0. 036. Combustion could be sustained at combustion-air flows above values of practical interest. The maximum flow was limited, however, by excessively high exhaust-gas temperature or high pressure drop. Both maximum and minimum combustion-air flows for consistent ignition decrease with increasing <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> and the two curves intersect at a <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of approximately 25, 000 feet and a combustion-air flow of approximately 28 pounds per hour...|$|R

40|$|Airborne {{experiments}} {{to assess the}} feasibility of remote sensing surface pressure from a space platform are described. The data are high-resolution spectra in the O 2 A band (759 – 771 nm) of sunlight reflected from the sea surface, measured by a grating spectrograph directed toward sunglint from a research aircraft. It is shown {{that in the first}} approximation the reflected radiance is a function of just one variable, the adjusted air mass, defined in terms of geometrical factors, surface <b>pressure,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft, and an estimate of the mean temperature of the lower atmosphere. This result allows the {{experiments to}} be used to determine surface pressure if the <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is given or vice versa. Since surface pressure varies slowly, whereas the <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft is under experimental control, most of the results apply to retrieval of <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude.</b> The principal difficulty in accurate retrievals of pressure lies in modeling the scattered component of the radiance since this quantity is sensitive to aerosol and thin cloud whose properties often are poorly known. It is shown that low-resolution spectra allow the <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> to be tracked with high precision (0. 1 %), but the absolute accuracy is low (2 %) because from low-resolution spectra {{it is not possible to}} determine whether scattered radiance is a significant fraction of the total radiance. However, high-resolution spectra contain additional information that allows the reflected and scattered components of the radiance to be distinguished. Experimenta...|$|R

40|$|A sensor fusion {{method was}} {{developed}} for vertical channel stabilization by fusing inertial measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> measurements from a barometric altimeter integrated in the same device (baro-IMU). An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimated the quaternion from the sensor frame to the navigation frame; the sensed specific force was rotated into the navigation frame and compensated for gravity, yielding the vertical linear acceleration; finally, a complementary filter driven by the vertical linear acceleration and the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> produced estimates of height and vertical velocity. A method was also developed to condition the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> using a whitening filter, which helped to remove the short-term correlation due to environment-dependent pressure changes from raw <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude.</b> The sensor fusion method was implemented to work on-line using data from a wireless baro-IMU and tested for the capability of tracking low-frequency small-amplitude vertical human-like motions that can be critical for stand-alone inertial sensor measurements. Validation tests were performed in different experimental conditions, namely no motion, free-fall motion, forced circular motion and squatting. Accurate on-line tracking of height and vertical velocity was achieved, giving confidence {{to the use of}} the sensor fusion method for tracking typical vertical human motions: velocity Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was in the range 0. 04 - 0. 24 m/s; height RMSE was in the range 5 - 68 cm, with statistically significant performance gains when the whitening filter was used by the sensor fusion method to track relatively high-frequency vertical motions...|$|R

The prototype encoders were retrofitted into two different internal altimeter configurations. A prototype encoder was checked for accuracy of transition points and environmental effects. Each altimeter configuration, with the encoder incorporated, was laboratory tested for performance and was subsequently flight-tested over the specified altitude range. With few exceptions, the assembled altimeter-encoder met aeronautical standards for altimeters and encoders.

50|$|The cabin {{altitude}} of the Boeing 767 is typically about 7000 ft when cruising at 37000 ft. This is typical for older jet airliners. A design goal for many, but not all, newer aircraft {{is to provide}} a lower {{cabin altitude}} than older designs. This can be beneficial for passenger comfort. For example, the Bombardier Global Express business jet can provide a cabin altitude of 4500 ft when cruising at 41000 ft. The Emivest SJ30 business jet can provide a sea-level cabin altitude when cruising at 41000 ft. One study of 8 flights in Airbus A380 aircraft found a median cabin <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 6128 ft, and 65 flights in Boeing 747-400 aircraft found a median cabin <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 5159 ft.|$|R
