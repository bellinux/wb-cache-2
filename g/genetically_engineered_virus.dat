50|$|<b>Genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> M13 {{bacteriophage}} <b>viruses</b> allow {{preparation of}} quantum dot biocomposite structures. It {{had previously been}} shown that <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>viruses</b> can recognize specific semiconductor surfaces through the method of selection by combinatorial phage display. Additionally, {{it is known that}} liquid crystalline structures of wild-type viruses (Fd, M13, and TMV) are adjustable by controlling the solution concentrations, solution ionic strength, and the external magnetic field applied to the solutions. Consequently, the specific recognition properties of the virus can be used to organize inorganic nanocrystals, forming ordered arrays over the length scale defined by liquid crystal formation. Using this information, Lee et al. (2000) were able to create self-assembled, highly oriented, self-supporting films from a phage and ZnS precursor solution. This system allowed them to vary both the length of bacteriophage and the type of inorganic material through genetic modification and selection.|$|R

40|$|The genome of {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) {{differs from that of}} other picornaviruses in that it encodes a larger 3 A protein (> 50 % longer than {{poliovirus}} 3 A), as well as three copies of protein 3 B (also known as VPg). Previous studies have shown that a deletion of amino acids 93 to 102 of the 153 -codon 3 A protein is associated with an inability of a Taiwanese strain of FMDV (O/TAW/ 97) to cause disease in bovines. Recently, an Asian virus with a second 3 A deletion (amino acids 133 to 143) has also been detected (N. J. Knowles et al., J. Virol. 75 : 1551 - 1556, 2001). <b>Genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>viruses</b> harboring the amino acids 93 to 102 or 133 to 143 grew well in porcine cells but replicated poorly in bovine cells, whereas a <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> derivative of the O/TAW/ 97 virus expressing a full-length 3 A (strain A 12) grew well in both cell types. Interestingly, a virus with a deletion spanning amino acid 93 to 144 also grew well in porcine cells and caused disease in swine. Further, <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>viruses</b> containing only a single copy of VPg were readily recovered with the full-length 3 A, the deleted 3 A (amino acids 93 to 102), or the “super” deleted forms of 3 A (missing amino acids 93 to 144). All of the single-VPg viruses were attenuated in porcine cells and replicated poorly in bovine cells. The single-VPg viruses produced a mild disease in swine, indicating that the VPg copy number is an important determinant of host range and virulence. The association of VPg copy number with increased virulence in vivo may help to explain why all naturally occurring FMDVs have retained three copies of VPg...|$|R
25|$|Viral vectors are {{generally}} <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>viruses</b> carrying modified viral DNA or RNA {{that has been}} rendered noninfectious, but still contain viral promoters and also the transgene, thus allowing for translation of the transgene through a viral promoter. However, because viral vectors frequently are lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. Viral vectors are often designed for permanent incorporation of the insert into the host genome, and thus leave distinct genetic markers in the host genome after incorporating the transgene. For example, retroviruses leave a characteristic retroviral integration pattern after insertion that is detectable and indicates that the viral vector has incorporated into the host genome.|$|R

Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose's inner circle through Ambrose's former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time—the virus is incurable twenty hours after infection—Hunt manages to acquire the cure and kill Ambrose.|$|E

Due to Sinestro's machinations, Hal Jordan and Sinestro are transported across the multiverse and trapped in the Planet of the Apes universe. Jordan is captured by Ape City security personnel, while Sinestro captures Doctor Zaius, the orangutan leader of Ape City. Back in Earth-0's universe, the Guardians reveal to members of the Green Lantern Corps that one of their earlier experiments after the creation of the Manhunters was a Universal Ring, which possessed the power to tap into the entire emotional spectrum. Realising that it was too powerful to control, although they lacked ability to destroy it, the Guardians instead trapped the universal ring in an alternate Earth that is trapped within a time loop. On this world, humanity destroyed itself in a nuclear war and is replaced by sapient apes, assisted by a <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>virus.</b> While Hal breaks out of Ape City prison with the assistance of Zira and other dissident chimpanzees and Sinestro abducts Dr Zaius and attempts to stage a coup, the Green Lantern Corps decide to 'recruit' Gorilla Grodd to assist in their recovery of Hal Jordan and the Universal Ring. Meanwhile, in the underground settlement of telepathic mutants within the ruins of New York City, Cornelius has used the Universal Ring to repel attackers and has discovered twentieth century astronaut Colonel George Taylor dead from a bullet wound. Angered at the loss of life and the presence of a cobalt bomb doomsday device worshipped by the mutants, he dismantles the device. Matters get more complicated when Cornelius' efforts provide the mutants with power rings of their own, while the Red Lantern Corps discover the existence of the Planet of the Apes and the presence of the Green Lanterns there and give pursuit.
