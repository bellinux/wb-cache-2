40|$|ABSTRACT. In this paper, the {{relevance}} of some debt ratio determinants from the recent <b>heory</b> <b>of</b> finance is empirically investigated in a small business ector. The data {{used in this study}} consist of average financial data of 27 shoptypes in 20 different years, covering a period of 24 years. The panel character of the data facilitates the use of analytical tech-niques aimed at reducing or avoiding the biasing effect of omitted variables on the outcomes. The main conclusion is, that the theoretical determinants appear indeed to be relevant for the small business sector investigated here, but the influences encountered in the analyses are far less straight-forward than the hypothesized effects in the theory. Influ-ences on total debt are frequently found to be the net effects of opposite influences on long and short term debt and some variables show large time and industry specific effects. Further, distinct patterns in the time specific effects were found. I...|$|R

The presence of sensitizing antibody in immune serum caused an atypical in vitro neutralization response curve and a non-neutralized fraction. Cell-associated (cytophilic) antibody was not present in the system. Dissociation of the immune complex was not a factor and sensitized virus adsorbed to host cells via the regutar vi us receptor site(s).

Dosing of the neutralization reaction mixtures with fractionated antibody of alternative antigenic specificities had an antagonistic effect on the neutralization response, suggesting steric hindrance.

Intensive land use reduced functional richness, but each functional group responded in a unique way. Species richness of generalist groups was nearly unaffected.

In all membranes the amount of water transported per faraday was independent of the current density in the tested range, 0. 05 - 0. 80 ma/cm ~. There was a paral le l ism between the water content of the membrane and the moles of water transported per faraday. In the presence of KC 1 the moles of water transported per faraday var ied from 3 to 50 for the series of membranes tested, and with LiC 1 from 6 to 90.

JavaScript is widely used in developing sophisticated software systems, especially web applications. Despite of its popularity, {{there is a lack}} of software tools that support JavaScript for software engineering clients. Dataflow analysis approxi-mates software behavior by analyzing the program code; it is the foundation for many soft-ware tools. However, several unique features of JavaScript render existing dataflow analysis techniques ineffective. Reflective constructs, generating code at runtime, make it difficult to acquire the complete program at compile time. Dynamic typing, resulting in changes in object behavior, poses a challenge for building accurate models of objects. Different functionalities can be observed when a function is variadic; the variance of the function behavior may be caused by the arguments whose values can only be known at runtime.

We used a published EST database for the waterflea Daphnia magna (Crustacea:Cladocera) to isolate variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers for linkage mapping, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL), and functional studies. Findings: Seventy-four polymorphic markers were isolated and characterised. Analyses of repeat structure, putative gene function and polymorphism indicated that intragenic tandem repeats are not distributed randomly in the mRNA sequences; instead, dinucleotides are more frequent in non-coding regions, whereas trinucleotides (and longer motifs involving multiple-of-three nucleotide repeats) are preferentially situated in coding regions. We also observed differential distribution of repeat motifs across putative genetic functions. This indicates differential selective constraints and possible functional significance of VNTR polymorphism {{in at least some}} genes.
