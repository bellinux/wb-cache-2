40|$|Lately, {{there has}} been an {{exponential}} increase in the usage of smartphones. In order to access features and information in Android phones, applications have to explicitly request permissions before they are installed. In all there are 13 permissions, out of which four are reserved for Short Messaging Service. These permissions are required to read, receive, send and write the messages by the application. However there is a possibility of misuse of the permissions by the developers for exploiting and leaking out personal data. While developing a location tracking application, we discovered the possibility for exploiting these permissions. We have tested it on various smartphones.

40|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{of computing}} devices {{and the need}} for ubiquitous communication has augmented the demand for pervasive computing. Security demands that all devices in a pervasive system must be able to authenticate each other and communicate in a secure manner. This is usually achieved through a Trusted Third Party like a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or a <b>Key</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Centre</b> (KDC). The establishment of such an entity in such a dynamic environment is neither feasible nor pragmatic. In this paper we present a novel mechanism for authentication and key exchange that can operate seamlessly in pervasive computing environments without the presence of a Trusted Third Party. The proposed scheme has minimal computational requirements, which makes it most suitable for devices with limited resources. 1. Security Scheme for Pervasive Systems ID-based systems [1] were introduced {{in order to avoid the}} explicit authentication of public keys through digital certificates. These systems aim at using the identity of a user to represent the public key. The advantage of such systems is that the public key certificates are no longer required to be maintained at a central or distributed trusted third party [2] providing elevated security and efficiency. Such schemes can be configured to perform authentication as well as key exchange without a trusted third party. We propose using the scheme by Sheih et al. [3] for pervasive computing environments because of its simplicity, lower computational overhead and minimal reliance on a central trust authority. The scheme, when configured for a pervasive system, works in thre...|$|E

As the security aspects of security protocol research is fully- edged, this thesis is therefore devoted to conducting a performance study of these protocols. The long term objective is to translate formal de nitions of security protocols to formal performance models automatically, then analysing by relevant techniques. In this thesis, we take a preliminary step by studying five typical security protocols, and exploring the methodology of construction and analysis of their models by using the Markovian process algebra PEPA. Through these case studies, an initial framework of performance analysis of security protocol is established. Firstly, a <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> is investigated. The basic model su ers from the commonly encountered state space explosion problem, and so we apply some efficient solution techniques, which include model reduction techniques and ordinary di fferential equation based fluid flow analysis. Finally, we evaluate a utility function for this secure key exchange model. Then, we explore two non-repudiation protocols. Mean value analysis has been applied here for a class of PEPA models, and it is compared with an ODE approximation. After that, an optimistic nonrepudiation protocol with off-line third trust party is studied. The PEPA model has been formulated using a concept of multi-threaded servers with functional rates. The nal case study is a cross-realm Kerberos protocol. A simplified technique of aggregation with an ODE approximation is performed to do efficient cient analysis. All these modelling and analysis methods are illustrated through numerical examples. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} {{associated}} with using symmetric/ asymmetric keys {{is how to}} securely store and exchange the keys between the parties over open networks particularly in the open environment such as cloud computing. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) have been providing a practical solution for session key exchange for loads of web services. The key limitation of PKI solution {{is not only the}} need for a trusted third partly (e. g. certificate authority) but also the absent link between data owner and the encryption keys. The latter is arguably more important where accessing data needs to be linked with identify of the owner. Currently available key exchange protocols depend on using trusted couriers or secure channels, which can be subject to man-in-the-middle attack and various other attacks. This paper proposes a new protocol for Key Exchange using Biometric Identity Based Encryption (KE-BIBE) that enables parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys even an adversary is monitoring the communication channel between the parties. The proposed protocol combines biometrics with IBE in order to provide a secure way to access symmetric keys based on the identity of the users in unsecure environment. In the KE-BIOBE protocol, the message is first encrypted by the data owner using a traditional symmetric key before migrating it to a cloud storage. The symmetric key is then encrypted using public biometrics of the users selected by data owner to decrypt the message based on Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption. Only the selected users will be able to decrypt the message by providing a fresh sample of their biometric data. The paper argues that the proposed solution eliminates the needs for a <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> in traditional cryptography. It will also give data owner the power of fine-grained sharing of encrypted data by control who can access their data...|$|E
