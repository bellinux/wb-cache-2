Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E

5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E

According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E

When the regents of the University of California wanted to terminate Segré's employment owing to his foreign nationality, Lawrence managed to retain Segré by hiring him as a part-time lecturer paid by the Rockefeller Foundation.
