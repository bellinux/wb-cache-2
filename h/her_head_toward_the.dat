60|$|He ceased speaking, almost choked now {{by his own}} eloquence, and the rapidity {{with which}} the lying words escaped his lips. And Gilda slowly turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> prisoner, and met that subtly-ironical, good-humoured glance again.|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} closed on him, Delly dropped on her knees. She lifted <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, but dropped it again, as if tyrannically awed downward, and bent it low over, till her whole form tremulously cringed to the floor.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{opened her}} eyes {{at the sound of}} her maid's approach. She turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> impatiently <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R

60|$|Perfectly unimpressed by this {{harrowing}} narrative, Francine turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> lazily <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house. The {{door was}} thrown {{open at the}} same moment. A lithe little person rapidly descended the steps {{that led to the}} lawn.|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped with}} lighted eyes on him. [...] "Is {{it because you}} think you owe it--" [...] and she paused, still with the {{heightened}} colour in her cheek, then went on--"that you've spoken to me as you did there?" [...] She tossed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lake.|$|E
60|$|Jeanne's lips quivered for a moment. Her {{eyes were}} fixed upon the distant figure, {{motionless}} now, upon the raised sandbanks. Kate had turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Red Hall, and was looking {{at one of the}} windows there as though her eyes would pierce the distance.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> young Englishman and {{challenged}} a straight look from his eyes. He did not waver {{and she was}} satisfied. Her instinct had not misled her, for he expressed no astonishment, only a sort of dog-like gratitude and joy as, having returned her gaze quite firmly, he now slowly raised his arm bringing her hand on a level with his lips.|$|E
60|$|As Luke Peterson was {{now doing}} fairly well, {{all of the}} others ran on deck, and soon the Swallow was {{in pursuit of the}} schooner.

60|$|With {{the words}} she lifted Tato high above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pit--that terrible cleft in the rocks which was {{believed}} to have no bottom.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} the two had mounted and were moving slowly across the moon-bathed plain. The girl turned <b>her</b> pony's <b>head</b> {{straight}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> jungle. It was {{in the direction of}} the roaring of the hungry lion.|$|R
6000|$|The young girl's clear, scrutinizing eyes softened; her red {{resolute}} lips trembled {{slightly and}} then parted, the upper one hovering {{a little to}} one side over her white teeth. It was Nelly's own peculiar smile, and its serious piquancy always thrilled him. But she drew a little farther back from his brightening eyes, her hands still curled behind her, and said, with the faintest coquettish toss of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hill: [...] "If {{you want to see}} father, you'd better hurry up." ...|$|E
60|$|She disappeared, and the Princess {{lay still}} upon her couch, thinking. Soon she heard steps outside, {{and with a}} little sigh she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. The man who entered was tall, and of the {{ordinary}} type of well-born Englishmen. He was carefully dressed, and his somewhat scanty hair was arranged to the best advantage. His features were hard and lifeless. His eyes were just a shade too close together. The maid ushered him in and withdrew at once.|$|E
6000|$|Had twin thunderbolts fallen {{through the}} twin {{roofs of the}} twin palaces and struck the twin Ki and the twin Ki-Ki upon their twin heads it would have created no more stupendous a {{sensation}} than did this remark. Never before had any two halves of a twin of the Land of Twi thought differently or spoken differently. Indeed, it startled the two maidens themselves {{as much as it}} did their hearers, for each one turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other and, {{for the first time in}} her life, looked into the other's face! ...|$|E

60|$|She {{paused at}} the mouth of the cave and looked the wall over carefully. Then, on one side and the other, she ran along the base of the wall to where its abrupt bulk merged from the softer-lined landscape. Returning to the cave, she entered its narrow mouth. For a short three feet she was {{compelled}} to crouch, then the walls widened and rose higher in a little round chamber nearly six feet in diameter. The roof barely cleared her head. It was dry and cosey. She inspected it with painstaking care, while One Eye, who had returned, stood in the entrance and patiently watched her. She dropped her head, with her nose to the ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched feet, and around this point she circled several times; then, with a tired sigh that was almost a grunt, she curled her body in, relaxed her legs, and dropped down, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entrance. One Eye, with pointed, interested ears, laughed at her, and beyond, outlined against the white light, she could see the brush of his tail waving good-naturedly. Her own ears, with a snuggling movement, laid their sharp points backward and down against the head for a moment, while her mouth opened and her tongue lolled peaceably out, and in this way she expressed that she was pleased and satisfied.|$|E

As the song progresses, strobe lights shine on Shakira and her band as she shakes <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> end of the video, bubbles and confetti fall from above, the song slows to almost an a cappella, and the video exits with Shakira holding her microphone over her head.|$|E
60|$|Louise {{found her}} way without {{difficulty}} across a cobbled yard, through a postern gate {{set in a}} red-brick wall, into the orchard. Very slowly, and with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned upward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> trees, {{she made her way}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> boundary wall. Once, with a little exclamation of pleasure, she drew down a bough of the soft, cool blossom and pressed it against her cheek. She stopped {{for a moment or two}} to examine the contents of a row of chicken-coops, and at every few steps she turned around to face the breeze which came sweeping across the moorland from the other side of the house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{video was}} filmed at Old Tucson Studios in Tucson, Arizona. During {{the filming of}} the video, a wooden crate was blown away 40 feet from the explosion, landing near Lawrence. As a result, Atlantic Records, Lawrence's record company at the time, decided not to do any more explosions in his videos, citing that [...] "it was too real." [...] On the explosion, Lawrence said [...] "I could feel wood and debris hitting me on the back. My wife Frances was tied up and gagged over my {{shoulder}} with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> pointed right <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> building, and the hair on top of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was singed. When I put her down, we just hugged each other real tight. It scared us to death." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{conservative}} Victorian {{society was}} not ready to accept Genth’s nude figures and at first her paintings were often rejected by exhibitions and advisors told her to abandon her new iconography. However, Genth, known for her fierce personality, persevered through these setbacks. In 1908 her painting, The Lark, won her the Shaw Memorial Prize at the 83rd Annual Exhibition of the National Academy of Design. The Lark depicts a full female nude strolling through the woods with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned looking <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sky as if she just heard a lark, as the title suggests. This painting successfully demonstrates Whistler’s influence on Genth through the integration of the nude form and the landscape. The success of the painting relies on the focus of the painting as a whole to make the nude form grounded in the landscape instead of looking out of place.|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the pas-senger head-tilt strategy on the severity of carsickness in lateral acceleration situations in automobiles. Background: It is well known that the driver is generally less susceptible to carsickness than are the passengers. However, it is also known that the driver tilts his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> curve center when negotiating a curve, whereas the passenger’s head moves in the opposite direction. Therefore, we hypothesized that the head-tilt strategy has the effect of reducing the severity of carsickness. Method: A passenger car was driven on a quasi-oval track with a pylon slalom while the participant sat in the navigator seat. The experiment was terminated when either the participant felt the initial symptoms of motion sickness or the car finished 20 laps. In the natural head-tilt condition, the participants were instructed to sit naturally, to relax, and not to oppose the lateral acceleration intentionally. In the active head-tilt condition, {{the participants were asked to}} tilt their heads against the centrifugal acceleration, thus imitating the driver’s head tilt. Results: The number of laps achieved in the active condition was significantly greater than that in the natural condition. In addition, the subjective ratings of motion sickness and symptoms in the active condition were significantly lower than those in the natural condition. Conclusion: We suggest that an active head tilt against centrifugal acceleration reduces the severity of motion sickness. Application: Potential applications of this study include development of a methodology to reduce carsickness...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Travers turned {{completely}} {{round and}} faced her husband. [...] "You sulk," [...] she said. [...] . Mr. Travers {{jerked his head}} back a little as if to let the word go past.--"I am outraged," [...] he declared. Mrs. Travers recognized there something like real suffering.--"I assure you," [...] she said, seriously (for she was accessible to pity), [...] "I assure you that this strange Lingard has no idea of your importance. He doesn't know anything of your social and political position and still less of your great ambitions." [...] Mr. Travers listened with some attention.--"Couldn't you have enlightened him?" [...] he asked.--"It {{would have been no}} use; his mind is fixed upon his own position and upon his own sense of power. He is a man of the lower classes. [...] ."--"He is a brute," [...] said Mr. Travers, obstinately, and for a moment those two looked straight into each other's eyes.--"Oh," [...] said Mrs. Travers, slowly, [...] "you are determined not to compromise with your feelings!" [...] An undertone of scorn crept into her voice. [...] "But shall I tell you what I think? I think," [...] and she advanced <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slightly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pale, unshaven face that confronted her dark eyes, [...] "I think that for all your blind scorn you judge the man well enough to feel that you can indulge your indignation with perfect safety. Do you hear? With perfect safety!" [...] Directly she had spoken she regretted these words. Really it was unreasonable to take Mr. Travers' tricks of character more passionately on this spot of the Eastern Archipelago full of obscure plots and warring motives than in the more artificial atmosphere of the town. After all what she wanted was simply to save his life, not to make him understand anything. Mr. Travers opened his mouth and without uttering a word shut it again. His wife turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> looking-glass nailed to the wall. She heard his voice behind her.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction An 82 -year-old Caucasian {{woman had}} {{remained}} in a {{persistent vegetative state}} after a coma of seven months duration, which occurred after a stroke with hemiplegia, nine years previously. The persistent vegetative state could be reversed in part by weekly injections with activated immune cells. After therapy, our patient responded to commands in addition to regaining spontaneous movements of both arms {{and the ability to}} swallow. This is the first report on the treatment with activated immune cells of a patient in a persistent vegetative state after a coma. Case presentation An 82 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with a persistent vegetative state subsequent to a coma. She retained respiratory and autonomic functions. As contact was not possible, physiotherapy was passive. Her skin was yellowish, and our patient did not move by herself. Vomiting repeatedly resulted from tube feeding. After a once-weekly treatment with activated immune cells sampled from our patient's blood and activated in vitro, several of her functions gradually returned. Our patient opened her eyes in the requested direction and turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> people entering <b>the</b> room. She 'supported' nursing efforts, as the nurse noted a loss of spastic motions. The strength in both her arms returned, and she spontaneously moved her arm on the side experiencing hemiplegia. After three months, our patient could stick out her tongue upon demand. Finally, the swallow reflexes of our patient started to return. However, tube feeding was continued, and our patient died after aspiration of vomit following a feeding. Conclusion The success of treatment with autologous activated immune cells in this patient may have resulted from the production of neuroactive substances, such as neurotrophin- 3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, by activated immune cells. The deterioration of our patient could be reversed, as demonstrated by the restoration of motor strength in her hemiplegic side. In addition, our patient was able to induce motor responses upon request. It seems reasonable to conclude that activated immune cells may improve the chronic vegetative state in some patients. </p...|$|R
60|$|This sufficed {{to change}} the discourse. Nor was it said {{altogether}} without reason; the lugger, which by this time had passed the western promontory, actually appearing disposed to do as Ghita conjectured. She jibed her mainsail--brought both sheets of canvas on her larboard side, and luffed a little, so as to cause <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to look <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite side of the}} bay, instead of standing on, as before, {{in the direction of the}} canal. This change in the lugger's course produced a general movement in the crowd, which began to quit the heights, hastening to descend the terraced streets, in order to reach the haven. 'Maso and the podestà led the van, in this descent; and the girls, with Ghita in their midst, followed with equal curiosity, but with eager steps. By the time the throng was assembled on the quays, in the streets, on the decks of feluccas, or at other points that commanded the view, the stranger was seen gliding past, in the centre of the wide and deep bay, with his jigger hauled out, and his sheets aft, looking up nearly into the wind's eye, if that could be called wind which was still little more than the sighing of the classical zephyr. His motion was necessarily slow, but it continued light, easy, and graceful. After passing the entrance of the port a mile or more, he tacked and looked up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> haven. By this time, however, he had got so near in to the western cliffs, that their lee deprived him of all air; and, after keeping his canvas open half an hour in the little roads, it was all suddenly drawn to the yards, and the lugger anchored.|$|R
