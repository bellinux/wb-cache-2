5|$|He {{started with}} a {{collection}} of seven basic statistics (assists, blocks, fouls, points, rebounds, steals, and turnovers) from Yahoo! Sports on every NBA player from the previous season and adjusted the stats for time in play. The software grouped the players into color-coded nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities. Alagappan had expected the software to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but the software instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically described positions. The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style. Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his <b>findings</b> <b>with</b> his bosses and basketball statisticians including Ken Pomeroy, who replied in encouragement. He then applied and was accepted to speak at the 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. By May 2012, at least four NBA teams and one MLB team had contacted Ayasdi about using their technology.|$|E
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy <b>findings</b> <b>with</b> all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E

25|$|Wiener always {{shared his}} {{theories}} and <b>findings</b> <b>with</b> other researchers, and credited {{the contributions of}} others. These included Soviet researchers and their findings.

His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Suspicious lesions may be cauterized, {{treated with}} laser light or cut with an {{electric}} wire for purposes of biopsy or complete removal polypectomy. Medication can be injected, e.g. to control bleeding lesions. On average, the procedure takes 20–30 minutes, depending on the indication and <b>findings.</b> <b>With</b> multiple polypectomies or biopsies, procedure times may be longer. As mentioned above, anatomic considerations may also affect procedure times.|$|E

25|$|With a gendered {{data mining}} system in place, feminist historians {{have little to}} no hope of {{integrating}} their <b>findings</b> <b>with</b> the internet.

However both are unlikely to occur as feminist digital humanists are just now themselves being integrated into the digital humanities.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} {{renal biopsy}} is to {{diagnose}} renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies).
