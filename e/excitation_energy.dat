5|$|The results {{indicated}} that nuclei of unbinilium were produced at high (~70MeV) <b>excitation</b> <b>energy</b> which underwent fission with measurable half-lives just over 10−18 s. Although very short (indeed, insufficient for the element to be considered by IUPAC to exist, because a compound nucleus has no internal structure and its nucleons have not been arranged into shells until it has survived for 10−14s, upon which it forms an electronic cloud), the ability to measure such a process indicates a strong shell effect at Z=120. At lower <b>excitation</b> <b>energy</b> (see neutron evaporation), {{the effect of the}} shell will be enhanced and ground-state nuclei can be expected to have relatively long half-lives. This result could partially explain the relatively long half-life of 294Og measured in experiments at Dubna. Similar experiments have indicated a similar phenomenon at element 124 but not for flerovium, suggesting that the next proton shell does in fact lie beyond element 120. In September 2007, the team at RIKEN began a program utilizing 248Cm targets and have indicated future experiments to probe the possibility of 120 being the next proton magic number (and 184 being the next neutron magic number) using the aforementioned nuclear reactions to form 302Ubn, as well as 248Cm+54Cr. They also planned to further chart the region by investigating the nearby compound nuclei 296Og, 298Og, 306Ubb, and 308Ubb.|$|E
