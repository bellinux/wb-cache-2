5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end}} of the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton {{came up with an}} asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picturesque castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E

50|$|The first {{buildings}} {{at the zoo}} were made of local stone and built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). These buildings {{were built in the}} 1930s and were home to primates, reptiles, birds, and big cats.

25|$|Construction of 72 private {{boxes in}} 1985 {{increased}} the seating capacity to 56,926, and a 1990 addition of 36 additional boxes and 1,920 theatre-style club seats brought {{the number to}} 59,543. In 1995, a $4.7 million project put 90 more private boxes in the previously open north end zone, again giving the stadium the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete bowl and increasing capacity to 60,890.|$|E
25|$|Demi-pointe {{shoes are}} most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to {{acclimate}} dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The toe box allows the dancer to experience the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pointe shoe, while the insole and outsole work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{departments}} that serve areas along the wildland–urban interface {{are faced with}} unique challenges that departments based in larger cities or strictly rural areas {{do not need to}} worry about. Departments in these areas often elect to use a type of fire engine commonly referred to as a wildland-urban interface engine or simply interface engines. While technically considered a wildland fire engine by many, these maintain the traditional look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard engine.|$|E
50|$|The comic largely {{follows a}} character-based narrative, mixing drama and light humor that {{sometimes}} {{borders on the}} surreal. With some swearing and partial nudity, it greatly relies on the juxtaposition of the two protagonists, {{as well as their}} relationships with and the relationships between other characters. Octopus Pie has the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> indie comic, focusing on young urbanites, usually from Gen Y.|$|R
50|$|Macandrew Bay is <b>a</b> suburb <b>of</b> Dunedin, {{but has the}} <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{isolated}} coastal {{settlement and}} is often regarded as a separate township, even though {{the heart of the}} city is visible 10 kilometres away at the head of the harbour. It is both a commuter and a harbourside retreat from the city. Macandrew Bay's 2001 population was 1131.|$|R
50|$|Action Quake 2 is a mod for {{the video}} game Quake II created by The A-Team.

It features many maps recreating realistic settings, such as city streets and office buildings, with <b>a</b> balanced range <b>of</b> weapons and equipment inspired by action movies.|$|R
25|$|Because it {{was unable}} to {{immediately}} broadcast live pictures from Baghdad, CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War had the dramatic <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> radio broadcast – and was compared to legendary CBS news anchor Edward R. Murrow's gripping live radio reports of the German bombing of London during World War II. Despite the lack of live pictures, CNN's coverage was carried by television stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide.|$|E

It is a famous milestone in BMX with early BMX stars like David Clinton winning the first BMX titles on it but it with its energy robbing shock absorbers was not the future that the BMX bicycle would take.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other games developed by Blizzard, Hearthstone was an experimental game {{developed by a}} smaller team based on the appreciation of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any possible plays from an opponent during a player's turn and by replicating the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical card game within the game's user interface. Many of the concepts as well as art assets were based on those previously published in the physical World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.|$|E

50|$|Though Newnham {{has changed}} {{enormously}} {{over the past}} 250 years, it retains the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archetypal southern English village, though few farmworkers still live there. Fast railway connections to London and the continent of Europe add to the appeal with jobs in Ashford, Canterbury, Maidstone and Medway within easy reach {{after the completion of}} the M20, M2, M26 and M25 between the mid-1960s and early 1990s.|$|R

25|$|The Geo Storm was a sport compact car {{manufactured}} by Isuzu and {{was sold in}} the United States by Geo from 1990 through 1993. The same vehicles, with minor variations, were sold in Canada in the 1992 and 1993 model years only. The Storm {{was intended to be}} a budget car with the look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sports car. It can be considered to have replaced the related Geo Spectrum, which was sold in hatchback and sedan, although it was only sold in two-door hatchback and station wagon forms.|$|E
25|$|Observation of most pornographic or artistic nude {{material}} {{before that}} decade {{and from the}} advent of the filming or photography camera, would show most if not all the performers or models with their own pubic hair differences of growth, with no signs of invested rejection or manipulated discrimination. The presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the style as unnatural. Some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hairless crotch.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{inmates were}} housed in cells {{that could only}} be {{accessed}} by entering through a small exercise yard attached {{to the back of the}} prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, {{the cinema}} {{was sold to}} Lyn Goleby and Tony Jones {{and became the first}} venue in the Picturehouse group of 21 cinemas.

50|$|The {{repeated}} phrase “come near” has the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> incantation: the rose’s proximity, so close, and yet {{leaving a}} space {{large enough for}} “the rose-breath to fill,” contributes to {{the feeling of being}} on the verge of the divine (line 14). The lack of complete and utter communion with the rose gives the poem <b>an</b> air <b>of</b> sweet suffering that seems necessary in order to achieve the sublime.|$|R
25|$|For a {{young or}} green (inexperienced) horse, longeing {{is used to}} teach a horse to respond to voice {{commands}} and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything {{it is going to}} be asked to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E
25|$|The Andrew Carnegie birthplace {{museum at}} the corner of Moodie Street and Priory Lane is {{dedicated}} to the well-known businessman and philanthropist. The museum is made up of two buildings; the weaver's cottage, his birthplace and the memorial hall which tells his life story. Annual heritage walks organised by the museum take place each summer.

25|$|Over {{six hundred}} Old Newingtonians enlisted during World War I {{and the loss}} of life was appalling. By war's end, 109 Old Boys had died for God, King and Country. Prior to 1920 the walls of the {{vestibule}} {{at the entrance to the}} Founders Wing had been hung with sporting teams photographs. In 1921 this space was transformed by the installation of white marble tablets, encased in Queensland maple, upon which were inscribed the names of Old Boys who had served. Those who had made the supreme sacrifice are listed on the central panels below the words: These Nobly Strining, Nobly Fell. With a black and white marble floor and stained glass door panels this space takes on the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small chapel.|$|E

50|$|Mannaja is {{an unusual}} {{spaghetti}} western, in that it contains some symbolism and emotional scenes that give the viewer the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adventure or horror film, particularly in the opening scene in the swamp, and {{the scene in the}} cave. Mannaja has been compared to a contemporaneous film called Keoma (1976). Like other spaghetti westerns it is sometimes rather brutal, and contains fairly graphic depictions <b>of</b> murder with <b>an</b> axe. It was banned in Sweden.|$|R
