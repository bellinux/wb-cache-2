25|$|In 2004, News Corporation {{retained}} {{the services of}} public relations firm Glover Park to launch a campaign aimed at delaying Nielsen's plan to replace its aging household electronic data collection methodology in larger local markets with its newer electronic People Meter system. The advocates in the public relations campaign charged that data derived from the newer People Meter system represented a bias toward underreporting minority viewing, {{which could lead to}} a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>discrimination</b> in employment against minority actors and writers. However, Nielsen countered the campaign by revealing its sample composition counts. According to Nielsen Media Research's sample composition counts, , nationwide, African American households using People Meters represented 6.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 6.0% in the general population. Latino households represent 5.7% of the Nielsen sample, compared to 5.0% in the general population. By October 2006, News Corporation and Nielsen settled, with Nielsen agreeing to spend an additional $50 million to ensure that minority viewing was not being underreported by the new electronic people meter system.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act {{apparently}} outlawed {{discrimination by}} businesses, reading: [...] "All persons within this state shall {{be entitled to}} the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement." [...] However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>discrimination</b> to continue. Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore. Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{rights in}} the United Kingdom are set out in common law, with its strongest roots being in the English Bill of Rights 1689 and Scottish Claim of Right Act 1689, as well as {{legislation}} of European institutions: the EU and the European Court of Human Rights.

In recent years, however, British human rights legislation has been criticised by some for what they perceive as excessive attention to the human rights of offenders at the expense of those of victims; high-profile cases, such as those of Learco Chindamo and the 2006 Afghan hijackers, have attracted controversy, sparking calls for the review of the Human Rights Act 1998 and other legislation.

40|$|It {{is close}} to a criminological truism {{that the lack of}} a {{legitimate}} job fosters criminality and, conversely, that holding a legitimate job diminishes criminal conduct. Consequently, many criminologists and social reformers have long advocated programs to expand employment opportunities for ex-offenders, particularly for those who have served prison time. Strategies for improving employability of ex-offenders include providing ex-offenders with basic education and job-specific training, assisting in identifying potential employment opportunities, interceding on the job seeker’s behalf with prospective employers, and eliminating de jure and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> employment <b>discrimination</b> against ex-offenders. Many federal and state laws make ex-offenders, or at least certain categories of ex-offenders, ineligible to obtain employment licenses or to work in organizations serving children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations (Love, 2006).

5000|$|Redlining is the {{practice}} of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, [...] or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and measure to end mortgage discrimination in 1975, would completely invalidate de jure racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S., although <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> segregation and <b>discrimination</b> have proven more resilient. According to the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, the actual <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in the late 1980s; since that time, the schools have, in fact, become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers. According to Rajiv Sethi, an economist at Columbia University, black-white segregation in housing is slowly declining for most metropolitan areas in the US Racial segregation or separation can lead to social, economic and political tensions. [...] Thirty years (the year 2000) after the civil rights era, the United States remained in many areas a residentially segregated society, in which blacks, whites and Hispanics inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality.|$|R

40|$|Until {{three years}} ago, a policy at Delhi Charter School in Louisiana {{required}} that any pregnant student be effectively expelled. A pregnant sixteen-year-old student’s expulsion {{caught the attention}} of national media in 2012. The ACLU sued and the school quickly rescinded the policy. Although the policy was revoked, the un-adjudicated nature of the resolution leaves teen girls at the school and nationwide without any final court order to protect them against the (re) enactment of similar discriminatory policies. This Article analyzes the Delhi Charter School policy in order to make three related arguments. First, the Court should adopt a rebuttable presumption of state action when the plaintiff is a charter school student alleging the deprivation of a fundamental right. Second, any pregnancy expulsion policy enforced by a charter school violates both the Equal Protection doctrine and Title IX. The Equal Protection claim rests on the remedy left available under Geduldig v. Aiello, which otherwise crippled women’s access to remedies against pregnancy discrimination: if a facially neutral policy evidences discrimination, that policy is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. Due to the complete lack of rational justification for these policies, this Article argues that all pregnancy expulsion policies <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> evidence invidious <b>discrimination.</b> Third, while Title IX provides another source of remedies, it will not provide meaningful remedies without reform to its implementation. This Article concludes with suggested Title IX reforms...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} how feminist consciousness at {{the crux of}} the second wave women 2 ̆ 7 s movement was simultaneously unified and splintered. What cut across backgrounds and united women was a common mission to overturn institutionalized and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> in American society. Yet consciousness development and approaches to these women 2 ̆ 7 s-centered goals varied greatly among and between black, white, and Chicana women based on race, distinct history in the United States, class, concurrent liberation struggles, and religion. There was both a women 2 ̆ 7 s movement – broadly defined as numerous women acting somewhat contemporaneously for the advancement of women 2 ̆ 7 s rights – and several women 2 ̆ 7 s movements, meaning the pursuit of rights by women of similar standpoints, perhaps within specific contexts, such as a racial community. These movements overlapped yet rarely blended; the simultaneous existence of one movement and many demonstrates the paradoxical nature of the second wave. It also begs the question of whether internal division is indicative of the movement 2 ̆ 7 s failure. This thesis argues that, contrary to the views of many historians and feminists, the movement 2 ̆ 7 s power lies in its complexity. The voices contained in numerous anthologies are showcased in this intellectual history to demonstrate how women 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts and experiences interacted and molded each other 2 ̆ 7 s. This dynamic process compelled the interpretation and application of pro-women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment ideals in myriad contexts, giving the struggle depth and making it accessible to a wider range of women. Women, regardless of background, perceived these ideals from their unique points of view and endeavored to integrate these concepts into their lives, traditions, and faiths. The movement 2 ̆ 7 s strength, rather than fatal flaw, is that “though all women are women, no woman is only a woman. ...|$|R
