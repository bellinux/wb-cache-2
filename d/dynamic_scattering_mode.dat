25|$|A {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) is an {{electronically}} modulated optical device shaped into a thin, flat panel made up of any number of color or monochrome pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed {{in front of a}} light source or reflector.

25|$|In 1964, George H. Heilmeier, {{then working}} at the RCA {{laboratories}} on the effect discovered by Williams achieved the switching of colors by field-induced realignment of dichroic dyes in a homeotropically oriented liquid crystal. Practical problems with this new electro-optical effect made Heilmeier {{continue to work on}} scattering effects in liquid crystals and finally the achievement of the first operational liquid-crystal display based on what he called the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>mode</b> (DSM). Application of a voltage to a DSM display switches the initially clear transparent liquid crystal layer into a milky turbid state. DSM displays could be operated in transmissive and in reflective mode but they required a considerable current to flow for their operation. George H. Heilmeier was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and credited with the invention of LCDs. Heilmeier's work is an IEEE Milestone. In the late 1960s, pioneering work on liquid crystals was undertaken by the UK's Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England.

40|$|The {{apparent}} shear viscosity of p-methoxybenzylidene-p'-n-butylaniline in {{the presence}} of electrohydrodynamic convection (EHC) is investigated experimentally. In the absence of an electric field, directors are almost aligned along the flow direction such that the viscosity is close to the minimum of the Miesowicz viscosities. Since EHC disturbs the flow-aligned director configuration, the viscosity increases as the applied voltage is increased in the low-voltage regime. In the high-voltage regime, however, further increasing the voltage leads to a decrease in viscosity. Microscope observations using a rheometer reveal that the decrease in viscosity occurs in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>mode</b> 2 (DSM 2) state, whose spatial director distribution is anisotropic due to the shear flow. By adopting the Ericksen-Leslie theory for the shear flow under the electric field, we find that the viscosity decrease {{can be attributed to the}} negative contribution of the electric stress caused by the anisotropic director distribution of the DSM 2 state...|$|E

As a result of these efforts, device sensitivity was improved by a factor of ten, device resolution was improved by a factor of three, device lifetime was improved by two-orders of magnitude, undesirable secondary liquid crystal scattering effects were eliminated, the scattering characteristics of the liquid crystal were thoroughly documented, the cosmetic quality of the devices was dramatically improved, and the performance of the device was fully documented...|$|E

The ACF is independent of chain sizes N for N/p<N_e (N_e is the entanglement length), and there exists a minimum of the stretching exponent as N/p → N_e. As N/p increases, we verify the crossover scaling behavior of the effective relaxation time τ_ eff,p from the Rouse regime to the reptation regime.
