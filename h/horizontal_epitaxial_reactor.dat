High flows are needed in order to achieve equal growth rates {{along the length of the}} reactor tube. In this way the depletion of the gas phase is counter acted. For various types of <b>horizontal</b> <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactors</b> the flow of these four carrier gases has been studied in detail using in situ optical measuring techniques i. c. interference holography. Analysis of the results clearly shows the dominant influence of the so called entrance effects, which, especially are of importance for argon and nitrogen. It appears that H 2 and He under normal conditions will have well developed laminar streamlines, whereas N 2 and Ar nomally will give a mixture of turbulent and convective streams, which are highly underdeveloped qua velocity and temperature. The interference patterns make it possible to calculate the temperature profiles in the reactor tube. This has been done for several flow velocities and types of reactor cells. Here the influence of the entrance effect is most clearly seen : it demonstrates itself as the presence of a cold finger in the gas stream. In low pressure CVD besides the lower pressure also higher flow velocities are present. The effect of these parameters on the flow profiles is discussed. In addition some calculations made by T.

The doping of the as-grown epi-layers is controlled down to 5 × 1011 cm? 3, a value that is solely limited by the cleanness of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactor</b> chamber. To ensure such a low doping concentration, first an As-doped Si seed layer is grown with a concentration of 1016 to 1017 cm? 3, after which the dopant gas arsine is turned off and a thick lightly-doped epi-layer is deposited. The final doping in the thick epi-layer relies on the segregation and incorporation of As from the seed layer, and it also depends on the final thickness of the layer, and the exact growth cycles.

40|$|The SEG {{technique}} and its extension epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) have already found many applications in device fabrication {{both in terms}} of process simplification and new device structures. The basic processes involve substrate preparation, ex-situ cleaning, in-situ surface oxide removal and SEG/ELO growth. Substrate preparation involves fabrication of the necessary "seed-windows" in, e. g. oxide or nitride layers down to the single crystal substrate : this is usually achieved using a reactive ion etch (RIE) process followed by the growth and subsequent etching of a sacrificial oxide (SO) for surface damage removal. Ex-situ cleaning usually consists of a wet chemical treatment, e. g. RCA, with the final RCA- 2 step leaving the silicon surface coated with a reproducible thin oxide layer which also serves to remove various contaminants. The in-situ clean removes the latter oxide through a low pressure H 2 prebake, using a temperature which effectively etches the oxide via the [MATH] disproportionation reaction, but which minimises the concomitant undercutting of the exposed SiO 2 /Si oxide - substrate interface by the same reaction. The growth process involves optimisation of the main parameters, i. e. temperature, pressure and gas flows, to obtain full control of selectivity (i. e. polysilicon nucleation on the field area), sidewall faceting, defect generation and autodoping.

In order to meet these future demands, optical interconnects must be improved to consume less power than they do today. To do this, both more efficient transmitters and more sensitive receivers must be developed. This work addresses the latter, focusing on device level improvements to tightly couple a low capacitance photodiode with the first stage transistor of the receiver as a single phototransistor device. First I motivate the need for a coupled phototransistor using a simple circuit model which shows how receiver sensitivity is determined by photodiode capacitance and the length of wire connecting it to the first transistor in a receiver amplifier. Then I describe our use of the unique rapid melt growth technique, which is used to integrate crystalline germanium on silicon photonics substrates without an <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactor.</b> The resulting material quality is demonstrated with high quality (0. 95 A/W, 40 + GHz) germanium photodiodes on silicon waveguides.

30|$|The {{starting}} substrates were SOI wafers with a 70 -nm-top silicon layer (p-type, 9 – 18  Ω cm).

This was followed by rinsing in deionized water and drying in N 2. The Ge film was deposited in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactor</b> (Epsilon 2000, ASM) using 10 % GeH 4 as the precursor. Hydrogen {{was used as the}} carrier gas. Before the deposition of the Ge film, an in situ HCl-based pretreatment was performed at 850  °C and 10  Torr to prepare the wafer surface. The substrate temperature was then changed to 400  °C to grow a Ge film on the SOI wafer using 10 % GeH 4. The thicknesses of the deposited Ge films were determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, thermal emission Schottky-type, 0.5 – 200  kV). The crystallinities of the Ge films were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (D 8 A, Bruker, CuKα radiation, λ[*]=[*] 1.5408  Å, 20 – 70 °). In addition, Ω– 2 θ scans were performed around the (004) diffraction peak using an X’Pert MRD (PANalytical) system. A two-fold Ge { 400 } channel-cut crystal collimator was used to select the CuKα 1 radiation.

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} materials both in {{the form}} of heteropitaxial and homoepitaxial structures, offer huge potentialities due to a large variety of band energy structures which can be exploited in microelectronics (FET, HBTs) and optoeletronic (lasers, LEDs) devices. However, epitaxial integration of different semiconductors for device development present several issues regarding mainly the minimization of the defects within the heterostructures. To achieve this, materials with similar lattice constant should be used, so that the induced elastic strain in the overgrown film is minimized. Other than the physical constraints however, the choice of the high quality substrate must yield to a cost-effective solution to develop the devices. In the field of microelectronics, the silicon has remained the unparallel material of choice for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices due to its large availability and relative low cost of the raw material. Born in the late 1950 s and having since grown into an industry with annual revenues currently in excess of 200 bilion, the modern Si-based semiconductor microelectronics industry is an amazing technical and financial accomplishment. The continuous increase in devices performance requirements have highlighted the main limitation of the silicon device employment. The carrier mobility for both electrons and holes is relatively small respect to the III V alloys, which instead combine high electrical performance with equally high radiation interaction efficiency. Furthermore, the maximum velocity that these carriers can attain under high electric fields is also small, and this limits the cut off frequency of the Si-based microelectronic devices. Due to indirect bandgap also, light emission and absorption is fairly inefficient, making impractical its employment in optoelectronics devices. On the other hand, the higher physical and electrical properties of the III V alloys respect to silicon, are also coupled with relatively high costs. Furthermore, these compounds offer an high application flexibility as the relative composition of these alloys can be also tuned in order to obtain a specific optical or electrical properties. By employment of the Germanium however, the properties of the silicon can be enhanced drastically. SiGe compounds infact exhibit higher electron and hole mobility even if small relative Ge fraction is added to the silicon. Moreover, the application of strain engineering in microelectronic devices using strain-relaxed SiGe buffer layer have brought a drastic enhancement in electrical properties of silicon. These alloys offers in addition the possibility to integrate the high efficiency III V alloys with low cost silicon substrate. The generally large lattice mismatch between these materials and the silicon, give rise to several issue regarding epitaxy integration. High mismatched heterostructure infact, relax plastically the elastic strain by an uncontrollable process which lead to a high density of induced defects in the grown layers. Several methods have been developed to growth high quality Ge layers onto silicon substrate with only a small dislocation content, such as constant composition thin buffer layers, linearly graded buffer layer and terrace graded buffer layers. On the other hand, in case a pure Ge can be directly integrated into the silicon wafer, a subsequent overgrown of III V alloys can be performed generating a low density of induced dislocations. Also the technique employed for deposition play a determinant role on the final quality of the grown layer. Classical CVD techniques, are able to growth high quality epitaxial layers but suffers generally of a low growth rate. Furthermore, the high thermal budgets required for precursor cracking can lead to several defect generation processes which finally degrade the electrical properties of the grown layer. In this work, high quality pure Ge virtual substrate (VS) have been grown onto silicon substrate using the low energy plasma enhance chemical vapor deposition (LEPECVD) technique. The innovative <b>epitaxial</b> <b>reactor</b> have been developed at the Physics Department of the University of Ferrara in collaboration with Dichroic Cell, and have been installed in the clean room facilities. A very high growth rates, as high as 3 nm/s, can be obtain while maintaining an high crystallographic quality of the epilayers. Furthermore, the substrate temperature have been proved to play a determinant role on the epitaxial processes. Thus a numerical approach have been developed to assess the temperature profile during the epitaxial process within the LEPECVD reactor. The finite element analysis have highlighted several feature useful for the design improvement of the LEPECVD heating stage. Finally, pure Ge VS buffer layers have been obtain with a induced TDD as low as 105 cm- 2. The low surface roughness and the high relaxation of the VS buffer layers obtained, put the basis for a cost-effective integration of the high efficient III-V alloys with Silicon substrates...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Chemical EngineeringJames H. Edgar 4 H-silicon carbide (4 H-SiC) is a {{wide band}} gap {{semiconductor}} with outstanding capabilities for high temperature, high power, and high frequency electronic device applications. Advances in its processing technology have resulted in large micropipe-free single crystals and high speed epitaxial growth on off-axis silicon face substrates. Extraordinarily high growth rates of high quality epitaxial films (> 100 [Mu]m per hour) have been achieved, but only on off-axis substrates (misoriented 4 ° to 8 ° from the (0001) crystallographic plane). There is a strong incentive to procure an on-axis growth procedure, due to the excessive waste of high quality single crystal associated with wafering off-axis substrates. The purpose {{of this research was}} to develop a reliable process for homoepitaxial growth of 4 H-SiC on on-axis 4 H-SiC. Typically the use of on-axis SiC for epitaxial growth is undesired due to the increased probability of 3 C-SiC inclusions and polycrystalline growth. However, it is believed that the presence of chlorine during reaction may reduce the presence of 3 C-SiC and improve the quality of the epitaxial film. Therefore homoepitaxial SiC was deposited using methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) and ethane sources with carrier gases consisting of argon-hydrogen mixtures. Ethane was used to increase the C/Si ratio, to aid in the prevention of 3 C-SiC, and to help eliminate silicon droplets deposited during epitaxial growth. Deposition occurred in a homemade, quartz, cold wall chemical vapor deposition <b>reactor.</b> <b>Epitaxial</b> films on on-axis 4 H-SiC were deposited without the presence of 3 C-SiC inclusions or polycrystalline SiC, as observed by defect selective etching, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. Large defect free areas, [similar to] 5 mm[superscript] 2, with epitaxial film thicknesses of [similar to] 6 [Mu]m were grown on on-axis 4 H-SiC. Epitaxial films had approximately an 80 %, [similar to] 20 cm[superscript]- 2, decrease in defect density as compared to the substrates. The growth rate was independent of face polarity and orientation of the substrate. The optimal temperature for hydrogen etching, to promote the smoothest epitaxial films for on-axis substrates (both C- and Si-polarities), is [similar to] 1550 °C for 10 minutes in the presence of 2 slm hydrogen. The optimum C/Si ratio for epitaxial growth on on-axis 4 H-SiC is 1; excess carbon resulted in the codeposition of graphite and cone-shaped silicon carbide defects...|$|R
