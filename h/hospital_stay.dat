Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|However, because {{intravenous}} linezolid may be {{switched to}} an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, {{people may be}} discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the length of <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, {{it may be more}} expensive—than comparable antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{was quite}} {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with <b>hospital</b> <b>stay).</b> With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90.

5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> in about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was born}} on April 29, 1967 to {{unmarried}} teenage parents. Five days after his birth, his mother, Wendy Munro, placed him for adoption with Jeanne Joseph, a nurse who had befriended her during her <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> and her husband Harold Joseph. Jeanne and her husband decided to name the baby Curtis after his birth father Curtis Nickle. Curtis grew up with an older stepbrother Grant and a stepbrother Victor; he also has three older stepsisters and a step brother from a previous marriage. The family was of mixed race with Harold and Victor being black. It was not until he signed with the St. Louis Blues that Joseph legally changed his name from Curtis Shayne Munro to Curtis Shayne Joseph.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the surgery habitually performed in low back pain and sciatica, frequent and costly affections, by analyzing <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> for diskectomies. Method: To this end, we selected <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> in public and private institutions in the Aquitaine region by using the 1997 DRG (PMSI) data. A multiple correspondence followed by a hierarchical cluster analysis was used. Results: We studied 2945 <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> in 37 different institutions. The average patient age was 45. 7 years. 58. 4 % of the patients were male. The average length of stay was 5 days. Surgical decompression was accomplished by disk ablation in 72. 8 % of the cases and by laminectomy in 26. 1 %. Only 1. 1 % of the patients underwent a bone-stabilizing procedure. Eight different categories of <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> were found. The university hospital (CHU) and private institutions preferentially cared for young patients with relatively uncomplicated low back pain (GHM n° 302) who had short <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> and disk decompression. Private institutions involved in a cooperative program with public hospitals (PSPH) tended to treat older patients who underwent bone decompression procedures. Their <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> were from 4 to 5 days. Smaller public hospitals (hôpitaux généraux) tended to hospitalize patients longer. Two types of <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> involved more complex clinical disorders (GHM 301 and 4) and mainly concerned older patients having undergone laminectomy and who had lengthy <b>hospital</b> <b>stays.</b> Conclusion: The results of the classification of <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> appear to accurately reflect disk surgery actually performed in Aquitaine. This method may prove useful for following other surgical procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{organizational}} {{appropriateness of}} <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> {{is an expression}} of a hospital's efficiency and aim of the management control. The AEP (American Version) /PRUO (Italian Version) protocol is specific for measuring the organizational appropriateness of <b>hospital</b> <b>stays.</b> The aim of this study is the comparative analysis of the organizational appropriateness of <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> in Careggi <b>Hospital</b> of Florence and in all hospital Departments in 1995 and 1998. In 1998 the AEP/PRUO protocol was applied to 2148 samples of <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> out of 38, 968 eligible hospitalizations, and in 1995 a sample of 1989 <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> out of 35, 108. In 1998 2, 148 admissions and 15, 338 days of hospitalization were tested. In 1995, 1989 admission days and 12, 264 days of hospitalization were tested, 63 departments were studied. In 1995 the first edition of the protocol was applied, in 1998 the second. A sample of 218 of the 1998 <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> was tested with both editions to evaluate the impact of differences. In 1998, with the second edition of the protocol, the inappropriateness rate of admission days and hospitalization days and the rate of in-patients inappropriate <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> was respectively 38. 0 %, 43. 8 % and 18. 5 %. Compared with 1995 results, the rates increased + 6. 2 %, 6 % and + 7. 5 % respectively. Instead, with the first edition of the protocol, the rates were 29. 7 %, 37. 6 % and 10. 7 % and, compared with 1995, they were reduced - 2. 1 %, - 0. 6 % and - 0. 3 %.

5|$|After a one-month <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld was {{promoted}} to Major and made Geschwaderkommodore of Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG5) on 20 February 1944. He and his crew, Oberfeldwebel Josef Renette and Unteroffizier Kurt Röber, {{were killed in a}} flying accident on 12 March 1944 on a routine flight from Parchim to Athies-sous-Laon. Above Belgium, they seem to have encountered a bad weather zone with low clouds and a dense snowstorm and it was assumed that the aircraft hit the high Ardennes ground after being forced to fly lower because of ice forming on the wings. The exact circumstances of this flight may never be known, the Bf 110 G-4 C9+CD (Werknummer 720 010—factory number) crashed into the Ardennes mountains near St. Hubert where the completely burned-out wreck was found the following day. The funeral service was held in the city church of Linz on 15 March 1944. Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Weißenfeld and Prinz Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein are buried side by side at Ysselsteyn in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{hospital}} financing {{is more and}} more based on a budget in function of the pathologies, it appears necessary to detect <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> presenting discrepancy between the resources they used and the medical characteristics they present. We propose the use of deterministic nonparametric frontier models to rank <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> in function of their expenses taking into account the severity level of the patient. In this case, the <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> with the lowest total expenses for a given level of severity are considered as efficient. But, deterministic models are very sensitive to the extreme stays so that some efficient stays could be in fact ‘too’ efficient and considered as outliers. We try to highlight these stays using the method of Simar (2001) which is based on the concept of order-m frontier. The idea is to define a ‘benchmark’ frontier that doesn’t envelop all the data. Indeed, for a given level of severity, a reasonable minimal value of the expenses is estimated. The <b>hospital</b> <b>stays</b> with expenses lower than this reasonable value could be considered as ‘outlier’ and require further analysis. We compare our results with these obtained in Beguin (2001) which relies on a method proposed by Wilson (1995). As a conclusion, we recommend the use of both methods to detect the outlier and so to obtain a better ranking of the other <b>hospital</b> <b>stays...</b>|$|R
