40|$|Currency crises exert strong {{pressure}} on currencies often causing costly economic adjustment. A measure of exchange market pressure (EMP) gauges {{the severity of}} such tensions. Measuring EMP is important for monetary authorities that manage exchange rates. It is also relevant in academic research that studies currency crises. A precise EMP measure is therefore important and this paper re-examines the measurement of EMP on the <b>Croatian</b> <b>kuna.</b> It improves it by considering intervention data and thresholds that account for the EMP distribution. It also tests the robustness of weights. A {{discussion of the results}} demonstrates a modest improvement over the previous measure and concludes that the new EMP on the <b>Croatian</b> <b>kuna</b> should be used in future research. exchange market pressure, currency crisis, Croatia...|$|R
