25|$|Johns Hopkins awarded Price a PhD in {{political}} science in 1933, and published his book, The Russo-Japanese Treaties of 1907-1916 Concerning Manchuria and Mongolia that same year. The book chronicled the remorseless efforts of Japan and Russia to carve up northeast Asia. In 1935, Price visited Manchukuo, Japan's puppet state in Northeast China, and met with the last Manchu emperor, Pu Yi. His book along {{with a number of}} academic articles published in the mid-nineteen thirties when he was a <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> <b>Institution</b> highlighted the threat of Japanese imperialism in Manchuria and China. Price warned that Japan’s aggressive policies could lead to a serious international conflict. His writing helped initiate the public debate over the “China question” in the years leading up to World War II. His warnings proved to be both prophetic and timely.|$|E

2500|$|During Hugo Chávez's tenure, {{he seized}} {{thousands}} of properties and businesses while also reducing the footprint of foreign companies.

2500|$|Although {{the court}} stated {{clearly that the}} {{decision}} {{is limited to the}} contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p.4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. Walter Dellinger, former acting solicitor general said, [...] "for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else." [...] Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care. In line with the dissenting opinion, The American Prospect asked, [...] "ill the taxpayers have to send a check to employees if employers feel that minimum wage laws violate their religious beliefs?" [...] Jonathan Rauch, a senior <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> <b>Institution,</b> said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLT) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights withdrew their support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the Hobby Lobby ruling. NGLT executive director Rea Carey said, [...] "We do not take this move lightly. We've been pushing for this bill for 20 years." ...|$|E
