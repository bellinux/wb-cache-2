50|$|What's Her Face {{was a line}} of {{customizable}} dolls that straddled {{the line}} between traditional fashion dolls and creative activity toys. Made by Mattel, the line ran from 2001-2003, and enjoyed only a modest success in a market dominated by Mattel's iconic Barbie and MGA Entertainment's Bratz dolls. Following the discontinuation of the What's Her <b>Face</b> <b>line,</b> their body molds {{were used for the}} Wee 3 Friends line of Barbie-related dolls. Several fashion, wig, and activity packs were also released for the What's Her <b>Face</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

This research conducted in four locations which were Aceh Besar, Pidie, North Aceh regencies and Banda Aceh city to obtain the quantitative and qualitative data of Aceh cattle (131 males and 269 females). All those data analyzed using descriptive statistics which Minitab 14. 13 program and sheet Excel tabulation. Research result showed that body weight and body size had been decreased compared to concised report in 1926. In the same age, Aceh cattle had smaller body size than those of Madura, Ongole (PO), and Bali cattle. Although, the body size and body weight of Aceh cattle were larger than the average body size and body weight of cattle in coastal west Sumatera. Qualitatively, Aceh cattle had dominant red sand and light brown colour, also variance of colour coat pattern starting from dark to light colour. The shape of horn growth in female cattle was bend slightly toward left or right and then bend to forward direction and the male had the same shape as female but {{the end of the}} horn goes upward.

40|$|Introduction. Lingual {{thyroid gland}} {{is a rare}} anomaly of thyroid gland development, {{occurring}} more frequently in females. If it causes local symptomatology such as dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea it is diagnosed in childhood, however, if it is asymptomatic it is usually diagnosed in adulthood. Case Outline. We present a 23 -year-old female patient in whom we diagnosed lingual thyroid gland coincidentally during diagnostic procedures of a concomitant disease. The application of 131 I scintigraphy showed an oval field of intensive accumulation of radio markers in the zone of medial <b>face</b> <b>line,</b> around tongue base, with the absence of thyroid gland in its physiological position. Functional testing proved primary hypothyroidism and we started the application of substitution therapy. The application of levothyroxine resulted in reaching euthyroid state and the reduction of thyroid gland size. Conclusion. We present a very rare anomaly of the thyroid gland, and so far {{there have been no}} clear attitudes about further treatment. The general condition of the patient, age, the size of ectopic thyroid gland and the existence of local symptomatology or complications represent the factors that have influence on the choice of treatment method...|$|E
40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) report evaluates three stress-transfer-modification {{concepts}} {{for their}} potential in reducing longwall gate road stresses and closures. In {{each of the}} three concepts - packwalling, gob infilling, and entry filling -support structures are constructed on the headgate side of the panel parallel with or inby the <b>face</b> <b>line.</b> When the headgate becomes the tailgate of the adjacent panel, these structures are in place to accept stresses transferred from the mined-out panel. Using the USBM nonlinear boundary-element program MULSIM/NL, baseline models of typical longwall stress transfer behavior were developed for both intermediate depth and deep mining conditions. These models were verified by comparing model results with field measurements and observations. The stress-transfer-modification concepts were then incorporated into the deep baseline model to quantify the effects of each concept on tailgate closure. Modeling results indicated that entry filling is the most effective concept in reducing tailgate escapeway closure. Using only 18 m 3 of a weak fill per meter of face advance (7. 3 yd 3 per ft of face advance), tailgate escapeway closure was reduced by 33 %. By improving the quality of the fill, similar results were achieved using 50 % less volume...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} computational modelling {{to the prediction of}} the stability of methane drainage boreholes during the extraction life of an active long wall coal panel within a United Kingdom coal mine. The modelling was undertaken to investigate the affects that changes in the roof geology and roadway support system may have on the deformation and closure of the gas drainage boreholes drilled from the tailgate across the goaf of an active long wall panel. The paper also outlines the development of an analytical model to estimate the bending deformation, axial strain, and the rupture of borehole casing due to rock shear. This model was used in conjunction with the geomechanical strata models to predict the distance behind the <b>face</b> <b>line</b> at which excessive borehole deformation and closure would occur. This method was used to evaluate the optimum roadway support system and spacing between boreholes to maintain effective borehole drainage subject to the range of geological conditions encountered during the panel retreat. A good correlation was obtained between the model predictions and the geomechanical and gas drainage data measured at a UK Colliery. D. N. Whittles, I. S. Lowndes, S. W. Kingman, C. Yates, S.

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional object {{reconstruction}} from {{a single}} 2 D line drawing is an important problem in computer vision. Many methods have been presented to solve this problem, but they usually fail when the geometric structure of a 3 D object becomes complex. In this paper, a novel approach based on a divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed to handle the 3 D reconstruction of a planar-faced complex manifold object from its 2 D line drawing with hidden lines visible. The approach consists of four steps: 1) identifying the internal faces of the line drawing, 2) decomposing the line drawing into multiple simpler ones based on the internal faces, 3) reconstructing the 3 D shapes from these simpler line drawings, and 4) merging the 3 D shapes into one complete object represented by the original line drawing. A number of examples are provided to show that our approach can handle 3 D reconstruction of more complex objects than previous methods. Index Terms— 3 D reconstruction, divide and conquer, internal <b>face,</b> <b>line</b> drawing, manifold. Ç 1 INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK Aline drawing is the 2 D projection of the wireframe of anobject. Humans have no difficulty in perceiving the 3 D geometry from a 2 D line drawing.

30|$|In general, {{tributary}} area method {{is used to}} estimate the value of mining induced stress around a symmetrical excavation with low percentage of extraction. The scope of the {{tributary area}} method ends with high percentage of extraction and roof strata failure. Once the strata breaks and acquires a new state of equilibrium, an assessment of mining induced stress over coal pillars around the excavation becomes a challenging task. In fact, failure of overlying roof strata is mainly governed by the geology and strength of the strata. Due to further dimensional increase of the opening, mining induced stress is created by the immediate roof strata cantilevering over the goaf area and their magnitudes depend, mainly, on the length and thickness of the roof strata that overhang inside the goaf area. In past, a number of attempts (Sellers 1997; Majumder and Chakrabarty 1991) utilizing, both, simulation (Jaiswal et al. 2004; Mathur 1992) and field observations (Maleki 1992; Gale 1998) were made {{to understand the nature}} and amount of mining induced stress variation in and around an underground excavation due to coal mining. Jayanthu et al. (2004) found that the maximum vertical stress over rib and stook decreases with increase in working height during depillaring. Field investigations (Singh et al. 1996) showed that the nature of development of mining induced stress over pillar/stook at different stages of depillaring, for a nearly flat coal seam, is influenced by different parameters like depth of cover, characteristics of overlying strata, distance from <b>face</b> <b>line,</b> extraction height and goaf treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} depth, {{distance from}} surface connections and falling quality of coal mined are factors {{that increase the}} risk of spontaneous combustion in working areas. The trend towards high capital investment, high output faces significantly raises the economic consequences of spontaneous combustion. Much work has been directed towards methods of identifying the liability of a coal to spontaneously combust under given conditions. The cost of prevention and combat of spontaneous combustion underground is high, however this work is carried out with little knowledge of the likely location of a heating in a coalface waste. This thesis investigates the airflow patterns in a coalface waste, with a view towards improving the use of prevention and combat methods. The factors that affect the liability of a coal to spontaneously combust, and the methods of prevention and combat are discussed to provide a background to the subject area. An investigation into the flow of nitrogen that was injected from one hole into a coalface waste as a combat measure was conducted. The results of this showed how the amount of nitrogen entering the waste depended on {{the rise and fall of}} the atmospheric pressure. An attempt was made to develop a method of sampling gas from deep within the coalface waste. It proved impossible to sample further than 15 m behind the <b>face</b> <b>line.</b> The results from this exercise are presented. The finite element method was used to model the pressure distribution in the waste under differing boundary pressure and waste permeability conditions. A suggested area at risk from spontaneous combustion is presented...|$|E
