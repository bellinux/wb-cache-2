500|$|Despite her {{interest}} in acting from an early age, Pinto was undecided on which career path to take until watching Monster (2003) while at college. She stated: [...] "I guess it was when I watched Monster... I pretty much knew. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way. I {{had to do something}} like that, something completely transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E
500|$|Morse {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} supporting roles following the finale of St. Elsewhere in 1988. He is quoted as saying: [...] "I made the decision that I didn't care if there was any money in the role or not. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> roles that were different from what I had been doing." [...] His turn in Desperate Hours as antagonist showed a darker Morse. He later starred in The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard. He has {{appeared in}} three adaptations of Stephen King stories: The Langoliers, Hearts in Atlantis, and The Green Mile. He was a guest star on , playing the racist cousin of Detective Tim Bayliss.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} have one person fully {{understand}} and develop their own character, as well as later be able to impart that to the crew, the film's directors and producers decided to have character leads and supervising animators on specific characters. First-time character lead Becky Bresee serves as the supervising animator for Anna. She described her job as [...] "making the character more believable". To achieve this, she had to act out part of a sequence in the movie between Anna and Kristoff {{for a number of}} times, each of them emphasizing the character's gestures differently. [...] "Anna's a little bit nervous and uncomfortable, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to put that into the animation," [...] explained Bresee.|$|E

500|$|Prokofiev's {{task was}} not straightforward; the film's 15 minutes of musical {{material}} was fragmentary, and scored {{for a small}} chamber orchestra. According to Prokofiev's own account, producing the suite was [...] "a devilish job", which, he said, [...] "gave me much more trouble than the music for the film itself, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the proper form, re-orchestrate the whole thing, polish it up and even combine some of the themes." [...] He wanted the suite to appeal to Soviet audiences hearing concert music for the first time. In an article in Izvestia in 1934 he wrote of such music: [...] "Above all, it must be melodious; moreover the melody must be simple and comprehensible without being repetitive or trivial... The simplicity should not be an old-fashioned simplicity but a new simplicity". He worked quickly, and had finished the piece by 8 July 1934. Because it was published (Op. 60) by his regular music publisher in Paris, the French form of [...] "Kijé" [...] rather than the Russian [...] "Kizhe" [...] was adopted in the work's title.|$|E
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to}} do that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1978 Forster's first {{recorded}} work was the group's debut single, [...] "Lee Remick", {{which appeared in}} September. It was a paean to the Hollywood actress of the same name. Forster later recalled [...] "I didn't have a girlfriend or any sort of romantic side to my life ... I {{wanted to write a}} love song. But who was I in love with? No-one. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> someone and I found Lee Remick". He also wrote the B-side, [...] "Karen", as an ode to the university's library staff, [...] "here was kindness in the library, then you walk out of the library into the harsh real world". Forster then wrote their second single, [...] "People Say". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, both singles were [...] "sparsely produced, poorly played yet passionately performed folksy, post-punk pop songs. They were sunny, catchy and hopelessly romantic, earning the band immediate local and international acclaim".|$|E

2500|$|The work of Abramović and Ulay {{tested the}} {{physical}} {{limits of the}} body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramović herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramović/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: [...] "The main problem in this relationship was {{what to do with the}} two artists' egos. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{everything}} about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found {{by many to be}} laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal Pandore wrote about [...] "that English candour which allows everything to be expressed and everything to be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama". Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him [...] "what I was searching for, what I lacked, what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> [...] actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes".|$|E
2500|$|Piss Flowers {{is a work}} made up {{of twelve}} sculptures that Chadwick made while on a {{residency}} at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta, Canada, in February 1991. During their stay, she and her partner, David Notarius travelled to different locations, made mounds of snow and laid out a flower shaped metal cutter. They would take turns to urinate in the snow then pour plaster into the cavities. These casts were attached to pedestals that {{were based on a}} hyacinth bulb. The whole thing was then cast in bronze and enamelled white. The works are a result of her physical contact with the location, preserving a direct impact of reality. Chadwick describes the flowers as a [...] "metaphysical conceit for the union of two people expressing themselves bodily". The work utilises the pleasure of taboo; elevating the medium of urine that is generally regarded as polluting and marginal in a dynamic and playful way. [...] "It may have been mischievous to piss in the snow, but it was damn hard work to end up with the 12 bronzes," [...] Chadwick recalled. [...] "Piss Flowers took two years, largely because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> [...] £12,000 to make them". The artist [...] "sold herself" [...] to make a programme about Frida Kahlo for the BBC in order to fund the work.|$|E
