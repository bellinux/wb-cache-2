The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin crystal structure.

5|$|Within a {{short time}} after the 1888 Act, Worcestershire's {{northern}} external boundaries began to alter (See <b>Fig</b> <b>3).</b> The district of Balsall Heath, which had originally constituted the most northerly part of the Parish of King's Norton, was the first area of the county {{to be added to}} the newly designated City of Birmingham on 1 October 1891. This was followed by the small island of Edvin Loach near Bromyard, which was transferred to Herefordshire in 1893. Two years following the loss of Edvin Loach, the county gained the parish of Upper Arley, which was a Staffordshire parish nearly surrounded by Worcestershire and Shropshire (See Fig 2). Oldberrow parish, which was situated in the north east Worcestershire border area was transferred to Warwickshire County Council jurisdiction during 1896.|$|E

25|$|Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index {{can take}} non-integer values, {{indicating}} that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does. For instance, a curve with fractal dimension very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves quite {{like an ordinary}} line, but a curve with fractal dimension 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface. Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume. This general relationship {{can be seen in}} the two images of fractal curves in Fig.2 and <b>Fig.</b> <b>3</b> – the 32-segment contour in Fig. 2, convoluted and space filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3,</b> which has a fractal dimension of 1.26.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of PA {{was the first}} to be determined (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3).</b> This structure and that of its cellular receptor shed much light on the specificity of recognition and binding. This specificity of PA and the receptor CMG2 (similar to type I integins) is due to interactions through a metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a hydrophobic groove, and a β-hairpin projection. These all contribute to a tight interaction in which much protein surface area on CMG2 (and TEM8) is buried.|$|E
30|$|As {{evident from}} <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> and 4, the {{seismicity}} parameter maps before, and after, declustering provide comparable results. The magnitude of completeness maps {{show that it}} is around Mn = 2.5 for inner parts of the Plateau and about Mn = 3.0 for outer parts (<b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> (a) and 4 (a)). The a-value maps (<b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> (b) and 4 (b)) indicate that values generally larger than 4.5 that may be taken as high seismicity rates in the Persian Plateau and surrounding area. The b-value estimations are about 0.8 to 0.9 for inner regions, and lower than 0.8 for outer regions, of this Plateau (<b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> (c) and 4 (c)). Based on <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> (d) and 4 (d) that represent significant b-value maps according to Wiemer and Schorlemmer (2007) the b-values are generally lower than unity {{and there is no}} significant difference between b-values. The lower b-values in some regions indicate that the seismic energy release in these areas is mostly provided by large magnitude earthquakes. Yet the b-value around northern Central-Iran and Eastern Alborz seems to be near unity which implies that the seismic energy release is compatible for larger and smaller earthquakes.|$|R

25|$|Time encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (TEFD-OCT, or swept source OCT) tries to combine {{some of the}} advantages of standard TD and SEFD-OCT. Here the spectral components are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in time. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier-transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see <b>Fig.</b> <b>3)</b> becomes simpler than SEFD, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference-arm into the TEFD-OCT light source.|$|E
25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3.</b> It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E
25|$|The phonetic map is hypermodal or multimodal: The {{activation}} of a phonetic item {{at the level}} of the phonetic map coactivates (i) a phonemic state (see phonemic link weights in Fig. 7), (ii) a motor plan state (see motor plan link weights in Fig. 7), (iii) an auditory state (see auditory link weights in Fig. 7), and (iv) a somatosensory state (not shown in Fig. 7).

500|$|The chanonry, {{referred}} to in the cathedral's chartulary as the college of the chanonry or simply as the college, was the collection of the canons' manses that were grouped around the cathedral. A substantial wall, over [...] high, [...] thick and around [...] in length, enclosed the cathedral and manses and separated the church community from the laity; only the manse of Rhynie lay outside the west wall. The houses of 17vicars and the many chaplains were also situated outside the west wall. The wall had four gates: the West Port gave access to the burgh, the North Port provided access to the road to the bishop's palace of Spynie, the South Port opened opposite the hospital of Maison Dieu and the surviving East or Panns Port allowed access to the meadowland called Le Pannis. The Panns Port illustrates the portcullis defences of the gate-houses (Fig. 1). Each canon or dignitary was responsible for providing his own manse and was built to reflect his status within the chapter. [...] The castle having become unsuitable, Edward I of England stayed at the manse of Duffus on 10 and 11 September 1303 as did James II in 1455. In 1489, a century after the incendiary attack on the cathedral and precinct in 1390 and 1402, the cathedral records revealed a chanonry still lacking many of its manses. The chapter ordered that 13canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately [...] "erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557.

40|$|Strength of {{the apple}} parts has been noticed to decrease, {{especially}} those installed by the new induction heating system since the LEP campaign started. Fig. 1 shows the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), and elongation of the installed or installation-simulated apples on various systems. One can clearly see the mean values of UTS and YS of the post-LEP parts decreased by about 8 ksi and 6 ksi respectively {{from those of the}} pre-LEP parts. The slight increase in elongation seen in Fig. 1 can be understood from the weak inverse relationship between the strength and elongation in metals. Fig. 2 shows the weak correlation between the YS and elongation of the parts listed in Fig. 1. Strength data listed in Figure 1 were re-plotted as histograms in <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> and 4. <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> a and 4 a show histograms of all UTS and YS data. <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> b and 4 b shows histograms of pre-LEP data and <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> c and 4 c of post-LEP data. Data on statistical scatter of tensile strengths have been rarely published by material suppliers. Instead, only the minimum 'guaranteed' strength data are typically presented. An example of strength distribution of aluminum 7075 -T 6 sheet material, listed in Fig. 5, show that its scatter width of both UTS and YS for a single sheet can be about 6 ksi and for multi-lot scatter can be as large as 11 ksi even though the sheets have been produced through well-controlled manufacturing process. By approximating the histograms shown in <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> and 4 by a Gaussian or similar type of distribution curves, one can plausibly see the strength reductions in the later or more recent apples. The pre-LEP data in <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> b and 4 b show wider scatter than the post-LEP data in <b>Figs.</b> <b>3</b> c and 4 c and seem to follow the binomial distribution of strength indicating that the apples might have been made from two different lots of material, either from two different vendors or from two different melts of perhaps slightly different chemical composition by a single vendor. The post-LEP apples seem to have been from a single batch of material. The pre-LEP apples of the weak strength and the post-LEP apples with even weaker strength could have been made of the same batch of material, and the small strength differential might be due to the difference in the induction heating system. If the pre-LEP apples with the lower strength and the post LEP apples are made from the same batch of material, their combined scatter of strength data would be wider and can be understood {{as a result of the}} additional processing steps of stress relief and induction heating as discussed...|$|R
