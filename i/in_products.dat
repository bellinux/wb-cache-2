5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead <b>in</b> <b>products</b> {{has greatly}} reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed <b>in</b> <b>products</b> in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lead can {{be found}} <b>in</b> <b>products</b> such as kohl, an ancient {{cosmetic}} from the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa that has many names; and from some toys. In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled from multiple countries owing to safety hazards including lead paint. Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead.|$|E
5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions of lead <b>in</b> <b>products</b> and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It {{was not until the}} second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. During the end of the 20th century, the blood lead levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. Blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.|$|E

5|$|Although {{marketers}} typically avoid promoting adult-oriented {{films to}} reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including Coors, Amazon, and Verizon FiOS, which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through Fandango, and placed promotional material <b>in</b> <b>products</b> shipped to customers; {{this was the first}} time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released a series of Prometheus action figures in September 2012. A book, Prometheus: The Art of the Film, containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used <b>in</b> <b>products</b> such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead <b>in</b> <b>products</b> such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E
