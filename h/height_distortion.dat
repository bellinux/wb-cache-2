40|$|Studies {{that have}} used mostly {{self-reported}} height {{have found that}} men with a same-sex orientation and women with an other-sex orientation are shorter, on average, than men with an other-sex orientation and women with a same-sex orientation, respectively. This thesis examined whether an objective height difference exists or whether a psychosocial account (e. g., distortion of self-reports) may explain these putative height differences. Also, this thesis examined whether certain individual differences (e. g, gender roles and socially desirable responding) predict <b>height</b> <b>distortion.</b> Eight hundred and thirteen participants, recruited at Brock University, the Niagara Community and through surrounding LGBT events, completed self-reported height, measures of gender roles and socially desirable responding, and had their height measured. Using hierarchical linear regressions, {{it was found that}} Same-Sex/Both-Sex Oriented men were shorter, on average, than predominantly Other-Sex Oriented men; however, {{there was no difference in}} objective height between Same-Sex/Both-Sex Oriented women and predominantly Other-Sex Oriented women. These findings contribute to existing biological theories of men's sexual orientation development and do not contribute to biological theories of women's sexual orientation development. <b>Height</b> <b>distortion</b> was not related to sexual orientation and only marginally related to sex. Predictors of <b>height</b> <b>distortion</b> were Impression Management, in both men and women, and Unmitigated Agency, in men. These findings highlight the complexity of sexual orientation development in men and women. These findings also highlight the role of certain psychosocial factors in how people perceive their bodies and/or how they want their bodies to be perceived by others...|$|E
40|$|In {{capillary}} electrophoresis separations coupled to NMR signal detection using small solenoidal coils, electrophoretic currents cause substantial distortion in the NMR spectral linewidths and peak <b>heights,</b> <b>distortions</b> which cannot be fully counteracted through shimming. The NMR spectra {{also have a}} low signal-to-noise ratio due to the small amounts of material, typically < 1 nmol, associated with such microseparations. This study proposes a two-step, signal processing method to restore spectral lines from the distorted NMR spectrum. First, a reference signal is acquired to estimate the broadening function, as a combination of several Lorentzian functions, using a gradient descent method. Then multi-resolution wavelet analysis {{is applied to the}} distorted spectrum to determine an initial estimate of the frequencies of the spectral lines. Convergence to the final spectrum, a second set of Lo-rentzians, involves deconvolution with the estimated broadening function using a gradient descent method. Experimental CE-NMR data show that considerable improvements in spectral quality are possible using this approach, although fine splittings can not be resolved if the broadening function is large...|$|R

40|$|Ratios {{have been}} applied to humans to {{identify}} individuals from images. These attempts have been proven unsuccessful, as camera angle, <b>height,</b> and <b>distortions</b> of the image affected the results. The anharmonic ratio is a ratio of ratios; it has proved successful {{in the identification of}} objects from images, as it is not affected by any distortions. The anharmonic ratio was applied to the human body and face to identify individuals from their images. Faces and bodies of twenty South Australian males aged 16 – 65 years were measured using standard anthropometric techniques. Participants were photographed in high quality images and recorded by standard surveillance camera (low quality images). Ten ratios were calculated from manual measurements and from all images. An Euclidean distance showed ratios incorrectly identified individuals 64. 3 % of the time between images of different quality. Variation of ratios between individuals is low so that standard deviations of ratios are of the magnitude similar to technical errors of measurements. Therefore participants cannot be isolated based on ratios. Ratios are an unreliable method for identification...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} application of the AISC Direct Analysis Method for stability bracing design of columns, beams, beam-columns and frames. Emphasis is placed on out-of-plane flange bracing design in metal building frame systems. Potential improvements and extensions to the 2005 AISC Appendix 6 stability bracing provisions are studied and evaluated. The structural attributes considered include various general conditions encountered in practical metal building design: unequal brace spacing, unequal brace stiffness, nonprismatic member geometry, variable axial load or bending moment along the member length, cross-section double or single symmetry, combined bending and axial load, combined torsional and lateral bracing from girts/purlins with or without diagonal braces from these components to the inside flanges, load <b>height,</b> cross-section <b>distortion,</b> and non-rigid end boundary conditions. The research addresses both the simplification to basic bracing design rules as well as direct computation for more complex cases. The primary goal is improved assessment of the demands on flange bracing systems in metal building frames. M. S.

Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) {{is regarded as a}} model virus and is widely studied, due to it contributes to plant pathology and economic importance. The symptoms of TMV infection include leaf <b>distortion,</b> <b>height</b> reduction, fruit deformation and low germination percent of seeds in tobacco. TMV is responsible for devastating diseases in major agricultural crops, including vegetables and tobacco, which leads to serious damage and enormous economic loss [2]. So far few effective anti-TMV agents are highly efficient. Therefore, low-priced agents that can control such diseases effectively are in great need.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{strongly}} writhing confined solar eruptions suggests an {{origin in the}} helical kink instability of a coronal flux rope which remains stable against the torus instability. This model is tested against the well observed filament eruption on 2002 May 27 in a parametric MHD simulation study which comprises all phases of the event. Good agreement with the essential observed properties is obtained. These include the confinement, terminal <b>height,</b> writhing, <b>distortion,</b> and dissolution of the filament, and the flare loops. The agreement is robust against variations in a representative range of parameter space. Careful comparisons with the observation data constrain {{the ratio of the}} external toroidal and poloidal field components to B_et/B_ep≈ 1 and the initial flux rope twist to Φ≈ 4 π. Different from ejective eruptions, two distinct phases of strong magnetic reconnection can occur. First, the erupting flux is cut by reconnection with overlying flux in the helical current sheet formed by the instability. If the resulting flux bundles are linked {{as a consequence of the}} erupting rope's strong writhing, they subsequently reconnect in the vertical current sheet between them. This reforms the overlying flux and a far less twisted flux rope, offering a pathway to homologous eruptions. Comment: Astrophys. J., accepte...|$|R

40|$|The Far Ultraviolet (FUV) {{detector}} on the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{is subject}} {{to a variety of}} distortions due to its analog nature. Thermal variations of the detector and electronics stretch and shift the active area. Geometric distortions on a range of spatial scales warp the two-dimensional spectral image. Changes due to detector walk - the dependence of detected position on pulse <b>height</b> - add <b>distortions</b> that change as a function of time. The calcos calibration pipeline includes corrections for each of these effects in the calibrated spectra, but these are imperfect, and they do not help with the target acquisition process, which uses raw detector coordinates. We discuss these distortions and their effect on the data, our attempts to mitigate them, the current pipeline corrections and their success at removing the effects, and possible modifications to improve the data quality in the future. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Distortions of {{body image}} {{have often been}} {{investigated}} in clinical disorders. Much of this literature implicitly assumes healthy adults maintain an accurate body image. We recently developed a novel, implicit, and quantitative measure of body image – the Body Image Task (BIT). Here, we report a large-scale analysis of performance on this task by healthy adults. In both an in-person and online version of the BIT, participants were presented with {{an image of a}} head as an anchoring stimulus on a computer screen, and told to imagine that the head was part of a mirror image of themselves in a standing position. They were then instructed to judge where, relative to the head, each of several parts of their body would be located. The relative positions of each landmark can be used to construct an implicit perceptual map of bodily structure. We could thus measure the internally-stored body image, although we cannot exclude contributions from other representations. Our results show several distortions of body image. First, we found a large and systematic over-estimation of width relative to <b>height.</b> These <b>distortions</b> were similar for both males and females, and did not closely track the idiosyncrasies of individual participant’s own bodies. Comparisons of individual body parts showed that participants overestimated the width of their shoulders and the length of their upper arms, relative to their height, while underestimating the lengths of their lower arms and legs. Principal components analysis showed a clear spatial structure to the distortions, suggesting spatial organisation and segmentation of the body image into upper and lower limb components that are bilaterally integrated. These results provide new insight into the body image of healthy adults, and have implications for the study and rehabilitation of clinical populations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the effect of physiological measurements of users, especially the elderly, {{with regard to the}} design of the chair. Firstly, based on the measurements of center-of-gravity (CG) distortion when standing up, the design of the chair is created with consideration to the relation of the <b>height.</b> CG <b>distortion</b> increases with age, and this phenomenon is pronounced in the elderly, especially when they stand up from the lower seat, indicating that this design requires careful attention. Secondly, CG distortion and the working area while sitting are measured. The CG decreases at a 25 - 30 cm difference in height between a table and a chair. In this position, the working area is large. Several observations in this experiment have shown that a 25 - 30 cm difference in height between a table and a chair is ideal when at the working position. This observation applies to all age brackets. Thirdly, buttock-popliteal length and angles of trunk and thigh in sitting position are measured to decide the size and the form of the seat. Finally, 3 types of chairs are made based on the results to explore the subject in detail. Also, an electromyogram (EMG) is recorded to compare muscle fatigue with the 3 types chairs. A tendency for a type of the chair that supports the thigh, which leads to a lower EMG reading, is found, suggesting the possibility that the form of the chair can have a direct influence on muscle fatigue when sitting. In conclusion, based upon these experiments, various tendencies are recognized. As well, a good prospect, which addresses the particular needs of the elderly users of the chair at work, is identified. Furthermore, the data from this study should help more informed decisions to be made with regard to overall measurements, the size of individual parts, and the form relating to the design of the chair at work.

40|$|There is the {{separation}} and reattachment process generated in {{or around the}} fluid machinery, as a significant factor to affect the energy efficiency of the fluid machinery in the low Reynolds number. It is important to control the separating and reattaching flow in a backward facing step flow in low Reynolds number. In the present study, a synthetic jet is employed as actuator because the acceptability of the frequency in the separating shear layer was confirmed in the previous study. The orifice of the synthetic jet is placed discretely in the spanwise direction. The effect of the orifice pitch on the spanwise uniformity of the reattachment process is investigated. The normalized pitch by the orifice diameter ranges from 10 to 40. In the orifice pitch range of 10 to 30, {{it is confirmed that}} the flow of the reattachment point on the lower wall has the two-dimensional structure in spite of the three-dimensional disturbance by the synthetic jets.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} online Min-cost Perfect Matching with Delays (MPMD) recently introduced by Emek et al, (STOC 2016). This problem is defined on an underlying n-point metric space. An adversary presents real-time requests online at points of the metric space, and the algorithm is required to match them, possibly after keeping them waiting for some time. The cost incurred {{is the sum of}} the distances between matched pairs of points (the connection cost), and the sum of the waiting times of the requests (the delay cost). We present an algorithm with a competitive ratio of O(n), which improves the upper bound of O(^ 2 n+Δ) of Emek et al, by removing the dependence on Δ, the aspect ratio of the metric space (which can be unbounded as a function of n). The core of our algorithm is a deterministic algorithm for MPMD on metrics induced by edge-weighted trees of height h, whose cost is guaranteed to be at most O(1) times the connection cost plus O(h) times the delay cost of every feasible solution. The reduction from MPMD on arbitrary metrics to MPMD on trees is achieved using the result on embedding n-point metric spaces into distributions over weighted hierarchically separated trees of <b>height</b> O(n), with <b>distortion</b> O(n). We also prove a lower bound of Ω(√(n)) on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm. This is the first lower bound which increases with n, and is attained on the metric of n equally spaced points on a line. The problem of Min-cost Bipartite Perfect Matching with Delays (MBPMD) is the same as MPMD except that every request is either positive or negative, and requests can be matched only if they have opposite polarity. We prove an upper bound of O(n) and a lower bound of Ω(^ 1 / 3 n) on the competitive ratio of MBPMD with a more involved analysis...|$|R
40|$|Three new Dy {{complexes}} {{have been}} prepared according to a complex-as-ligand strategy. Structural determinations indicate that the central Dy ion is surrounded by two LZn units (L 2 - is the di-deprotonated form of the N 2 O 2 compartmental N,N- 2, 2 -dimethylpropylenedi(3 -methoxysalicylideneiminato) Schiff base. The Dy ions are nonacoordinate to eight oxygen atoms from the two L ligands and to a water molecule. The Zn ions are pentacoordinate in all cases, linked to the N 2 O 2 atoms from L, and the apical position of the Zn coordination sphere is occupied by a water molecule or bromide or chloride ions. These resulting complexes, formulated (LZnX) -Dy-(LZnX), are tricationic with X=H 2 O and monocationic with X=Br or Cl. They behave as field-free single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with effective energy barriers (U-eff) for the reversal of the magnetization of 96. 9 (6) K with (0) = 2. 4 x 10 (- 7) s, 146. 8 (5) K with (0) = 9. 2 x 10 (- 8) s, and 146. 1 (10) K with (0) = 9. 9 x 10 (- 8) s for compounds with ZnOH 2, ZnBr, and ZnCl motifs, respectively. The Cole-Cole plots exhibit semicircular shapes with parameters {{in the range of}} 0. 19 to 0. 29, which suggests multiple relaxation processes. Under a dc applied magnetic field of 1000 Oe, the quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) is partly or fully suppressed and the energy barriers increase to U-eff= 128. 6 (5) K and (0) = 1. 8 x 10 (- 8) s for 1, U-eff= 214. 7 K and (0) = 9. 8 x 10 (- 9) s for 2, and U-eff= 202. 4 K and (0) = 1. 5 x 10 (- 8) s for 3. The two pairs of largely negatively charged phenoxido oxygen atoms with short DyO bonds are positioned at opposite sides of the Dy 3 + ion, which thus creates a strong crystal field that stabilizes the axial M-J=+/- 15 / 2 doublet as the ground Kramers doublet. Although the compound with the ZnOH 2 motifs possesses the larger negative charges on the phenolate oxygen atoms, as confirmed by using DFT calculations, it exhibits the larger distortions of the DyO 9 coordination polyhedron from ideal geometries and a smaller U-eff value. Ab initio calculations support the easy-axis anisotropy of the ground Kramers doublet and predict zero-field SMM behavior through Orbach and TA-QTM relaxations via the first excited Kramers doublet, which leads to large energy barriers. In accordance with the experimental results, ab initio calculations have also shown that, compared with water, the peripheral halide ligands coordinated to the Zn 2 + ions increase the barrier <b>height</b> when the <b>distortions</b> of the DyO 9 have a negative effect. All the complexes exhibit metal-centered luminescence after excitation into the UV -* absorption band of ligand L 2 - at = 335 nm, which results in the appearance of the characteristic Dy-III ((F 9 / 2 HJ/ 2) -F- 4 -H- 6; J= 15 / 2, 13 / 2) emission bands in the visible region...|$|R
