This experiment assessed the role of response-produced <b>key</b> <b>offset</b> as a possible conditioned positive reinforcer of keypecking. Pigeons responded in a substantial proportion of the trials (50 %– 66 %) on a procedure in which key illumination coterminated with reinforcer availability, and in which keypecks prevented reinforcement but did not extinguish the keylight. Thus, the notion that negative automaintenance keypecking {{is a function of}} conditioned positive reinforcement must be rejected...|$|E
40|$|International carbon {{offsetting}} {{can help reduce}} compliance costs in emissions trading schemes {{and at the same}} time support carbon mitigation projects in developing countries. A surprising observation from the European Union Emissions Trading System's experience with offsetting is that companies do not fully utilise offsetting for compliance despite the cost advantage in doing so. However, so far ther ehas been limited research evaluating what factors influence companies' decisions to utilise offsets. This paper fills this gap by investigating the demand for carbon offsets in tradable permit emissions markets. To do so, we use detailed firm-level data on 279 companies regulated under the EU ETS during 2008 - 2012. Our findings suggest that there are clear sectoral differences and that, contrary to expectations, transaction costs and over-allocation of free allowances are not the key determining factors. We find some evidence to support the existence of ‘insetting', that is, companies with subsidiaries in <b>key</b> <b>offset</b> countries are more likely to use a larger share of their offset allowance for compliance. Semi-structured interviews with companies supported these findings...|$|E

40|$|ZigBee {{technology}} {{was developed for}} a wireless personal area networks (PAN), aimed at control and military applications with low data rate and low power consumption. This thesis is mainly focusing on development of Matlab/Simulink model for ZigBee transceiver at physical layer using IEEE 802. 15. 4. ZigBee is a low-cost, low-power, wireless mesh networking standard. First, the low cost allows the technology to be widely deployed in wireless control and monitoring applications. Second, the low power-usage allows longer life with smaller batteries. Third, the mesh networking provides high reliability and more extensive range. The work presented here is to show how we can implement ZigBee transceiver with its specifications by using Matlab/simulink, without using complex mathematical blocks. A ZigBee chip can tested and prepared by shifting the whole work from matlab environment to cadance environment. This {{can be done by}} HDL languages like Verilog HDL. Here, Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modulation technique is described, an analysis of which shows that the theoretical maximum bandwidth efficiency of MSK is 2 bits/s/Hz which is same as for Quadrature Phase Shift <b>Keying</b> (QPSK) and <b>Offset</b> Quadrature Phase Shift <b>Keying</b> (<b>Offset</b> QPSK). The implementation clearly confirms the viability of theoritical approach. Results show that OQPSK modulation with half sine pulse shaping is perfectly employed ZigBee technology. ...|$|R
40|$|Design of {{text entry}} on small screen devices, e. g. smartwatches, faces two related challenges: trading off a {{reasonably}} sized keyboard area against space {{to display the}} entered text and the concern over "fat fingers". This paper investigates tap accuracy and revisits layered interfaces to explore a novel layered text entry method. A two part user study identifies preferred typing and reading tilt angles and then investigates variants of a tilting layered keyboard against a standard layout. We show good typing speed (29 wpm) and very high accuracy on the standard layout – contradicting fears of fat-fingers limiting watch text-entry. User feedback is positive towards tilting interaction and we identify ~ 14 ° tilt as a comfortable typing angle. However, layering resulted in slightly slower and more erroneous entry. The paper contributes new data on tilt angles and <b>key</b> <b>offsets</b> for smartwatch text entry and supporting evidence for the suitability of QWERTY on smartwatches...|$|R

40|$|A multiple-bit differential-detection {{method has}} been {{proposed}} for the reception of radio signals modulated with <b>offset</b> quadrature phase-shift <b>keying</b> (<b>offset</b> QPSK or OQPSK). The method is also applicable to other spectrally efficient offset quadrature modulations. This method is based partly on the same principles as those of a multiple-symbol differential-detection method for M-ary QPSK, which includes QPSK (that is, non-offset QPSK) as a special case. That method was introduced {{more than a decade}} ago by the author of the present method as a means of improving performance relative to a traditional (two-symbol observation) differential-detection scheme. Instead of symbol-by-symbol detection, both that method and the present one are based on a concept of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE). As applied to the modulations in question, MLSE involves consideration of (1) all possible binary data sequences that could have been received during an observation time of some number, N, of symbol periods and (2) selection of the sequence that yields the best match to the noise-corrupted signal received during that time. The performance of the prior method was shown to range from that of traditional differential detection for short observation times (small N) to that of ideal coherent detection (with differential encoding) for long observation times (large N) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn recent work, Bellare, Hoang, and Keelveedhi (CRYPTO 2013) {{introduced}} a new abstraction called Universal Computational Extractors (UCEs), and showed how they can replace random oracles (ROs) across {{a wide range of}} cryptosystems. We formulate a new framework, called Interactive Computational Extractors (ICEs), that extends UCEs by viewing them as models of ROs under unpredictable (aka. high-entropy) queries. We overcome a number of limitations of UCEs in the new framework, and in particular prove the adaptive RKA and semi-adaptive KDM securities of a highly efficient symmetric encryption scheme using ICEs under <b>key</b> <b>offsets.</b> We show both negative and positive feasibility results for ICEs. On the negative side, we demonstrate ICE attacks on the HMAC and NMAC constructions. On the positive side we show that: 1) ROs are indeed ICE secure, thereby confirming the structural soundness of our definition and enabling a finer layered approach to protocol design in the RO model; and 2) a modified version of Liskov's Zipper Hash is ICE secure with respect to an underlying fixed-input-length RO, for appropriately restricted classes of adversaries. This brings the first result closer to practice by moving away from variable-input-length ROs. Our security proofs employ techniques from indifferentiability in multi-stage settings...|$|R

Based on the representations of OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK as trellis-coded modulations, we investigate the potential coding gains achievable from the application of simple outer codes to form a concatenated coding structure with iterative decoding. For MIL-STD SOQPSK, we describe the optimum receiver corresponding to its trellis-coded modulation form and then propose a simplified receiver. The bit-error-rate (BER) performances of both receivers for uncoded and coded MIL-STD SOQPSK are simulated and compared to those of OQPSK and Feher-patented quadrature phase-shift keying (FQPSK).
