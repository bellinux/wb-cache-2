Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes do not rely upon either changes in gene expression or changes in protein synthesis to control the cell cycle. This probably explains why they do not have similar proteins to those used by eukaryotes to control their cell cycle, such as cdk1. This has led to research on what the control mechanism is in prokaryotes. Recent evidence suggests that it may be membrane- or lipid-based.|$|E

In this study, we evaluated a stem cell media and a perivascular cell-specific media for {{the culture of}} primary perivascular cells regarding their cell morphology, doubling time, stem cell properties, and expression of cell type-specific markers. When the two cell culture media were compared to each other, perivascular cells cultured in the stem cell medium had a more elongated morphology and a faster <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> and cells cultured in the pericyte medium had a more typical morphology, with several filopodia, and a slower <b>doubling</b> <b>rate.</b> To evaluate stem cell properties, perivascular cells, CD 146 − cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were differentiated into the adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. It was seen that perivascular cells, as well as CD 146 − cells and MSCs, cultured in stem cell medium showed greater differentiation than cells cultured in pericyte-specific medium. The expression of pericyte-specific markers CD 146, neural/glial antigen 2 (NG 2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), myosin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) {{could be found in}} both pericyte cultures, as well as to varying amounts in CD 146 − cells, MSCs, and endothelial cells. The here presented work shows that perivascular cells can adapt to their in vitro environment and cell culture conditions influence cell functionality, such as <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> or differentiation behavior. Pericyte-specific markers were shown to be expressed also from cells other than perivascular cells. We can further conclude that CD 146 + perivascular cells are inhomogeneous cell population probably containing stem cell subpopulations, which are located perivascular around capillaries...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of Lithopanspermia {{investigations}} have been performed to investigate the ability of different organisms to resist scenarios of the natural interplanetary transfer of life from a donor planet (host planet) to an acceptor planet. Whereas {{the main focus of}} previous studies was on the resistance of bacteria and their colony forming capacity after space exposure, only a few experiments on eukaryotic microorganisms and especially on symbiotic organization forms such as lichens, have been performed in space (de la Torre et. al. 2007, Sancho et al. 2007). These experiments have concentrated on photosynthesis analysis as a first step to understand the maintenance of physiologic activity of eukaryotic organisms after exposure to space conditions. As a next step, physiologic activity, reproduction capacity and “healthy” cell structures as essential parts of vitality check were analyzed after the last ESA experiment on BIOPAN- 6 on Foton M 3. Besides the examination of photosynthetic activity determination by use of chlorophyll a-fluorescence, CLSM analysis by the use of LIVE/DEAD staining dyes and culture experiments for verification of germination and growth capacity of both of the lichen symbionts (alga and fungi), were performed. In this case, new results are now clearly emphasizing quantitatively the high survival capacity and maintenance of germination and growth capacity of both of the investigated symbionts which form the epilithic lichen species of Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, although they were exposed to harsh space conditions with an exposure time of 10 days. About 80 % to 90 % of ascospores of both of the analyzed lichens were able to germinate and to grow into well-developed mycelia. In detail: results of germination and growth capacity analysis of ascospores of the lichen X. elegans have shown no damage on growth behavior, if compared to the control analysis, differing only in the starting point of germination, which is about 1 to 2 days earlier than under control conditions (1 to 2 days after sporulation instead of 2 to 4 days). Results of analysis on ascospores of R. geographicum indicate an important role of desiccation for successful germination. Without the vacuum treatment in space, the control samples were not able to germinate. This implicates the necessity of very dry conditions for the break down of ascosporic cell walls to foster the ability of germination, what can be expected also in natural habitats (high mountain regions). Analyses on the growth multiplication factor of photobiont cells (alga) are indicating a higher degree of space influence on X. elegans. Photobiont cells of R. geographicum maintained their <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> of about 12 days compared to control conditions, whereas the <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> of photobiont cells of X. elegans was seriously affected after space exposure, showing a severe retardation (control conditions: <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> (d r) = 7 days, after space exposure: d r = 12 days) ...|$|E

We give a quantum extension of this approach for gambling over the measurement outcomes of tensor product states. Under certain parameters of the gambling setup, one can give operational meaning of von Neumann entropies. We discuss two variants of gambling when a helper is available and it is shown that the difference in their doubling rates is the quantum discord.

40|$|Mutant {{strains of}} the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are {{available}} which divide at smaller mean sizes than wild type. Earlier work by the present authors has shown that all these strains <b>double</b> their <b>rates</b> of polyadenylated messenger RNA synthesis as a step once in each cell cycle. The smaller the cell, the later in the cycle is the <b>doubling</b> in <b>rate</b> of synthesis. Strains of all sizes, however, <b>double</b> their synthetic <b>rate</b> when at the same threshold size. We show here that the differences in cell cycle stage of <b>doubling</b> in <b>rate</b> of polyadenylated messenger RNA synthesis are enough to explain the reduced mean steady state polyadenylated messenger RNA contents of the smaller strains. The cell size-related control over <b>doubling</b> in <b>rate</b> of synthesis is also shown to maintain the mean polyadenylated messenger RNA content as a constant propor-tion of cell mass, irrespective of cell size. This control thus allows cells to maintain balanced exponential growth, even when absolute growth rate per cell is altered by mutation. It is also shown that the concentration of polyadenylated messenger RNA itself could act as a monitor of the threshold size triggering the <b>doubling</b> in <b>rate</b> of synthesis in each cell cycle...|$|R

The biomolecules most often reported to be damaged by ionizing radiation are lipids and DNA. Dr. Boss has shown that cobinamide, a structural analogue of cobalamin (vitamin B 12), binds to superoxide anion in vitro. We now show that in cultured cells cobinamide can work as a possible therapeutic agent for radiation-induced injury. First, in HeLa cells cobinamide improved increased DNA synthesis {{by an average of}} 19 percent when given prior to irradiation, and 7 percent when given 24 hours post- irradiation. Secondly, in irradiated MDA MB- 231 cells, the <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> was 19 percent higher in cobinamide-treated cells than in non-treated cells. And finally, cells treated with cobinamide showed less fragmentation and blebbing following irradiation than non-treated cells.

The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing faster than {{any other type of}} cancer in white population worldwide, with a <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> every 10 - 20 years. So far, the only identified external risk factor for malignant melanoma is UV exposure. Elimination of photodamaged cells by apoptosis (programmed cell death) is essential to prevent tumor formation. Melanocytes are considered relatively resistant to apoptosis, however, the regulation of apoptosis in melanocytes is still unknown. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the apoptotic process following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in primary cultures of human melanocytes. Focus was on regulation of mitochondrial stability by Bcl- 2 family proteins and the possible participation of lysosomal proteases, cathepsins. UV irradiation activated the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, leading to cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. No change in protein expression of Bax and Bcl- 2 was observed in response to UV...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Deinococcus radiodurans, {{there is}} a unique RecQ homolog (DR 1289) with three-tandem HRDC domains. Deletion of drrecQ {{resulted}} in a low <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Here, we used cDNA microarray and biochemical assays to explore the physiological changes in the drrecQ mutant. The expressions of genes with predicted functions involved in iron homeostasis, antioxidant system, electron transport, and energy metabolism were significantly altered in response to drrecQ disruption. More reactive oxygen species (ROS) was accumulated in drrecQ mutant strain when compared to wild type. In addition, ICP-MS {{results showed that the}} intracellular level of iron was relatively higher, whereas the concentration of manganese was lower in drrecQ mutant than in wild type. Furthermore, our microarray data and pulsed-field gel results showed that DNA suffered more damage in drrecQ mutant than in wild type under 20  mM hydrogen peroxide stress. These results suggested that drrecQ is a gene of pleiotropic functions and contributes to the extraordinary resistance of D. radiodurans against stresses...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of three genera of epibionts on two Daphnia species was examined in two subalpine beaver ponds. Epibiont prevalence and burden were proportional to body length in both species of Daphnia, but {{varied between the}} two Daphnia species and among female Daphnia with parthenogenic eggs in different stages of development. The most common epibiont appeared to have a <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 d-l, but this rapid growth rate was insufficient to increase epibiont burdens on Daphnia in a pond where salamanders fed selectively on Daphnia serving as epibiont substrates.

The resulting data are high quality and reveal fundamental information regarding cellular dynamics. The phase diagram and discrete fast Fourier {{transformation of the}} dissolved O 2 values revealed a square waveform with at least eight harmonic peaks. Stepwise changes in temperature revealed that the oscillation was temperature compensated at temperatures ranging from 27 to 34 °C when either glucose (temperature quotient [Q 10] = 1. 02) or ethanol (Q 10 = 0. 82) {{was used as a}} carbon source. After alteration of the temperature beyond the temperature compensation region, phase coherence events for individual cells were quickly lost.

A one-step transition from 700 to 70 micromole quanta per square meter per second resulted in a reduction of <b>doubling</b> <b>rate</b> from 1. 1 to 0. 4 per day within 24 hours, followed by a slower accumulation of photosynthetic pigments, light harvesting antenna complexes, Photosystem II reaction centers and structural lipids that constitute the thylakoid membranes. Photoregulated changes in the biochemical composition of the thylakoid proteins and lipids were functionally accompanied by decreases in the minimal photosynthetic quantum requirement and photosynthetic capacity, {{and an increase in}} the minimal turnover time for in vivo electron transport from water to CO 2. Analysis of de novo synthesis of thylakoid membranes and proteins indicates that a high light to low light transition leads to a transient in carbon metabolism away from lipid biosynthesis toward the synthesis of the light harvesting antenna protein complexes, accompanied by a slower restoration rate of reaction centers and thylakoid membranes. This pattern of sequential synthesis of light harvesting complexes followed by reaction centers and membranes, appears to optimize light harvesting capabilities as cells adapt to low photon flux densities...|$|E

Tumour ploidy, DNA index and mitotic count were also assessed as was histological grade and type. Multiple biopsies from each tumour were obtained from 121 women. The median Tpot was 4. 0 days, median S-phase duration 12. 8 h and median adjusted labelling index 9. 8 %. Higher BrdUrd labelling was seen in patients who developed pelvic tumour recurrence following radiotherapy.
