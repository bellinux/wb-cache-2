5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave Captain America: The First Avenger a {{positive}} review, saying, [...] "Johnston has delivered a light, clever and deftly balanced adventure picture with real lump {{in the throat}} nostalgia, with Nazis – who make the best villains, and with loving references to Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times remarked, [...] "I enjoyed the movie. I appreciated the 1940s period settings and costumes, which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes. I admired the way that director Joe Johnston propelled the narrative. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of a broad story, rather than {{the impression of a}} series of sensational set pieces. If Marvel is wise, it will take this and Iron Man as its templates". A. O. Scott of The New York Times declared it [...] "pretty good fun".|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} system proved difficult to develop because computers {{of the time}} lacked power. Artificial intelligence was considered crucial, as the navigation and other aspects relied on it. According to co-designer Jonty Barnes, the team wanted the creatures complex without high computational costs. Healey {{came up with the}} idea of slapping creatures to make them work faster, and Barnes considered it a [...] "great game decision". A great deal of time was spent working on the user interface, and at one point the idea of having no interface was considered. Carter stated that the team tried to make the sounds atmospheric and industrial so players <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of power. Using others' 3D sound routines proved troublesome, so he and his colleague Tony Cox wrote their own. Dungeon Keeper uses lighting algorithms used in Magic Carpet, which provided effects such as fireballs lighting corridors.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I {{like the way he}} played it. ... I think he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor and he's got some good things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in Britain, Lloyd Webber {{teamed up}} with record company {{executive}} Colin Barlow, {{who has worked with}} the likes of Take That and Girls Aloud, having had 15 number ones and sold over 40 million albums as a producer, to help select the lucky six performers who will progress to the live shows. After seeing a number of entries sent into the BBC by the people, getting a [...] "fabulous look at people's living rooms" [...] as Norton said, we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of who may be the future qualifiers to the live shows. After a number of auditions and workshops, showing some potential qualifiers rehearsing at their homes and elsewhere, the final six qualifiers were finally introduced. They were five-piece [...] "man band" [...] the Emperors of Soul, twins Francine and Nicola Gleadall and soloists Damien Flood, Charlotte Finlay, Mark Evans and Jade Ewen.|$|E

6000|$|... "Eh, Oh, yes--the engagement. Yes, yes, yes! Yes--to be sure. Yes; very {{satisfactory}} {{in every}} respect. High time he settled down and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little <b>sense.</b> I {{put it to}} him straight. I cut off his allowance and made him stay at home. That made him think--lazy young devil!" ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Madison Taylor, {{an editor}} of Times-News, the serial has detractors and fans among the paper readers. Some dislike serials, some desire more humor and less intrigue. Some like it because [...] "it’s {{different}} than anything else" [...] Times-News publishes and [...] "it's also <b>got</b> <b>an</b> quirky <b>sense</b> of humor." ...|$|R
2500|$|On July 25, 2006, Colbert {{responded to}} {{television}} networks—specifically Fox News, NBC's The Today Show and ABC's Good Morning America—which took {{comments made by}} Florida Congressman Robert Wexler on The Colbert Report out of context (e.g.: [...] "I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do."). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he [...] "say some things that would really lose the election for [...] if [...] were contested." [...] Colbert criticized the major networks' morning news shows that featured the interview in a misleading and a negative light, by showing clips {{from many of the}} [...] "fluff" [...] pieces they favored instead of [...] "real" [...] news. Colbert subsequently told his viewers to [...] "vote Wexler, the man's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor, unlike, evidently, journalists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} the Titan's Training Camp in Clarksville & Nashville, Tennessee which started July 25. Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E

60|$|The sun {{had sunk}} behind the range, {{and the sky}} was green. In places the high white peaks were touched by fading pink; the snow that rolled down to the timber-line was blue. Mist floated about the pines by the river, but did not reach the hotel terrace, and the evening was warm. Looking down at the dark valley, one <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of space and height.|$|E
60|$|Kit {{liked the}} engine-room. The steady {{beat of the}} machine was soothing. One <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of order, {{measured}} effort and strength that matched the strain. Force was not wasted but sternly controlled. In the engine-room Macallister was another man, quiet, keen, concentrated, and Kit understood the Scots' satisfaction when all ran well. They sprang from a stock that counted rule and effort to be worth more than beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Wyndham, [...] "not much light. For a few hours, {{the glare}} was dazzling, {{but soon the}} shadow crept back from the bush and the fever-mist floated about the boat. On the creek and at the village, you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of gloom that never melted." [...] He paused and added with a smile: [...] "It's often {{like that in the}} tropics, and the gloom is not {{altogether}} physical." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sookie sees Dahlia as very [...] "direct in her judgement". She also {{mentions}} that Dahlia behaves [...] "regally" [...] {{in the company}} of the Queen Sophie-Anne.Dahlia is supremely confident in her strength, wits and lethality. She is usually very composed and has a violent, vengeful nature. Dahlia is seen smiling only rarely (usually before a good battle), but she has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>sense</b> of humor. Immediately after her husband's death she experiences difficulties with controlling her temper.|$|R
5000|$|The third use of {{the term}} Vicar of Christ appears in the 5th century, in a synod of bishops to refer to Pope Gelasius I. The {{theological}} connotations of the title <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pastoral <b>sense,</b> evoking the words of Christ to the Apostle Peter, regarded by the first Catholic Pope in John 21:16-17, [...] "Feed my lambs... Feed my sheep", so Christ made Peter his vicar and pastor with the responsibility to feed his flock (i.e. the Church) in his own place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't study too hard, and be {{sure and}} put your winter underclothes on {{as soon as the}} weather gets cool.

60|$|Yet Stannard was athletic, and at Parisian {{clubs and}} Swiss hotels men {{talked about his}} fencing and his {{exploits}} on the rocks. He was not a big man, but now his thin jacket was open, the moulding of his chest and the curve to his black silk belt were Greek. All the same, one rather <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of cultivation than strength; Stannard looked thoroughbred, and Jimmy was proud he was his friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not yet, {{he paints}} just like Pissarro. He hasn't found himself, but he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of colour {{and a sense}} of decoration. But that isn't the question. It's the feeling, and that he's got. He's behaved like a perfect cad to his wife and children, he's always {{behaving}} like a perfect cad; the way he treats the people who've helped him--and sometimes he's been saved from starvation merely by the kindness of his friends--is simply beastly. He just happens to be a great artist." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{understood}} that the main object of my trip to England was {{to find out whether}} the British people have any sense of humour. No doubt the Geographical Society had this investigation in mind in not paying my expenses. Certainly on my return I was at once assailed with the question on all sides, [...] "Have they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humour? Even if it is only a rudimentary sense, have they got it or have they not?" [...] I propose therefore to address myself to the answer to this question.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Salta, teams {{made their way}} to follow a series of Road Signs to locate the next clue, sending them to Aerodormo Gilberto Lavaque in Cafayate for the Roadblock, asking [...] "Who's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> great <b>sense</b> of direction?". One team member had to use a provided map to navigate to a skydiving drop zone; meanwhile, the other team member had to board an airplane and tandem skydive to that location. Once the team was reunited, the jump master gave them their next clue.|$|R
60|$|She had {{consented to}} the sale of their farm in Illinois with great reluctance, and, as Burke rode along on his load of furniture, he {{recalled}} it all very vividly, and it made him anxious to know her impression of his claim. As he took her position for <b>a</b> moment, he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>sense</b> of the loneliness and rawness of this new land which he had not felt before. The woman's point of view was so {{different from that of}} the adventurous man.|$|R
2500|$|UGO.com ranked him in {{its list}} of top 11 [...] "silver screen psychos", saying that [...] "Chigurh is an assassin of little words and {{interesting}} choices of weaponry - is a man without <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of humor. Others might say he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> warped <b>sense</b> of principles. One thing that most can agree on, is Chigurh is one crazy S.O.B. - ruthlessly killing damn near anyone who sets eyes on him, let alone those who get in his way. And apparently, {{the only way you}} can survive a run in with the man is the 50-50 chance of a coin toss, but dear god, don't question his motives, it just seems to irritate him even more so." ...|$|R

But for Oscar--to speak in sober earnest, this time--I tell you I would much rather perfect the sense in me that I have already got, than have a sense given to me that I have not got.

60|$|The {{party in}} the gun-room were silent while they waited for Jim. Mrs. Halliday glanced at the others curiously and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of strain. Dick, looking {{disturbed}} but resolute, leaned against the table opposite Mordaunt, whose face was rather white; Bernard occupied the bench by the wall and his look was inscrutable. All was very quiet except for the snapping of the stove and the occasional rattle of a cinder falling through the bars. It {{was something of a}} relief when Jim came in and Bernard turned on the light.|$|E
60|$|After a {{few moments}} Jimmy heard Deering's laugh and Stannard's party crossed the floor. Frank Dillon talked to Laura, whom Jimmy had not seen since he returned; Frank was rather a handsome, {{athletic}} young fellow. Laura wore a fashionable black dinner dress and her skin, by contrast, was very white. Her movements were languidly graceful, and Jimmy <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of high cultivation. He was young and to know he belonged to Laura's party flattered him. Yet he was half embarrassed, because he waited for other guests {{and did not know}} if Laura would like his friends. When she gave Jimmy her hand Stannard indicated two extra chairs.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the pilot}} was shot, {{producers}} decided that they needed a regular comedian on the show, so Rip Taylor was brought aboard to portray the Bradys' realtor, moving man, next-door-neighbor, general Jack-of-all-trades and Alice's boyfriend, Mr. Merrill. Like Reischl, Taylor felt welcomed by the cast—with the exception of Ann B. Davis, who barely spoke to him except when they were doing scenes. [...] "Rip Taylor is a salty guy," [...] commented series writer Mike Kagan, [...] "he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> dirty <b>sense</b> of humor and Ann B. Davis is a born-again Christian." ...|$|R
5000|$|The verses to [...] "Blasphemous Rumours" [...] {{describe}} a 16-year-old girl who attempts suicide but fails.

The chorus uses these incidents to conclude, [...] "I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours / but I think that God's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sick <b>sense</b> of humour / and when I die, I expect to find him laughing." [...] Like other songs on Some Great Reward, the song uses a dense sound with extensive sampled percussion.|$|R
