40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper investigates some of {{the effects}} of {{axisymmetric}} die geometry and flowrate during the <b>isothermal</b> <b>extrusion</b> of solid chocolate. Experimental observations, such as the material exhibiting a yield stress, flowrate independence and irreversible deformation, indicate that solid chocolate can be modelled using a rigid perfect plastic constitutive model (usually applied to the characterisation of metal forming processes). Numerically obtained extrusion pressures for a range of area reductions, using a commercial finite element package (ABAQUS) in combination with a remeshing code, are compared to experimental data to determine the uniaxial yield stress of the material. Analytical approximations are used to verify the numerical results. A study of the material behaviour in the die land, however, shows that the perfect plastic description can be inadequate in predicting extrusion pressures under certain conditions...|$|E

Laboratory and development work has usually relied on one-step forging to produce test material. Attempts to scale-up TiAl-based alloy processing has indicated that multi-step wrought processing is necessary. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine potential multi-step processing routes, such as two-step <b>isothermal</b> forging and <b>extrusion</b> + <b>isothermal</b> forging. The effects of processing (I/M versus P/M), intermediate recrystallization heat treatments and processing route on the tensile and creep properties of Ti- 48 Al- 2 Nb- 2 Cr alloys were examined. The results of the testing were then compared to samples from the same heats of materials processed by one-step routes. Finally, by evaluating the effect of processing on microstructure and properties, optimized and potentially lower cost processing routes could be identified...|$|R
40|$|Extrusion is a {{metal forming}} process, In this process the {{material}} is pushed or drawn through a die of desired cross-section to create long object of a fixed cross-section area, extrusion may be continuous (producing infinitely long material) or semi continuous (producing many pieces). The extrusion process {{can be done with}} the material hot or cold. There is gradual deformation which results in the uniform microstructure. Anon-linear converging cosine dies profiles are used for square to square extrusion process. Extrusion through mathematically contoured die plays a critical role in improvement of surface finish of extruded product. The cosine die profile designed using CATIA, Solidworks and MATLAB was used to find out the coordinate of the cosine die profile and solid model was generated using CATIA the STL files of extrusion dies generated by solid work and CATIA. The STL files are used in DEFORM- 3 D Software for FEM simulation. The work piece, punch and container with cosine die profiles are used in DEFORM- 3 D software for simulation purpose.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the theoretical prediction, finite element simulation, and {{experimental studies of}} extrudate swell in monodisperse and bidisperse polystyrenes. We present a molecular approach to understanding extrudate swell using the tube-model-based Rolie-Poly constitutive equation within a Lagrangian finite element solver. This yields theoretical predictions of swelling which show a close universality: The molecular weight dependence of the swelling can be removed when the flow speed is scaled by the Rouse Weissenberg number. The roles that both chain orientation and stretch play in determining extrudate swell are clearly identifiable from plots of swelling ratio against each Weissenberg number. We also present <b>isothermal</b> <b>extrusion</b> experiments on the same polymers and can obtain good predictions well into the strong chain stretching regime. The predictions for swelling ratios match those from experiments up to Rouse Weissenberg numbers of ∼ 7, above which swelling is overpredicted by the Rolie-Poly equation...|$|E

40|$|Based on an {{analytical}} review of scientific publications the goal and general guidelines were grounded. The prospects of using structurally modified and structurally inhomogeneous materials based on titanium and aluminum alloys were shown. The analysis of power loading schemes of <b>isothermal</b> <b>extrusion</b> was made. Typical schemes of loading {{as a result}} of structural and logical analysis were classified depending on the impact of shear stresses, which are proportional to the forces of friction, on the overall stress state in the cell strains. The general method of work, which includes the method of theoretical numerical and experimental analysis was considered. The theory of plastic flow is proposed for theoretical analysis. A new approach for calculation of shear strains in the overall process of deformation was created based on the general equations of the theory of plastic flow continuum. Based on the proposed approach, it was considered the process of extrusion with active friction forces that create large shear deformation in the cross section of the channel through which the solid medium moves. The research of isothermal forging process for screw expanding extrusion was carried out. Based on theoretical models the kinematic relationships of the deformation process was studied and contribution of shear deformation on the formation of the microstructure of the metal after deformation was determined. In a production environment shows promising The prospects of further treatment of modified metals by screw forging for following stamping processes, such as hot extrusion, was demonstrated in production environment The process of intense plastic deformation in the center of deformation during of drawing of bimetallic materials with thinning with heating was investigated. Theoretic models were obtained for calculation of combined drawing with thinning of two-layer cylindrical workpiece for perfectly-plastic material as well as a theoretical model of drawing of two-layer workpiece with regard to the forces of friction on the contact surfaces of the workpiece with the matrix and punch, between layers of dissimilar metals.

40|$|The {{extrusion}} {{of aluminium}} alloys involves the shaping of the product from an homogenised billet into a complex shape. In addition {{the properties of the}} extrudate are closely related to the processing parameters (temperature, stain rate, and material morphology). Since all the parameters vary throughout the ram stroke and throughout the billet the prediction of the condition of the extrudate is complex. In this study the analysis is accomplished by the use of finite element analysis coupled with sub-illodelling of the structural features. The study is extended to include the lieat-treatment process necessary for precipitation hardened alloys subsequent to the process. The author has published these results in a number of learned journals and these are given in Appendix. After a concise introduction and crirical literature review chapter 3 analyses the basic operation of the finite element package(FEM) discussing the procedures involved, the equilibrium equations and the more practical aspect of the mesh morphology and size. Finite Element analysis and material structural models have been integrated using parallel processing technology and program sub-routines. In this section the external inputs are also defined paying particular attention to the friction conditions and the constitutive equations. The thesis then proceeds to describe and analyse the integrated modelling of the process necessary to introduce the user introduction of the equations necessary to produce a comprehensive analysis of the material structural problems. This includes the cellular automata teclu-iiques. Various complex extrusion geometries are analysed and the effects of scaling considered. Development of the extrudate surface and criteria for ptedicting this important feature are coinprehebsivcly covered in chapter 5 whilst chapter 6 considers some special technologies {{such as the use of}} pockets to obtain homogenous structures. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>extrusion</b> is also included in this section. ...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{experiments}} being designed in the framework of the Large Hadron Collider accelerator at CERN. CMS will contain the largest and the most powerful superconducting solenoid magnet ever built in terms of stored energy. It will work at 4. 2 K, will have a magnetic length of 12. 5 m, with a free bore of 6 m and will be manufactured as a layered and modular structure of NbTi cables embedded in a high purity (99. 998 %) Al- stabiliser. Each layer consists of a wound continuous length of 2. 55 km. In order to withstand the high electromagnetic forces, two external aluminium alloy reinforcing sections are foreseen. These reinforcements, of 24 mm multiplied by 18 mm cross-section, will be continuously electron beam (EB) welded to the pure Al-stabiliser. The alloy EN AW- 6082 has been selected for the reinforcements due to its excellent extrudability, high strength in the precipitation hardened state, high toughness and strength at cryogenic temperatures and ready EB weldability. Each one of the 2. 55 km continuous sections of reinforcement is extruded billet on billet and press quenched on-line from the extrusion temperature in an industrial extrusion plant. The region where billet on billet welds develop is usually defective and represents a discontinuity in the extruded product, where improper quenching conditions associated to the stop of the line induce poorer mechanical properties. In the present case, thanks to an optimisation of the process, almost <b>isothermal</b> <b>extrusion</b> could be achieved, independently of the discontinuous process. This, associated to a proper conditioning of the mating surface of the billet, allowed the local degradation of the yield strength to be reduced from the usual value of 30 to less than 10 %. The extent of the transition region was also decreased from 8 to 2 m. The achievement of homogeneous strength along continuously extruded long shapes, which is important for the CMS coil winding, might also be c...|$|E
40|$|NiTiHf alloys have {{attracted}} considerable attention as potential high temperature Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) but the instability in transformation temperatures and significant irrecoverable strain during thermal cycling under constant stress remains a major concern. The {{main reason for}} irrecoverable strain and change in transformation temperatures {{as a function of}} thermal cycling can be attributed to dislocation formation due to relatively large volume change during transformation from austenite to martensite. The formation of dislocations decreases the elastic stored energy, and during back transformation a reduced amount of strain is recovered. All these observations can be attributed to relatively soft lattice that cannot accommodate volume change by other means. We have used Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE), hot rolling and marforming to strengthen the 49. 8 Ni- 42. 2 Ti- 8 Hf (in at. %) material and to introduce desired texture to overcome these problems in NiTiHf alloys. ECAE offers the advantage of preserving billet cross-section and the application of various routes, which give us the possibility to introduce various texture components and grain morphologies. ECAE was performed using a die of 90 ?? tool angle and was performed at high temperatures from 500 ??C up to 650 ??C. All extrusions went well at these temperatures. Minor surface cracks were observed only in the material extruded at 500 ??C, possibly due to the non-isothermal nature of the extrusion. It is believed that these surface cracks can be eliminated during <b>isothermal</b> <b>extrusion</b> at this temperature. This result of improved formability of NiTiHf alloy using ECAE is significant because an earlier review of the formability of NiTiHf using 50 % rolling reduction concluded that the minimum temperature for rolling NiTi 12 %Hf alloy without cracks is 700 ??C. The strain level imposed during one 90 ?? ECAE pass is equivalent to 69 % rolling reduction. Subsequent to ECAE processing, a reduction in irrecoverable strain from 0. 6 % to 0. 21 % and an increase in transformation strain from 1. 25 % to 2. 18 % were observed at a load of 100 MPa as compared to the homogenized material. The present results show that the ECAE process permits the strengthening of the material by work hardening, grain size reduction, homogeneous distribution of fine precipitates, and the introduction of texture in the material. These four factors contribute in the increase of stability of the material. In this thesis I will be discussing the improvement of mechanical behavior and stability of the material achieved after various passes of ECAE...|$|E
