This factor together with agriculture landscape changes and traditional agriculture practices represent a threat for bee diversity and pollination service of natural and agro ecosystems. Additionally, research on key pollinating bee species is still poor and the benefits of the service they provide have not been estimated. Particularly, bumblebees from highlands of central Colombia have an important function as pollinators of ecosystems such as “Páramos ” where native vegetation represent a critical component for water production and regulation at a national level.

Here, we compare post-dispersal seed removal by rodents within and among sites in two distinct regions, the south-eastern Spanish Mediterranean highlands and the Swiss Jura. Seed removal was assessed experimentally for four fleshy- fruited species (Berberis vulgaris, Crataegus monogyna, Rosa spp. and Taxus baccata) in heterogeneous sites with distinct microhabitats. A factorial general linear model (GLM) analysis was used to evaluate the relative influence of species- specific seed traits on removal at three spatial levels (microhabitat, site and region). In both <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> live trapping revealed that rodents were the main seed removers: Apodemus sylvaticus was observed in both regions, whereas A. flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus occurred only at the Swiss sites. There was a significant difference in seed removal between regions, and the preferences of the rodents varied among plant species and microhabi- tats.

40|$|In the <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> where {{actions by}} some {{individuals}} or groups often generate off-site effects among {{a wide range of}} social actors and stakeholders, the use and management of natural resources are susceptible to multiple forms of conflicts. This paper examines the hypothesis that conflicts constrain the adoption of agroforestry technologies. Using empirical data from 243 households in Kabale-Uganda, the study identified over 780 different cases of conflicts, and found positive relationships between certain types of conflicts and adoption of agroforestry technologies. The results of this paper challenge the conventional wisdom that conflicts are pervasive, and that the prevalence of conflicts is a major barrier to the adoption of NRM technologies. On the contrary, they seem to suggest that conflicts may have some positive outcomes; they provide incentives for the adoption of NRM technologies, and can be a potential force for positive social change. Conflicts are an essential feature of NRM in the highland systems and cannot therefore be ignored. What matters is the ways such conflicts are managed and resolved, and transformed into a force for positive change. We found that three dimensions of social capital (collective action, byelaws implementation and linking with local government structures) have increased the ability of communities to manage and transform conflicts into opportunities for collective action. These findings suggest new areas for further investigation to improve understanding of adoption decisions and building local capacity for scaling up the impacts of agroforestry innovations.

In Africa, an increase in temperature can break seed dormancy and stimulate germination of some herbaceous and woody species. In Madagascar, the once widespread <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> dominated by woody species are now highly fragmented and dominated by anthropic grasslands and fields, with a significantly reduced area occupied by sclerophyllous forests referred to as ‘tapia woodlands’. Six species of this endemic vegetation type were studied: Abrahamia ibityensis (Anacardiaceae), Aphloia theiformis (Aphloiaceae), Carissa edulis (Apocynaceae), Pentachlaena latifolia (Sarcolaenaceae), Uapaca bojeri (Phyllanthaceae) and Vaccinium secundiflorum (Ericaceae). Germination tests were conducted (i) by soaking seeds in water for 24 [*]h (imbibition) or (ii) by exposing the seeds to dry heat.

40|$|The Galapagos Islands are {{renowned for}} their {{ecological}} value. However the native biodiversity of this unique region is under threat. This thesis examines and disseminates ecological baseline {{conditions for the}} humid highlands of Santa Cruz Island in the Galapagos Archipelago. The aim {{of the study was}} to distinguish temporal vegetation transitions within the highlands, identify potential drivers of the transitions, and evaluate the importance of these transitions to conservation and management practices. Furthermore, the study aimed to develop baseline conditions within the soil microbial communities, examine relationships between testate amoebae (Protozoa) and environmental variables, and evaluate the functional diversity of these communities across the highlands. Utilization of palaeoecological proxies including macrofossil analysis, applied to three sediment sequences collected from Sphagnum peat bogs in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island, provided the basis for vegetative reconstructions during the Holocene. Examination of surface samples from differing substrate types and micro-habitat types was employed to evaluate the testate amoebae communities. The results indicate that these specialized <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are relatively young dynamic communities and have undergone considerable changes in vegetation composition, transitioning from diverse hygrophilous herbs and submerged aquatic lake communities to drier fem-sedge-Sphagnum bog systems during the last 10, 000 yr BP. A new aquatic genus previously undocumented on the islands, Elatine sp., was discovered at two of the study sites. Additionally, this study confirmed native status of seven plant species once considered introduced or doubtful native species. Results indicate that some of the observed vegetation successions may have been driven by climatic shifts, and recent anthropogenic change. This study helps reveal patterns of change in the humid highlands over the last 10, 000 years BP regarding vegetation variability, climatic shifts, influence of fire and anthropogenic impacts on the island.

An existing early malaria epidemic prediction model required further development, validations and automation before its wide use and application in the region. The model has a lead-time of two to four months between the detection of the epidemic signal and the evolution of the epidemic. The validated models would be of great use in the early detection and prevention of malaria epidemics. Confirmed inpatient malaria data were collected from eight sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for the period 1995 - 2009. Temperature and rainfall data for the period 1960 - 2009 were collected from meteorological stations closest to the source of the malaria data. Process-based models were constructed for computing the risk of an epidemic in two general <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> using temperature and rainfall data. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive power were used to validate the models RESULTS: Depending on the availability and quality of the malaria and meteorological data, the models indicated good functionality at all sites. Only two sites in Kenya had data that met the criteria for the full validation of the models. The additive model was found most suited for the poorly drained U-shaped valley ecosystems while the multiplicative model was most suited for the well-drained V-shaped valley ecosystem.

40|$|The {{tropical}} Andes {{is one of}} the worlds 25 {{most species}} rich and exceptional areas, and the montane forest ecosystems in particular are considered as biodiversity hotspots. Also the high altitude páramo region, between 3500 and 5000 m a. s. l., is another important Andean ecosystem. The low temperatures, high intra-day temperature variability and the tendency to be consistently humid throughout the year creates an environment ideal for wet páramo flora primarily consisting of tussock-grasses or bunch-grasses, and the home of a multitude of endemic species. Ecuador possesses the largest net wet páramo area within South America. According to SENPLADES the montane forests and páramos are two of the most important natural ecosystems that still exist. Both provide essential services to the society such as the biodiversity in flora and fauna, carbon sequestration, and water regulation and supply. These ecosystems are considered as the major water suppliers for Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, providing good water quality to millions of habitants of the main cities in the Andean cordillera and coastal areas. Notwithstanding the socio-economic and environmental importance of the <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> good understanding of their functioning is still scarce hindering their conservation and management. According to several authors the geochemical, biologic and ecologic processes in tropical forest and páramo systems are controlled by the water passing through them. Therefore, most socio-economic and ecological services of these ecosystems are strongly linked to the governing hydrological processes. Logically, disturbance of the hydrology will directly affect all water dependent processes and the services provided by them. In this context, it is important and relevant to research the hydrological functioning of the highlands catchments. Good understanding of the hydrology is essential as to conserve in a more effective way these ecosystems. Where, identification of the hydrological processes governing the conversion of precipitation into runoff {{is one of the}} major challenges for hydrologists worldwide. The main objective of this dissertation was to identify the rainfall runoff processes that control the discharge generation of the study areas. The research was conducted on the south of Ecuador, between latitude 2 ° 24 ´ and 3 ° 58 ´, the altitude range between 1742 to 4100 m a. s. l [...] The research uses multi techniques including hydrometric data analysis, tracers (isotopes and chemical constituents) and conceptual modeling. Results obtained using a variety of techniques and the detailed analysis of existing datasets and the collection of new datasets revealed that the hydrology of the study catchments is strongly controlled by the soil. This knowledge is very useful in deriving policies and regulations that best manage and protect the gamma of ecological services offered by these fragile ecosystems. For the generic use of the acquired knowledge findings were translated into a conceptual model mimicking the rainfall-runoff process, primarily based on mimicking the soil hydrology. With the tested model it will be possible to predict the impact on the runoff of future changes in climate and land use, and to test the effect of mitigation and management policies with respect to the sustainability in water delivery by this catchments for the multiple water uses in the region. The findings are representative for the area in which the study sites are located. Given the similarity in properties of the micro-basins in the Ecuadorian Andes cordillera above 2500 m a. s. l., stretching from Riobamba to the border with Peru, a bird-flight distance of 600 km, it is very likely that the modeling concept can be used for the prediction of the runoff in most, if not all, of the micro-catchments in this region...|$|R
40|$|The flora of the Swat Valley is {{composed}} of 1550 higher plant species of which a remarkable 350 are medicinally important (out of c. 6000 species with 700 of medicinal value {{for the whole of}} Pakistan). The diverse geographic, topographic and climatic conditions in the alpine and subalpine regions of Swat are responsible for its biodiversity richness. The present study on the medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) was conducted in the alpine and subalpine regions of the Swat Valley (2007 - 2009) in order to evaluate their current threats (both anthropogenic and natural), population density, indigenous uses (along with trade importance in the local economy) and impact of climate change. However, the fragility of these <b>highland</b> <b>ecosystems</b> makes this biodiversity vulnerable. The analysis revealed 177 species belonging to 70 families with major families of Rosaceae containing 18 species followed by Lamiaceae 16 species, Asteraceae 15, Ranunculaceae 12 and Polygonaceae with 9 species. The driving forces in the increasing decline of these species were found to be: overgrazing, overexploitation, timber logging, fuelwood collection and agriculture expansion. The root causes behind these driving forces are: the lack of economic development, population pressure, poverty, illiteracy and basic unawareness of sustainability and ecosystem importance. The dominant plant community types in these regions were recorded with their life form (biological spectrum), showing that the flora was of Hemicrypto-therophytic nature with 36. 72 % (hemicryptophytes) and 14. 68 % (therophytes). The leaf spectra analysis of these plants revealed that microphyll was dominant (100 species) followed by nanophyll (38 species) and mesophyll (30 species). The palatability analysis revealed that 88 % plants were palatable, 34 % were highly palatable and 6. 6 % were non-palatable. The impact of climate change under current and future scenarios were analysed and indicates that Viola canescens, Fragaria nubicola and Bistorta amplexicaulis would profoundly shift their distribution towards north in comparison to their present distribution while Juniperus communis and Betula utilis have not shown large shifting towards north because of their different climatic needs. Viola canescens would extend whereas Juniperus communis would reduce its distribution. The indigenous knowledge indicates that 93 species belonging to 49 families were of immense importance to the basic health needs of these communities including 19 species used as ethno- veterinary medicines. The market analysis of these plants shows that the most expensive plants are Aconitum heterophyllum, Morchella esculenta and Viola canescens with high demand in the local markets and sporadic exportation to the Middle East, especially to the UAE. The annual tonnage sale of 23 species in the local markets sampled was 196 tonnes per annum with an average amount of 8. 52 tonnes. Berberis Iyceum, Saussurea atkinsonii and Viola canescens are the most wanted plants in the area and are the top selling drugs in the local market reaching an annual mean sale of 1 tonne per retailer. Based on the findings of this research, the MAPs of these regions are declining sharply on an enormous scale due to habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and habitat loss. Government intervention along with the active involvement of local communities is needed in order to ensure sustainable utilisation without risking their local extinction. The study revealed an urgent need to conserve these valuable taxa in situ in the form of national parks, nature reserves and game reserves, and ex situ in the form of botanical gardens, seed banks and other germplasm collections. In addition to the above threat, improper and untimely government policies with poor implementation procedures, compounded by corruption and the illicit influence for resource-use patterns among local and national departments, are further sharply aggravating this decline.

40|$|Bee species {{interactions}} {{can benefit}} plant pollination through synergistic effects and complementary effects, {{or can be}} of detriment to plant pollination through competition effects by reducing visitation by effective pollinators. Since specific bee interactions influence the foraging performance of bees on flowers, they also act as drivers to regulate the assemblage of flower visitors. We selected squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) and its pollinators as a model system to study the foraging response of honey bees to the occurrence of bumble bees at two types of sites surrounded by a high amount of natural habitats (≥ 58 % of land cover) and a low amount of natural habitats (≤ 12 % of land cover) in a <b>highland</b> agricultural <b>ecosystem</b> in China. At the individual level, we measured the elapsed time from the departure of prior pollinator(s) {{to the arrival of}} another pollinator, the selection of honey bees for flowers occupied by bumble bees, and the length of time used by honey bees to explore floral resources at the two types of sites. At the community level, we explored the effect of bumble bee visitation on the distribution patterns of honey bees on squash flowers. Conclusively, bumble bee visitation caused an increase in elapsed time before flowers were visited again by a honey bee, a behavioral avoidance by a newly-arriving honey bee to select flowers occupied by bumble bees, and a shortened length of time the honey bee takes to examine and collect floral resources. The number of overall bumble bees on squash flowers was the most important factor explaining the difference in the distribution patterns of honey bees at the community level. Furthermore, {{decline in the number of}} overall bumble bees on the squash flowers resulted in an increase in the number of overall honey bees. Therefore, our study suggests that bee interactions provide an opportunity to enhance the resilience of ecosystem pollination services against the decline in pollinator diversity...|$|R
40|$|Aquatic <b>ecosystems</b> of <b>highland</b> rivers are {{different}} from those of low altitude rivers because of the specific topography and environmental parameters associated with high altitudes. Yalutsangpo, the upper course of the Brahmaputra River, is the highest major river in the world, flowing from west to east across Tibet, China and pouring into India. Macroinvertebrates were sampled from Yalutsangpo and its tributaries, the Lhasa, Niyang, and Parlong Tsangpo Rivers, from October 2009 to June 2010, to study characters of the <b>highland</b> aquatic <b>ecosystem.</b> Altogether, 110 macroinvertebrate taxa belonging to 57 families and 102 genera were identified from the basin. The biodiversity and composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages were strongly affected by altitude gradients. Local diversity represented by taxa richness and the improved Shannon-Wiener index were high at altitudes of 3, 300 - 3, 700 m, among which suitability of habitat was higher due to the better integrated environmental conditions of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and aquatic vegetation, etc. Macroinvertebrates were grouped into shredders, scrapers, predators, collector-filterers, and collector-gatherers according to their feeding behaviors. It was found that the distributions of the functional feeding groups varied with habitat altitudes. Shredders were present at altitudes of 2, 900 - 4, 400 m, while scrapers mainly inhabited altitudes of 3, 500 - 4, 500 m, and collector-filterers preferred 3, 500 - 4, 000 m. Even though the local taxa richness was not high at each site, the taxonomic composition and density of the assemblages varied greatly among the different sites, resulting in much higher regional diversity compared to the lowland river with similar flow and substrate conditions. The regional cumulative taxa richness of Yalutsangpo decreased and more families were lost as the altitude increased. However, some families that were newly present as the altitude increased were essential for sustaining the high regional biodiversity. The ordination diagram obtained from Detrended Correspondence Analysis indicated that altitude, river pattern, riverbed structures, bank structures, and flow conditions were the main factors that influenced the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Yalutsangpo basin...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{is almost}} an axiom {{that in the}} African {{highlands}} (above 1500 m) transmission of P. falciparum is limited primarily by low ambient temperature and that small changes in temperature could result in temporary favourable conditions for unstable transmission within populations that have acquired little functional immunity. The pattern of malaria transmission in the <b>highland</b> plateau <b>ecosystems</b> is less distinct due to the flat topography and diffuse hydrology resulting from numerous streams. The non-homogeneous distribution of larval breeding habitats in east African highlands obviously affects Anopheles spatial distribution which, consequently, leads to heterogeneous human exposure to malaria. Another delicate parameter in the fragile transmission risk of malaria in the highlands is the rapid loss of primary forest due to subsistence agriculture. The implication of this change in land cover on malaria transmission is that deforestation can lead to changes in microclimate of both adult and larval habitats hence increase larvae survival, population density, and gametocytes development in adult mosquitoes. Deforestation has been documented to enhancing vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae by nearly 100 % compared to forested areas. Method: The {{study was conducted in}} five different ecosystems in the western Kenya highlands, two U-shaped valleys (Iguhu, Emutete), two V-shaped valleys (Marani, Fort-Ternan) and one plateau (Shikondi) for 16 months among 6 - 15 years old children. Exposure to malaria was tested using circum-sporozoite protein (CSP) and merozoite surface protein (MSP) immunochromatographic antibody tests. Malaria parasite was examined using different tools which include microscopy based on blood smears, Rapid diagnostic test based on HRP 2 proteins and serology based on human immune response to parasite and vector antigens have been also examined in the highlands in comparison with different topographical systems of western Kenya. Results: The results suggested that changes in the topography of had implication on transmission in highlands of western Kenya and appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and control tool needed to be considered accordingly. Both plateau and U-shaped valley found to have higher parasite density than V-shaped valley. People in V-valley were less immune than in plateau and U-valley residents. Conclusion: Topography diversity in western Kenya highlands has a significant impact on exposur...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{functional}} characteristics of forest soils in the mountainous regions in Bulgaria were assessed {{in order to}} obtain a better understanding of cesium distribution in soil. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the small-scale spatial variability of Cs- 137 contamination in forest floor and surface soil layers in relation to regional and local characteristics. The mountainous regions of Bulgaria were strongly and inhomogeneously contaminated with cesium- 137 due to the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The study confirmed that the cesium in forest soils from two mountainous regions of Bulgaria, SW Rila Mountain and Central Balkan, is located in the forest floor and upper 0 - 5 cm of soil. In a few cases from Central Balkan the maximum activities are found at a soil depth 5 - 10 cm. The measured values of cesium activity concentration in Aoh in Rila Mountain region are between 287. 9 and 827. 1 Bq kg− 1. Greater variations in cesium activity concentration in forest floor are determined for the plots from Central Balkan, where the measured values in Aof are between 85. 7 and 2543 Bq kg− 1. The contamination density of Cs- 137 in fine soil (b 1 mm) from Rila varies from 0. 6 to 6. 0 kBq m− 2 while in the Central Balkan plots it is between 1. 2 and 19. 6 kBq m− 2. The forest floor remains the main reservoir for cesium even years after pollution. The profile distribution of Cs- 137 in soil systems shows a tendency of decrease toward deeper layers. The mountainous ecosystems with different types of vegetation were compared on the basis of estimated factor of accumulation (FA). The FA for conifers in Rila Mountain is from 0. 28 to 0. 69 and in the Central Balkans the FA is from 0. 20 to 0. 61. The data showed that the spatial distribution of Cs- 137 in soil system depends on type of vegetation, humus type and altitude. Due to their low clay content and the high content of organic matter, the mountain forest soils can be considered an excellent ecosystem in which to study the mobility and behaviour of Cs- 137 and its transfer into the soil-plant system. Due to the high levels of radiocesium contamination within the mountainous regions of the Central Balkan and the characteristics of soils, the <b>highland</b> mountain herbaceous <b>ecosystems</b> located in this region, in the authors' opinion, could be considered as risk zones to easier soil-to-plant transfer of cesium...|$|R
40|$|Demographic {{pressure}} {{combined with}} agricultural and industrial development have incremented {{the demand for}} groundwater employment {{so far as to}} make the preservation of the water quantity and quality difficult. The problem consists of maintaining high qualitative standards with an increasing demand on the one hand, on the other to balance groundwater use with environmental issues for the protection of natural ecosystems. A conflict so arises and, at the same time, the need to quantify the effects on the ecosystems of different exploitation schemes, even in apparently highly protected environments. Wetlands in the Alpine <b>highlands</b> are fragile <b>ecosystems</b> of high environmental values and, in some instance, may be subjected, in a world with increasing pressures on water resources, to potentially adverse impacts due to groundwater exploitation. This is the case of a couple of wetland systems located in the Eastern Alps (Veneto Region, Northern Italy), respectively at {{the eastern edge of the}} Asiago plateau (Marcesina site, 1300 m a. s. l.) and near the border with Austria at the northern edge of the Piave river watershed (Colotrondo site, 1800 m a. s. l.). Both the sites have a high naturalistic importance for the occurrence of some topic habitat declared as deserving protection priority in Europe; at the same time near Marcesina site a well has been drilled to pump groundwater for municipal water supply whereas near Coltrondo springs are used for farming. Understanding groundwater flow systems inside the wetland porous medium and quantifying the components of the wetland hydrological budget is the main way to forecast the adverse effects of anthropic impact and to manage them. The paper deals with the results of a hydrological continuous monitoring system set-up to reconstruct the hydraulic head field internal to the wetlands and to verify and quantify the components of the recharge-discharge system (direct recharge, groundwater flow from surrounding aquifers and moraines, discharge from springs, discharge from evapotranspiration through the unsaturated zone, discharge from surface creeks). A total of 39 open-stand pipe piezometers (diameter 60 mm) have been drilled in triplets at 3 distinct depths below ground surface (respectively, on the average, 5 m, 2, 5 m, 1 m). The total thickness of the wetland porous medium is, on the average, varying between 0, 8 and 7 m. During the vegetative period of 2005 (from August to October) a discontinuous weekly monitoring of hydraulic heads have been performed; during all the 2006 summer a total of 12 piezometers record continuously the hydraulic head via mini pressure transducers connected to data-loggers. At the same time main springs and wells discharge, creeks surface flow and rainfall are monitored. Depending on the ombrotrophic or minerotrophic type of the wetland we have monitored different patterns of groundwater flow (upward or downward oriented). The final goal is the implementation of a numerical flow model to simulate the outcome of the possible modifications on the wetland groundwater flow systems induced by anthropic pressures...|$|R
