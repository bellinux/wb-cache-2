But somephysico-chemical modifications of the lysozyme can modify its membrane activity, increasinglysozyme antimicrobial properties against E. coli; <b>dry-heating</b> is able to induce suchmodifications. 4 Especially, we previously highlighted that native (N-L) and dry-heatedlysozyme (DH-L) disrupt the outer membrane of E. coli, but in different ways. 3, 4 The mode of insertion into the bacterial outer membrane and molecular interactions remains unknown. This was thus investigated using an E. coli lipopolysaccharide monolayer (LPSM) membranemodel, mimicking the outer leaflet of the bacterial outer membrane. The interactions betweenlysozyme and LPSM were studied by tensiometry, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy(AFM) and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). Both N-L and DH-L are able to insert into aLPSM. As expected, electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged LPSM and bothpositively charged forms of lysozyme were observed.

The lysozyme/phospholipid interactions have been studied by surface pressure measurements, ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy.
