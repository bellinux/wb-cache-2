50|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their road {{loss to the}} Ravens, the Raiders went home for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Atlanta Falcons. In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Falcons QB Matt Ryan {{completed}} a 37-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins, while RB Jerious Norwood got a 12-yard TD run.

From then on out, Atlanta would prevent Oakland from <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> positive drive going and the Raiders fell to 2-6 with the shutout loss.|$|R

So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick I'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little cottage with a light in the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that I'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as {{if she was going to}} bed when I knocked and she had her hair hanging and I thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, and I thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said: 'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES...' I didn't go in, Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing at the door.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to frequent collaborations with various independent zines across Europe and North America, such as Zero Zero (which {{led to a}} US reprinting of Primitive Crétin! in 1996), Valium also started by the mid-1990s to experiment more formally with collage, which moved his art toward a more abstract and horrific form. Among the interesting collages of that period, we find La Prison Anale des Frères Rouges (1996) and the Curés Malades ("sick priests") series. The later, through the depiction of machine parts and pornography blended over portraits of priests, is a gloomy and graphic criticism on the Catholic Church’s historical influence in Quebec. Valium’s collage work, with its incorporation of explicit sexual imagery (often going as far as bestiality) and gruesome press photos, has prevented him from <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> public recognition, including government subsidies. Since the 1980s, Valium has mostly made a living from printing posters for various Montreal rock bands and bars, such as Le Café Campus and Les Foufounes Électriques.|$|R

(Part of the data was taken from the section "Cooking with Chilies" that appeared in Bon Appetit magazine, December 1986.
