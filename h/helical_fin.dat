A new SVLX {{static mixer}} is {{original}} {{designed by the}} author with the structure of alternative connection of the SV static mixing unit and cross shaped stationary <b>helical</b> <b>fin.</b> The two-phase flow is sheared, separated, impinged and rotated by SV static mixing unit, as well as whirled by the cross shaped stationary <b>helical</b> <b>fin.</b> Hence the mixer efficiency is enhanced. The most advantage of this design is the mixer efficiency is more enhanced with none applied force. Followed by the static mixer structure illustration, the preliminary analysis of the two-phase flow field is carried out, which provides some proofs for the selection and optimization of the new SVLX static mixer structural parameters...|$|E

The experimental results indicated that f and Nu in smooth tube was predicted very well by conventional correlations both for air and CO 2. In rough tubes the friction factor was significant higher than the prediction of conventional correlations both in laminar and turbulent flow.

40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} is {{an important}} device in all the thermal systems. The heat exchanger is widely used equipment in different industries such as process, petroleum refining, chemicals and paper etc. Energy and material saving considerations as well as environmental challenges in the industry have stimulated the demand for high efficiency heat exchanger. To improve the efficiency of heat exchanger one must think of heat transfer enhancement in heat exchanger. Moreover heat transfer enhancement enables the size of heat exchanger to be considerably decreased. A high rate of heat transfer with minimum space requirement is necessity for compact heat exchanger. In present work, to improve the heat transfer characteristic of the double pipe heat exchanger, the <b>helical</b> <b>fins</b> were installed on the outer surface of the inner tube {{and the level of}} turbulence increased by the rotating the inner tube. The length of heat exchanger was 1 m and the pitch of <b>helical</b> <b>fins</b> kept constant equal to 17 mm. The convective heat transfer coefficients were obtained for the stationary as well as rotating inner tube for the counter flow mode using water as cold fluid in the tube side and glycerol as hot fluid in the shell side. The flow rate of cold fluid was kept constant and that of hot fluid was varied. The Nusselt number was calculated for the each speed of the rotation and compared with standard values obtained from Dittus-Boelter equation.

40|$|AbstractVacuum tubular {{receiver}} is {{the core}} component of parabolic trough solar collectors (PTCs). To enhance the heat transfer rate from solar radiation to heat transfer fluid (HTF), one of the effective techniques {{is to improve the}} convective heat transfer inside the inner tube. In this study, we focus the heat transfer of the HTF side. A numerical simulation on the fully developed turbulent flow and heat transfer in the inner tube with and without <b>helical</b> <b>fins,</b> protrusions and dimples has been investigated. The results show that the receiver tubes with dimples have superior performance of heat transfer augmentation compared with that with protrusions or <b>helical</b> <b>fins.</b> Then, the effects of the geometry sizes and arrangements of dimples on the convective heat transfer performance are further studied. The performance evaluation plot of heat transfer enhancement techniques show that dimples with deeper depth, narrower pitch and more numbers in the circumference direction is benefit for improving the performance of heat transfer enhancement while the varied arrangements have no obvious influence...|$|R
40|$|Solar–thermal {{power plants}} are being {{deployed}} world-wide. These plants have traditionally used steel absorber pipes. Two types of fluids {{have been used}} in such ventures, synthetic aromatic fluid or water. Fluid flow in parabolic trough systems leads to instability in the tube due to the concentrated solar flux on only one-half of the absorber tube, resulting in temperature asymmetricity. The resulting stresses cause deflection and bending of the tube. This paper deals with direct steam systems and proposes incorporation of internal helical fins within the tube to reduce temperature variation. The fins provide an orderly distribution of flow from the ‘hot ’ to the ‘cold ’ side of the tube. A CFD simulation was carried out for three fin pitches, and an aluminium pipe without fins. The effect on heat transfer improvement and temperature asymmetry is presently reported. It is shown that the thermal gradient between the upper and lower temperature for the pipe without a <b>helical</b> <b>fin</b> (20 K) is considerably higher compared with the pipes with 100, 200 and 400 mm pitch helical fins, i. e. 10. 8, 13, 14. 9 K, respectively.

40|$|Experirnental {{data and}} {{theoretical}} calculation on the heat transfer performance of extended surface submerged: in shallow air fluidized beds ~ less than 150 mm, are presented. Energy t;ransferrence {{from the bed}} material was effected by water cooled tubes passing through the fins. The extended surface tested was either manufactured from square or radial copper fins silver soldered to a circular basic tube or commercially supplied, being of the crimped or extruded <b>helical</b> <b>fin</b> type. Performances are compared, {{for a wide range}} of geometric variables, bed configurations and fluidized materials, with plain and oval tubes operating under similar experimental conditions. A statistical analysis of all results, using a regression technique, has shown the relative importance of each significant variable. The bed to surface heat transfer coefficients are higher than those reported in earlier published work using finned tubes in much deeper beds and the heat transfer to the whole of the extended surface is at least as good as that previously reported for un-finned tubes. The improved performance is attributed partly to the absence of large bubbles in shallow beds and it is suggested that the improved circulation of the solids when constrained in the narrow passages between adjacent fins may be a contributory factor. Flow visualisation studies between a perspex extended surface and a fluidized bed using air at ambient temperatures, have demonstrated the effect of too small a fin spacing. Fin material and the bonding to the basic tube are more important in the optimisation of performance than in conventional convective applications because of the very much larger heat fluxes involved. A theoretical model of heat flow for a radial fin surface, provides data concerning the maximum heat transfer and minimum metal required to fulfil a given heat exchange duty.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis {{was to investigate the}} effect of swirl in steady turbulent pipe flows. The work has been carried out by a numerical approach, with direct numerical simulations as the method of choice. A key target to pursue was the effects of the swirl on the wall friction in turbulent pipe flows. The motivation came from studies of rotating pipe flows in which drag reduction was achieved. Drag reduction was reported to be due to the swirl favourably influencing the coherent turbulent structures in the near-wall region. Based on this, it was decided to investigate if similar behaviour could be obtained by inducing a swirl in a pipe with a stationary wall. To do a thorough investigation of the general three-dimensional swirl flow and particularly of the swirl effects; chosen variations of mean and turbulent flow parameters were explored together with complementary flow visualizations. Two different approaches in order to induce the swirl in the turbulent pipe flow, have been carried out. However, the present thesis might be regarded to be comprised of three parts. The first part consists of the first approach to induce the swirl. Here a prescribed circumferential force was implemented in a serial open source Navier-Stokes solver. In the second approach, the swirl was intended induced by implementing structures at the wall. Simulations of flows through a pipe with one or more helical fin(s) at the pipe wall was decided to be performed. In order to pursue this approach, it was found necessary to do a parallelization of the existing serial numerical code. The key element of this parallelization has been included {{as a part of the}} present work. Additionally, the helical fin(s) were implemented into the code by use of an immersed boundary method. A validation of this work is also documented in the thesis. The work done by parallelizing the code and implementing an immersed boundary method constitutes the second part of the present thesis. The last part of this thesis includes the simulations of flows with helical fin(s) at the pipe wall. First laminar flow in different pipe configurations were investigated; varying fin height, fin number, and fin angle. Secondly, turbulent flow in a pipe configuration with one <b>helical</b> <b>fin</b> was studied. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the performance enhancement of single-phase flow and boiling heat transfer in the 3 D inner <b>finned</b> <b>helical</b> tubes. The tests for single-phase flow and heat transfer were {{carried out in the}} helical tubes with a curvature of 0. 0663 and a length of 1. 15 m, the range of the Reynolds number examined varies from 1000 to 8500. In comparison to the smooth helical tube, the experimental results of two <b>finned</b> <b>helical</b> tubes with different inner fin geometry showed that the heat transfer and flow resistance in the 3 D inner <b>finned</b> <b>helical</b> tube gains greater augmentation. Within the measured range of Reynolds number, the average augmentation ratio of heat transfer of the two finned tubes are 71 % and 103 %, compared with the smooth helical tube, and 90 % and 140 % for flow resistance, respectively. The tests for flow boiling heat transfer was carried out in the 3 D inner <b>finned</b> <b>helical</b> tube with a curvature of 0. 0605 and a length of 0. 668 m.

This thesis concerned with computer simulation study of vertical tube with <b>helical</b> <b>fins</b> used to enhance their {{heat transfer}} performance subjected to natural convection heat transfer. All the main parameters which can significantly influence the heat transfer performance of finned tube has been analyzed. Natural convection in a vertical tube without fins was taken as the reference tube and different fin patterns such as a single fin with large no. of turns like coiled shape and large no. of fins with single turn is compared with reference tube on the basis of different parameters such as {{heat transfer rate}}, surface nusselt number, heat transfer coefficient, fin effectiveness etc. There are some dimensionless numbers which affect the natural convection such as nusselt number which is the function of Reynolds number, grashof number and prandlt number, Rayleigh number which is the product of grashoff and prandtl number. After getting best fin configuration compared it with different fin profile such as rectangular cross section,tapered fin with trapezoidal cross section and hyperbolic cross section. All the computer simulation has been done on the ANSYS 13. 0. The Navier-stokes equations were used to solve for the fluid flow inside the tube and the Boussinesq approximation was used to get the buoyancy effect. Aluminium is used for the fin material and air is taken as the fluid flowing inside the tube and the flow is taken as laminar. It was found that the large number of fins with single turn is more efficient then other fin patterns, as there is less flow resistance, high heat transfer rate...|$|R

A typical Joule-Thomson (J-T) {{refrigerator}} {{consists of}} a recuperative heat exchanger, a gas expansion nozzle, a mandrel, and a compressed gas storage bottle. The thermodynamic performance of a J-T refrigerator depends highly on the hydraulic and heat transfer characteristics of the recuperative heat exchanger. The typical recuperative heat exchanger of a J-T refrigerator has a double <b>helical</b> tube and <b>fin</b> configuration, but other heat exchanger configurations may be used, including the two-flow type <b>helical</b> tube and <b>fins</b> configuration, the twostage heat exchanger configuration, a double helically wound tube circuit arranged in a spiral channel, etc. In this study, the performance of J-T refrigerators with single and two-flow type recuperative heat exchangers was investigated.
