5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued <b>fathometer</b> ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational <b>fathometer,</b> Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons <b>fathometer</b> head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the <b>fathometer</b> inoperable.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fathometer</b> was not {{required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a <b>fathometer</b> would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording <b>fathometer</b> enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{and naval}} <b>fathometers</b> of yesteryear used a strip chart {{recorder}} where an advancing roll of paper was marked by a stylus to make a permanent copy of the depth, usually with some means of also recording time (Each mark or time 'tic' is proportional to distance traveled) so that the strip charts could be readily compared to navigation charts and maneuvering logs (speed changes). Much of the world's ocean depths have been mapped using such recording strips. <b>Fathometers</b> of this type usually offered multiple (chart advance) speed settings, and sometimes, multiple frequencies as well. (Deep Ocean—Low Frequency carries better, Shallows—high frequency shows smaller structures (like fish, submerged reefs, wrecks, or other bottom composition features of interest.) At high frequency settings, high chart speeds, such <b>fathometers</b> give {{a picture of the}} bottom and any intervening large or schooling fish that can be related to position. <b>Fathometers</b> of the constant recording type are still mandated for all large vessels (100+ tons displacement) in restricted waters (i.e. generally, within 15 mi of land).|$|R
50|$|Valiants mission {{capabilities}} are greatly enhanced by sophisticated electronic equipment such as: a Global Positioning System, surface search radar with a computerized collision avoidance system, radio direction finders, <b>fathometers,</b> and {{different types of}} radios.|$|R
50|$|Early {{sporting}} <b>fathometers</b> {{for recreational}} boating used a rotating {{light at the}} edge of a circle which flashed in sync with the received echo, which in turn corresponded to depth. These also gave a small flickering flash for echos off of fish. Like today's low-end digital <b>fathometers,</b> they kept no record of the depth over time and provided no information about bottom structure. They had poor accuracy, especially in rough water, and were hard to read in bright light. Despite the limitations, they were still usable for rough estimates of depth, such as for verifying that the boat had not drifted into an unsafe area.|$|R
5|$|Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his {{electronics}} technician team {{returned the}} <b>fathometer</b> to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and Tritons engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} a detour to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the Argentine Navy had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but Tritons contact {{turned out to be a}} school of fish.|$|E
25|$|The 67-foot motor yacht, Maimelee, {{was at its}} {{launching}} in 1961 {{the largest}} fiberglass yacht in the world. The hull was molded in England, shipped to East Boothbay and finished by Hodgdon Brothers. It was equipped with twin 308-horsepower diesel engines, air conditioning for cruising in southern waters and an electronic suite that included a radio direction finder, a <b>fathometer</b> and radar.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February, Tunny set her {{course for}} Swatow, keeping to the {{shoreline}} {{in hopes of}} intercepting shipping. En route, she passed a large hospital ship well marked and brilliantly lighted. On 6 February and 7 February, Tunny patrolled off Swatow. Numerous junks plying the Formosa and Swatow banks at all hours added to the hazards imposed by shallow water, and an inoperable <b>fathometer</b> (depthmeter) {{made it impossible for}} Tunny to approach the shore closer than six miles (10km).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{approach}} {{comes from}} greater signal processing of existing military sensors. [...] The US Naval Research Laboratory demonstrated both seafloor characterization, {{as well as}} subsurface characteristics of the seafloor. Sensors used, in different demonstrations, included normal incidence beams from the AM/UQN-4 surface ship depthfinder, and AN/BQN-17 submarine fathometer; backscatter from the Kongsberg EM-121 commercial multibeam sonar; AN/UQN-4 <b>fathometers</b> on mine countermeasures (MCM) ships, and the AN/AQS-20 mine-hunting system. These produced the [...] "Bottom and Subsurface Characterization" [...] graphic.|$|R
50|$|Single-beam echosounders and <b>fathometers</b> {{began to}} enter {{service in the}} 1930s which used sonar to measure the depth beneath a vessel. This greatly {{increased}} the speed of acquiring sounding data over that possible with lead lines and sounding poles by allowing information on depths beneath a vessel to be gathered {{in a series of}} lines spaced at a specified distance. However, it shared the weakness of earlier methods by lacking depth information for areas in between the strips of sea bottom the vessel sounded.|$|R
50|$|Practical {{applications}} of the methods of geometrical acoustics {{can be found in}} very different areas of acoustics. For example, in architectural acoustics the rectilinear trajectories of sound rays make it possible to determine reverberation time in a very simple way. The operation of <b>fathometers</b> and hydrolocators is based on measurements of the time required for sound rays to travel to a reflecting object and back. The ray concept is used in designing sound focusing systems. Also, the approximate theory of sound propagation in inhomogeneous media (such as the ocean and the atmosphere) has been developed largely {{on the basis of the}} laws of geometrical acoustics.|$|R
25|$|To avoid {{electrical}} interference with her sensitive hydrographic surveying equipment, Explorer′s deck machinery and major auxiliary equipment all {{was driven by}} high-pressure steam. When commissioned, Explorer was considered to have the finest and most extensive hydrographic surveying equipment {{in the history of}} the Coast and Geodetic Survey′s fleet, all entirely electrically powered. The equipment included a <b>fathometer,</b> a Dorsey sonic depth finder, a Hughes automatic depth recorder system, a special taut-wire measuring gear with 120 nautical miles (138 statute miles; 222km) of fine wire and several tons of iron balls, and hydrophones. Electrolysis eliminators mounted to her hull ensured that she would be grounded so as to avoid interference with her electrical surveying equipment.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>fathometer</b> was devised involving {{the use of the}} ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the combat intelligence center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the <b>fathometer</b> to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor. [...] On 13 March, Triton detected a submerged peak using active sonar and the gravity meter that confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.|$|E
500|$|Fortunately at {{the present}} time we are in an area where the water is deeper than normal for the Atlantic and for a number of hours there is [...] worry about {{unexpectedly}} scraping the top of any unsuspected submerged peak. [...] But we will want that <b>fathometer</b> badly as we approach Cape Horn.|$|E
40|$|A towable sled was {{developed}} at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the waterways Experiment station in con-junction with SIRAD, Inc. S to survey navigation channels with "fluff " or fluid mUd. Fluid mud layers {{on the bottom of}} navigation channels can result in a false bottom record when surveyed with conventional acoustic <b>fathometers.</b> The WES gage was designed to tow along channel bottoms at a specific gravity of about 1. 15 - 1. 20 glcc and coincide with nautical depth. To monitor this towed density value, a nuclear density gage was installed in the original prototype. Field trials have been completed at the Gulfport, MS, Calcasieu, LA, and Sabine Pass, TX navigation channels. Data are presented that show the sled tracks a fairly constant densi ty level at a given site, and that its depth is situated between the high and low frequency acoustic depths in channels with a significant layer of fluid mud...|$|R
40|$|As the {{international}} hydrographic community continues {{to address the}} question of irreducible uncertainty in modern surveys, a similar question must be asked of archived vertical beam echo sounder (VBES) and leadline data sets. The Office of Naval Research funded STRATAFORM project surveyed an area of the New Jersey shelf around 39 deg 122 ̆ 7 N 72 deg 502 ̆ 7 W using an EM 1000 multibeam echosounder (MBES). This area is also covered by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration surveys from 1936 to 1938 (from early visual indicating <b>fathometers)</b> and 1975 - 1976 (VBES). The analysis shows that the earlier data are biased in deeper water, most probably because of 2 ̆ 2 hydrographic rounding 2 ̆ 2 or instrument limitations, and may be unrecoverable, but that the VBES data appear approximately unbiased. Estimates of uncertainty for a surface model generated from the archive data are constructed, taking into account measurement, interpolation, and hydrographic uncertainty (addressing the problems of unobserved areas and surface reconstruction stability). Comparison of predicted depths against the MBES data shows that the VBES-derived surface is consistent given the quoted uncertainty and that the uncertainty corresponds with appropriate hydrographic survey standards. However, spatial aliasing of the VBES surface is observed, which may be the limiting factor in the applicability of this data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although the {{emphasis}} in underwater acoustics {{for the last few}} decades has been in low-frequency acoustics, motivated by long range detection of submarines, there has been a continuing use of high-frequency acoustics in traditional specialized applications such as bottom mapping, mine hunting, torpedo homing and under ice navigation. The attractive characteristics of high-frequency sonar, high spatial resolution, wide bandwidth, small size and relatively low cost must be balanced against the severe range limitation imposed by attenuation that increases approximately as frequency-squared. Many commercial applications of acoustics are ideally served by high-frequency active systems. The small size and low cost, coupled with the revolution in small powerful signal processing hardware has led to the consideration of more sophisticated systems. Driven by commercial applications, there are currently available several commercial-off-the-shelf products including acoustic modems for underwater communication, multi-beam <b>fathometers,</b> side scan sonars for bottom mapping, and even synthetic aperture side scan sonar. Much of the work in high frequency sonar today continues to be focused on specialized applications in which the application is emphasized over the underlying acoustics. Today’s vision for the Navy of the future involves Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs) and off-board ASW sensors. High-frequency acoustics will {{play a central role in}} the fulfillment of this vision as a means of communication and as a sensor. The acoustic communication problems for moving AUVs and deep sensors are discussed. Explicit relationships are derived between the communication theoretic description of channel parameters in terms of time and Doppler spreads and ocean acoustic parameters, group velocities, phase velocities and horizontal wavenumbers. Finally the application of synthetic aperture sonar to the mine hunting problems is described...|$|R
500|$|On 18 February Triton {{conducted}} {{her first}} general daily drill and on 19 February released her first twice-daily hydrographic bottles, {{used to study}} ocean current patterns.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{discovery}} of the “Boulder Patch”, an area of cobbles and boulders with attached kelp and invertebrate life, is reported from Stefansson Sound, near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Geophysical surveys using side-scan sonar and low-frequency recording <b>fathometers</b> reveal that cobbles and boulders occur in patches of various sizes and densities. Despite a seasonal influx of sediments, the Boulder Patch is a nondepositional environment. Physical disruption of cobbles and boulders by deep draft ice is minimal due to offshore islands and shoals which restrict the passage of large ice floes into Stefansson Sound. The apparent absence of similar concentrations of rocks with attached biota along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast is explained by the scarcity of rocks in areas protected from ice abrasion and with no net sediment deposition. In Stefansson Sound, the rocks provide a substratum for a diverse assortment of invertebrates and several species of algae. Recolonization by the biota was minimal on twelve boulders denuded and then left undisturbed for a three-year period. Sedimentation and grazing activity {{appear to be the}} major factors inhibiting recolonization. Linear growth in the kelp, Laminaria solidungula, is greatest in winter and early spring when nutrients are available for new tissue growth. The plant draws on stored food reserves to complete over 90 % of its annual linear growth during the nine months of darkness under a turbid ice canopy. These reserves are accumulated by photosynthetic activity during the preceding summer. The total carbon contribution made by kelp in Stefansson Sound under these conditions is about 146 x lo 6 gyr ” or 7 g. m- 2. yr”. A small percentage of this carbon is consumed directly by herbivores, but its importance to other organisms is not known and is under investigation...|$|R
500|$|Around {{the same}} time in Missouris [...] Combat Information Center (CIC) crew members manning the battleship's navigational radar system noticed that the radar returns {{indicated}} that Missouri was steaming for dangerous waters; however, the CIC crew did not report this information to the captain. Lieutenant John Carr, the officer on duty in the CIC {{at the time of the}} grounding, concluded that the radar equipment was likely not operating correctly. Carr later explained the decision not to report the radar information by stating, [...] "the standard practice on board ship did not call for radar advice to the bridge in the absence of specific requests." [...] He also pointed out that the <b>fathometer,</b> a water depth-reading instrument, was out of order and had not been repaired in the yard.|$|E
500|$|Operation Sandblast {{gathered}} extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, and geophysical data. [...] Water {{samples were}} taken throughout Tritons circumnavigation, which were tested {{for differences in}} chemical composition, salinity, density, and temperature. Such samples were vital for submarine operations. Water salinity and density affects submerged trim, as well as sonar performance, while warmer water affects the efficiency of shipboard condensers and, consequently, ship speed. [...] Measurements from the installed gravity meter provided a continuous record of variations in earth's gravity field throughout Tritons circumnavigation. This extensive gravity study assisted the Navy in developing navigational aids. [...] Some 144 hydrographic bottles to track ocean currents were released during Operation Sandblast.
