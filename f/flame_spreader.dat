50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses {{an inverted}} bell-shaped burner {{topped with a}} <b>flame</b> <b>spreader</b> (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} <b>flame</b> <b>spreader,</b> where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the <b>flame</b> <b>spreader</b> where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the <b>flame</b> <b>spreader</b> and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the <b>flame</b> <b>spreader</b> (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very low fuel output levels, the fuel will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the <b>flame</b> <b>spreader</b> and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.|$|E
5000|$|A central draught lamp, or Argand lamp, {{works in}} the same manner as the flat wick lamp. The burner is {{equipped}} with a tall glass chimney, of around 12 inches tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of cotton, that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a [...] "carrier," [...] which is some form of a toothed rack that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the [...] "central draft" [...] or draft that supplies air to the <b>flame</b> <b>spreader.</b> When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the <b>flame</b> <b>spreader</b> that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.|$|E
5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, {{the fuel tank}} must first be {{pre-heated}} and pressurized by lighting {{a small amount of}} fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank {{at the base of the}} vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the control valve and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan. [...] The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a cotton wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the adjusting key. This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output. The control valve (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a faucet (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a <b>flame</b> <b>spreader)</b> spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.|$|E
