50|$|Dendritic arbor {{formation}} for pyramidal neurons in the cortices occurs progressively {{beginning in}} late embryonic {{stages of development}} and extending well into post-natal periods.

Pyramidal cell dendrites <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> III branch to form arbors <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> I. Thalamocortical afferents will make synaptic contact with dendrites <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> IV while myriad of other inputs will meet dendrites <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> I. The post-synaptic structure is driven in part by signals from incoming afferent fibers and through life there is plasticity in the synapses.|$|R
5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed <b>in</b> six <b>layers.</b> Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> VI. <b>In</b> this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|R
40|$|The {{main input}} to primary sensory cortex is via thalamocortical (TC) axons {{that form the}} {{greatest}} number of synapses <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 4, but also synapse onto neurons <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 6. The development of the TC input to layer 4 has been widely studied, but less is known about the devel-opment of the layer 6 input. Here, we show that, in neonates, the input to layer 6 is as strong as that to layer 4. Throughout the first postnatal week, there is an experience-dependent strengthening specific to layer 4, which correlates with the ability of synapses <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 4, but not <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 6, to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP). This strengthening consists of an increase in axon branching and the divergence of connectivity <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 4 without a change in the strength of individual connections. We propose that experience-driven LTP stabilizes transient TC synapses <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 4 to increase strength and divergence specifically <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 4 over layer 6...|$|R

The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
5|$|As the {{microscopic}} world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped <b>in</b> <b>layers</b> of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and extinction.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones.

5|$|It is {{possible}} for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack <b>in</b> <b>layers</b> and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.|$|E

The pyramid was planned to be about 42 to 45 meters tall, but is now only 17 meters. It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished.

40|$|Fast {{inhibitory}} synaptic {{transmission is}} primarily mediated by synaptically released g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting on postsynaptic GABAA receptors. GABA acting on GABAA receptors produces not only phasic but also tonic inhibitions by persistent activation of extrasynaptic receptors. However, the mechanistic characteristics of tonic inhibition in the neocortex are not wellunderstood. To address this, we studied pharmacologically isolated GABAA receptor [...] mediated currents in neocortical pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. Bath application of bicuculline blocked miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and produced an outward shift in baseline holding current (Ihold). Low concentrations of SR 95531, a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, abolished mIPSCs {{but had no}} significant effect on Ihold. The benzodiazepine midazolam produced an inward shift in I hold by augmenting tonic GABAA receptor [...] mediated currents, which were significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V neurons than <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> II/III. Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed a relatively higher expressions of a 1 anda 5 subunit mRNA <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> V neurons.

The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman.

5|$|The {{array of}} {{different}} types and styles of ceramic found during the excavations of Gedi provide information about the city's trade ties through the origin of imported vessels and aid in dating the site through seriation. At Gedi, a chronology has been established for the appearance {{of many of the}} ceramics, which have been found in deposits up to five feet. The dated tomb with an inscription connecting it to AD 1399 has served as a datum point for dating the stratigraphic layers. Celadon, Islamic monochromes, and blue and white Chinese porcelain were found in levels above the tomb, which date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Below the tomb, yellow and black Islamic wares were found down to the natural soil, while celadon was found <b>in</b> <b>layers</b> immediately below the tomb. The celadon below the tomb varied from the celadon found above the tomb, since carvings of lotus pedals were more common on the celadon in the lower layers. Given the date of the tomb, it was determined that the ceramics above the tomb dated to the fifteenth century, which helped extrapolate dates for the remaining stratigraphy.|$|E

50|$|Long-term {{depression}} {{has also}} been observed in the visual cortex, and it is proposed {{to be involved in}} ocular dominance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a neural model of interval timing, which reproduces the duration discrimination experiments of Wearden (1992). The model comprises 3 layers of neural units. The units <b>in</b> the first <b>layer</b> represent clusters of neurons with probabilistic internal feedback that maintains self-sustained (short-term memory) activity for a random time. The unit <b>in</b> the second <b>layer</b> is a spiking neuron that fires {{as long as}} a sufficient number of input clusters are active. The unit <b>in</b> the third <b>layer</b> detects the offset of firing <b>in</b> the previous <b>layer</b> by producing a short burst of spikes. Analysis and simulation of the model shows spikes produced at random times with a distribution determined by the number of units <b>in</b> the first <b>layer,</b> their survival time constant, and the threshold of the unit <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> 2.

40|$|The {{granular}} retrosplenial cortex (GRS) in the rat has {{a distinct}} microcoluimn-type structure. The apical tufts of dendritic bundles at layer I, which are formed by layer II neurons, co-localize with patches of thalamic terminations from anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV). To further understand this microcolumn-type structure in the GRS, one of remaining questions is whether this structure extends into other layers, such as layers III/IV. Other than layer I, previous tracer injection study showed that AV thalamic nucleus also projects to <b>layer</b> III/IV <b>in</b> the GRS. In this study, we examined the morphology of branches in the GRS from the AV thalamus in single axon branch resolution {{in order to determine}} whether AV axon branches <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> III/IV are branches of axons with extensive branch <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> I, and, if so, whether the extent of these arborizations <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> III/IV vertically matches with that <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> I. For this purpose, we used a small volume injection of biotinylated dextran-amine into the AV thalamus and reconstructing labeled single axon branches in the GRS. We found that the AV axons consisted of heterogeneous branching types. Type 1 had extensive arborization occurring only <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> Ia. Type 2 had additional branches in III/IV. Types 1 and 2 had extensive ramifications <b>in</b> <b>layer</b> Ia, with lateral extensions within the previously reported extensions of tufts from single dendritic bundles (i. e., 30 - 200 &# 181;m; mean 78 &# 181;m).
