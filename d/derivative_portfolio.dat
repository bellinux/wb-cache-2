5000|$|In {{addition}} to the potential loan book transfer to NAMA, the Draft NAMA Business Plan outlined the existence of over 1,000 derivative positions attached to the commercial loans. These loans were transferred to NAMA as well. The nominal value of this <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> was €14.7 billion. Developers and other borrowers in real-estate transactions are often required by lenders to enter into derivative transactions {{as part of a}} loan agreement, as a mechanism to fix the interest rate on the loan. Typically, interest rate swap agreements are used. If interest rates fall, the borrower does not benefit, as he/she must pay the saving to the counter-party of the swap agreement. Given the decline in interest rates over the last 2 years (e.g. the US Federal Funds Rate was 0.25% in late September 2009 versus 5.25% in August 2007), there may be a significant liability relating to the €14.7bn <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The Draft NAMA Business Plan does not elaborate on the magnitude of this liability, however, it states: [...] "These derivatives change the interest rate structure of the underlying loans and their mark-to-market value will be incorporated into the valuation of the loans".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the extent to}} which derivatives pose threats to firms and to the economy. After reviewing the derivatives markets and putting in perspective the various measures of the size of these markets, the paper shows who uses derivatives and why. The difficulties firms face in valuing <b>derivatives</b> <b>portfolios</b> are evaluated. Although academics pay much attention to no-arbitrage pricing results, the paper points out that there can be considerable subjectivity in the pricing of derivatives that do not have highly liquid markets. It is shown that the known risks of <b>derivatives</b> <b>portfolios</b> can generally be measured and managed well at the firm level. However, derivatives can create systemic risks when a market participant becomes excessively large relative to particular derivatives markets. Overall, the benefits of derivatives outweigh the potential threats. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{derivatives}} {{can lead}} to higher yields and lower funding costs. In addition, derivatives are indispensable tools for risk management. We analyze the <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> hedging problems based on value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR). We show that these <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> optimization problems are often ill-posed and the resulting optimal portfolios frequently incur large transaction and management costs. In addition, the optimal portfolio may perform poorly under a slight model error. A CVaR optimization model including a proportional cost is proposed to produce optimal portfolios with fewer instruments and smaller transaction cost with similar expected returns and a small compromise in risk. In addition, we illustrate the importance of sensitivity testing of the hedging performance with respect to model error; the optimal portfolio under a suitable cost consideration performs much more robustly with respect to model error. Finally, we discuss computational issues for large scale CVaR optimization problems and consider a smoothing technique which solves a CVaR optimization problem more eÆciently than the standard linear programming methods...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formulate}} the Risk Management Control {{problem in the}} interest rate area as a constrained stochastic portfolio optimization problem.

The numerical approximation scheme is presented and applied using a single factor interest rate model. It is shown how the whole methodology works in practice, with the implementation of the algorithm for a specific interest rate portfolio. The recent financial crisis showed that risk management of <b>derivatives</b> <b>portfolios</b> especially in the interest rate market is crucial for the stability of the financial system. Modern Value at Risk (VAR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVAR) techniques, although very useful and easy to understand, fail to grasp the need for on-line controlling and monitoring of <b>derivatives</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The portfolios should be designed in a way that risk and return be quantified and controlled in every possible state of the world.

30|$|Note that, if a {{corporate}} holds a bank payable, it typically has {{a desire to}} close it, receive cash, and restructure the hedge with a par contract (the bank would agree to close the deal as a market maker, charging fees for the new trade). Because of this natural selection, a bank is mostly in the receivables in its derivative business with corporates. Hence, the tail-fluctuations of its loss process L are mostly driven by the counterparty default events {{rather than by the}} volatility of the underlying market exposure. As a consequence, working with a deterministic term structure approximation ES(1)(t) of economic capital should be acceptable. If, by exception, the <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> of a bank is mostly in the payables, then all XVA numbers are small and matter much less anyway.|$|E

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2007 global financial crisis, banks started reflecting into derivative pricing the cost of capital and collateral funding through XVA metrics. Here XVA is a catch-all acronym whereby X is replaced by a letter such as C for credit, D for debt, F for funding, K for capital and so on, and VA stands for valuation adjustment. This behaviour is at odds with economies where markets for contingent claims are complete, whereby trades clear at fair valuations and the costs for capital and collateral are both irrelevant to investment decisions.

40|$|Purpose – It is {{the purpose}} of this article to improve {{existing}} methods for risk management, in particular stress testing, for derivative portfolios. The method is explained and compared with other methods, using hypothetical portfolios. Design/methodology/approach – Closed form option pricing formulas are used for valuation. To assess the risk, future price movements are modeled by an empirical distribution in conjunction with a semi-parametrically estimated tail. This approach captures the non-linearity of the portfolio risk and it is possible to estimate the extreme risk adequately. Findings – It is found that this method gives excellent results and that it clearly outperforms the standard approach based on a quadratic approximation and the normal distribution. Especially for very high confidence levels, the improvement is dramatic. Practical implications – In applications of this type the present method is highly preferable to the classical Delta-Gamma cum normal distribution approach. Originality/value – This paper uses a “statistics of extremes” approach to stress testing. With this approach it is possible to estimate the far tail of a <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> adequately. Portfolio investment, Return on capital employed, Statistics...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} credit {{value adjustment}} (CVA) for an outstanding over-the-counter (OTC) <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> is computed {{based on the}} portfolio exposure over its lifetime. Usually, the future portfolio exposure is approximated using the Monte Carlo simulation, as the portfolio value can be driven by several market risk-factors. For derivatives, such as Bermudan swaptions, {{that do not have}} an analytical approximation for their Mark-to-Market (MtM) value, the standard market practice is to use the regression functions from the least squares Monte Carlo method to approximate their MtM along simulated scenarios. However, such approximations have significant bias and noise, resulting in inaccurate CVA charge. In this paper, we extend the Stochastic Grid Bundling Method (SGBM) for the one-factor Gaussian short rate model, to efficiently and accurately compute Expected Exposure, Potential Future exposure and CVA for Bermudan swaptions. A novel contribution of the paper is that it demonstrates how different measures, for instance spot and terminal measure, can simultaneously be employed in the SGBM framework, to significantly reduce the variance and bias of the solution...|$|E

40|$|Portfolio {{optimization}} problems involving Value-at-Risk (VaR) {{are often}} computationally intractable and require complete {{information about the}} return distribution of the portfolio constituents, which is rarely available in practice. These difficulties are further compounded when the portfolio contains derivatives. We develop two tractable conservative approximations for the VaR of a <b>derivative</b> <b>portfolio</b> by evaluating the worst-case VaR over all return distributions of the derivative underliers with given first- and second-order moments. The derivative returns are modelled as convex piecewise linear or - by using a delta-gamma approximation - as (possibly non-convex) quadratic functions of the returns of the derivative underliers. These models lead to new Worst-Case Polyhedral VaR (WCPVaR) and Worst-Case Quadratic VaR (WCQVaR) approximations, respectively. WCPVaR is a suitable VaR approximation for portfolios containing long positions in European options expiring {{at the end of}} the investment horizon, whereas WCQVaR is suitable for portfolios containing long and/or short positions in European and/or exotic options expiring beyond the investment horizon. We prove that WCPVaR and WCQVaR optimization can be formulated as tractable second-order cone and semidefinite programs, respectively, and reveal interesting connections to robust portfolio optimization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating non-linear relationships between the asset returns into a worst-case VaR model.
