500|$|Vickers {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first career win {{in front of the}} crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient." [...] Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus, was annoyed: [...] "I just don't think [...] has the talent to understand what he has underneath him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tennant {{appeared}} in Derren Brown's Trick or Treat. In TV & Satellite Week [...] (26 April – 2 May issue), Brown {{is quoted as}} saying: [...] "One of the appeals of Doctor Who for David is time travel, so I wanted to give him that experience. He was open and up for it, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reaction. He's a real screamer!" [...] The episode aired on Channel 4 on 16 May 2008, and showed Tennant apparently predicting future events correctly by using automatic writing. Tennant also returned for the final episode of the series {{with the rest of}} the participants from the other episodes in the series to take part in one final experiment.|$|E
60|$|I had the {{satisfaction}} of startling Jane at last. She turned her head and looked at me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> square, satisfying gaze into her big, blackish-blue eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> bump," [...] {{answered}} the youngest Rover, [...] "and I guess I'm {{going to have}} a lump there as a consequence." ...|$|R
60|$|SIR PATRICK [meditatively] Yes: <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> saw: <b>a</b> useful, handy instrument.|$|R
60|$|And {{before the}} morrow came he had sought and found Him, and <b>I</b> doubt not <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> place.|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Resolutely] I can't tell you--and I won't. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason--and that's all {{you need}} to know. I can't marry you, that's all there is to it. [Distractedly.] So, for Gawd's sake, let's talk of {{something}} else.|$|E
60|$|Out of {{the tail}} of my eye I saw the center fielder running. When I rounded first base <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at this fielder, and though I had seen the {{greatest}} outfielders the game ever produced, I never saw one that covered ground so swiftly as he.|$|E
6000|$|... "I studied law--and practised {{for a year}} or two in Washington; but I didn't like my position; I {{was neither}} white nor colored, so when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance I went out to service with a senator as body-servant." [...] He stopped {{abruptly}} as though that were all of his tale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing, only <b>I</b> reckon we've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> hold on Mr. Aaron Poole now--in case {{he tries}} to make a {{complaint}} against you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, now, whar'd I hear thet name? <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> plumb <b>good</b> memory fer names an' faces. 'Pears I heerd thet name in Cheyenne, last summer.... <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it. Cowpuncher named Panhandle rode down street draggin' {{a bolt of}} red calico thet unwound an' stampeded all the hosses. Might thet lad have {{happened}} to be you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{price for}} the horse!' said he to himself when he shook all his money out in a heap in his room. 'This will put Big Klaus in a rage when he hears how rich I have become through my one horse; but I won't tell him just yet!' ...|$|R
60|$|Pretty {{soon after}} that I was sick, and used up, and had {{to go off to}} the Hot Springs. When there, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many letters from commanders saying they wanted me to come back. I declined, because I wasn't well enough or strong enough; but I kept still, and kept the {{reputation}} I had made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{the bearer}} of bad news, sir. Nothing at all could {{be seen from the}} top; but in the cross-trees, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look through the smoke, and am sorry to say the French rear-admiral is coming down fast on our larboard-quarter, with all his force. We shall have him abeam in five minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One fellow {{looked like}} Langside, though I couldn't swear to him; but I'd {{know the man}} who knifed my horse. Remembered that would be desirable, in case he escaped me; and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at him. Now, if you feel able shall we make a start? I'm afraid the horse is too lame to carry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> guess she's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{right to}} be. I wasn't certain {{whether it was}} her or Miss Saunders first when I saw her, the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, then, I'll try. I {{mean that}} you are not {{satisfied}} with this world {{and those of us who}} live here. You keep trying to fashion another--oh! yes, you have been at it from a boy, you see <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> memory, <b>I</b> remember all your 'vision stories'--and then you try to imagine its inhabitants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mr. Goodenough said, [...] "you {{need not}} go without it till they come back, for I {{can give you}} eight bottles which will last you for two months. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> supply, and as I never use it for trade unless a chief {{particularly}} wants it, I can very well spare it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harris {{snapped off}} the light. The room was pitch black. [...] "I'll run this first reel for you. The subject {{is one of}} the best {{biologists}} stationed at the Garrison. Robert Bradshaw. He came in yesterday. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> run from the shock box because Bradshaw's mind is so highly differentiated. There's a lot of repressed material of a non-rational nature, more than usual." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Amanuensis {{has been}} ill, {{and after the}} above trial petered out. I must return to my own, lone Waverley. The captain refused, telling me why; and at last I had to beat up for people almost with prayers. However, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lot, {{as you will see}} by the {{accompanying}} newspaper report. The road contained this inscription, drawn up by the chiefs themselves: ...|$|E
60|$|My cold {{has been}} oppressive, {{and is not}} yet gone. I have been very hard to sleep too, and last night I was all but sleepless. This morning I was very dull and seedy; but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> walk, and picked up again. It has been blowing all day, and I fear we shall have a sick passage over to Dublin to-morrow night.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny had a fair night, and we {{are both}} {{tolerable}} this morning, only the yoke of correspondence lies on me heavy. I beg you will let this go on to my mother. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start in your letter, that I kept on at it, and I have neither time nor energy for more.--Yours ever, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's more in my line {{than you}} suppose, Mr. Ricker," [...] said the young fellow. [...] "It's a subject I've looked up {{a great deal}} lately. I once thought"--he looked down bashfully--"of trying to write a play about <b>a</b> defaulter, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{together}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many facts about defalcation. You've no idea how common it is; it's about the commonest fact of our civilization." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Dear Daddy,I {{have decided}} to go to Austin because <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job offer. <b>I</b> am sorry that I decided to leave but I just had to go.PS I will be back in late August.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know if it}} is {{usual for}} a woman to speak at a {{business}} meeting, but I have a number of shares in the line and it's long since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dividend," [...] she said. [...] "Two per cent is ridiculous and my lawyer tells me I could get four per cent, where the security is really good." [...] She paused and added naïvely: [...] "To have twice as much to spend would be very nice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently I heard {{a slight}} noise behind me, and turning around I saw in a dim way {{the figure of}} a man behind me. He was bending down under the gun, as if he was hunting for something. I was just on the point of {{speaking}} to him when he straightened up and slunk away as silently as a ghost. I watched him, and when he got under the rays of the electric light <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at his face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'August 1st.--Very tired 7 A.M., Prayers 7.20-8.20, school 8.20-10; baptized 55 {{infants and}} young children. Now it is past 1; a boisterous day, though as yet no rain. I had {{a cup of}} cocoa at 6.30, and at 10.30 a plate of rice {{and a couple of}} eggs, nice clean fare. The weather is against me, so cold, wet, and so boisterous. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> night though, for I sent Mrs. Rhoda and her squalling baby to another house, and so slept quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--yes; in {{one sense}} I had; but you don't {{understand}} about business. You had better not interrupt me now as <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal to say {{before we get to}} the Square. It will suit me to give up the rooms. I don't like them, and they are very dear. As you yourself said, it will be a capital thing for us to go and stay with your father." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{wondered}} why she said it with such stooping shame, but he went on mildly, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> price, but of course I don't want to take any chances on running short of coin, so I'm not splurging much. And----" [...] He looked at his nails, and whistled a bar or two, and turned his head away, and looked back with a shy, [...] "And I'm learning to play bridge and tennis and stuff!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Doubtless Mrs. Gaylord {{saw that}} her husband wished to talk about Marcia, and must be helped {{to do so by}} a little perverseness. [...] "I don't know but what most of folks would say 't she'd made out pretty well. <b>I</b> guess she's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> provider." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours, of course," [...] {{answered}} Jane. [...] "Billy {{wants to}} marry you. He's always been crazy about you--and now father has given him the upper farm in his own name and there's nothing {{to prevent him from}} getting married. But he's so shy he couldn't ask you himself if you'd have him, so he got me to do it. I'd rather not have, but he gave me no peace till I said I would, if <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance. What do you think about it, Anne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{and your}} folks feel that way about it, I'd like very much to meet the old man again and {{have a talk with}} him. Of course, {{he told me that he}} never wanted to hear your father's name mentioned; but if <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> chance I might be able to get him to open up and tell me his side of the story. And after he had done that, he might be more willing to listen to what I had to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{done wrong}} sleepin' here," [...] was his vindication. [...] "This ain't your property. It's agin the law. An' folks that go agin the law go to jail, {{as the two}} of you'll go. I've sent many a tramp up for thirty days for sleepin' in this very shack.

Are you goin' to give in an' come peaceable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was there}} an hour or so--him and me alone--discussin' trade. <b>I</b> reckon he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing outer that curled horse hair, for <b>I</b> see he's <b>got</b> in <b>an</b> invoice o' cushions. I've stored 'em all in the forrard {{bulkhead}} until he sends for 'em, ez Mr. Renshaw hez taken the loft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not always; {{occasionally}} {{one gets}} hit hard, but nineteen {{times out of}} twenty, if one is careful, one wins. The great thing is always to have enough in hand to pay your losses {{the day after the}} race; and as one receives all the money when the bets are made, two or three months before a race, it is hard if one cannot do that. In this way <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> name, am looked upon as a safe man, and so am getting <b>a</b> <b>good</b> business together.|$|R
5000|$|... "For {{the first}} and only time, I was more worried about getting hurt by the crowd than by the guy I was fighting. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>good</b> blast when introduced.
