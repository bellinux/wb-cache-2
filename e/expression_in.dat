5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
40|$|The Phrasebook {{pattern is}} a {{technique}} to separate <b>expressions</b> <b>in</b> one language from the main code that is written in another programming language. This is done by keeping the <b>expressions</b> <b>in</b> a separate phrasebook.

This separation makes maintenance easier both for the main application code and for the foreign language code.

5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal tract, which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal tract. Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal tract formation.|$|E

5|$|Gene <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> prokaryotes is {{influenced}} by an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E

5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 <b>expression</b> <b>in</b> the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
