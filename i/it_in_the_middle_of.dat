Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds, however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using [...] "Virgilianised" [...] syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as Greek, Italian, Latin, and Provençal. For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling to start <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "Century," [...] or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh [...] "Century" [...] have not survived in any extant edition.|$|E

The plastered, whitewashed walls, about [...] thick, are in good repair and stand [...] high. Entrance to the courtyard is from the north through the ruin of a little square domed building. There are two Hebrew inscriptions on the south wall. An additional English inscription notes that the structure was entirely rebuilt at the expense of the English consul at Damascus by early 1868.The tomb itself measures [...] long and stands [...] high.

The tomb is not in line with the walls of the courtyard, which have a bearing of 202°, nor is <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the enclosure, being nearest to the west wall. Two short plastered pedestals with shallow cup-shaped hollows at their tops stand at the head and foot of the tomb.

Both Jews and Samaritans burn oil lamps and incense in the pillar cavity.|$|E

[...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action-adventure… but the finale wasn't as mind-bending as [...] season's farewell, during which we received the show's first flash-forward." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel ever so slightly disappointed by all of this." [...] He also found the special effects [...] "looked much shoddier than usual" [...] and praised the score. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press thought that [...] "it might be the most rewarding, deliciously challenging episode {{in the history of this}} mystical ABC serial." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "Part 2" [...] "was perhaps the most action-packed, meaningful episode of television I've watched all year. [...] The pace was excellent, and the revelations were plentiful." [...] Compora also wrote that [...] "though the pace was considerably slower, the finale delivered in a big way … it was [...] well written and well directed in its own right." ...|$|E

2500|$|The fall of Kartasura {{made the}} palace inauspicious {{for the king}} and Pakubuwana II built a new kraton in Surakarta or Solo and moved there in 1746. However, Pakubuwana II was far from secure in this throne. Raden Mas Said, or Pangeran Sambernyawa (meaning [...] "Soul Reaper"), son of banished Arya Mangkunegara, who later would {{establish}} the princely house of Mangkunagara in Solo, and several other princes of the royal blood still maintained rebellion. Pakubuwana II declared that anyone who can suppress the rebellion in Sukawati, areas around present day Sragen, would be rewarded with 3000 households. Pangeran Mangkubumi, Pakuwana II’s brother, who would later establish the royal house of Yogyakarta took the challenge and defeated Mas Said in 1746. But when he claimed his prize, his old enemy, patih Pringgalaya, advised the king against <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> this problem, VOC’s Governor General, van Imhoff, {{paid a visit to}} the kraton, the first one to do so during the whole history of the relation between Mataram and VOC, to confirm the de facto Dutch possession of coastal and several interior regions. Pakubuwana II hesitantly accepted the cession in lieu of 20,000 real per year. Mangkubumi was dissatisfied with his brother’s decision to yield to van Imhoff’s insistence, which was made without consulting the other members of royal family and great nobles. van Imhoff had neither experience nor tactfulness to understand the delicate situation in Mataram and he rebuked Mangkubumi as “too ambitious” before the whole court when Mangkubumi claimed the 3000 households. This shameful treatment from a foreigner who had wrested the most prosperous lands of Mataram from his weak brother led him to raise his followers into rebellion in May 1746, this time with the help of Mas Said.|$|E

2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, and now that I have been formed, it is as if I had not been formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
