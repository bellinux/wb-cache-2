The mutual relationship between genera or even between species are not known, except for the species list and the host specification. Moreover, there is an anambiguous use of their species concept. Some authors consider Strepsiptera as the specialists and they match almost every host species with one separate strepsipteran parasite. The opposite concept is to consider strepsiptera as the generalists. The presence of the crypctic species also affect {{our understanding of the}} diversity of Strepsiptera. Therefore, the knowledge of Strepsiptera phylogeny provide us the important information about species diversity of studied group as well as about their coevolution with their hosts. On the basis of molecular analyses of three genes constructed the phylogeny genus Stylops.

40|$|International audiencePopulations of herbivorous {{insects are}} {{naturally}} consumed by other predacious or predatory <b>insect</b> species. These <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects</b> are thus plant-dwelling organisms {{that use the}} plant for several vital functions and are affected by plant traits at the evolutionary, organism and population levels. Many entomophagous species are used for the biological control of insect pests worldwide. The aim of this chapter is to provide an exhaustive review of mechanisms underlying the interactions between plants and <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects,</b> including those governing life history traits at the individual level, {{as well as those}} acting on population and community structure and dynamics. We detail how properties of host-infested plants determine parasitism behaviour, development (in the case of parasitoids) and nectar consumption by adult <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> We detail how plants respond to and benefit from natural enemies attacking insect herbivores.

40|$|The {{disposability}} of {{high numbers}} of <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects</b> for their use in biological control strategies is an old objective carried on, between others, by the rearing in different kinds of artificial diets. The definition and the perfecting of these diets are at first based on nutritional studies. Food or carcass analyses, nutritional balance studies, and deletion/supplementation methods allow to evaluate the different nutritional needs. Nitrogen sources are the most critical needs especially with fast growing <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> Lipids and carbohydrates mainly constitute energy sources with storage possibility. Other nutrients such as salts and vitamins are also needed, and sometimes some specific polyunsaturated fatty acids. There are other important physiological requirements, concerning the digestion process, the respiration, or the hormonal balances. Physico-chemical factors such as Osmotic Pressure and pH often show critical values for the normal development, mostly of endoparasitoid insects. For egg parasitoids and predators, {{the presentation of the}} food is of prime importance for a normal food intake, and finally for the success of the rearing. Sterilization of the diet or incorporation of preservative agents is often necessary for preventing bacterial or fungal contaminations. Many successes were obtained for artificial rearing of <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects,</b> but ultimate efforts are still needed for crucial improvements and supports that may lead to the extension of the use of this biological control strategy...|$|R

40|$|The braconid wasps {{represent}} one of {{the greatest}} family of the superfamily Ichneumonoidea inside Hymenoptera, to which we range Ichneumonidae and 8 small families, furthermore. The last catalogue of Braconidae enumerated 3731 species (Szépligeti, 1904). At present the number of the known species comprises all in all 13000. A new catalogue is published by Shenefelt since 1969. The plurality of the new braconid species are waited to discover outside Europe and North America on one hand and on the other the supposed number of the species living on the Earth is estimated about 30000. The modern classification distinguishes 20 subfamilies of Braconidae. The subfamilies mostly represent both taxonomical units and evolutionary trends (Tobias 1967, Papp 1974). The braconids arc primary parasites, neither secondary nor tertier braconid prasites are not known except Syntretus Först. There is not at all non-parasites braconid. They are parasitic exclusively during their Iarval stage, mostly in the larva of their hosts. True egg-parasites not among them. In their host-spectrum the caterpillars are predominate, the species of Opiinae-Alysiinae-Dacnbsinae are parasitic in different flies (Diptera), relatively small is the number of the braconid parasites of beetles and bugs. During their, parasitic life the braconids contribute a very important role in the terrestrial coenosae. In Szélenyi 2 ̆ 7,s (1955) biocoenological concept the braconids appear as two, structural elements (coetus) during a year incorporated in very much food-chain. In their instar stage as -obstant elements consuming animals (first of all caterpillars i. e. corrumpent elements), and in their imaginal stage as sustinent elements promoting the pollination of plants. The last role is much less significant than that of their obstancy. Highly important is their parasitic life in connection with that phenomenon of the coenosae which is named recently as biological circulation. Namely they take a high part in the checking of the prolification of their hosts over the quantity necessary. The plurality of the corrumpent elements posses a more or less series of <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects</b> parasitizing them in their different developmental stege (i. e. from oval to imaginal stages). This phenomenon is disclosed as parasite-chain theory. In the, light of this theory it is necessary to study not only egg-parasites (relatively the most useful <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects)</b> but instar, pupal, and imaginal parasites too. Recently was established that the most effective are the oligophagous parasites.

40|$|One of the {{negative}} consequences of globalization is the increased introduction of exotic pests into new areas.

Introduction and conservation of beneficial insects {{are two ways}} to increase natural control of pests. Whether massive releases of <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects</b> are expensive and time consuming, the preservation of predator natural populations can be expected by reducing and by adapting chemical treatments in crop fields. Vegetable cultivated areas increased in Belgium for several years, mainly Fabaceae species such as peas and beans. In this work, the evolution of ladybird species population was assessed from May to June in broad bean fields (Vicia faba L.) between Waremme and Hannut, in Hesbaye.

40|$|Abstract—To defend {{themselves}} against herbivory, plants {{use a variety of}} direct and indirect strategies involving induced increases in secondary substances. Species of the Allium genus (Alliaceae), such as the leek Allium porrum (L.), produce nonprotein sulfur amino acids derived from cysteine, i. e., alk(en) yl-cysteine sulfoxides that are precursors of volatile thiosulfinates and disulfides. These defend most species including the specialist leek moth, Acrolepiopsis assectella. We determined by measuring the increase in the sulfur precursor propyl-cysteine sulfoxide (PCSO) if production of this precursor is induced in response to moth attack and mechanical wounding. The concentration of PCSO was determined by HPLC in 2 - or 6 -mo-old leeks after attacks of various intensity either by the specialist leek moth or by a generalist moth, Agrotis ipsilon. Injury-induced release of sulfur volatiles was measured by GC/MS after the attacks. Results showed an increase in the production of sulfur compounds in both the precursor and volatile form, occurring only in association with intensive attacks by leek moths. The increase in sulfur precursors also led to an increase in the release of sulfur volatiles. This induced response may provide an effective defense strategy against the plant’s main natural enemy, both directly and indirectly by attracting <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> Key WordsVAcrolepiopsis assectella, Allium porrum, constitutive defenses, induced defenses, sulfur compounds, disulfides, thiosulfinates, propyl-cysteine sulfoxide, specialist insect, tritrophic interactions...|$|R

On the other side, some egg parasitoid species also attack predaceous bugs, thus affecting the efficacy of these important <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> Most studied stink bug egg parasitoids belong to Platygastridae (=Scelionidae) and Encyrtidae, the main research topics concerning behavior, chemical ecology, behavioural ecology and field efficacy. Some species have been used for biological control programs. However, some constraints may prevent egg parasitoids from becoming effective agents in inundative biocontrol projects, the most important being incomplete behavioral and ecological knowledge for most species and inefficient mass production. Thus, understanding the host selection strategies of egg parasitoids and the chemical stimuli involved would lead to enhanced biological control through behavioral manipulation of egg parasitoids in the field, and to the development of better rearing methods. Egg parasitoids of herbivorous stink bugs may adopt differing host selection strategies, the most important being the exploitation of kairomones from non-target instars in combination with host-induced plant synomones (indirect resistance), and associative learning. The chemically mediated behavior of these wasps may be exploited, e. g., through the development of plants with elevated expression of indirect induced resistance, or spraying fields with resistance elicitors. Important elements toward implementation include procedures for selection of egg parasitoids, evaluation of their specificity, risk assessment of new introductions, release methods, and quality control.

Results indicated that biological parameters of T. dendrolimi were affected differently by six ingredients of the artificial medium: pupal hemolymph of Antheraea pernyi (Guerin-Meneville) (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), egg yolk, 10 % malted milk solution, Neisenheimer's salt solution, trehalose, and sterile water. Statistical analysis indicated that trehalose and Neisenheimer's salt solution, 10 % malted milk solution, and pupal hemolymph of A. pernyi were the main ingredients of the artificial medium based on rates of parasitism and pupation, the number of larvae developing in each artificial egg, adult emergence rate, {{and the number of}} normal adults produced.

Further it is known that the concentration of potassium ions in the haemolymph of phytophagous insects is far higher than that in predatory forms; this has led to the suggestion that the nerve sheath in plant feeding insects should be more highly developed than that of <b>entomophagous</b> <b>insects.</b> In this work the structure of the nerve sheath in phytophagous and predatory insects has been studied and this assumption has been shown to be groundles. However, preliminary experiments on the effects of ions and drugs on the peripheral nerves of phytophagous and predatory insects have shown that there is a definite difference in susceptibility between the nerves of these two forms and this has led to the postulate of a diffusion barrier beneath the level of the nerve sheath, which is more highly developed in phytophagous than in predatory forms. The properties of this second barrier are discussed. Part 1. During the course of the work which has been described in Part 1 - an outbreak of large saturniid moths Nudaurelia cytherea capensis Stoll.) occurred in the Grahamstown area. It was felt that an investigation into the properties of the flight motor of this moth, which has an extremely low wing beat frquency, might be rewarding as our knowledge of the flight motor in insects is limited to those with very much higher wing beat frequencies than that of this moth. The anatomy, innervation and histology of the flight muscles of Nudaurelia are described and it is shown that the flight motor of this moth is functionally different to that of other insects which have been investigated.

With {{the aim of}} controlling these infestations, mathematical models simulating the biological development of the insect {{as a function of}} temperature, which were developed in Texas (USA) and adapted to the climatic conditions in southern France, were used within the framework of an experimental research study on sorghum. The hypothesis put forward clearly accounts for the local dynamics of this <b>insect.</b> <b>Entomophagous</b> parasitoids (Aprostocetus spp.) of sorghum midges were also found to be present...|$|R
