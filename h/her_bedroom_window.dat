Her parents were John Ramsay Darling, a science teacher at Winchester College and Patricia Rosemary, who was a nurse and a Quaker.

Belote hit Christian with a cuspidor, commonly called a spittoon. The altercation escalated when Christian and Belote ran for two broom handles Belote used to prop up <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows.</b> Christian grabbed one of the broom handles and struck Belote on the forehead.

25|$|Resident {{advocates of}} the housing {{initiative}} were treated with abuse and threats. Leading advocate Ethel Lawrence, a poor black resident who lived her life in Mount Laurel, had her house repeatedly vandalized, and once <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> was damaged by gunfire. Longtime white residents also tried to force the poor black residents out of town. Although the court {{ruled in favor of}} creating affordable housing, residents did manage to delay the process for decades.|$|E

50|$|Bark {{from a tree}} outside Worledge's {{window was}} found on <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> floor. A small hole had been cut in the flyscreen of her window, but {{forensic}} tests revealed {{that it had been}} cut from the inside. Police believed the hole was too small to have been used by the abductor, and scientific evidence found it unlikely that Worledge was taken through <b>her</b> open <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

"In {{the video}} for angry rock-pop track [...] "Over," [...] Lindsay stares at a {{neighbor}} boy from <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> wears too much black eye makeup, hooks up with said {{boy in a}} random trailer and cries... a lot. This video has a completely over-the-top dramatic ending with Lindsay doing donuts with the neighbor boy in a vintage car (amazing), only to be interrupted by his abusive father. Lindsay cries more, breaks through a window with her heel and shatters a lamp on the ground. Yes, Lindsay, yes. We love it when you're angry." ...|$|E

500|$|Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, {{three were}} spawned in the {{southern}} portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF-1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly {{in the form of}} shingles and roof covering torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, the garage door was damaged, causing the door to blow in, which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a [...] boat was flipped on its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, a tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm Beach County before lifting back up; it resulted in no damage.|$|E

Distraught, Diane reconciles with Lloyd at the gym where he trains.|$|R
500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> and it continued sounding, she opened <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to <b>her</b> first-floor <b>bedroom.</b> While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through <b>her</b> second-floor <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|R
500|$|Tracey Ross was {{originally}} hesitant {{to audition for}} another soap opera after her stint as Diana Douglas on Ryan's Hope from 1985 to 1987, which she compared to [...] "working in a morgue" [...] because the show was constantly threatened with cancellation. She initially rejected the offer to play Eve Russell, but she was repeatedly contacted by NBC about the role over several months before her agent convinced her to audition for Passions casting director Jackie Briskey. Ross said later {{that she did not}} realize that Passions was supposed to be [...] "wacky" [...] until the character Grace Bennett floated out of <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> Based on the first week's scripts, she described Passions as [...] "my kind of show" [...] owing to the supernatural and fantasy elements. Ross played the role from the series debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and Kimberly Kevon Williams played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her time as a nightclub singer. Ross described Passions as the opposite of Ryan's Hope; Passions, she felt, was [...] "the spring of a soap opera" [...] because of the cast and crew's excitement about future storylines, while Ryan's Hope was [...] "the winter of one" [...] due to the fear of cancellation.|$|E

5000|$|Tony meets a {{seemingly}} polite and respectful neighbor, a boy his own age, Joel Hoober. While Joel's manners impress Mr. and Mrs. Miglione, Tony sees Joel's true colors in private. Joel secretly engages in misbehavior such as prank calls, underage drinking, hiding issues of Playboy magazine under his bed, and shoplifting, and encourages Tony to participate as well. Tony starts to experience inexplicable abdominal pain {{brought on by}} his anxiety over his new friend's antics. Tony also develops an infatuation with Joel's beautiful teenage sister Lisa, who routinely undresses near <b>her</b> uncovered <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> motivating Tony to watch her from his own <b>bedroom</b> <b>window.</b> He is going through puberty and must deal with the physical changes in his body, such as wet dreams and erections, {{on top of the}} major changes in his family life. It is implied that he masturbates and thinks of Lisa when he does it.|$|R
60|$|On these {{occasions}} our {{positions were}} reversed, I being the admiring spectator of her prowess. Yet to {{me she was}} ever meek, almost irritatingly submissive. She found out where I lived and would often come and wait for me for hours, her little face pressed tight against the iron railings, until either I came out or shook my head at <b>her</b> from my <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> when she would run off, the dying away into silence of her pattering feet leaving me a little sad.|$|R
50|$|During the summer, the {{youngest}} sister, Cecilia, slits her wrist in a bathtub, but survives. After her parents allow her sisters {{to throw a}} chaperoned basement party intended {{to make her feel}} better, she excuses herself and jumps out of <b>her</b> second story <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> dying when she is impaled on an iron fence below. In the wake of her act, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from the community and heightens the air of mystery surrounding the girls; to the neighborhood boys in particular.|$|R

5000|$|At Mott Manor, Dora (Patti LaBelle) {{is dressed}} in costume as Woody Woodpecker, Dandy (Finn Wittrock) throws a tantrum after Gloria (Frances Conroy) gives him a box {{containing}} a Howdy Doody costume. Dandy decides to craft the pieces into a clown costume. Later, Dandy dressed in the costume, threatens Dora with a knife. She tells him that she is aware of his animal kills, and {{that he does not}} [...] "have the guts" [...] to kill a human.

In a Palm Beach neighborhood, Jessie (Lauren Gobuzzi), is teased by her older brother Mike (Dalton E. Gray). Twisty (John Carroll Lynch) approaches from behind him. Mike screams, causing their mother to run upstairs. She asks where Mike went - Jessie points to <b>her</b> <b>bedroom's</b> open <b>window.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Most of {{the rooms}} were {{completely}} dismantled, or had only ghastly rags of torn leather or tapestry hanging to their walls. The upper windows, however, were merely obscured by dust and cobwebs. <b>Her</b> own <b>bedroom</b> <b>windows</b> only showed the tall front of an opposite house, but climbing to the higher storey, she could see at the back over the garden wall the broad sheet of the Thames, covered with boats and wherries, and the banks provided with steps and stairs, {{at the opening of}} every street on the opposite side, where she beheld a confused mass of trees, churches, and houses. Nearer, the view to the westward was closed in by a stately edifice which she did not know to be Somerset House; and from another window {{on the east side of}} the house she saw, over numerous tiled roofs, a gateway which she guessed to be Temple Bar, and a crowded thoroughfare, where the people looked like ants, toiling towards the great dome that rose in the misty distance. Was this the way she was to see London? ...|$|R
5000|$|The play {{takes place}} during the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War. Its heroine, Raina Petkoff, is a young Bulgarian woman engaged to Sergius Saranoff, one of the heroes of that war, whom she idolizes. On the night after the Battle of Slivnitza, a Swiss {{mercenary}} soldier in the Serbian army, Captain Bluntschli, climbs in through <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> balcony <b>window</b> and threatens to shoot Raina if she gives the alarm. When Russian/Bulgarian troops burst in to search the house for him, Raina hides him so that he won't be killed. He asks her to remember that [...] "nine soldiers out of ten are born fools." [...] In a conversation after the soldiers have left, Bluntschli's attitude towards war and soldiering (pragmatic and practical as opposed to Raina's idealistic views) shocks her, especially after {{he admits that he}} uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than cartridges for his pistol. When the search dies down, Raina and her mother Catherine sneak Bluntschli out of the house, disguised in an old housecoat.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} Miss Drewitt, peeping {{cautiously}} from <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> saw Mr. Tredgold perched {{up in the}} crow’s-nest with the telescope.

6000|$|She stoically {{looked from}} <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>window,</b> and {{contemplated}} her fate {{as if it}} were written {{on the top of the}} church-tower hard by.

Presently her father emerged in a brilliant but ancient dressing gown, his white locks waving on the breeze.|$|E
5000|$|The video {{features}} {{school children}} enacting {{scenes from the}} first two Spider-Man films on stage, with the band playing the song. It opens with a scene showing the children's parents making {{their way into the}} hall beside a board reading: [...] "Tonight: Spider-Man". The curtain opens and children dressed as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson appear on stage, with Parker taking photographs of Watson. A boy dressed as a spider is then shown being pulled up with ropes. He is then lowered down to the stage and proceeds to bite Parker on the neck. The next scenes show Parker's affinity for Watson, with Parker peeking at <b>her</b> through his <b>bedroom</b> <b>window</b> while she combs her hair.
