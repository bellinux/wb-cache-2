5|$|The Ju 88s arrived {{over the}} target at Kenley {{to find a}} smoke pall hanging over the target. It was {{impossible}} to begin dive-bombing attacks under those conditions. Given the amount of damage to Kenley, it also seemed unnecessary to the bomber crews. As they were deciding what action to take, they were attacked. The Bf 109s led by Hannes Trautloft had a <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> of defending the Ju 88s. After passing Biggin Hill {{on their way to}} RAF West Malling British AAA fire began targeting the formation. One Ju 88 was hit, and Trautloft gave it special protection. As he manoeuvred himself into position, the formation was jumped by Spitfires and Hurricanes. One Ju 88 was lost to 32 Squadron's Pilot Officer Bolesław Własnowolski. As they attack began, the Ju 88s turned to West Malling, and began dive-bombing attacks as an alternate target.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a {{prominent}} United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General {{at the conclusion of}} that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him as a president who performed a <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> with some merit, and took strong action on civil rights for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|As {{to whether}} her {{comments}} about Waters {{had been as}} continuous and negative as Perkins-Graham and Ballew had asserted, Churchill testified {{that she had not}} had a problem with Waters and felt she could have a good working relationship with her. Welty, the chief shift nurse on duty that night, who had overheard most of the conversation from the nearby nurses' station, corroborated Churchill's version. She further recalled that Perkins-Graham had said she had only one reservation about transferring to obstetrics—Waters. Churchill, Welty testified, had actually defended Waters, saying she had a <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> and was sometimes moody, but that could be accommodated.|$|E

25|$|The loader {{also had}} a <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> {{due to the lack}} of a turret basket (a {{rotating}} floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34's turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the floor boxes, leaving the floor littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.|$|E
25|$|The label was {{originally}} known as The Shinoda Imprint, named after Mike Shinoda. Machine Shop {{was born in}} drummer Rob Bourdon's living room in 1999 when the band was packing CDs and stickers into boxes to send to their very first fans. The label only {{had the potential to}} release the extended plays for the bands fan club annually. Shinoda wanted to release albums of Linkin Park under the label, but the albums were already managed by the parent company Warner Bros. Records, and managing the albums on his alone basis was a <b>difficult</b> <b>job.</b> The first release under the label was for the fan club, LP Underground 2.0, which was released on November 18, 2002. The label also made available some enhanced features, such as T-shirts, sticker, key-chain, a band picture, guitar pick and membership card. The album was co produced by Don Gilmore with Shinoda. On November 17, 2003, the label released another extended play for the LPU fan club, entitled LP Underground 3.0, which featured the unreleased songs in the live album Live in Texas (which was released on November 18, 2003 through the record label).|$|E
25|$|The {{unpainted}} stainless body creates challenges during {{restoration of}} the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original ("straight") as possible and imperfections are sculpted back to form with body filler like Bondo or lead (body solder). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the quarter panel). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain—which is a tremendously <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work-harden. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired; each DeLorean service center today {{has at least one}} experienced body repair person on staff, and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances.|$|E

500|$|As a director, Manjrekar {{believed}} that the mansion shown in the film [...] "plays a major character" [...] and was certain that finding the appropriate mansion would be a <b>difficult</b> <b>job.</b> The production designing team had searched for various location across Konkan {{but most of the}} mansions had electrical wiring across which was a major obstacle for the shooting as Konkan then did not have electricity. Finally, Manjrekar was introduced to a mansion owned by Avinash Nene near Paalshet which suited the period where third and final schedule of the film was carried out.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the Campbell Case {{brought down}} the Labour {{minority}} government and forced a general election. Birkett returned to Nottingham East to campaign for his re-election, though he faced a much more <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> than he had in 1923. The Conservative candidate, Edmund Brocklebank, was much stronger {{than in the previous}} election, and the left-wing vote was split because he was also campaigning against Tom Mann, a noted Communist. A few days before the election, a letter allegedly addressed to the Communist Party was published that mentioned organising uprisings in British colonies; fear of the [...] "socialist menace" [...] drove many voters to the right, and in the election on 29 October 1924, many Liberal members of parliament, including Birkett, lost their seats to Conservatives.|$|E
500|$|The D-1 used {{separate}} loading ammunition, {{with eight}} different charges. The charges included the [...] "full charge" [...] Zh-536 and smaller charges {{ranging from the}} [...] "first" [...] to [...] "sixth", which was the smallest. A [...] "special charge" [...] was used with the BP-540 HEAT projectile. Propellant charges were produced in [...] "full" [...] and [...] "third" [...] variants in munitions factories. All other charges were derived from them by removing small gunpowder bags from the charge cartridge. For flash suppression there was a special chemical mixture {{which was to be}} inserted into a cartridge before night firing. 152mm projectiles for the D-1 weighed about 40kg; a <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> for the loaders, who had to carry the projectiles alone.|$|E

5000|$|Kingsley Davis and Wilbert E.

5000|$|The {{hypothesis}} is an attempted explanation of social stratification, {{based on the}} idea of [...] "functional necessity." [...] Davis and Moore argue that the most <b>difficult</b> <b>jobs</b> in any society are the most necessary and require the highest rewards and compensation to sufficiently motivate individuals to fill them. Once the roles are filled, the division of labour functions properly, based on the notion of organic solidarity advanced by Emile Durkheim.|$|R
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was recorded by three separate broadcasters: the BBC, the Olympic Broadcasting Services (directed by the Finnish state broadcaster YLE {{on behalf of}} the OBS), and by independent production company Done and Dusted, hired by LOCOG and working under Boyle's direction. This {{was the first time that}} an independent production company had been used for an Olympic ceremony. [...] This situation led to some tension, as Boyle wanted more artistic control and felt he was getting no co-operation from the OBS. He criticised the OBS coverage during his commentary for the BBC DVD. In addition, the BBC filmed some of the pre-recorded parts of the ceremony. The filming was directed for television by Hamish Hamilton, who described it as [...] "easily the most <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> of my life".|$|E
500|$|... "Small Victories" [...] surpassed [...] "Nemesis" [...] as {{the biggest}} visual-effects-heavy Stargate SG-1 episode and {{remained}} one of biggest visual effects works of the season. Nevertheless, the limited budget required the major Computer-generated imagery (CGI) moments to be chosen well. The opening sequence of the Asgard ship flying over the ocean until its crash into the water was completely computer-generated, as was the Asgard homeworld at a later point in the episode. The finetuning of the lighting of the Asgard homeworld, which was blended with a matte painting of Asgard space ships in the sky, was the most <b>difficult</b> <b>job.</b> To save costs, the moments before Thor's entry to the SGC were stockshots of the Stargate, and {{the illusion of a}} Stargate event horizon behind Thor in the following scenes was created with an LCD projection. Although a computer-generated version of Thor was built around the puppet for independent movements, the CGI version's walking down the Stargate ramp was intercut with filmed shots of the puppet put on a trike.|$|E

500|$|The 2nd Panzer {{had been}} given the most <b>difficult</b> <b>job.</b> Its advance through the Ardennes trapped and delayed it in nearly [...] of traffic. Consequently, it arrived late at Donchery, after the 1st and 10th Panzer Divisions had {{initiated}} their assaults across the Meuse. Due to a combination of its being late and the attacks of its sister units, the enemy defences were alerted in advance of the 2nd Panzer's offensive. Crossing at the extreme western end of the Sedan sector on the Donchery axis, it was forced to advance across open terrain for the last 3km before reaching the bridgehead. This subjected the division to fire from Donchery and the Bellevue Castle's 75mm artillery casemates, located slightly to the east of the town. Several boats were tied to the Panzers and dragged across, but the tanks were knocked out. The bulk of the 174 artillery pieces available to the French at Sedan were concentrated on the 2nd Panzer Division's front. Most were located in the bunkers {{on the south side of}} the river Meuse-Donchery sector. Some of the French 102nd Infantry division's batteries also joined in from the north west, at Charleville. The only way to respond was with howitzers but the 2nd Panzer Division had handed its heavy howitzers over to the 1st Panzer. Only 24 guns remained and they did not arrive on the battlefield until 17:00. When they arrived, they had only had a couple of shells per gun owing to the logistical tailback in the Ardennes.|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{considered}} housing, uniforms, and recruit {{training to}} be her first priorities after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No.1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was [...] "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place". She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform. Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and group officer on 1 April 1942, {{which was to be}} the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member. She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF. To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job. She was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying, [...] "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will come in on a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later." [...] Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff. Colonel Sybil Irving, the head of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson [...] "did the most pertinent pioneering work" [...] in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces. For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director [...] "a <b>difficult</b> <b>job</b> and often a lonely one".|$|E
