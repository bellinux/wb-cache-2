5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved <b>dry</b> <b>farming,</b> with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E

They were known for their pottery, using the paddle-and-anvil technique. The Classical period of the culture saw the rise in architecture and ceramics. Buildings were grouped into walled compounds, as well as earthen platform mounds. Platform mounds were built along river as well as irrigation canal systems, suggesting these sites were administrative centers allocating water and coordinating canal labor. Polychrome pottery appeared, and inhumation burial replaced cremation. Trade included that of shells and other exotics. Social and climatic factors led to a decline and abandonment of the area after 1400 A.D.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with <b>dry</b> <b>farming.</b> The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E
2500|$|Norrie {{argues that}} the {{necessity}} of using <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year.

Because farmers were averse to risk, grain production was less than it might have been.|$|E

This {{study was conducted}} over 17. 833 hectares of irrigated wheat fields and 15. 500 hectares of dry land wheat in Saveh city, Iran, in the harvest year of 2003 - 2004. The data was collected from three different sources: questionnaire, literature reviewand field measurement. Total energy consumption for wheat in irrigated <b>farming</b> systems and <b>dry</b> land <b>farming</b> systems was estimated 51, 587 and 12, 543 MJ/ha. The average operational energy consumption for cultivation of irrigated <b>farming</b> system and <b>dry</b> land <b>farming</b> system was 36107 and 6067 MJ/ha, respectively.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine changes in resource productivity and factor shares as irrigation was introduced on small rice farms using traditional management techniques. Average output on irrigated farms was double that of <b>dry</b> <b>farms.</b> This was because irrigated farms produced two crops as opposed to one crop on farms without irrigation. Examination of marginal products showed that farmers with irrigation could profitably use more land. Dry farmers could profitably use more labor. The low labor input and high MP of labor on <b>dry</b> <b>farms</b> occurs because these farmers are undercapitalized and are obliged to accept off-farm employment at crucial periods of the rice. growing season. On both farm types, irrigated and dry, factor shares of land were high suggesting that a redistribution of land would also redistribute income.
