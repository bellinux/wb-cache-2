40|$|When {{foraging}} in {{a social}} group, individuals {{are faced with the}} choice of sampling their environment directly or exploiting the discoveries of others. The evolutionary dynamics of this trade-off have been explored mathematically through the producer-scrounger game, which has highlighted socially exploitative behaviours as a major potential cost of group living. However, our understanding of the tight interplay that can exist between social dominance and scrounging behaviour is limited. To date, only two theoretical studies have explored this relationship systematically, demonstrating that because scrounging requires joining a competitor at a resource, it should become exclusive to high-ranking individuals when resources are monopolisable. In this study, we explore the predictions of this model through observations of the natural social foraging behaviour of a wild population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We collected data through over 800 h of focal follows of 101 adults and juveniles across two troops over two 3 -month periods. By recording over 7, 900 social foraging decisions at two spatial scales we show that, when resources are large and economically indefensible, the <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> required for scrounging can occur across all social ranks. When, in contrast, dominant individuals can aggressively appropriate a resource, such <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> becomes increasingly difficult to employ with decreasing social rank because adult individuals can only join others lower ranking than themselves. Our study supports theoretical predictions and highlights potentially important individual constraints on the ability of individuals of low social rank to use social information, driven by competition with dominant conspecifics over monopolisable resources...|$|E

We investigate the role of reinforcement in <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> in bumble-bees, Bombus terrestris. When bees visit unfamiliar flower species, they prefer to probe inflorescences where others are also foraging, and here we show that such behaviour is promoted through experience when conspecific presence reliably predicts reward.

The shear strength of the joints was increased with increasing of heat input and pulse duration. This indicates that the anodizing process could improve shear strength of the laser joining specimens.

40|$|We {{consider}} a service system (Qs) that operates {{according to the}} FCFS discipline, and in which the service rate is an increasing function of the queue length. Customers arrive sequentially to the system and {{decide whether or not}} to join, using decision rules based upon the queue length on arrival to (Qs). Each customer is interested in selecting a rule that meets a certain optimality criterion with regards to their expected sojourn time in the system; as a consequence, the decision rules of other customers need to be taken into account. Within a particular class of decision rules for an associated infinite player game, the structure of the Nash equilibrium routing policies is characterized. We prove that within this class, there exist a finite number of Nash equilibria, and that at least one of these is non-randomized. Finally, we explore the extent to which the Nash equilibria are characteristic of customer <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> under a learning rule based on system-wide data with the aid of simulation experiments.

40|$|Master of EducationThis study {{investigated}} the communicative behaviour strategies exhibited by two preschool children with profound hearing loss during outdoor free play sessions at their integrated and segregated educational settings. The participants were investigated {{in terms of the}} particular play and non-play behaviours they engaged in; along with the communicative behaviours and communicative mode they exhibited during each interaction. The data collection process involved video taped footage analysed over 15 - second intervals for a total of 60 minutes for each participant. The study was designed to give a description of the communicative behaviour strategies and communicative interaction mode used during play and non-play behaviours across the integrated and the segregated preschools. The results of the study suggested that more sophisticated forms of play behaviour; such as cooperative play are observed more often in the integrated setting. In the integrated setting join in communicative strategies were used more often, whereas greeting and inviting communicative behaviours were more frequently observed in the segregated setting. The visual communicative mode was the most often recorded communicative mode in the integrated setting. The main differences were in the amount of solitary play produced in the integrated setting, familiarity with hearing peers may have been a contributing factor to this result. Associative play was greater in the segregated setting and this may have been related to the activities the participants engaged in. Much of the play was based around the sandpit and riding tricycles. In addition, communicative behaviours differed mainly in the level of sharing and <b>joining</b> in <b>behaviours</b> that were demonstrated. The results suggest that sharing may have occurred more in the segregated setting due to the children being more familiar with each other. <b>Join</b> in <b>behaviour</b> strategies were greater in the integrated setting due to the participants gaining access by mainly using the visual interaction mode. Finally, the communicative interaction mode was slightly different across the two settings in the verbal, vocal and sound making mode. The setting also impacted upon the number of instances in which no interaction occurred at all. These results have implications for the management of the preschool outdoor environment in both integrated and segregated settings for children with hearing loss. The outcomes of this study also highlight important areas for further research. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn group-living animals, {{collective}} {{movements are}} a widespread phenomenon and occur through consensus decision. When one animal proposes a direction for group movement, the others decide to follow or not and hence {{take part in}} the decision-making process. This paper examines the temporal spread of individual responses after the departure of a first individual (the initiator) in a semi-free ranging group of whitefaced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). We analysed 294 start attempts, 111 succeeding and 183 failing. Using a modelling approach, we have demonstrated that consensus decision-making for group movements is based on two complementary phenomena in this species: firstly, the joining together of group members thanks to a mimetic process; and secondly, a modulation of this phenomenon through the propensity of the initiator to give up (i. e. cancellation rate). This cancellation rate seems to be directly dependent upon the number of followers: the greater this number is, the lower the cancellation rate is seen to be. The coupling between joining and cancellation rates leads to a quorum: when three individuals join the initiator, the group collectively moves. If the initiator abandons the movement, this influences the <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the other group members, which in return influences the initiator's behaviour. This study demonstrates the synergy between the initiator's behaviour and the self-organized mechanisms underlying group movements...|$|E
40|$|Consistent {{behavioural}} {{differences between}} individuals {{across time and}} situations {{are referred to as}} animal personality. Associated with this are behavioural syndromes, which are suites of correlated behaviours across individuals. When foraging in social groups, individuals can use a producer tactic, which involves searching for food independently, or a scrounger tactic, which involves joining others who have already discovered food. In this study, wild populations of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) were tested in captive communal behavioural assays, trying to link variation in personality and behavioural syndromes to social foraging and producer-scrounger tactics in 8 social flocks. Individual variation and the covariation between the measured behavioural variables was quantified using univariate tests and structural equation modelling (SEM), respectively. There were surprisingly few sex differences in behaviour in these flocks. Nevertheless, clusters of covariance around individual differences in both activity (coming and going from the feeder in groups) and <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> (rates of scrounging and aggression at the feeder) provided the best model for the individual variation in different behaviours in these sparrow flocks. However, we found little individual consistency in the behavioural traits tested, indicating that there are no personalities, and thus only plasticity, in social foraging behaviours in these house sparrows. The findings here suggests that the birds were acting as a group of almost interchangeable individuals, and that the patterns of social foraging recorded were not driven by individual-specific producer-scrounger tactics or a wider behavioural syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The "explosion of interest" {{in animal}} social {{learning}} which {{has taken place}} {{over the last two}} decades has rarely touched upon invertebrate models. Yet, often social learning does not reflect complex cognitive processing, but instead derives from simple learning processes which also occur when animals learn asocially, shaped or directed by social behaviour mechanisms. In this thesis, I investigate how information provided inadvertently by conspecifics can influence foraging decisions in an animal with a small brain, and yet highly developed learning abilities, the bumblebee. In the first two chapters, I show that foraging bumblebees, when visiting unfamiliar flower species, prefer to probe those individual inflorescences where others are foraging. By comparing individual learning curves when foraging in the absence or presence of experienced conspecifics, I find that this can lead to faster learning about the relative rewards that different flower species offer. I investigate the proximate mechanistic causes of <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> in Chapter four, showing that social information use is a flexible trait which can be modified by learning. In Chapter five, I explore the influence of social cues in learning about "nectar robbing" - a process by which bees remove nectar from 1 flowers without pollination, by biting through the corolla. Finally, in Chapter six, I extend the context of the thesis to address the whether bees might use social information about danger. Taken together, my findings provide a model of how social learning can arise through a combination of simple social behaviour and individual learning, suggesting that social influences on learning in invertebrates may be more common than the current literature would suggest.

To improve the heat dissipation at the metal/ceramic interface, a high quality bonding between the substrate and the copper conductor is needed. This process requires a previous step of AIN pre-oxidation of the substrates by oxygen gas at 1200 °C, in order to form {{a thin layer of}} Al 2 O 3 at the surface of AlN. The junction between Cu and the substrate is carried out at 1075 °C in controlled oxygen atmosphere which promote the oxidation of the copper and the formation of an eutectic phase which can form a strong junction with AlN via the layer of Al 2 O 3.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{rheological}} and thermal characterisation of the self-assembling behaviour of different Poloxamer 407 systems (15 - 30 %, w/v), both alone or after the addition of various amounts of hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (5 - 20 %, w/v). The knowledge of the interactions existing between the two kinds of molecules could allow the development of systems for parenteral administration containing also proteins or peptides drugs. A rheology (temperature sweep and frequency sweep test) study has been performed to characterise the thermogelation process while thermal analysis (nanoDSC) allowed the determination of both micellization and sol/gelation transition processes. These two techniques were also utilised to outline the variation in the critical micelle temperature (cmT) or in the sol/gel temperature (sgT,) of the systems containing also hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HP β-CD). Both the rheology and thermal analysis showed the presence of interesting interactions between the HP β-CD and the Poloxamer 407, which cause a shift of both cmT and sgT.

40|$|Diffusion bonding of {{structural}} ceramics to superalloys has been investigated. Emphasis {{was placed on}} methods resulting in joints durable at elevated temperatures (500 - 700 ºC) between these two classes of high - temperature materials. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was used to enhance void elimination at relatively low diffusion bonding temperatures. This results in lower residual stresses, thinner reaction layers and a retained microstructure in the superalloy. The investigation centred on ceramic materials based on silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4). This is the main structural ceramic intended for use in components facing very high temperatures and/or aggressive environment at {{a certain level of}} thermomechanical stress. These ceramics were densified by HIP, with or without a few percent of yttria (Y 2 O 3) as a sintering additive. A silicon nitride composition developed for the turbine wheel in a vehicular gas turbine was the main ceramic, HIPed with 2. 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 to give a material with good mechanical properties up to about 1400 ºC. The increased oxidation resistance of silicon oxynitride (Si 2 N 2 O), as well as the formation of a layer consisting mainly of silicon oxynitride on the surface of silicon nitride components during glass-encapsulated HIP, made it valuable to compare the <b>joining</b> <b>behaviour</b> of these two materials to superalloys. Reaction sinterings of Si 2 N 2 O without sintering additives using HIP, as well as simultaneous joining and sintering of powder bodies of Si 2 N 2 O to Si 3 N 4 were therefore conducted. Diffusion bonding of these ceramics to the superalloy Incoloy 909 was performed by HIP at 200 MPa and 900 ºC or 1000 ºC for two hours. The thin reaction layers (apparently about 2 micrometer in thickness) were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Enrichments of titanium and niobium were detected at the interface with silicon nitride, while no such enrichments were observed when the silicon oxynitride was bonded. The main physical limitation for durable joints (intended for use up to about 700 ºC) between silicon nitride materials and superalloys is the large mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). This leads to extreme residual stresses and cracking of the ceramic. Two possible solutions to this problem were investigated: The use of a low-expansion superalloy, Incoloy 909, could reduce the residual stresses in the joint. The thermal expansion of this alloy was measured to higher temperatures than the maximum recommended temperature during use (65 OºC) since the contraction from higher joining temperatures at about 900 - 1000 ºC has a significant influence on the residual stresses in the joint after cooling. A temperature range suitable for joining without impairment of the microstructure and properties of the superalloy was determined. The relatively high average CTE of Incoloy 909 during a joining cycle, together with the serious limitations in methods suggested in the literature such as as interlayers of refractory metals such as tungsten, low-expansion alloys like Kovar or ductile metals such as nickel) lead {{to the conclusion that the}} CTE mismatch could not be sufficiently reduced by modifying only the metal part. The composition in the ceramic part of the joint should therefore be graded to increase the thermal expansion behaviour from the low CTE value in monolithic silicon nitride up to a significantly higher value at the ceramic/metal interface. Titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium diboride (TiB 2) were chosen as supplementary phases to the silicon nitride due to their suitable properties and the availability of a variety of such composites. A gradation up to 80 vol% TiN could reduce the CTE mismatch against Incoloy 909 to less than half from delta-alpha= 8. 8 micrometer/(mxK) to delta-alpha= 3. 5 micrometer/mxK). The two composites used in diffusion couples were densified by HIP from powder mixtures Of Si 3 N 4 and either 60 vol% TiN or 50 vol% TiB 2. Monolithic silicon nitride HIP ed with 2. 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 was also included in this study of interfacial reactions with Incoloy 909. A diffusion couple geometry was developed to facilitate the preparation of thin-foil specimens for examination by analytical electron microscopy (AEM). Diffusion bonding was performed by HIP at 9270 C (1200 K) and 200 MPa for four hours. The formation of reaction layers was very limited, being less than one micron in total layer thickness for all the Si 3 N 4 -based ceramics used. Two reaction products were found by AEM; a continuous, very thin, (less than or equal 100 micrometer) layer of fine TiN crystals at the initial ceramic/metal interface, and larger grains extending about 100 - 500 micrometer into the superalloy and forming a semi-continuous layer of a Gphase silicide containing mainly nickel, silicon and niobium. A ceramic composite, in which both the continuous fibres and the matrix consist of silicon carbide (S W), was diffusion bonded to two superalloys, Incoloy 909 and Hastelloy X, by HIP at 200 MPa and 9000 C or 10000 C for one hour. Using SEM/EDS, the reaction zones were found to consist of a thin line of carbide formers from the superalloys (Cr+Mo and Nb+Ti, respectively), bounded by several layers containing silicides and free carbon, depending on the superalloy involved. The width and composition of the reaction zones formed were found to depend more on the different compositions of the superalloys (Hastelloy X or Incoloy 909) than on a difference of 100 K in joining temperatures (1000 ºC or 900 ºC). At 1000 ºC, the reaction zones were typically about 40 micrometer thick in joints with Hastelloy X and about 100 micrometer in joints with Incoloy 909. The SiC/SiC composite was considerably more prone to reactions with superalloys compared to the behaviour Of Si 3 N 4 under similar conditions. The higher reactivity of SiC requires efficient diffusion barriers to be developed since the reaction zones formed will otherwise grow more than two orders of magnitude thicker (about 100 micrometer) than for silicon nitride ceramics under similar joining conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background To go {{from one}} place to another, we {{routinely}} generate internal representations of surrounding spaces, which can include egocentric (body-centred) and allocentric (world-centred) coordinates, combined into route and survey representations. Recent studies have shown how both egocentric and allocentric representations exist in parallel and are <b>joined</b> to support <b>behaviour</b> according to the task. Our study investigated the transfer from survey (map-like) to route representations in healthy and brain-damaged subjects. The aim was two-fold: first, to understand how this ability could change with age in a sample of healthy participants, aged from 40 to 71 years old; second, to investigate how it is affected after a brain lesion in a 8 patients' sample, with reference to specific neuropsychological frames. Methods Participants were first required to perform the paper and pencil version of eight mazes, then to translate the map-like paths into egocentric routes, in order to find the right way into equivalent Virtual Reality (VR) mazes. Patients also underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, including a specific investigation of some topographical orientation components. Results As regards the healthy sample, we found age-related deterioration in VR task performance. While education level and gender were not found to be related to performance, global cognitive level (Mini Mental State Examination), previous experience with computer and fluidity of navigation into the VR appeared to influence VR task results. Considering the clinical sample, there was a difficulty in performing the VR Maze task; executive functions and visuo-spatial abilities deficits appeared to be more relevant for predicting patients' results. Conclusions Our study suggests the importance of developing tools aimed at investigating the survey to route transfer ability in both healthy elderly and clinical samples, since this skill seems high cognitive demanding and sensitive to cognitive decline. Human-computer interaction issues should be considered in employing new technologies, such as VR environments, with elderly subjects and neurological patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} role of the body in the work of Foucault and {{symbolic}} interactionism. Instead of a mere comparative analysis, the perspective Foucault takes of the social actor is employed at certain interactionists. Symbolic interactionists that incorporate an emphasis on the physical and somatic are investigated to make the Foucauldian perspective relevant to the investigation. Those deemed relevant are George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman and the identity theory of Sheldon Stryker and Peter J. Burke. It is argued that a focus on the somatic and material aspects can avoid much of the arbitrary and fluid of social interaction. Relativism is suppressed and structure enhanced while still dealing with the importance of meaning. Foucault presents the social actor as a mere body. Although alive, it leads a sort of group life without the imperatives of knowledge in modern society. It is only upon being invested by discourse that the body acquires an inner forum that disciplines it and makes it an individualised subjective of power. A reversion is created in Foucault’s thought by claiming that the soul is the prison of the body. Discourse imposes conditions on what the individual can employ in thought and behaviour. As Foucault is not an interactionist, he underemphasises the motives of the individual. Upon researching his texts however, three main processes seem to surround the body. First, bodies are categorised, trained in procedures and placed in hierarchies. This is mainly where power is being exercised upon individuals. Secondly, there is implicitly an incentive factor responsible for both individuals being motivated by discipline, and the collective motive for discourses about optimisation of health and life in the human sciences. Thirdly, the capacity for the body to learn makes it both docile by incorporating knowledge, and later to constitute itself by means of using discourses to shape the self in a liberating way. The latter two processes are implicit, but necessary conditions for the subjectivation process to have an effect in the first place. The social behaviourism of George H. Mead has a dormant somatic component in the account of the act. The impulse, perception, manipulation and consummation part of the act implies that behaviour precedes the emergence for the mind and self. This naturally sets material conditions of what kind of experiences the mind and self is constituted with. Gestures from the surroundings are imposed on the individual, and the response to it functions to keep the physiological organism alive. The neglected role of memory or experience also limits the flexibility of defining future situations due to interpretation being a process of calling up experience with acts and consequences. The “I” is further interpreted as the response of the organism, and the “me” as constituted by memory of the responses and attitudes others have of him. Thus both aspects of the self have somatic sources. In {{much the same way as}} Foucault the body is filled with information with the intent of optimising life, but at the same time it directs the behaviour of the body, while simultaneously giving it a self. Goffman’s dramaturgy is innovative by using materials in the surroundings when presenting a self that is favourable. By means of barriers to perceptions, the actor can control others’ view of him. It is an incentive to gain social support by being interpreted as competent, while avoiding being discredited. Incidentally, competency is always associated with the same optimisation motives that seem to sustain discursive production. Ritual behaviour is also motivated via competency incentives, while also illustrating the inertia of learning and simultaneous threat and privilege of reciprocity. One gives deference out of fear for not receiving it. Lastly, primary frames are an integral part of interpretation. Actors arrive at frames and do not create them from scratch. Primary frame also asserts itself if incentive processes are disturbed, such as a dangerous or painful situation. The image presenter is thus revealed as a psychobiological being seeking optimisation of life via skills. Identity theory refines Mead’s inertia of learning by viewing role-meanings as identities stacked in a hierarchy of salience with a certain chance of being enacted. Burke and Stryker attempt to solve the puzzle of why the actor chooses one type of role behaviour over another. Commitment to relationships in culture and groups influences role behaviour and gives an identity higher salience in the hierarchy. Further, activated identities have a standard that controls meaning, and the actor counteracts disturbances to the goal of this standard. The behaviour connected to role identities serves to control resources, interpreted by signs and symbols. As such, incentive and interpretation are <b>joined.</b> People’s <b>behaviour</b> is dependent on both social and physiological utility and their physical location in social groups, thereby accounting for their specific experience. Discussing the somatic in Foucault’s theory and interactionist theory grounds both fluidity of behaviour and linguistic imperatives in stable frames. The intersection between discourse, incentive and social action is articulated. Social individuals and their incorporation of discourse are embedded in tangible, incentive-based relationships in order to maintain competence. Such a conception suggests limits for relativism in how individuals are constituted by discourse. This also connects individuals to structures by suggesting links between learning and interaction. It is argued here that since structure and action are connected an overly free subject is useless to sociology. The somatic aspect suggests conditions for this freedom...|$|R
