5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Coke {{returned}} to Britain, plans were {{already under way}} for him to enter Parliament. When an election was called in 1774, Wenman stood for the seat of Norfolk, with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby. Coke was not particularly enthusiastic about this, and withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21, the requisite age to stand for Parliament. With his father elected, Coke travelled with him to London, meeting members of the British high society. His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton's sister Jane, and Coke fell in love with her. Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> out the daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman's friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which occurred on 5 October 1775.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E

25|$|Questioned further {{as to his}} claims, Fred calmly {{explained}} {{there were}} a further five bodies buried in his cellar, and a sixth body beneath the ground-floor bathroom. Most of these victims, Fred claimed, had been hitchhikers or girls <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up at bus stops whom he had murdered in the 1970s. Initially, Fred claimed these six victims had been killed when they had threatened to inform Rose of his infidelity with women, {{and that he had}} transported their bodies to Cromwell Street to abuse, dismember, and then bury in shallow graves. The actual dismemberment, Fred claimed, had made it easier to bury the remains in shallow, cubicle graves, and he agreed to return to Cromwell Street to indicate precisely where he had buried each victim.|$|E
25|$|He {{enlisted in}} {{military}} service at 17 years old somewhat charmed at {{the stories of}} Lawrence of Arabia and {{was assigned to the}} 12th Cavalry Regiment.

When he was discharged he served as a state trooper and corporal in New Jersey into 1923. He quit, hoping for advancement but working for an oil company to Feb 1924 was not it. Neither was re-enlisting as he found after a few months in 1924 at Fort Slocum (New York). Instead he worked as a railroad “special agent” protecting trains and added time as a deputy sheriff in New Mexico and Arizona.|$|E
25|$|The killing began during June 1980.

He had ordered them to perform fellatio on him and then shot them both in the head before taking them to a garage and raping their dead bodies. He had then dumped their bodies near the Ventura Freeway where they were found the next day. Bundy was uneasy upon hearing this news and phoned the police, admitting to having some knowledge of the murders, but she refused to provide any clues as to Clark's identity. Clark told Bundy that, if either of them were apprehended, {{he would take the}} blame in the hope that Bundy would be allowed to go free.|$|E

25|$|In their summation, the {{prosecution}} {{stated that the}} evidence they presented proved that Einem's story was full of lies and inconsistencies, {{and that he did}} murder (with the help of others) Richard Kelvin. They also stated that his admission that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up Kelvin showed that he was in contact with him on 5 June; that the fibres and hairs proved that Einem was with him at the time of just before and/or at the time of death; and that the drugs proved Einem was with Kelvin in between those times. The prosecution also answered the doubts raised by the defence about when on 10 July the body was dumped at the airstrip by suggesting that Einem could have dumped the body sometime very late on 10 July or in the early morning of 11 July before going to work for the day.|$|E
25|$|Since Cole's identification, {{investigation}} is now aimed at locating {{the person responsible}} for her murder. Frances Aucoin, whose father, John Chesson, discovered Cole's remains along with her brother, told officers that she suspects he is responsible for the victim's death. Police confirm that Chesson is considered a person of interest in the case, especially because of his conviction for the murder of his estranged wife's former mother-in-law, but he has yet to be considered the prime suspect. Aucoin believes that Chesson had decided to go hunting {{for the first time with}} his children to establish his innocence by finding the victim's body and reporting it to the police. She went into further detail, describing her father as abusive and that she believes that a young woman he had brought into their home was Cole whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up as a hitchhiker. Aucoin's brother, a witness in finding the body, committed suicide in 2008. Chesson is currently incarcerated for life for the murder of his estranged wife's former mother-in-law, which occurred in 1997.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham.

He denied knowing Tutill or having {{anything to do with}} his death, and whilst admitting to his historic offences against boys said he had put that behaviour behind him. Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field could not sleep that night and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill. He said he had seen a boy get off a bus and thumb for a lift and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> him up. He said he drove the boy to a layby where he anally raped him over the front seat. He said when he finished he panicked and then strangled the boy with his own school tie, he kept the body in his car's boot for several days before dumping him in woodland.|$|E

25|$|Sergei Diaghilev {{was born}} to a wealthy and cultured family in Selishchi (Novgorod Governorate), Russia; his father, Pavel Pavlovich, was a cavalry colonel, but the family's money came mainly from vodka distilleries. After the death of Sergei's mother, his father married Elena Valerianovna Panaeva, an artistic {{young woman who was}} on very affectionate terms with her stepson and was a strong {{influence}} on him. The family lived in Perm but had an apartment in Saint Petersburg and a country estate in Bikbarda (near Perm). In 1890, Sergei's parents went bankrupt, having for a long time lived beyond their means, and from that time Sergei (who had a small income inherited from his mother) had to support the family. After graduating from Perm gymnasium in 1890, he went to the capital to study law at St. Petersburg University, but ended up also taking classes at the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music, where he studied singing and music (a love of which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up from his stepmother). After graduating in 1892 he abandoned his dreams of composition (his professor, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, told him he had no talent for music).|$|E
25|$|The defence {{opted for}} Einem {{to give an}} unsworn {{statement}} from the dock, rather than given sworn evidence from the witness box. In his unsworn statement, Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu {{for the next week}} after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his unsworn statement by again claiming his innocence.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{were set}} {{a target of}} 239 for victory, and {{although}} {{that would have made}} it the highest-scoring innings in the match, they had five sessions in which to do it. However, what followed was a master-class in bowling from Broad, who took seven wickets for 44 runs in just 11 overs – his best Test figures – as New Zealand were bowled out for 68, their sixth-lowest score in Tests against England. Only BJ Watling and Neil Wagner managed to make it into double figures, theirs being two of the three wickets that Broad did not manage to take. Watling was not helped by a knee injury <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>picked</b> up on day 3 that meant McCullum had to keep wicket {{for the rest of the}} innings, but he nevertheless came out to bat, only to be caught in the slips off Anderson for 13. Wagner's wicket was the last to fall; it looked as though he would be caught after hitting the ball straight up in the air to long leg, but the fielder missed the catch. In the confusion that followed, the ball was thrown back to Anderson at the bowler's end with Wagner stranded mid-pitch in the middle of his second run. With that, the day's play concluded with 14 wickets in less than two sessions and England went 1–0 up in the two-match series.|$|E
