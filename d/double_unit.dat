5|$|From 7 January 2001, NSB {{made several}} major {{changes to the}} {{commuter}} rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. Six stations were closed: Muruvik, Solbakken, Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg. At the same time, the station at Marienborg and Røstad opened. NSB also introduced a fare zone system, which gave up to NOK20 discount for single-fare travelers and about the same fares for month-pass holders. Part {{of the reason for}} the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units. This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with <b>double</b> <b>unit</b> (four-car) trains in rush-hour.|$|E

25|$|East Midlands Trains runs Regional Services {{across the}} East Midlands. The Norwich to Liverpool trains are painted white like Mainline services, {{rather than in}} the blue scheme used for other {{regional}} and local services. The Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Central, Manchester Oxford Road and Piccadilly, Sheffield, Nottingham, Peterborough and Ely to Norwich service was historically provided by Central Trains. Nottinghamshire County Council has consistently campaigned for better services between the four core cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham. Network Rail's plans for the Manchester Hub would deliver extra train paths along the Hope Valley Line, enabling more trains to run from the North West to the East Midlands. In December 2012, <b>double</b> <b>unit</b> trains were provided for services between Manchester and Nottingham to ease overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|Thirty new train units (named DT3) {{were ordered}} {{and have been}} {{delivered}} for U3 operations. Those trains are designed to operate without a driver, controlled by an ATC system from Siemens, and will provide the passengers with an unobstructed view from the front window into the tunnel. A normally locked drivers panel exists at every front window which enables service employees to drive DT3 units by hand if required. As with all Nuremberg subway trains, these units consist of two carriages and are half the platform length. They can be run as a single unit (short train) or coupled as <b>double</b> <b>unit</b> (long train), depending on passenger numbers. For {{the first time in}} a Nuremberg subway train, the two carriages of a unit are built with an accessible gangway. This is intended to improve passenger distribution in the train as many stations in the system have their exits at the very ends of the platform and therefore often the first and the last carriages of a 4 carriage (long) train are rather full, while the two middle carriages are relatively empty.|$|E
2500|$|Le Corbusier {{explicitly}} {{used the}} golden ratio in his Modulor {{system for the}} scale of architectural proportion. He saw this system as {{a continuation of the}} long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci's [...] "Vitruvian Man", the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and the <b>double</b> <b>unit.</b> He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the Modulor system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.|$|E

Built in 1921, the court was designed by Jas. Humphreys.

5000|$|The current cars {{represent}} {{the third generation}} of cars {{that have been used}} on the line. The line opened using a fleet of shorter cars manufactured by the St. Louis Car Company in 1954 and 1955.

[...] They were virtually identical to the cars built by St. Louis Car at the same time for what is now the MBTA's Blue Line. Twelve cars were operable as single units with cabs at each end, and 56 cars operable as pairs. The single units were numbered as 101-112, and the paired units as 201-256. Additional cars in this fleet were purchased in 1958 when the line was extended to West Park.
