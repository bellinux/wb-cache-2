5|$|The {{county seat}} of Washington County (before county {{government}} was abolished) {{is often referred}} to as West Kingston. In reality, West Kingston, a village of South Kingstown, does not have its own local government, but because the courthouse was located in West Kingston's zip code, it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the county seat.|$|E

5|$|Gleason is {{also the}} namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that {{generate}} the weight enumerators of linear codes. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving {{a relationship between the}} weight enumerators of codes and their duals that <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the MacWilliams identity.|$|E
5|$|Renault's victory {{contributed to}} an {{increase}} in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race. Despite being the second to carry the title, the race <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the first Grand Prix. The success of the 1906 French Grand Prix prompted the ACF to run the Grand Prix again the following year, and the German automobile industry to organise the Kaiserpreis, the forerunner to the German Grand Prix, in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry with}} Arsenal {{arises from the}} {{numerous}} times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, have battled for the Premier League title.

5|$|This {{philosophy}} of approaching {{the art of}} acting has stood not only steadfast, but as the cornerstone of acting {{for much of the}} 20th century to this day. Mikhail Chekhov considered Ivanov a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career. From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Chekhov's gun, a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.|$|E
5|$|Acting on James Bevel's {{call for}} a march from Selma to Montgomery, King, Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial {{collaboration}} with SNCC, attempted to organize the march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Bloody Sunday and was a major {{turning point in the}} effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E
5|$|Drawn and Quarterly <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> a {{house for}} art comics, {{translations}} of non-English works, like Montrealer Michel Rabagliati's Paul series, and archive editions of classic comics, such as Wright's Little Nipper. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US. D publisher Chris Oliveros, along with Art Spiegelman, lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield {{has a long}} {{sporting}} heritage. In 1857 {{a collective}} of cricketers formed the world's first-ever official football club, Sheffield F.C., and the world's second-ever, Hallam F.C., who also play at the world's oldest football ground in the suburb of Crosspool. Sheffield and Hallam are today Sheffield's two major non-league sides, although Sheffield now play just outside the city in nearby Dronfield, Derbyshire. Sheffield and Hallam contest what <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Sheffield derby. By 1860 there were 15football clubs in Sheffield, with the first ever amateur league and cup competitions {{taking place in the}} city.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{culminated in}} what <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Toledo War, as Michigan and Ohio militia took up {{arms in the}} area. As a {{condition}} for entering the Union, Michigan was forced to accept the eastern three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip. After a state convention first rejected this condition, a second convention, assembled under some duress in December 1836, reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26, 1837, with Detroit as its first capital.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of Poland, Finland, and the Baltic States between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia (then part of Romania, now Moldova). This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September. On 5 March 1940 Lavrentiy Beria gave Molotov, along with Anastas Mikoyan, Kliment Voroshilov and Stalin, a note ordering the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and anti-Soviets, in what <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Katyn massacre.|$|E

5|$|Justinian's {{habit of}} {{choosing}} efficient, but unpopular advisers nearly {{cost him his}} throne early in his reign. In January 532, partisans of the chariot racing factions in Constantinople, normally divided among themselves, united against Justinian in a revolt that <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Nika riots. They forced him to dismiss Tribonian {{and two of his}} other ministers, and then attempted to overthrow Justinian himself and replace him with the senator Hypatius, who was a nephew of the late emperor Anastasius. While the crowd was rioting in the streets, Justinian considered fleeing the capital, but eventually decided to stay, apparently on the prompting of Theodora, who refused to leave. In the next two days, he ordered the brutal suppression of the riots by his generals Belisarius and Mundus. Procopius relates that 30,000 unarmed civilians were killed in the Hippodrome. On Theodora's insistence, and apparently against his own judgment, Justinian had Anastasius' nephews executed.|$|E
5|$|Some neighborhoods, such as SoHo, {{which is}} mixed use, {{are known for}} upscale {{shopping}} as well as residential use. Others, such as Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Alphabet City and the East Village, have long {{been associated with the}} Bohemian subculture. Chelsea is one of several Manhattan neighborhoods with large gay populations and has become a center of both the international art industry and New York's nightlife. Washington Heights is a primary destination for immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Chinatown has the highest concentration of people of Chinese descent outside of Asia. Koreatown is roughly bounded by 6th and Madison Avenues, between 31st and 33rd Streets, where Hangul (한글) signage is ubiquitous. Rose Hill features a growing number of Indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of Lexington Avenue between 25th and 30th Streets which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Curry Hill.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 Joseph Leidy described a Hadrosaurus skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the American Civil War that really fueled the expansion of fossil collection. The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of North America, including the discovery of the Western Interior Sea that had covered Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the Cretaceous, the discovery of several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and the discovery of a number of new dinosaur genera including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. Much of this activity was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Bone Wars.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{never again}} went on crusade {{after his return}} to England in 1274, but he {{maintained}} an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287. This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by {{the conflict between the}} French House of Anjou ruling southern Italy, and the kingdom of Aragon in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to Peter of Aragon, in what <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Sicilian Vespers. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, Charles of Salerno, was taken prisoner by the Aragonese. The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release. As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Mesolithic humans {{arrived in}} the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth {{millennium}} BC, probably from Ireland. This {{was followed by a}} wave of Neolithic peoples using the same route and {{there is some evidence that}} the Firth of Clyde was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time. A particular style of megalithic structure developed in Argyll, the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Clyde cairn. They are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large slabs of stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments. A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead, who were placed inside the chambers. They are concentrated in Arran, Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating. An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to 3160 BC, although it was almost certainly built earlier than that, possibly c. 4000BC. There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor, Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute.|$|E
