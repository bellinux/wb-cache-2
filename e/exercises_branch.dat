40|$|Branch {{coverage}} {{is an important}} criteria used during the structural testing of programs. In this paper, we present a new program execution based approach to generate input data that <b>exercises</b> a selected <b>branch</b> in a program. The test data generation is initiated with an arbitrarily chosen input from the input domain of the program. A new input {{is derived from the}} initial input in an attempt to force execution through any of the paths through the selected branch. The method dynamically switches among the paths that reach the branch by refining the input. Using a numerical iterative technique that attempts to generate an input to <b>exercise</b> the <b>branch,</b> it dynamically selects a path that offers less resistance. We have implemented the technique and present experimental results of its performance for some programs. Our results show that our method is feasible and practical.

40|$|Due to {{the damaged}} central nervous system, people with {{multiple}} sclerosis have many physical problems, which make their {{everyday life and}} participation in all sport activities more difficult. In the book Telovadba za obolele z multiplo sklerozo (1990) the Association of Multiple Sclerosis Slovenia states that with timely regular daily exercise and stretching we can partly avoid some {{of the consequences of}} multiple sclerosis, we can fix and minimize them. In our research we were establishing the actual state of physical activity among the members of the Association of Multiple Sclerosis Slovenia branches. We gathered the informations in april 2011, within the project called Športna mreža enakih. As a method of research we used a questionnaire with whitch we collected informations about sex and age of members, their physical activity, reasons for physical inactivity, types of sports, professional qualification of staff, weekly sport activity, locations of sports activities, adjustment of sports objects to the level of disability, attendance of unorganised exercise, possibilities of the development of the disabled sports in Slovenia, cooperation with other sport associations, informational spots for inclusion of disabled athletes as well as the informations about acquiring financial support from local communities of 15 branches. The results were entered into the program Excel and represented by charts and tables. It was discovered that women prevail among members of the branches of the Association of Multiple Sclerosis Slovenia and that most members are older than 40 years. Mostly they are physicaly inactive, the main reason for physical inactivity being poor awareness of the meaning of sport activity. Most popular types of sport are bowling, darts and shooting. The staff who runs the activities is not proffessionally qualified. Members are physicaly active once per week. Sports activity is performed at locations that are suitable for particular type of sport and are only party adjusted to the level of disability. Half of the branches have no information whether the members also participate in unorganised exercise. The sport of the disabled will only be enabled with higher awareness of all the members about the meaning of regular <b>exercise.</b> <b>Branches</b> partially cooperate with other sport associations but do not have sufficiently developed informational spots for the inclusion of disabled athletes. They also do not gain enough financial support from local communities. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{represents}} an in-depth examination of Separation of Power issues {{raised in the}} context of the Legislative and Executive <b>Branch’s</b> <b>exercise</b> of their War Powers. Specifically, the paper considers the argument raised by the Bush Administration that Congress cannot constitutionally infringe on the President’s exercise of his Commander in Chief Power in the fight against terrorism. Such an argument would effectively insulate most Presidential decisions related to terrorism from Congressional oversight. The implication being that even if Congress wanted to accomplish something like ending the detainment of detainees at Guatanamo Bay it would be outside their Constitutional authority. The paper considers whether this argument is valid under either a formalist or more contextual view of Separation of Powers, and ultimately concludes that in any Branch conflict Congress should ultimately prevail...|$|R
