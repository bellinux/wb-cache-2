5|$|Bolt was {{a member}} of the silver medal winning relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4×100 metres relay. Jamaica set a {{national}} record of 37.89 s. Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in <b>his</b> <b>stride</b> frequency, giving him more driving power on the track.|$|E
5|$|His {{breakthrough}} {{began in}} 2000, {{when he was}} voted Player of the Year by the Durham members, particularly for his one-day efforts. His form varied following a back injury, but he hit <b>his</b> <b>stride</b> in 2001, when he excelled both in the County Championship and in the one-day game. In the six English seasons from 2001, Collingwood has exceeded a batting average of 40 four times and achieved a bowling average of less than 40 on three occasions.|$|E

5|$|During the 2007–08 season, he was {{replaced}} by backup Chris Osgood, who had originally been traded away from the Red Wings {{to make way for}} Hašek before the 2001-02 season. When Hašek recovered and got back into <b>his</b> <b>stride,</b> Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit coach Mike Babcock announced Hašek to start in the 2008 playoffs. Through the first two games against the Nashville Predators, the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism in practice and continued to support his teammates, with Darren McCarty citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually the Red Wings beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch <b>his</b> <b>stride,</b> and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E

From that win at New York's Inwood Country Club, through his 1930 victory in the U.S. Amateur, he won 13 major championships (as they were counted at the time) in 20 attempts. Jones was {{the first player to}} win The Double, both the U.S. and British Open Championships in the same year (1926).

25|$|The {{early to}} mid fifties saw Thompson {{reaching}} <b>his</b> <b>stride</b> as a mature writer. In 1952, The Killer Inside Me was published. It is perhaps Thompson's finest and best-known novel. The narrator, Lou Ford, is a small-town deputy sheriff who appears amiable, pleasant and slightly dull-minded. Ford is actually very intelligent and fighting a nearly-constant urge to act violently; Ford describes his urge as the sickness (always italicised). Lion Books unsuccessfully attempted to have The Killer Inside Me {{nominated for a}} National Book Award. It was eponymously adapted to the cinema, in 1976 (by director Burt Kennedy, with Stacy Keach as Lou Ford), and again in 2010 (by director Michael Winterbottom, with Casey Affleck as Ford and co-starring Kate Hudson and Jessica Alba).|$|E

His presidency also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom, and launched large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam and Helwan City. Nasser's detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his human rights violations and his dominance of military over civil institutions, establishing a pattern of military and dictatorial rule in Egypt.|$|R
25|$|In the Patriots' fifth game, Brady {{began to}} find <b>his</b> <b>stride.</b> Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 26–16 {{in the fourth}} quarter, he led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force {{overtime}}, and another in overtime {{to set up a}} winning field goal. Brady finished the game with 33 pass completions on 54 attempts, for 364 yards, and two touchdowns. The following week, Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 38–17 win.

Brady finished the 2001 season with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns and earned an invitation to the 2002 Pro Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Saṅkrānti (Hindi: सङ्क्रान्ति, meaning Revolution): In {{the first}} 27 verses (first quarter) of the canto, the poet expounds on Saṅkrānti, {{the concept of}} true revolution. It {{is not to be}} {{attained}} by spilling blood, but by spreading a thought. Rarely do people want such a revolution, their egos do not allow it. The narrative then proceeds – after the Puṃsavana and Sīmantonnayana Saṃskāras of Sujātā, one day, late in the night, Kahola is practising Vedic chanting, perfecting his knowledge of what he is to teach his disciples on the following day. Out of fatigue and the four defects of Bhrama, Pramāda, Vipralipsā and Karaṇāpāṭava, Kahola starts erring in all eight types of recitations – Jaṭā, Rekhā, Mālā, Śikhā, Ratha, Dhvaja, Daṇḍa, and Ghana. The child of Sujātā, while still in the womb, thinks about this for some time and then asks his father to stop practising and teaching verses incorrectly, pointing out that the sage is making eight errors in reciting each verse. Kahola is taken aback and asks the child in the womb to stay quiet, saying he is reciting as per tradition, and forgetfulness is only human. The child replies by saying that the father should throw away the old corpse of so-called tradition and again requests Kahola to learn the Vedas once more from Uddālaka. The enraged Kahola curses the child to be born with all eight limbs crooked. Kahola repents immediately after, but the child (Aṣṭāvakra) takes the curse in <b>his</b> <b>stride,</b> and asks his father not to repent.|$|E
25|$|Caroline is {{introduced}} in Last Tango in Halifaxs series premiere (2012), {{as a successful}} headmistress dealing with the fallout of her husband's affair and her own clandestine liaison with Kate. At {{the climax of the}} episode she is shocked to learn that her mother Celia has decided to marry Alan; an old love interest she had recently {{met for the first time}} in sixty years. She is also shocked upon discovering that Alan is father to Gillian, a working-class woman who Caroline has previously insulted. After learning that John is still seeing his lover Judith (Ronni Ancona), Caroline tells him he has no right to carry on living in their marital home. She grows closer to Kate, and explains to her that she finds it hard to be open with her feelings, having long suppressed her emotions. In the following episode, Caroline grows closer to Gillian after their respective parents go missing. She admits to John that she has moved on and began seeing someone else. When Caroline makes her relationship with Kate official, her eldest son William (Edward Ashley) takes it in <b>his</b> <b>stride,</b> but her younger son Lawrence (Louis Greatorex) is upset. When Judith arrives at Caroline's house she learns of the relationship and informs John who tells Celia. Celia refuses to accept that her daughter is gay and her bigoted words and attitude at a dinner party drive Kate away. Caroline has an angry argument with her mother, blaming her for her emotional repression and for ruining her chance of happiness with Kate. She reminds her that she had previously tried to come out to her at the age of 18, and that it had been her prejudices that had forced her to live a closeted existence. Celia, realising that she may have ruined her relationship with both her daughter and the liberal-minded Alan, is compelled to ask Kate to give Caroline another chance.|$|E
