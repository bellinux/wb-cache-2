5|$|Biodiesel (in its pure form) is a non-toxic, {{biodegradable}} form of <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> {{made from}} vegetable oil, usually soybean oil or recycled restaurant grease.

5|$|Grid parity {{was first}} reached in Spain in 2013, Hawaii and other islands that {{otherwise}} use fossil fuel (<b>diesel</b> <b>fuel)</b> to produce electricity, {{and most of}} the US is expected to reach grid parity by 2015.|$|E
5|$|Cambodia has no proven {{fossil fuel}} reserves, and is almost {{completely}} dependent on imported <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay {{some of the}} highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} using a Light-Duty, single-cylinder, research engine {{in which the}} emissions, fuel consumption and combustion characteristics of two Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> derived from natural gas and two conventional <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> (Swedish low sulfur Diesel and European EN 590 Diesel) were compared. Due to their low aromatic contents combustion with the F-T <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> resulted in lower soot emissions than combustion with the conventional <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuels.</b> The hydrocarbon emissions were also significantly lower with F-T fuel combustion. Moreover the F-T fuels tended to yield lower CO emissions than the conventional <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuels.</b> The low emissions from the F-T <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuels,</b> {{and the potential for}} producing such fuels from biomass, are powerful reason for future interest and research in this field...|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{are under}} way in many countries, {{including}} India, to search for suitable alternative <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> that are environment friendly. The need to search for these fuels arises mainly {{from the standpoint of}} preserving the global environment and the concern about long-term supplies of conventional hydrocarbon-based <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels.</b> Among the different possible sources, <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> derived from triglycerides (vegetable oils/animal fats) present a promising alternative to substitute <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels.</b> Although triglycerides can <b>fuel</b> <b>diesel</b> engines, their high viscosities, low volatilities and poor cold flow properties have led to the investigation of various derivatives. Fatty acid methyl esters, known as biodiesel, derived from triglycerides by transesterification with methanol have received the most attention. The main advantages of using biodiesel are its renewability, better-quality exhaust gas emissions, its biodegradability and given that all the organic carbon present is photosynthetic in origin, it does not contribute to a rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and consequently to the greenhouse effect. ...|$|R
5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel,</b> which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> and kerosene, were commonly used. These {{were good}} at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{equipment}} was installed on floors four through seven, including 12transformers on the 5th floor. Several emergency generators {{installed in the}} building were used by the New York City Office of Emergency Management, Salomon Smith Barney, and other tenants. In order to supply the generators, 24,000gallons (91,000L) of <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> were stored below ground level. <b>Diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor. After the World Trade Center bombings of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized {{in light of the}} events of 9/11, the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building.|$|E
30|$|Although {{most of the}} {{emission}} tests summarized in Table  9 were carried out with synthetic <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> produced from very large plants operated by Sasol, Shell and others, the chemical compositions of these synthetic <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are very similar to}} Greyrock’s fuel (Table  5), and therefore, these average emission reductions were used in the WTW-LCA model.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the design optimization {{and operation of}} the Forschungszentrum Jülich’s ATR 13 autothermal reformer with conventional <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels.</b> The main objective was to eliminate undesirable by-products that can amass in the reformate. The reforming of conventional, highly aromatic <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> with a high final boiling point presents a particular challenge – these fuels {{are more difficult to}} evaporate and are prone to coking; tendencies that can damage both the reformers themselves and downstream components. Here, we present several constructive and operational measures to generate a high-quality reformate from the Swedish Test Diesel SD 10 and, moreover, to prevent the formation of short-chain hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds in the reformate. This will enable the stable, long-term operation of fuel cell-based APUs utilizing conventional <b>diesel</b> <b>fuels</b> on board trucks...|$|R

5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of <b>diesel</b> <b>fuel</b> from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E
5|$|Further {{controversy}} ensued at the Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit.

Roberts and the new championship points leader, Virginio Ferrari, instigated a riders' revolt and refused to race. Once again, the FIM responded by suspending Roberts and Ferrari. The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to the press about forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E
