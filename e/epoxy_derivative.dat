[...] Studies implicate the following pathway in its formation: 12-lipoxygenase converts DHA to its 14-hydroxperoxy intermediate, 14(S)-hydroperoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-DHA (14-HpDHA); 14-HpDHA is converted enzymatically to its 13(S),14(S) <b>epoxy</b> <b>derivative,</b> termed 13(S),14(S)-epoxy-maresin which is then enzymatically hydrolyzed to Mar1. Byproducts of this metabolism include the reduction of 14-HpDHA to its hydroxyl counterpart, 14(S)-hydroxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z-DHA (14-HDPA); the 5-lipoxygenase-dependent conversion of 14-HpDHA and/or 14-HDHA to 7(S),14(S)-dihydroxy-4Z,8E,10Z,12E,15Z,19Z-DHA; and the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of 14-HpDHA to 7(S/R),14(S)-DHA and 13(S/R)-DHA products. [...] Concurrently, the macrophages also convert DHA to 13(R),14(S)-dihydroxy-4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid, i.e. maresin 2 (MaR2).

Incubation of the enzyme {{in the presence}} of Dol-PP-linked [14 C]oligosaccharides and the N- 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoylated <b>epoxy</b> <b>derivative</b> leads to the double-labelling of two subunits (48 and 66 kDa) of the oligomeric OST complex, both of which are involved in the catalytic activity. Labelling of both subunits was blocked competitively by the acceptor peptide N-benzoyl-Asu-Gly-Thr-NHCH 3 and by the OST inhibitor N-benzoyl-alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid-Gly-Thr-NHCH 3, but not by an analogue derived from the epoxy-inhibitor by replacing asparagine with glutamine. Our data clearly show that double-labelling is an active-site-directed modification, involving inhibitor glycosylation at asparagine and covalent attachment of the glycosylated inhibitor, via the epoxy group, to the enzyme. Double-labelling of OST can occur as the result of either a consecutive or a syn-catalytic reaction sequence. The latter mechanism, during the course of which OST catalyses its own 'suicide' inactivation, is more likely, as suggested by indirect experimental evidence. The syn-catalytic mechanism corresponds with our current view of the functional role of the acceptor site Thr/Ser acting as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, not a donor, during transglycosylation...|$|E

Based on the experience acquired by humans over the years by exploiting plant-derived products or secondary metabolites, this thesis was aimed to analyse the chemical components of some plants from the Mozambican flora used in the traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Extracts of Cadaba natalensis (Capparaceae), Clematis viridiflora (Ranunculaceae), Brachylaena discolor (Asteraceae) and Senna spectabilis (Fabaceae) plant species were investigated for their chemical constituents. By fractionation based on various chromatographic methods, forty metabolites were isolated and their chemical structures were determined. Out of these, three were found to be novel metabolites, All in all, 40 secondary metabolites belonging to the three main classes of secondary metabolites were isolated and their structures were determined by high resolution NMR and MS techniques. The macrocyclic dibenzo-diazocyclododecanedione (134), (S) - 2 -ethyl- 2 -methyloxazolidin- 5 -one (139 a), and 4 -methoxy- 3 -methyl- 2 -(methylthio) - 1 Hindole (141) were the three novel metabolites, while the (R) - 5 -ethyl- 5 -methyloxazolidin- 2 -one (140) was isolated as natural product for the first time. The structures on these metabolites were determined by extensive use ofthe spectroscopic techniques of NMR (1 D- and 2 D-NMR), IR, as well as MS data. The structures of the known compounds were determined by the same techniques, and confirmed by the comparison of their spectroscopicdata with those reported in the literature. Isolated metabolites with interesting structural features were assayed for in vitro antiprotozoal activity towards two Leishmania strain, Leishmania amazonensis clon 1 and L. braziliensis.

The current studies were designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that membrane-associated PLA 2 -induced release of arachidonic acid (AA) and/or its metabolites may serve as an upstream mediator of Ang II-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Ang II stimulated transient dose-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK with a maximum at 1 μM (10 min). Inhibition of PLA 2 by mepacrine diminished both AA release and MAPK phosphorylation, induced by Ang II. Furthermore, AA itself induced time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK, supporting the importance of PLA 2 as a mediator of Ang II signaling. The effects of both Ang II and AA on MAPK phosphorylation were protein kinase C independent and abolished by the inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme, ketoconazole. Moreover, 5, 6 -epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and 14, 15 -epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, the cytochrome P 450 -dependent metabolites of AA, significantly stimulated MAPK activity in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells.

Elevated temperatures are required to cure the epoxy resins with the phosphorus-contaning diamine; however, when Tedlar is being bonded, lower curing temperatures must be used to avoid shrinkage and the concomitant formation of surface defects. Thus, the phosphorus-containing aromatic amine curing agent cannot be used alone, although it is possible to use it in conjunction with an aliphatic amine which would allow lower cure temperatures to be used. The experimental epoxy resins have not provided adhesive bonds quite as strong as those provided by Epon 828 when compared in peel tests, but the differences are not very significant.

The reversibility of the Lewis acid-base reaction between CO 2 and amines has been applied in numerous reaction and separation processes and chapter I gives a short overview of the different areas. Up to date this interaction has not been used to steer the selectivity of a reaction and in this context, switchable solvents are applied in the selective homogeneous hydrogenation to steer the chemoselectivity in chapter II. The interaction between CO 2 and amine was ensured by using the switchable solvent system of DBU and 1 -hexanol. This switchable solvent system was characterised in detail {{in order to obtain}} a deeper insight on its effects in the reaction. Different homogeneous rhodium-complexes were evaluated as catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene and 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene and the presence of various bases on the selectivity towards cyclohexene was investigated. As a result, the rhodium-complex [Rh(cod) (dppp) ]BF 4 was selected for further studies including concentration profiles, mechanistic considerations and catalyst recycling in the switchable solvent system. In chapter III, switchable ligands for the control of coordination geometries in catalysis are discussed. These ligands are guanidine substituted triphenylphosphines, which can interact with CO 2 in presence of an alcohol. The synthesis of these ligands is described and the interaction between the ligands, 1 -hexanol and CO 2 is investigated using high-pressure NMR spectroscopy. The largest interaction was found between the meta-substituted ligand. The influence of the switchable ligands on the regioselectivity in the rhodium-catalysed hydroformylation of 1 -octene was tested, where the influence of the substituted position (ortho, meta or para) and different alcohols on the selectivity were evaluated.

[...] The initial 12(S)-HpETE and 12(R)-HpETE products, regardless of their pathway of formation, are rapidly reduced to 12(S)-HETE and 12(R)-HETE, respectively, by ubiquitous cellular peroxidases, including in particular Glutathione peroxidases or, alternatively, are further metabolized as described below.|$|R
40|$|For the immobilization-stabilization of multimeric enzymes, {{we propose}} a novel heterofunctional support {{containing}} {{a very low}} concentration of ionized amino groups and a very high concentration of very poorly reactive glyoxyl (aldehyde) groups. A large tetrameric enzyme, β-galactosidase from Thermus sp., was purified and dramatically stabilized with this novel support. The enzyme was first immobilized by physical adsorption via selective multipoint anionic exchange involving the largest region of the enzyme containing all enzyme subunits. Then, an additional long incubation of the immobilized derivative under alkaline conditions was performed {{in order to promote}} an intense intramolecular multipoint covalent attachment between amino groups of the adsorbed enzyme and the very stable glyoxyl groups on the support. This novel β-galactosidase derivative is the first one in which the four subunits of this enzyme become attached to a pre-existing support. Additionally, the novel amino-glyoxyl supports were much more suitable than amino-epoxy supports for intramolecular multipoint covalent immobilization of the adsorbed enzyme onto the support. In fact, at pH 7. 0, the new supports covalently immobilize the physically adsorbed protein 24 -fold more rapidly than <b>epoxy</b> supports. Furthermore, <b>derivatives</b> prepared on amino-glyoxyl supports preserved 85 % of catalytic activity and were 5 -fold more stable than derivatives prepared on amino-epoxy supports and more than 1000 -fold more stable than soluble enzyme. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess whether {{oxidized}} lipids are released downstream from obstructive plaques after percutaneous coronary and peripheral interventions using distal protection devices. BackgroundOxidation of lipoproteins generates multiple bioactive oxidized lipids that affect atherothrombosis and endothelial function. Direct evidence of their role during therapeutic procedures, which may result in no-reflow phenomenon, myocardial infarction, and stroke, is lacking. MethodsThe presence of specific oxidized lipids was assessed in embolized material captured by distal protection filter devices during uncomplicated saphenous vein graft, carotid, renal, and superficial femoral artery interventions. The presence of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) and oxidized cholesteryl esters (OxCE) was evaluated in 24 filters using liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunostaining. ResultsPhosphatidylcholine-containing OxPL, including (1 -palmitoyl- 2 -[9 -oxo-nonanoyl] PC), representing a major phosphatidylcholine-OxPL molecule quantitated within plaque material, [1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(5 -oxo-valeroyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine], and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -glutaroyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine, were identified in the extracted lipid portion from all vascular beds. Several species of OxCE, such as keto, hydroperoxide, hydroxy, and <b>epoxy</b> cholesteryl ester <b>derivatives</b> from cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate, were also present. The presence of OxPL was confirmed using enzyme-linked immunoassays and immunohistochemistry of captured material. ConclusionsThis study documents the direct release and capture of OxPL and OxCE during percutaneous interventions from multiple arterial beds in humans. Entrance of bioactive oxidized lipids into the microcirculation may mediate adverse clinical outcomes during therapeutic procedures...|$|R
40|$|With its {{worldwide}} {{availability and}} its low market-price native starch provides {{the potential for}} the use as a bio-based material. However, in its native form it is highly hydrophilic, not cold-water dispersible and only forms brittle films. So, our work aimed at the chemical modification of degraded starch for the application in the coating sector as binder, with the focus on paints and varnishes. For this purpose, cold-water dispersible hydrophobized starch esters and ethers with high solid contents (≥ 30 % (w/w)) and viscosities between 100 and 1000 mPa•s should be synthesized. Additionally, they should form continuous films and show adhesion to different substrates. As starting product a degraded potato starch with a molar mass of 1. 18 • 105 g/mol was used and modified by carboxylic acid anhydrides (C 2 -C 4) and carboxylic acid vinylesters (C 6) {{in the case of the}} esters. <b>Epoxy</b> alkane <b>derivatives</b> were used for the synthesis of hydroxyalkyl starch ethers (C 3 -C 4, C 6). Beside the type of substituent and the chain length, also the degrees of substitution (DS) and molar substitutions (MS) were varied from 0. 05 to 1. 1. The modification led to cold water-soluble or dispersible products with applicable concentrations between 30 and 45 % (w/w) and viscosities in the range of 102 - 103 mPa•s (100 s - 1). The most samples had a newtonian flow behaviour and showed viscoelastic properties with higher values for the loss modulus (G’’). Continuous films were observed with starch esters in the DS range of 0. 11 - 0. 81 and in the case of the starch ethers with MS values of 0. 77 - 0. 91. Wet and dry layer thicknesses of 25 - 50 μm and 7 - 12 μm were obtained (doctor blade: 100 μm). In the cross cut test the esters had clearly better results with values of 0 and 1, in contrast to the tested ether with values of 4. The compatibility tests with 3 commercial binders showed that two Acronal binders (A 754 & S 559) (42 %) showed compatibility with the modified starches (58 %). According our experiments and especially based on the results of the film formation and the cross cut test the starch esters and not the ethers could be the preferred class for an application in the coating sector. Additionally, the results showed that the starch esters could be an alternative to petroleum-based polymers as binder in paints and varnishes potentially...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} {{phytosterol}} oxidation products was determined in samples of crude vegetable oils: peanut, sunflower, maize, palm nut, and lampante olive oils that were intended for refining {{and not for}} direct consumption. The 7 α- and 7 β-hydroxy derivatives of β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol and the 7 -keto-β-sitosterol were the principal phytosterol oxides found in {{almost all of the}} oils analyzed. In some oils, the <b>epoxy</b> and dihydroxy <b>derivatives</b> of β-sitosterol were also found at very low levels. The highest total concentrations of phytosterol oxides, ranging from 4. 5 to 67. 5 and from 4. 1 to 60. 1 ppm, were found in sunflower and maize oils, respectively. Lower concentrations were present in the peanut oils, 2. 7 - 9. 6 ppm, and in the palm nut oil, 5. 5 ppm, whereas in the lampante olive oils, only three samples of the six analyzed contained a low concentration (1. 5 - 2. 5 ppm) of oxyphytosterols. No detectable levels of phytosterol oxides were found in the samples of palm and coconut oils. Bleaching experiments were carried out on a sample of sunflower oil at 80 °C for 1 h with 1 and 2 % of both acidic and neutral earths. The bleaching caused a reduction of the hydroxyphytosterol with partial formation of steroidal hydrocarbons with three double bonds in the ring system at the 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -positions (steratrienes). The same sunflower oil was deodorized at 180 °C under vacuum for 1 h, and no dehydration products were formed with a complete recovery of the hydroxyphytosterols. A bleaching test with acidic earths was carried out also with an extra virgin olive oil fortified with 7 -keto-cholesterol, dihydroxycholesterol, and α-epoxy-cholesterol. There was no formation of steratrienes from these compounds, but dihydroxycholesterol underwent considerable decomposition and α-epoxycholesterol underwent ring opening with formation of the dihydroxy derivative, whereas 7 -ketocholesterol was rather stable...|$|R
