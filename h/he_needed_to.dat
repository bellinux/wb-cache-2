5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{know was}} that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{arrived in}} Princeton, New Jersey, in late December 1805. He had {{completed}} his final exams by April 5, {{but he declined}} his father's offer to come to Washington because <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> catch up on his studies in arithmetic. When the next term began in May, he joined the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, a debating society founded by James Madison, Philip Freneau, Aaron Burr, and Henry Lee in 1769.|$|E

In {{order to do}} this, Casper <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} obstacles, an obstacle course where <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> use his Ethereal Shield to get through bars, a fan room where <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> shoot two red switches {{on the first floor}} and four on the second floor, an arch-way room, and then a room where <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> shoot down 24 spectres. At the end of each of these, there will be a generator with a magically sphere and Casper <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> quickly shoot them down.|$|R
500|$|Myrie-Williams {{believes}} that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{work on his}} heading ability, and despite actively trying to improve it, he states that it still [...] "needs a bit of work".

5|$|Brock felt <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's {{orders from the}} government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|He {{broke his}} nose during {{training}} camp after {{engaging in a}} pickup game. The injury required surgery and <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> wear a mask. On November 23, he made his NBA debut in a 109–88 loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, recording two points and three rebounds in 12 minutes. During his rookie season, he received multiple assignments to the Grand Rapids Drive, the Pistons' D-League affiliate.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Lamason {{was asked}} to be the lead pilot to test the flight paths for a new British airport. As part of the agreement, he was offered a farm in Berkshire. However, family said <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be home instead and Heathrow Airport went ahead without him. In 1948, Lamason moved to Dannevirke, a small rural {{community}} north east of Palmerston North where he acquired 406 acres and became a farmer until his retirement.|$|E

5|$|In another essay, {{he refers}} to James Baldwin's {{struggle}} to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{take control of the}} language and expand it. The Nigerian poet and novelist Gabriel Okara likens the process of language-expansion to the evolution of jazz music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen did {{not give}} up the violin during his time with the battalion, {{continuing}} to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 øre and {{a loaf of bread}} every five days {{for two and a half}} years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> perform at barn dances.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley {{decided to}} run for president, but to have a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election to be held in January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E

Bim asks again and Bam says yes. Bim then calls Bom to come with him and they both exit.|$|R

5|$|The breach between Antony and Octavian {{prompted}} {{a large portion}} of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.|$|E
5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine {{to devote more}} time to cricket. Constantine realised that to succeed as a professional cricketer, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E

5|$|After {{recording}} 18 points (eight {{goals and}} ten assists) over 27 {{games with the}} Barons, Brulé was recalled by the Oilers on January 9, 2012, in lieu of injured forwards Nugent-Hopkins and Jordan Eberle. In order to join the team, however, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> clear re-entry waivers and he was consequently claimed by the Phoenix Coyotes the following day. Brulé debuted with the Coyotes on January 12, playing 14 minutes in a 3–2 shootout loss to the Detroit Red Wings. Two games later, he recorded his first two points as a Coyote, a goal and an assist, in a 6–1 win against the Colorado Avalanche.|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Major Schmidt decided <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> see for himself what was {{happening}} at the bridges. He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a motorcycle escort. Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Despite several {{problems}} {{during the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, setting a time of 1:12.070, just over {{a tenth of a}} second in front of his teammate. Earlier in the session, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> return to pit lane due to a gear-selection problem which had caused him to temporarily stop on track and later spun at turn eleven. Vettel was again third fastest, more than six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. He was followed by teammate Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India, all more than a second slower than Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman {{continued}} to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series {{to a number}} of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision, and <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> pretend to consider it.|$|E
