500|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> {{called my}} dog, E Base, {{who plays a}} lot of {{instruments}} up at Baseline [...] for me and [...] Just Blaze. [...] came through. I programmed the drums in 10 minutes, and then he played all the different parts. This version is all live bass, live guitars, [...] chords on it. I brought it to Hov that night, he heard it, {{he thought of the}} video treatment before he thought of the rap. He just knew it was gonna be the one.|$|E
500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and {{he is wearing a}} pink shirt with the name of the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were not going to allow the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> did it again. We did not want to leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio García said in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; we came out with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good,' {{said that}} gentleman, sipping his peppermint; 'I'll call at Sowerberry's as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> {{tell him to}} send to-morrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} kinds of {{caterpillars}} in America," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that wind their silk up into balls. I mean {{to get some of}} the balls when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> see if <b>I</b> can unwind them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must {{search and}} consider,' said Anne; 'I will hunt him out when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> {{if we have}} a print of him, and if he is tolerably good-looking, I will see what I can do with him.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{concept of the}} series, the three females' boss would be a millionaire who often aided them in their assignments; however, Jackson and Spelling {{decided it would be}} more {{interesting}} to have the boss's identity remain a secret. With this, millionaire Charlie Townsend was an unseen character on the series who only spoke to the Angels via a Western Electric Speakerphone. John Forsythe, who played the unseen Charlie Townsend, directing the 'Angels' crime-fighting operations over a speaker-phone, recorded his lines in an audio studio and was never on set. Thus, Forsythe rarely met any of his female co-stars. Some years later, he bumped into Farrah Fawcett-Majors at the tennis courts, as he recalled, [...] "I was coming off the court when she {{came up to me and}} said, 'Charlie! I finally met Charlie!'". Forsythe was offered the 'Charlie' role in a panicky late-night phone call from producer Aaron Spelling after the original choice, American film, stage and television actor, Gig Young, showed up too intoxicated to read his lines. [...] "I didn't even take my pajamas off – I just put on my topcoat and drove over to Fox. When it was finished, Aaron Spelling said, 'That's perfect.' And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> went back to bed".|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> asked Uma if {{she were}} a Popey, which I had made out to be the native word for Catholics.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{know only}} what dad has written {{and what was}} said about the ranch before we {{purchased}} it. I suppose I'll learn a lot more as soon as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> then I'll let you know about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} two left, Terence, {{so we will}} smoke them together, and I have got a bottle of dacent spirits. Think of that, me boy; thirty-two days without spirits! They will never believe me when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> tell 'em <b>I</b> <b>went</b> without it for thirty-two mortal days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much for {{allowing}} me to interrupt you," [...] said Dorothea, immediately. [...] "I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find him, or even allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon." ...|$|R
60|$|After this <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> told {{my mother}} all my joy, for in truth there was no happier man in Egypt. She listened, then answered, smiling a little.|$|E
60|$|So Major Selby {{departed}} in his cab and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and,</b> {{having nothing}} better to do, turned up my notes on various cases of venous thrombosis, or blood-clot in the veins, which I had treated {{at one time or}} another.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{know what}} I'm going to do about Hen. He's back again; and he and mother have made it up, and they both got to {{drinking}} last night after <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> carried on so that the neighbours came in." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked if}} he missed America and his family, he responded: [...] "Of course. I love when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> get to see my family and get a break, but that is how {{everyone}} feels when they <b>go</b> on vacation. <b>I</b> consider myself as living in Europe. I am always excited and ready to come back." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bonnard did not {{paint from}} life but rather drew his subject—sometimes photographing it as well—and made {{notes on the}} colors. He then painted the canvas in his studio from his notes. [...] "I have all my {{subjects}} to hand", he said, [...] "I {{go back and look}} at them. I take notes. Then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> <b>And</b> before <b>I</b> start painting I reflect, I dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, Sandy, as our {{enterprise}} is handsomely and successfully ended, <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> report; and if ever another one--" ...|$|R
6000|$|She smiled again. [...] "After {{seeing you}} on the street, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> looked up that slip--I saved it, you see. I've {{wanted to see you}} for a long time. You've had a {{wonderful}} life for one so young. This article raked up a whole lot of stuff about you--said you were the son of a preacher--is that so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, I said, old Ballhatchet {{could tell}} that I crossed the bridge {{at the very time}} they were doing this pretty piece of work, for he was sitting smoking in his porch when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and,</b> would you believe it? the old rascal would not {{remember}} who passed that evening! It is all his malice and revenge--nothing else!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Neither,' said Gillian. 'To chatter to Constance Hacket. They both {{spoke to}} me about it {{yesterday}} before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> I believe Constance has written a note to her to ask her today! Fancy, that goose told me my sweet cousin was a dear, and that we didn't appreciate her. Even Miss Hacket gave me quite a lecture on kindness and consideration to an orphan stranger.' ...|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{tomorrow}} <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and,</b> finally, <b>I</b> get to, {{get back}} on my routine, and, you know, skate as much as I've been wanting to skate. Back to my life and get back to-basically, {{the only thing that}} rolls my routine is just skating as much as I feel I need to be skating, um, and spending time with Heaven, really—that's it. Keep it simple! Just work on my craft.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>Home</b> occasionally. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> used to {{know the}} Galleries. (Nervously.) You mustn't think me only a Philistine with--a moustache.|$|R
5000|$|After Memphis {{was swept}} by Phoenix in the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Williams was {{reportedly}} {{involved in an}} altercation with Geoff Calkins, {{a columnist for the}} Commercial Appeal. Sources said that Williams screamed in Calkins' ear and took his pen away from him. Calkins had previously quoted Williams as saying, [...] "I'm happy. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> see my kids and my wife and I'm OK. All of this stuff is secondary to me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{called at}} my tailors {{on the way}} home and ordered a {{yachting}} suit, with a white hat, which they promised to bustle up and have ready in time; and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> told Ethelbertha all I had done. Her delight was clouded by only one reflection--would the dressmaker be able to finish a yachting costume for her in time? That is so like a woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, your sermon last Sunday puzzled me. I could not {{comprehend}} (on your showing) how Paul got that wonderful influence over those pagans which he evidently had; and as how to get influence is a very favourite study of mine, I borrowed the book when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> read for myself; and the matter at last seemed clear enough, on Paul's own showing." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> {{washed out}} my mouth, and {{sprinkled}} my clothes {{with a strong}} solution of permanganate of potash, for, although my own folly was evident, it is always as well to be careful, especially in hot weather. Still I could not help wondering {{what might happen if}} by any chance smallpox were {{to get a hold of}} a population like that of Dunchester, or indeed of a hundred other places in England.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not going}} to wait for you now, but shall confess it all to Aunt Jane as soon as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> try to take it as my {{punishment}} if she asks a terrible number of questions. Perhaps I shall write it, but it would take such a quantity of explanation, and I don't want Aunt Ada to open the letter, as she does any that come while Aunt Jane is out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mind so much now," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "Now that I've seen {{a friendly}} face, <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to bed early." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{these people}} are desperate. It is {{impossible}} {{for the world to}} realize the earnestness of these farmers. Just see the interest the women-folks take in it! No other movement in history--not even the anti-slavery cause--appealed to the women like this movement here in Kansas. Why, sometimes <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> walk the floor like a crazy woman--I get so wrought up over it. While our great politicians split hairs on the tariff, people starve. The time has come for rebellion." ...|$|R
60|$|Peggy and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> told father. We {{felt very}} flat, {{but there was}} nothing to be done or said. Father laughed at the whole thing, but I could not laugh. I was sorry for Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and, though I was angry with her, I was sorry for Aunt Olivia, too. Plainly she felt badly enough over her {{vanished}} hopes and plans, but she had developed a strange and baffling reserve which nothing could pierce.|$|E
60|$|Then Jack Churchill, poor fellow, died. A {{year after}} his death, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> again asked Sara to marry me, as in duty bound. Sara again declined, alleging that her heart was buried in Jack's grave, or words to that effect. I found {{that it did not}} much matter...of course, at thirty-two one does not take these things to heart as at twenty-two. I had enough to occupy me in getting The Maples into working order, and {{beginning}} to educate Betty.|$|E
60|$|In an art {{exhibition}} {{the other}} day I saw a painting that had been sold for $5,000. The painter was a young scrub out of the West named Kraft, who had a favourite food and a pet theory. His pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the Unerring Artistic Adjustment of Nature. His theory was fixed around corned-beef hash with poached egg. There was a story behind the picture, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> let it drip out of a fountain-pen. The idea of Kraft--but {{that is not the}} beginning of the story.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Claude {{had taken}} his hat and stick; he stood looking at her a moment. [...] "You're a comfort in trouble! But <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> pack you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, law! <b>I</b> <b>went</b> right <b>home</b> <b>and</b> hugged them {{children}} {{for a couple}} of hours stiddy," [...] answered Mrs; Wilkins, as if but one conclusion was possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} it worth while," [...] he said, [...] "you had better fetch the police, perhaps. If you take my advice, though, I think <b>I</b> should <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> forget all about it." ...|$|R
