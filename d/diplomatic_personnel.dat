40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Article is twofold: first, to place the {{perception}} of 2 ̆ 2 diplomatic crime 2 ̆ 2 in the United States in a proper factual and legal perspective, and second, to oppose any unilateral legislative attempts, in contravention of both international and domestic law, to remove immunity from criminal jurisdiction presently accorded to foreign <b>diplomatic</b> and consular <b>personnel</b> and their dependents residing in the United States. Specifically, the Article suggests that enactment of legislation such as S. 1437, would contravene existing United States and international law; that U.

On 7 February 1963 the Australian government declared First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra Ivan Skripov persona non grata after he was accused by ASIO of being a spy. According to ASIO, Skripov recruited Kay Marshall, an ASIO agent, firstly by giving her small tasks to gauge her suitability as an agent. In December 1962 Skripov gave Marshall a package which she was to give to a contact in Adelaide, but the contact did not meet Marshall as planned. The package, which had already been inspected by ASIO, contained coded transmission timetables for a Soviet radio station, along with a high-speed message sender which could be attached to a radio transmitter. Two months later the Australian government produced photos of meetings between Skripov and Marshall, and sent the embassy a note declaring Skripov persona non grata for [...] "elaborate preparations for espionage" [...] and gave him seven days to leave the country.
