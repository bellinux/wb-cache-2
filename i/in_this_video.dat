25|$|Since {{much of the}} {{criticism}} {{is the result of}} photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo, Japan, in October 1999, shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.

500|$|The fashion was {{extremely}} important <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video</b> because everything was so minimal ...

500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video</b> are {{not the kind of}} thing you see every day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman, and Benny Blanco, who also produced the song. Kesha said that the song originated from a discussion {{they had in the}} studio on the politics of female-male relationships which Kesha later explained, [...] "The song came about when the people that wrote it — me, Benny Blanco, Neon Hitch and [...] Sean Foreman — all got in a room, and they were talking about how chicks talk too much," [...] "And me and Neon were like, 'No, no, no, guys talk too much," [...] "So, we had this war of who were more obnoxious, chicks or dudes. And the song kind of came around from that conversation. I think I make a pretty fair point both <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video</b> and in the song, that dudes are way more annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Remember December" [...] was {{directed}} by Tim Wheeler, who co-directed the videos of Lovato's previous singles, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] and [...] "La La Land" [...] Lovato was interviewed by MTV News {{on the set of}} the music video, where she stated that it stays true to the song's theme: [...] "The music video relates to the song in a way ... And so instead of having a love interest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video,</b> it's all about being fierce and kind of, like, taking control as a girl. It's like girl empowerment. Yeah, divas!" [...] She described the video as [...] "really, really glam rock". According to Wheeler, the concept behind the video was to incorporate different lights and backlights. The video premiered on November 12, 2009 and was made available for download in the iTunes Store on December 1, 2009.|$|E

500|$|The filming {{took place}} in June 2017 at The Confidante, a hotel located in Miami Beach {{that is part of}} the Unbound Collection brand by Hyatt. Hyatt's vice {{president}} of global brands, Sandra Micek, stated that the collaboration between the artist and the hotel made sense to her because [...] " [...] inspiration and its name came from the notion of being a trusted friend". Regarding the shooting, Scholfield commented that the camera was quite near during the dance routines, in order to film more uninterrupted single takes. During an interview with NPR, Lipa commented that, [...] "What I wanted to convey <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video</b> is the unity and togetherness of women supporting each other, helping each other and looking after each other in a situation."

500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>video,</b> Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E
500|$|Among the {{accessories}} shown, {{the wings}} worn {{in the video}} were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team, Haus of Gaga, created the arrows.

The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video</b> the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>video</b> serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|Summarizing the video, Jocelyn Vena MTV News said, [...] "Bieber is seen {{hanging out}} in the catacombs of Bahamian aquariums...In this new clip, Bieber is seen {{performing}} on the beach and frolicking with Hurd.

Shots of the pair in silhouette holding hands play into the video's plot of two young teens falling in love in a very exotic locale." [...] Vena also said that Bieber continues her [...] "knack for Michael Jackson-esque dance moves." [...] (read: bad mimicry and complete rip off of). Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "So romantic," [...] as [...] "they dance in an age-appropriate fashion." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV News reviewed the video positively, stating that it is, [...] "a really nice take on the innocence of young love, full of flirting, dancing and hair-touching." ...|$|E

James Montgomery of MTV said that after watching the video [...] "you are overcome with the sudden urge to go to the Big Apple Circus. Or pick up some Curious perfume. Or you know, possibly both".
