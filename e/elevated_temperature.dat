40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the behaviour and design of high strength steel columns at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> using finite element analysis. In this study, equations predicting the yield strength and elastic modulus of high strength steel and mild steel at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> are proposed. In addition, stress-strain curve model for high strength steel and mild steel materials at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> is also proposed. The numerical analysis was performed on high strength steel columns over a range of column lengths for various temperatures. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results of columns at normal room and <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The effects of initial local and overall geometrical imperfections have been taken into consideration in the analysis. The material properties and stress-strain curves at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> used in the finite element model were obtained from the proposed equations based on the material tests. Two series of box and I-section columns were studied using the finite element analysis to investigate the strength and behaviour of high strength steel columns at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Both fixed-ended stub columns and pin-ended slender columns were considered. The column strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, European and Australian specifications for hot-rolled steel columns at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> by substituting the reduced material properties. In addition, the direct strength method, which was developed for the design of cold-formed steel columns at normal room temperature, was also used in this study to predict the high strength steel column strengths at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The suitability of these design rules for high strength steel columns at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> is assessed. Generally, it is shown that the American and European specifications as well as the direct strength method conservatively predicted the column strengths of high strength steel at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The European Code predictions are slightly more conservative than the American Specification and the direct strength method predictions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Further {{separation}} {{was carried}} out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH≈3.5), using ion exchange at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature.</b> The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature.</b> Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical and microstructural {{characteristics of a}} lightweight aggregate geopolymer concrete (LWAGC) synthesized by the alkali-activation of a fly ash source (FA) before and after being exposed to <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures,</b> ranging from 100 to 800 °C. The {{results show that the}} LWAGC unexposed to the <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> possesses a good strength-to-weight ratio compared with other LWAGCs available in the published literature. The unexposed LWAGC also shows an excellent strength development versus aging times, up to 365 days. For the exposed LWAGC to the <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 100 to 800 °C, the results illustrate that the concretes gain compressive strength after being exposed to <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 100, 200 and 300 °C. Afterward, the strength of the LWAGC started to deteriorate and decrease after being exposed to <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 400 °C, and up to 800 °C. Based on the mechanical strength results of the exposed LWAGCs to <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 100 °C to 800 °C, the relationship between the exposure temperature and the obtained residual compressive strength is statistically analyzed and achieved. In addition, the microstructure investigation of the unexposed LWAGC shows a good bonding between aggregate and mortar at the interface transition zone (ITZ). However, this bonding is subjected to deterioration as the LWAGC is exposed to <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 400, 600 and 800 °C by increasing the microcrack content and swelling of the unreacted silicates...|$|R

25|$|The most {{versatile}} among dialkylboranes is 9-BBN. It exists predominantly as a dimer. It can be distilled without decomposition at 195°C (12mm Hg). Such property allows 9-BBN to react at 60–80°C, and most alkenes react within one hour in such temperature range. Even tetrasubstituted alkenes undergo hydroboration with 9-BBN at <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature.</b> As mentioned before, 9-BBN has excellent regioselectivity in hydroboration of alkenes. It is {{more sensitive to}} subtle steric differences than Sia2BH, because the rigid hetereocyclic substituents prevent internal rotation to relieve steric hindrance in the transition state. Reflecting its greater sensitivity to electronic factors, 9-BBN is more reactive towards alkenes than alkynes.|$|E

The chlorohydrin process was unattractive for several reasons, including low efficiency and loss of valuable chlorine into calcium chloride. More efficient direct oxidation of ethylene by air was invented by Lefort in 1931 and in 1937 Union Carbide opened the first plant using this process. It was further improved in 1958 by Shell Oil Co. by replacing air with oxygen and using <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> of 200–300°C and pressure (1–3 MPa).

25|$|Like {{many other}} peptides, {{aspartame}} may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids {{under conditions of}} <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life {{is only a few}} days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable.
