5|$|An ephemeral/fluctuating pool natural {{community}} {{known as}} the Edgewood Vernal Pools is located on and near Nescopeck Mountain. It consists of dozens of vernal pools created by glaciation. Numerous amphibian species breed in the pools and hardwood trees and hemlock are present on the southern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> system. A globally rare species of invertebrate was observed in the pools in 1990. Another system of vernal pools {{known as the}} Briggsville Vernal Pools are found north of the ridge.|$|E
25|$|Typically, rats swim {{around the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> first before venturing {{out into the}} center in a {{meandering}} pattern before stumbling upon the hidden platform. However, as {{time spent in the}} pool increases experience, the amount of time needed to locate the platform decreases, with veteran rats swimming directly to the platform almost immediately after being placed in the water.|$|E
25|$|After filming was {{completed}} on Fiesta, Williams {{appeared in the}} romance This Time for Keeps (1947) with singer Johnnie Johnston. In 1948, Williams {{signed a contract with}} swimwear company Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson, and Williams and the other swimmers in her films wore Cole swimsuits. Since the aqua-musicals were an entirely new genre, the studio's costume designers had little experience creating practical swimsuits. William's plaid flannel swimsuit for Thrill of a Romance (1945) was so heavy that she was dragged {{to the bottom of the}} pool, and had to unzip the suit, swimming naked to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> to avoid drowning. Cole swimsuits used latex, which meant zippers were no longer necessary. While filming Skirts Ahoy (1952), Williams discovered that members of the WAVES program received thin, cotton, shapeless swimsuits as part of their uniforms. Williams modeled a Cole swimsuit for the Secretary of the Navy and explained that the new swimsuits helped support women's figures. The United States Navy ordered 50,000 suits immediately.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} picnic tables on <b>the</b> {{opposite}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek, {{and it is}} easy to cross over by following <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pools.</b> It is possible to swim behind the falls and enter a small rock shelter behind it. However, drownings have occurred.|$|R
25|$|Tanymastix stagnalis survives drought as resting eggs, {{which are}} dark brown, 0.40–0.43mm in diameter, coppery-brown in colour and, {{characteristically}} for the genus Tanymastix, lentil-shaped. Each ovisac produces 8–14 eggs, which are laid in open water. The eggs usually float, {{and tend to}} accumulate at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Canoe polo {{is played}} either indoors in {{swimming}} pools or outdoors on a pitch which should measure 35 meters by 23 meters. [...] <b>The</b> boundaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch are ideally marked using floating ropes (similar to lane markers in swimming), although for smaller venues <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> are frequently used.|$|R
2500|$|Even with {{artificial}} reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a [...] "flat spell", when no waves are available. Completely artificial Wave pools aim {{to solve that}} problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however {{there are only a}} handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to 10-foot faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2nbsp&billion to build and was expensive to maintain. The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave, situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.|$|E
60|$|The {{last words}} of Tua's chant died away, {{and with them}} that picture passed. Janees leapt back from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> glaring at Asti.|$|E
60|$|He found, in fact, {{that at a}} {{distance}} of twenty yards {{from the edge of the}} bare rock it was but the same distance from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> to the brow of the cliff.|$|E
60|$|So {{they all}} stood {{side by side}} on one <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lightly {{the golden}} glory rose till only the highest peaks {{retained}} its flame; then it leapt to the clouds behind the peaks, and gorgeously lit their somber sulphurous masses. <b>The</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> grew black as night; <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream grew stern; {{and a cold}} wind began to fall from the heights, sliding like an invisible but palpable icy cataract.|$|R
60|$|Just then Billy Mink saw {{a little}} brown head {{swimming}} along one <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool.</b>|$|R
60|$|Creeping to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> {{he listened}} to its turmoil, for the shadows were {{gathering}} so fast that, with some ghostlike shapes of foam excepted, he could not even see {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
60|$|Harry did not reply; {{his face}} was white with excitement. He walked forward slowly till he reached the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> It was some fifteen yards across, and the colour of the water showed {{that it was very}} deep.|$|E
6000|$|But she wasn't sure a Scarecrow couldn't drown {{and never}} relaxed her speed until {{she stood on}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> with the spray dashing in her face. Cap'n Bill, puffing and panting, had just voice enough to ask, as he reached her side: ...|$|E
60|$|As he {{finished}} speaking, again the tumult broke out, some crying {{this thing and}} some that. But no action was taken, for Nam's excuse was ready and plausible, and <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> men were confused. So the assembly broke up in disorder; only the priests and as many more as could find place, Olfan among them, crowded round <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> {{to see what happened}} in its depths.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Peter Rabbit, {{stretching}} {{himself out}} in the soft grass on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool.</b> [...] "Do tell us about it. Please do, Grandfather Frog!" ...|$|R
50|$|The falls {{are known}} for their natural pools, created by mineralization, {{although}} most of these pools were damaged and/or destroyed in the early 1990s by large floods that washed through the area. A small man-made dam was constructed to help restore <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> and to preserve what is left. There are many picnic tables on <b>the</b> opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek and it is very easy to cross over by following <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pools.</b> It is possible to swim behind the falls and enter a small rock shelter behind it.|$|R
60|$|For a {{while there}} was silence, then the clamour broke out with redoubled violence, and {{a portion of the}} {{multitude}} made a rush round the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> towards the rock platform, which was repelled by the soldiers in a very half-hearted way.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the easiest}} thing in the world," [...] said the Story Girl, tiptoeing to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> to peep at her own arch reflection, as some nymph {{left over from the}} golden age might do. [...] "Beautiful {{thoughts}} just crowd into your mind at times." ...|$|E
60|$|Around the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> was a level platform, {{and then}} {{the walls of the}} cave rose perpendicularly for a few feet to arch toward the centre of the low roof. The walls about the ledge were pierced with a number of entrances to dimly lighted passageways.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; {{you know}} well enough which one I mean. The one that ran along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{stagnant}} <b>pool</b> into which you tumbled as we were coming back." ...|$|R
60|$|Grandfather Frog sat {{among the}} bulrushes on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool.</b> Over his head Mr. Redwing was singing {{as if his}} heart would burst with <b>the</b> very joy <b>of</b> springtime.|$|R
60|$|The Merry Little Breezes threw {{themselves}} down on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool,</b> where <b>the</b> rushes grow tall, {{and there}} they took turns rocking the cradle which held Mrs. Redwing's four babies.|$|R
60|$|She obeyed, {{for with}} hope her {{strength}} seemed, to {{have returned to}} her, {{and the two of}} them scrambled down the cliffs into the kloof. As they reached the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> they saw great snouts and a disturbance in the water. Rachel was right, crocodiles lived there.|$|E
60|$|We {{were soon}} to know, however, for as {{we reached the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> {{directly}} above the thing, Xodar cried out a few words in a strange tongue. Immediately a hatch cover was raised {{from the surface of}} the object, and a black seaman sprang from the bowels of the strange craft.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not a}} hard one, but {{the ground}} was slippery, and the child's foot slipped, and she fell at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> her dress going partly into the water. At the same instant, Richard reeled, and almost fell beside her, from a heavy blow between the eyes from James's fist.|$|E
50|$|The Yrjönkatu Swimming Hall's {{first floor}} {{contains}} a 25 × 10 metre pool, two saunas and dressing closets at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> <b>The</b> second floor contains resting cabins, saunas and a café. The hall sells {{two kinds of}} tickets, providing access either {{to the first floor}} only or to both floors. Traditionally, people swam naked in <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> but since 2001, it has been allowed to wear a swimsuit. Men and women have separate days for swimming. In March 2012, the hall reported it was switching its original 1928 wooden sauna stove to a new one {{to cut down on the}} smoke damages to the Forum building. The new wooden sauna stove was taken into use in August 2013. It is 2.8 metres high and is thought to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest wooden sauna stoves in Finland.|$|R
60|$|By and by {{they came}} {{skipping}} back, one by one, to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool,</b> {{each with a}} fat, foolish, green fly, and each stopping to give Mrs. Redwing's cradle a gentle push.|$|R
50|$|Technique of {{work piece}} {{cleaning}} and filler metal addition {{is similar to}} that in TIG welding. Filler metal is added at <b>the</b> leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld <b>pool.</b> Filler metal is not required in making root pass weld.|$|R
60|$|Three {{times they}} wheeled about the {{interior}} of the oval chamber, to settle finally upon the damp, cold bowlders that fringe the outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> In the center of one side the largest rock was reserved for the queen, and here she took her place surrounded by her terrible guard.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} sitting on the far <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> staring down into the water, resting her head on one {{drawn-up}} knee. She had been bathing; he could see that at once. Her coppery body was still wet and glistening with moisture, sparkling in the sun. She had not seen him. He stopped, holding his breath, watching her.|$|E
6000|$|As soon as Mrs. Trout had started, Tommy Trout swam off {{by himself}} to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> [...] "I wonder {{what is on the}} other side of the Big Rock," [...] said Tommy Trout. [...] "The sun is shining and the brook is {{laughing}} and nothing could happen if I go just a little speck of a ways." ...|$|E
60|$|Billy Mink {{ran around}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool</b> and {{turned down by}} the Laughing Brook. His eyes twinkled with mischief, and he hurried as only Billy can. As he passed Jerry Muskrat's house, Jerry saw him.|$|R
60|$|When {{finally he}} reached <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Smiling <b>Pool</b> {{he was quite}} out of breath. There sat Great-Grandfather Frog on his big, green lily pad. He was {{blinking}} his great goggle eyes at jolly, round, red Mr. Sun.|$|R
50|$|On <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{dinner at}} the Recchi villa for the investors, a {{conversation}} between Edoardo Jr. and Eva is overheard, revealing she is pregnant with his child. Antonio prepares ukha. When Edoardo sees this dish served, he instantly realizes his mother is {{having an affair with}} Antonio. He leaves the dinner table in a fury. Emma follows him outside to the garden and alongside <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> she tries to talk to him. At this point they speak Russian. In pulling away from Emma's outstretched hand Eduardo loses his balance, falls, strikes his head on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool's</b> stone trim, and falls into <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> He sustains a cerebral haemorrhage and dies in hospital.|$|R
