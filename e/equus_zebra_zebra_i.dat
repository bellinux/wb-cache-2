40|$|Neoplasia {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{in the vast majority}} of metazoans. The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0. 2 % observed in Canada geese (. Branta canadensis) to more than 50 % recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (. Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and Cape mountain <b>zebras</b> (. <b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>zebra).</b> The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals. The chapter additionally compares cancer recorded in French zoological parks to those obtained at other zoological parks. Finally, we provide an updated list of cancer recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals...|$|R
40|$|The short-interval fires {{required}} to promote grazing for large herbivores within the Cape Floristic Region World Heritage Site are detrimental to plant diversity. At the same time, longer interval fires significantly reduce graze quality. Conservation managers thus face an enormous challenge when the herbivores {{are also a}} conservation priority, since the competing conservation objectives are difficult to reconcile. Population growth rates of genetically important populations of endangered Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>zebra)</b> are low or declining following management focused on their fynbos habitat. Investigation of spatial and temporal habitat use and the diet of Cape mountain <b>zebra,</b> focusing {{on the use of}} land historically converted to agricultural grassland within fynbos in De Hoop Nature Reserve (South Africa), determined factors limiting populations and facilitated development of management strategies. <b>Zebras</b> selected grassland over other habitat types, despite grassland accounting for only a small proportion of the reserve. Grasses also made up the greatest proportion of diet for <b>zebras</b> throughout the year. Time spent on grasslands increased with grass height and was likely to have been influenced by grass protein levels. It is likely that grazing resources are a limiting factor for <b>zebra,</b> and so options for improving and/or increasing grassland at De Hoop should be considered. Translocation of surplus males to other conservation areas, reductions in other herbivore populations and targeted burns to increase grassland availability all offer short-term solutions.

Bovine papillomavirus (BVP) affects mainly the epidermis, but also the dermis in several species including bovine, the best-known example being equine sarcoid, which is {{associated with}} BVP types 1 and 2. This publication describes and illustrates the macroscopic and histological appearance of BPV-associated papillomatous, fibropapillomatous or sarcoid-like lesions in Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>zebra)</b> from the Gariep Dam Nature Reserve, 2 giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) from the Kruger National Park, and a sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) from the Kimberley area of South Africa. An African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) cow from Kruger National Park also had papillomatous lesions but molecular characterisation of lesional virus was not done. Immunohistochemical staining using polyclonal rabbit antiserum to chemically disrupted BPV- 1, which cross-reacts with the L 1 capsid of most known papillomaviruses, was positive in cells of the stratum granulosum of lesions in Giraffe 1, the sable and the buffalo and negative in those of the <b>zebra</b> and Giraffe 2. Fibropapillomatous and sarcoid-like lesions from an adult bovine were used as positive control for the immunohistochemistry and are described and the immunohistochemistry illustrated for comparison. Macroscopically, both adult female giraffe had severely thickened multifocal to coalescing nodular and occasionally ulcerated lesions of the head, neck and trunk with local poorly-circumscribed invasion into the subcutis. Necropsy performed on the 2 nd giraffe revealed neither internal metastases nor serious underlying disease. Giraffe 1 had scattered, and Giraffe 2 numerous, large, anaplastic, at times indistinctly multinucleated dermal fibroblasts with bizarre nuclei within the sarcoid-like lesions, which were BPV- 1 positive in Giraffe 1 and BPV- 1 and - 2 positive in Giraffe 2 by RT-PCR. The sable antelope presented with a solitary large lesion just proximal to the right hind hoof, which recurred after excision, and was BPV- 1 positive by RT-PCR. Other wart-like growths were present elsewhere on the body. The Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> either succumbed from their massive lesions or were euthanased or removed from the herd because of them. The lesions wereBPV- 1 and/or - 2 positive byRT-PCR. The buffalo lesions were wart-like papillomatous projections in the inguinal and udder region.

40|$|Up until 2004, {{the burning}} regime {{applied in the}} Bontebok National Park was aimed at {{maintaining}} grazing conditions suitable for bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus). It was, however, not suitable for maintaining plant species diversity, an increasingly urgent conservation priority for the park. Accordingly, the burning regime was changed in 2004 to increase the interval between fires. A possible unintended outcome of the new burning regime is the spread of grazing lawns {{which is likely to}} be deleterious for maintaining the diversity of rare plants. Red grass, Themeda triandra, a species often locally abundant in areas preferred by bontebok, is potentially a good indicator of the anticipated change because, although it persists with moderate grazing, it is sensitive to localised intense grazing and will decrease on grazing lawns. To gauge the potential of this indicator, the canopy spread cover, degree of defoliation and inflorescence production of T. triandrawas determined at 13 permanently marked sites in November 2005. The results are compared with a survey conducted 20 years previously (October&ndash;November 1984 and October&ndash;November 1985) using similar methodology. The results suggest that T. triandra remained abundant over the previous 20 years&rsquo; application of the prior burning regime. In 1984 &ndash; 1985, defoliation of T. triandra was high within 1 year after a fire but declined quickly thereafter. In 2005, the tendency for the defoliation level to decline with increasing time after a fire was still apparent, but it was much less marked than in the previous survey period. A likely cause of this was the fact that Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>zebra)</b> and red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus caama) were present in 2005 but absent in 1984 &ndash; 1985 and these taller-grass grazers would have contributed {{to the use of the}} older veld. Provided it is interpreted together with other monitoring programmes, the use of T. triandra cover and defoliation intensity appears promising as an efficient indicator of some of the potentially deleterious outcomes of the interactions between herbivory and the new burning regime. Conservation implications: The conservation objectives of maintaining (1) large mammal herbivory as an ecological process and (2) plant species diversity may be difficult to reconcile with each other in the highly fragmented renosterveld and lowland fynbos ecosystems.

40|$|Sarcoid-like tumours {{have been}} {{reported}} in Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> <b>zebra)</b> in two South African game parks recently. These tumours caused severe distress to the animals and also made them unsightly for tourists visiting the parks. The aim of this investigation was to identify and characterize the infectious agent considered {{to be involved in the}} aetiology of sarcoid in the Cape mountain <b>zebra.</b> Bovine papillomaviruses (BPV) - 1 and - 2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in sarcoid tumour tissue, but not from blood specimens or unaffected skin. Differentiation between BPV- 1 and - 2 was made by using the restriction endonuclease BstXI on PCR products of the E 5 open reading frame (ORF). A hybridization probe real-time assay was developed for the specific and sensitive detection and differentiation of BPV- 1 and - 2 DNA in blood, skin and sarcoid tumour samples. For the specific detection of BPV- 1, an increase in fluorescence was detected at 640 nm and of BPV- 2 at 705 nm. The test is extremely sensitive and able to detect 1. 5 genome copies/reaction. The presence of BPV- 1 and - 2 DNA could be demonstrated in the blood of sarcoid-affected and -unaffected <b>zebras</b> even in the blood of <b>zebras</b> from parks where sarcoids have never been observed. The phylogenetic relationships of the papillomaviruses detected in tumours in the Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> in comparison with a broad selection of papillomavirus sequences available in GenBank were compiled. The papillomavirus sequences retrieved from the <b>zebras</b> were identified as variants of either BPV- 1 or BPV- 2. The age of the most recent common ancestor for BPV- 1 variants is estimated to be 1. 40 million years (Mya) and for BPV- 2 variants, 0. 55 Mya. The age of the most recent common ancestor of BPV- 1 and BPV- 2 is estimated to be 5. 34 Mya. Certain major histocompatibility (MHC) haplotypes are associated with increased risk of sarcoid tumours in horses. The <b>zebras</b> in these parks may have become inbred for the MHC region with increased prevalence for a haplotype, conferring increased risk for sarcoid tumours. Therefore typing system was developed to determine whether or not a high prevalence of sarcoids among <b>zebras</b> is associated with a MHC haplotype. Single strand conformational polymorphism was used to assess the genetic variation in MHC class II genes. The use of DQB and DRB genes demonstrated that genetic variation and sarcoids in the <b>zebras</b> could not be attributed to a specific haplotype. The developed real-time PCR technique was also applied in the detection of cutaneous papillomavirus in two giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) which were manifesting cutaneous papillomatosis, in the Kruger National Park and in a fibropapilloma in a sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), on a game farm in the Kimberley district, South Africa. In conclusion, this was the first study to confirm the presence of BPV- 1 and - 2 DNA in the sarcoid tumours, healthy skin and blood of sarcoid-affected and healthy free-roaming <b>zebras</b> from sarcoidaffected parks. The presence of BPV- 1 and - 2 DNA in the blood of <b>zebras</b> from parks where sarcoids have not been previously observed was a significant finding.

5000|$|The social {{behavior}} of the Asian wild ass can be very different, depending on different habitats, ranges and even threats by predators and humans.

Also, annual large hikes occur 4,5 km2 to 40 km2, where hiking in summer are more limited than in the winter.

50|$|The plains <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> quagga, {{formerly}} Equus burchelli) is {{the most}} common, and has or had about six subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the common <b>zebra,</b> the dauw, Burchells <b>zebra</b> (actually the subspecies <b>Equus</b> quagga burchellii), Chapmans <b>zebra,</b> Wahlbergs <b>zebra,</b> Selous <b>zebra,</b> Grants <b>zebra,</b> Boehms <b>zebra</b> and the quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).|$|R
50|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30-50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's <b>zebra</b> between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, and {{there is no evidence that}} they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's mountain <b>zebra</b> (<b>Equus</b> <b>zebra</b> hartmannae).|$|R
