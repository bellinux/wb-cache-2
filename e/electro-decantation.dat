40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} incorporating gel mold, electrode chambers, and direct-contact cooling plates. It eliminates several steps in preparing and handling the gel, and permits use of either rigid (starch) of flexible (acrylamide) gels. Electrophoretic analyses {{can be completed}} in 2 - 4 hr. Examples are given of serum and hemoglobin electrophoretic patterns obtained. ‘T 1 HE INTRODUC”ION of starch gel as an electrophoresis medimn by Smithies k 4) arkecl a significant advance {{in the analysis of}} serum proteins. The increased resolving power afforded by this medium is indicated by the fact that as many as 30 distinct components can be electrophoretically separated; only 5 or 6 are usually observed on paper or in free-solution electrophoresis. Acrylamide gel (2, 3, 7) produces resolutions of serum protein qualitatively similar to those seen in starch gel. In order to exploit fully the inherent advantages of these media in electrophoretic analysis, apparatus specially designed to accomodate their particular properties ought to he employed. Smithies (5) has demonstrated the desirability of supporting the gel iii a vertical posi-tion to avoid distortions in the electrophoretic pattern due to <b>electro-decantation</b> effects in the sample application slot. His apparatus cannot he used for acrylamide gel because the elastic and flexihile gel cannot support its own weight. The apparatus described herein is designed to utilize the superior resolving power of vertical-gel electrophoresis, either of starch or aerylamide gel, for analysis of serum, hemoglobin, and other protei...|$|E
