40|$|A {{centrifugal}} compressor is a mechanical machine with purpose to convert kineticenergy from a rotating <b>impeller</b> <b>wheel</b> into the fluid medium by compressingit. One application involves supplying boost air pressure to downsized internalcombustion engines (ICE). This allows, {{for a given}} combustion chamber volume,more oxygen to the combustion process, which is key for an elevated energeticefficiency and reducing emissions. However, the {{centrifugal compressor}} is limitedat off-design operating conditions by the inception of flow instabilities causingrotating stall and/or surge. These instabilities appear at low flow rates andtypically leads to large vibrations and stress levels. Such instabilities affectthe operating life-time of the machine and are associated with significant noiselevels. The flow in centrifugal compressors is complex due {{to the presence of}} a widerange of temporal- and spatial-scales and flow instabilities. The success fromconverting basic technology into a working design depends on understandingthe flow instabilities at off-design operating conditions, which limit significantlythe performance of the compressor. Therefore, the thesis aims to elucidate theunderlying flow mechanisms leading to rotating stall and/or surge by means ofnumerical analysis. Such knowledge may allow improved centrifugal compressordesigns enabling them to operate more silent over a broader operating range. Centrifugal compressors may have complex shapes with a rotating partthat generate turbulent flow separation, shear-layers and wakes. These flowfeatures must be assessed if one wants to understand the interactions among theflow structures at different locations within the compressor. For high fidelityprediction of the complex flow field, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approachis employed, which enables capturing relevant flow-driven instabilities underoff-design conditions. The LES solution sensitivity to the grid resolution usedand to the time-step employed has been assessed. Available experimentaldata in terms of compressor performance parameters, time-averaged velocity,pressure data (time-averaged and spectra) were used for validation purposes. LES produces a substantial amount of temporal and spatial flow data. Thisnecessitates efficient post-processing and introduction of statistical averagingin order to extract useful information from the instantaneous chaotic data. Inthe thesis, flow mode decomposition techniques and statistical methods, suchas Fourier spectra analysis, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), ProperOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two-point correlations, respectively, areemployed. These methods allow quantifying large coherent flow structures atvfrequencies of interest. Among the main findings a dominant mode was foundassociated with surge, which is categorized as a filling and emptying processof the system as a whole. The computed LES data suggest that it is causedby substantial periodic oscillation of the impeller blade incidence flow angleleading to complete system flow reversal. The rotating stall flow mode occurringprior to surge and co-existing with it, was also captured. It shows rotating flowfeatures upstream of the impeller {{as well as in the}} diffuser.

40|$|INTEGRAL COMPRESSOR / GENERATOR / FAN UNITARY STRUCTURE. *) Dr. Nelik Dreiman Consultant, P. O. Box 144, Tipton, MI E-mail: ndreiman@frontier. com An {{extremely}} compact, therefore {{space saving}} single compressor/generator/cooling fan structure of short axial length and light weight {{has been developed}} to provide generation of electrical power with simultaneous operation of the compressor when power is unavailable or function as a regular AC compressor powered by a power line. The generators and air conditioning or mobile refrigeration compressors are designed and used at present as independent units (portable or automatic standby generator and a compressor of a condenser unit; car generator and AC compressor; generator driven by auxiliary engine and compressor of a trailer refrigeration unit, etc.). Such design makes it necessary to provide {{a considerable amount of}} material, installation space for every independent unit and requires separate mounting, wiring andÂ maintenance The present paper contemplates single unit serving as both a compressor and a generator to overcome the disadvantages related to utilization of independent multi-units specified above. The unitary compressor/generator structure is developed by radial integration of a revolving piston rotary compressor with an external rotor electric motor which can function as a motor or as an output generator. The integrally formed revolving piston compressor can be selectively driven by either the compressor electric motor powered by a line supply or by the external driver means when a source of electrical power is unavailable. The compressor driven by the external driver means pumps refrigerant and simultaneously produce electric power for utility by employing the generating mode of the compressors electric motor. Novel revolving piston rotary compressor which provides possibility for such integration comprises the following: a suction gas delivery system which provides cooling of the electric motor / generator and supplies refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged); a modified discharge system and lubricating oil supply system. Axial passages formed in the stationary crankshaft are used to supply discharge gas to a condenser, to return vaporized cooling agent from the evaporator to the suction cavity of the compressor, to pass a lubricant and to accommodate wiring for an electric power supply and transmission. An <b>impeller</b> <b>wheel</b> attached externally and spaced concentrically to the spinning piston is utilized to cool the compressor and direct the air over a condenser. The unitary C/G structure employs single electric motor to run the compressor, to generate electric power and to operate the airflow fan. The developed compressor/generator structure eliminates plurality of electric motors, related wiring, and control elements, reduce weight and cost due to exclusion of secondary stators, rotors, shafts and bearings, mounting and fence arrangements. The structure also minimizes the installation space. Â *) Patent pending...|$|E
40|$|PaperPg. 19 - 27. This paper {{presents}} {{the highlights of}} a complete rotor dynamics analysis and bearing optimization study that was performed on a 3800 HP multistage steam turbine. This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common bull gear. The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage <b>impeller</b> <b>wheel.</b> The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the bull gear is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with journal diameters of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the turbine driver rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the bull gear, which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of misalignment, if the coupling is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the exhaust end bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the inlet end bearing). As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The inlet end bearing has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The exhaust end bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|E

40|$|A {{strongly}} focused {{laser beam}} {{can be used to}} trap, manipulate and exert torque on a microparticle. The torque is the result of transfer of angular momentum by scattering of the laser beam. The laser could be used to drive a rotor, <b>impeller,</b> cog <b>wheel</b> or some other microdevice of a few microns in size, perhaps fabricated from a birefringent material. We review our methods of computationally simulating the torque and force imparted by a laser beam. We introduce a method of hybridizing the T-matrix with the Finite Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD) method to allow the modelling of materials that are anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and structures that have complex shapes. The high degree of symmetry of a microrotor, such as discrete or continuous rotational symmetry, can be exploited to reduce computational time and memory requirements by orders of magnitude. This is achieved by performing calculations for only a given segment or plane that is repeated across the whole structure. This can be demonstrated by modelling the optical trapping and rotation of a cube. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{model for}} a radial inflow turbine has been developed for super-critical carbon dioxide (S-CO{sub 2 }) Brayton cycle applications. The model accounts for the main phenomena present in the volute, nozzle, and impeller of a single-stage turbine. These phenomena include internal losses due to friction, blade loading, and angle of incidence and parasitic losses due to windage and blade-housing leakage. The model has been added as a component to the G-PASS plant systems code. The model was developed to support the analysis of S-CO{sub 2 } cycles in conjunction with small-scale loop experiments. Such loops operate at less than a MWt thermal input. Their size permits components to be reconfigured in new arrangements relatively easily and economically. However, the small thermal input combined with the properties of carbon dioxide lead to turbomachines with impeller diameters of only one to two inches. At these sizes the dominant phenomena differ from those in larger more typical machines. There is almost no treatment {{in the literature of}} turbomachines at these sizes. The present work therefore is aimed at developing turbomachine models that support the task of S-CO{sub 2 } cycle analysis using small-scale tests. Model predictions were compared against data from an experiment performed for Sandia National Laboratories in the split-flow Brayton cycle loop currently located at Barber-Nichols Inc. The split-flow loop incorporates two turbo-alternator-compressor (TAC) units each incorporating a radial inflow turbine and a radial flow compressor on a common shaft. The predicted thermodynamic conditions at the outlet of the turbine on the main compressor shaft were compared with measured values at different shaft speeds. Two modifications to the original model were needed to better match the experiment data. First, a representation of the heat loss from the volute downstream of the sensed inlet temperature was added. Second, an empirical multiplicative factor was applied to the Euler head and another to the head loss to bring the predicted outlet pressure into better agreement with the experiment. These changes also brought the overall efficiency of the turbine into agreement with values cited by Barber Nichols for small turbines. More generally, the quality of measurement set data can in the future be improved by additional steps taken in the design and operation of the experimental apparatus. First, a thermocouple mounted at the nozzle inlet would provide a better indication of temperature at this key point. Second, heat losses from the turbine should be measured directly. Allowing the <b>impeller</b> to free <b>wheel</b> at inlet conditions and measuring the temperature drop between inlet and outlet would provide a more accurate measure of heat loss. Finally, the enthalpy change during operation is more accurately obtained by measuring the torque on the stator using strain gauges rather than by measuring pressure and temperature at inlet and outlet to infer thermodynamic states...|$|R
