2500|$|In {{his works}} on the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{addressed}} {{the relationship between the}} presence of specific watermarked paper and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> and developed the principle of [...] "runs and remnants". Many bibliographers had argued that the fact that a watermark in a book whose date is in question also appears in a book with a specific date gives no indication (other than a terminal date) for the printing of the undated book because the printer of the dated book could have used old paper which he or someone else had held for many years. Stevenson observed that, while an individual might hold on to a supply of writing paper for a number of years, a printer, for whom the cost of paper for books was his largest capital investment, would ordinarily use paper soon after it was purchased. In fact, [...] "As a rule a particular lot of paper seems to have been obtained and set out for a particular job." [...] Where there is a run of paper with a specific watermark, as opposed to an isolated sheet or two, that should indicate that the book was printed shortly after the paper was manufactured and purchased. In contrast, the presence of a single or few sheets with a particular watermark (a [...] "remnant") might reflect an older paper used, and not be indicative of the actual printing date of a book. Stevenson confirmed this principle by identifying numerous examples of the same watermarks in the Missale Speciale in other dated or datable incunables, the deteriorating states of which fit the chronology of the known dates of the books.|$|E

It has been printed all over the country, and if report is to be believed, in foreign countries as well.

This edition was the first book printed in Italy to have a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> as well as the first use of a Greek alphabet font anywhere, which was apparently produced in the course of printing, as the early pages leave Greek text blank.

The characters were not created by the Empress herself, but were suggested by an official named Zong Qinke, the son of one of her cousins, in December 689 AD. The number of characters varies between 12, 17, 19, or 30 characters. They were forcibly used by people during her reign but fell into disuse immediately after her death, so they help to determine <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> materials.|$|R
5000|$|Block-books, {{where both}} text and images are cut {{on a single}} block for a whole page, {{appeared}} in Europe in the mid-15th century.

2500|$|In his Problem of the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{analyzed}} the four then known {{copies of the}} missal, along with a fifth shorter version. He reported that surviving copies of the book contained several [...] "runs", i.e., a number of consecutive gatherings of paper, with the same three watermarks (including their twins), a cross on mounts and two different bull's heads under a Tau cross. Stevenson identified several states of these watermarks in the book, reflecting {{the aging of the}} watermark as stress was repeatedly applied to the screen in making the paper. He identified the same watermarks in other books which included their <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> or were otherwise firmly datable. In fact, some of those books contained both the identical cross on mounts and identical bull's head watermarks. Moreover, he traced the deteriorating states of the bull's head watermarks through a number <b>of</b> <b>dated</b> or datable books, thereby determining the relationship between a particular state of the watermark with the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the book, and through that analysis, to identify the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the watermark {{on the basis of its}} condition.
