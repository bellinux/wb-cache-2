40|$|The flux {{distribution}} in an overlapped linear joint {{constructed in the}} central region of an <b>Epstein</b> <b>Square</b> was studied experimentally and results compared with those obtained using a computational magnetic field solver. High permeability grain-oriented (GO) and low permeability non-oriented (NO) electrical steels were compared at a nominal core flux density of 1. 60 T at 50 Hz. It {{was found that the}} experimental results only agreed well at flux densities at which the reluctance of different paths of the flux are similar. Also it was revealed that the flux becomes more uniform when the working point of the electrical steel is close to the knee point of the B-H curve of the steel...|$|E

In {{order to}} acquire the {{magnetic}} properties parameter of transformer core under DC bias conditions, also to reveal the accurate analysis and judgment on the operating characteristics of transformer under the DC bias, this thesis utilized two <b>Epstein</b> <b>Square</b> devices to proceed the experiment and measurement on magnetization curve of some certain transformer which used the 30 ZH 120 electrical steel sheet under four different lap ways. This paper provided the measure method of bias magnetic density under laboratory conditions, meanwhile it offered the bias magnetization curve and the loss curve. The measure consequence comparison between the electrical sheet steel and the transformer model showed that direct oblique way lap can be more realistically reflected the magnetization characteristic of transformer which worked in the DC bias conditions. For Large Transformer which was difficult to measure the magnetic properties provided a convenient measurement methods, and offered the experiment facts to the theory study of the DC bias transformers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} section, the {{magnetisation}} {{characteristics of the}} switched-reluctance motor are examined. Measurements {{have been carried out}} using both static and dynamic test methods. The test data has been compared with simulation results from analytical design programs and finite element models. The effects of mutual coupling on the magnetisation characteristics are investigated through measurement and simulation. Results show that the degree of mutual coupling is strongly dependent on the winding arrangement of the machine. In the next section, the difficulties in measuring the properties of permanent-magnet machines are discussed in detail, and solutions to common problems proposed. The measurement and analysis methods used for the switched-reluctance motor are further developed for analysis of permanent magnet machines. Techniques for determining the variation in synchronous reactances and permanent magnet flux are presented. Finite element simulations are used to show the variation of magnet flux under loading, a condition ignored in classical analysis methods. The final section discusses the analysis of magnetisation characteristics of electrical sheet steels. Comparison is made between measurements carried out on single sheet tester and <b>Epstein</b> <b>square</b> test rigs. The iron losses of a typical non-grain-orientated steel are measured under both sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal flux density conditions. The iron losses are shown to increase significantly when higher harmonic components are introduced to the flux density waveform. The difficulties in modelling the nonlinear iron loss characteristics of electrical steels are considered. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
