He also contributed saxophone for a Cypress Hill song. In 2007, he appeared in the film Crazy, which was inspired by the life of Hank Garland.|$|E
25|$|The case {{reached the}} U.S. Supreme Court in 1948; their verdict {{went against the}} movie studios, forcing {{all of them to}} divest {{themselves}} of their movie theater chains. This, coupled with the advent of television and the attendant drop in movie ticket sales, brought about a severe slump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> a slump that would not be reversed until 1972, with the release of The Godfather, the first modern blockbuster.|$|E
500|$|However, the Coens disavow a {{significant}} connection between Faulkner and Mayhew, calling the similarities [...] "superficial". [...] "As {{far as the}} details of the character are concerned," [...] Ethan said in 1991, [...] "Mayhew is very different from Faulkner, whose experiences in Hollywood were not the same at all." [...] Unlike Mayhew's inability to write due to drink and personal problems, Faulkner continued to pen novels after working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> winning several awards for fiction completed during and after his time in Hollywood.|$|E

500|$|Kapadia {{was cast}} in Zoya Akhtar's first directorial venture, Luck By Chance (2009), a satirical take on the Hindi film industry. She played the part of Neena Walia, an {{erstwhile}} superstar—referred to in the film as [...] "a crocodile in a chiffon saree"—who struggles to launch her young daughter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Luck By Chance opened to a warm critical response, though its financial income was modest. Critics were appreciative of Kapadia's performance, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Deepa Karmalkar from Screen characterised her as [...] "gloriously bitchy", while Sukanya Verma from Rediff hailed her as [...] "stunning, striking, storming".|$|E
500|$|The Lithuania-born Volk brothers, Bill and Sidney, came to Minnesota in {{the early}} 1920s and got {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business</b> by purchasing neighborhood theaters during the Great Depression. In 1946, the Volks initiated what the publication Greater Amusements called a [...] "theater-building orgy" [...] when they received a permit from the Minneapolis City Council to build the first new theater in Minneapolis in twelve years {{in spite of the}} protests of other theater managers. The Riverview was designed by architectural firm Liebenberg and Kaplan and built in 1948 in the Streamline Moderne style. It opened December 30, 1948, with a showing of June Bride. The single-screen theater utilized stadium seating, {{making it one of the}} earlier movie theaters to do so.|$|E
500|$|Fields {{had come}} [...] "up from the cutting room floor" [...] {{and out of}} the customary, near-anonymity of film editors. Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E

500|$|Chancellor {{stated in}} May 2007 that the band would {{probably}} continue their tour until early 2008 and then [...] "take some time off". He {{added that the}} band had already written some new material and would surely release another album at some point. He speculated {{about the possibility of}} a [...] "band movie", something the band has considered for a long time. Ideas ranged from [...] "a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible" [...] to [...] "pockets of all of that or something that's live or the band playing". Although Carey stated that the necessary know-how was at hand due to the band's connections to artists working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> Jones dismissed the idea, saying [...] "It's just talk right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: [...] "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture.... That {{was part of what}} got us going on the whole Barton Fink thing." [...] Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh (1932), which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.|$|E
500|$|Looking to {{forestall}} the impending legal imbroglio in early 1954, Hughes {{offered to buy}} out all of RKO's other stockholders. Convinced that the studio was sinking, Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own distribution firm, Buena Vista Pictures. Virtual, but not quite actual. Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from acquiring the 95% ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the company's losses against his earnings elsewhere. Hughes had reneged on his promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he divested it and was now paying the price. With negotiations between the two at a stalemate, in July 1955, Hughes turned around and sold RKO pictures to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million. For Hughes, this was the effective end of a quarter-century's involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Historian Betty Lasky describes Hughes's relationship with RKO as a [...] "systematic seven-year rape." ...|$|E

500|$|In September, Hughes and his {{corporate}} president, Ned E. Depinet, sold their RKO studio stock to a Chicago-based syndicate with no experience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Once Hughes learned that said company had connections to organized crime, he gained near-total {{control of the}} studio in February 1953 {{at a cost of}} $23.5 million, becoming the first virtual sole owner of a studio since Hollywood's pioneer days. The studio's net loss in 1952 was over $10 million, and shooting had taken place for just a single in-house production over the last five months of the year. During the turmoil, Samuel Goldwyn ended his 11-year-long distribution deal with RKO. Wald and Krasna escaped their contracts and the studio as well. The deal that brought the team to RKO had called for them to produce sixty features over five years; in just shy of half that time, they succeeded in making four. The RKO Encino movie ranch shut down permanently in 1954 and the property was sold off. [...] Jack Webb's NBC television series Dragnet was the last project to film on the rundown movie ranch for an episode entitled [...] "The Big Producer", where the lot played the part of a crumbling [...] "Westside Studios". In November, Hughes finally fulfilled his obligations under the 1948 consent decree, divesting RKO Theatres; Albert A. List purchased the controlling interest in the business and renamed it List Industries. Hughes soon found himself the target of no less than five separate lawsuits filed by minority shareholders in RKO, accusing him of malfeasance in his dealings with the Chicago group and a wide array of acts of mismanagement. [...] "RKO's contract list is down to three actors and 127 lawyers", quipped Dick Powell of Four Star.|$|E
2500|$|Following the band's dissolution, {{frontman}} Danny Elfman turned full-time {{to writing}} film scores, having composed several scores through the 1980s and early 1990s while {{the band was}} active. [...] He has been nominated for four Academy Awards. [...] His first major motion picture score was Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985, and he continues to be much sought-after <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> particularly in collaboration with director Tim Burton. Elfman almost exclusively employs Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek as orchestrator. His film scores have included Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Good Will Hunting, Men in Black, Spider-Man, Big Fish, The Nightmare Before Christmas and dozens more. Elfman also wrote the themes {{for more than a}} dozen TV series, including The Simpsons, , Tales from the Crypt and Desperate Housewives.|$|E
2500|$|After a month <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business,</b> Mankiewicz {{signed a}} year's {{contract}} at $400 a week plus bonuses. By {{the end of}} 1927, he was head of Paramount's scenario department, and film critic Pauline Kael, who wrote about him {{and the creation of}} Citizen Kane in [...] "Raising Kane", her famous 1971 New Yorker article, wrote that [...] "in January, 1928, there was a newspaper item reporting that he was in New York 'lining up a new set of newspaper feature writers and playwrights to bring to Hollywood,' and that 'most of the newer writers on Paramount's staff who contributed the most successful stories of the past year' were selected by 'Mank.'" [...] Film historian Scott Eyman notes that Mankiewicz was put in charge of writer recruitment by Paramount. However, as [...] "a hard-drinking gambler, he hired men in his own image: Ben Hecht, Bartlett Cormack, Edwin Justus Mayer, writers comfortable with the iconoclasm of big-city newsrooms who would introduce their sardonic worldliness to movie audiences.|$|E

She even {{went as far as}} spending two years as a pre-med student at the University of Southern California. During World War I, she left school to work overseas in the ambulance corps. By the time the war ended, she decided against returning to her medical studies and, after a visit to a movie studio, decided to pursue a career as a film director.

2500|$|Working {{with visual}} effects {{supervisor}} Dan Glass, Trumbull {{used a variety}} of materials for the creation of the universe sequence. [...] "We worked with chemicals, paint, fluorescent dyes, smoke, liquids, CO2, flares, spin dishes, fluid dynamics, lighting and high speed photography to see how effective they might be," [...] said Trumbull. [...] "It was a free-wheeling opportunity to explore, something that I have found extraordinarily hard to get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> <b>business.</b> Terry didn't have any preconceived ideas of what something should look like. We did things like pour milk through a funnel into a narrow trough and shoot it with a high-speed camera and folded lens, lighting it carefully and using a frame rate that would give the right kind of flow characteristics to look cosmic, galactic, huge and epic." [...] The team also included Double Negative in London. Fluid-based effects were developed by Peter and Chris Parks, who had previously worked on similar effects for The Fountain.|$|E
