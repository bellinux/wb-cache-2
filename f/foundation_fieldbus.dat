50|$|<b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the 4-20 mA standard, and today it coexists alongside other technologies such as Modbus, Profibus, and Industrial Ethernet. <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> today enjoys a growing installed base in many heavy process applications such as refining, petrochemicals, power generation, and even food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear applications. <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> was developed over a period of many years by the International Society of Automation, or ISA, as SP50. In 1996 the first H1 (31.25 kbit/s) specifications were released. In 1999 the first HSE (High Speed Ethernet) specifications http://www.fieldbus.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=144&Itemid=319 were released. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard on field bus, including <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus,</b> is IEC 61158. Type 1 is <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> H1, while Type 5 is <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> HSE.|$|E
50|$|An {{explanation}} of how <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> works {{and how it is}} used in continuous process control is in the <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> Primer which may be found at the Fieldbus Inc. website.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>Foundation</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> and Profibus {{technologies}} are now commonly implemented within the process control field, both for new developments and major refits. In 2006, China saw the largest FF (<b>Foundation</b> <b>Fieldbus)</b> systems installations at NanHai and SECCO, each with around 15000 fieldbus devices connected.|$|E

50|$|In {{process control}} systems, {{the market is}} {{dominated}} by <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>fieldbus</b> and PROFIBUS PA. Both technologies use the same physical layer (2-wire manchester-encoded current modulation at 31.25 kHz) but are not interchangeable. As a general guide, applications which are controlled and monitored by PLCs (programmable logic controllers) tend towards PROFIBUS, and applications which are controlled and monitored by a DCS (digital/distributed control system) tend towards <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus.</b> PROFIBUS technology is made available through Profibus International with headquarters in Karlsruhe, Germany. <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> technology is owned and distributed by the Fieldbus Foundation of Austin, Texas.|$|E

50|$|The big {{advantage}} of <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> {{is that it}} allows power to be transferred over the communication bus to the controlled devices, this requires a <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> power supply. Power supplies are normally redundant type with rating of 32 V DC with 500 mA current, and are mostly installed in the Marshalling Cabinet or System Cabinet in the Control Room.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> {{achieved}} {{many important}} milestones {{along the way}} to the maturity and success of FOUNDATION technology. These included: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> was an {{organization}} dedicated to a single international, interoperable fieldbus standard. It was established in September 1994 by a merger of WorldFIP North America and the Interoperable Systems Project (ISP). <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> was a not-for-profit trade consortium that consisted of more than 350 of the world's suppliers and end users of process control and manufacturing automation products. Working together those companies made contributions to the IEC/ISA/FDI and other fieldbus standards development.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to exploit some aspects of the {{functional}} and hardware redundancy in fault detection and isolation tasks using back-propagation neural networks as functional approximation devices to be used as residuals generators which will evaluated by means of rule based strategies.

50|$|From a {{business}} standpoint, <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> technology delivers savings in total installation costs. H1 Fieldbus reduces instrument wiring, which means less termination and fewer screwdriver turns. The technology reduces hardware requirements and lowers Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> primarily reduces Operating Expenses (OPEX) through improved plant efficiencies, better asset management, and reduced maintenance requirements.Specific benefits of FOUNDATION technology include: reduced wiring, multi-variables {{from a single}} multi-channel field instrument, simpler integration and easier maintenance. Using Half Duplex RS485 hardware connection a two wire communication is possible. The <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> H1 has support for Intrinsically Safe Wiring. Unlike other protocols, FOUNDATION H1 provides explicit synchronization of control and communication for precisely periodic (isochronous) communication and execution of control functions with minimized dead time and jitter. It synchronizes clocks in fieldbus devices for support of Function Block scheduling and alarm time-stamping {{at the point of}} detection.|$|E
50|$|Two related {{implementations}} of <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> {{have been}} introduced to meet different needs within the process automation environment. These two implementations use different physical media and communication speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{harmonization}} and {{enhancement of}} the EDDL is being {{undertaken in the}} EDDL Cooperation Team (ECT). The ECT consists of {{the leadership of the}} <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation,</b> Profibus Nutzerorganisation (PNO), Hart Communication Foundation, OPC Foundation and the FDT Group.|$|R
50|$|From its {{inception}} <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> {{had taken a}} leadership {{role in the development of}} fieldbus digital communications and integrated system architecture based on regional and international standards. The foundation's history was one of growth and achievement, as fieldbus-based control solutions gained widespread acceptance in the global automation marketplace.|$|R
5000|$|Based on the {{requirements}} study other manufacturers created similar protocol definitions - starting in 1990 {{a number of}} partners from Japan and America merged with FIP to the WorldFIP standardization group (that later merged into the <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> group). Along with the competing German Profibus the field buses were submitted for European standardization by CENELEC in 1996. Along with other field bus standards these CENELEC standards were included to the international IEC 61158 and IEC 61784 standards by 1999 where FIP is listed as the Communication Profile Family 5. Eventually FIP has lost ground to Profibus which came to prevail the market in Europe in the following decade - the WorldFIP homepage has seen no press release since 2002 (with the US based <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> to haven {{taken the lead in}} ongoing development which however promotes H1 fieldbus for process automation).|$|R
50|$|<b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> H1 {{is one of}} the <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>fieldbus</b> {{protocol}} versions. FOUNDATION H1 (31.25 kbit/s) is a bi-directional {{communications protocol}} used for communications among field devices and to the control system. It utilizes either twisted pair, or fiber media to communicate between multiple nodes (devices) and the controller. The controller requires only one communication point to communicate with up to 32 nodes, this is a significant improvement over the standard 4-20 mA communication method which requires a separate connection point for each communication device on the controller system.|$|E
50|$|<b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> is an all-digital, serial, two-way {{communications}} system {{that serves as}} the base-level network in a plant or factory automation environment. It is an open architecture, developed and administered by FieldComm Group.|$|E
50|$|Although 4-20 mA {{has been}} the main field {{signalling}} standard, modern DCS systems can also support fieldbus digital protocols, such as <b>Foundation</b> <b>Fieldbus,</b> profibus, HART, Modbus, PC Link etc., and other digital communication protocols such as modbus.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{disturbance}} compensation by means of a novel feedforward control procedure. It consists in the additive association of a conventional feedback control action with the prediction of the steady state control effort necessary to keep the controlled plant under setpoint requirements. Such steady state control effort is achieved by means of inverse neural network based modelling prediction. Predictors are based in an inverse neural network steady state plant model.

40|$|Abstract: <b>FOUNDATION</b> ™ <b>Fieldbus</b> {{technology}} has now grown {{well beyond the}} initial development and commercialisation phase and is fast becoming an accepted element of process control projects. Fieldbus offers many benefits and advantages to the user. However, it requires not only {{an understanding of the}} technology but some differences in thinking about how to implement projects. Issues range from wiring practices, control in field devices and power distribution to project scheduling and plant personnel capabilities. This paper deals with the changes to process planning, documentation, and installation, and with the tools that can simplify and hide the complexities of networking devices in highly distributed control and monitoring environments to deliver real benefits to users...|$|R
50|$|In January 2006, the <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> {{announced}} that TÜV Rheinland Industrie Service GmbH, Automation, Software and Information Technology, a global, independent and accredited testing agency, had granted Protocol Type Approval for its Safety Specifications. The Foundation Technical Specifications - Safety Instrumented Functions are {{in compliance with}} International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61508 standard (functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems) requirements up to, and including, Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3).|$|R
50|$|PLC (Programmable logic controller) {{communicate}} {{using one}} of several possible open or proprietary protocols, such as EtherNet/IP, Modbus, Sinec H1, Profibus, CANopen, DeviceNet or <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus.</b> The idea to use standard Ethernet makes these systems more inter-operable.|$|E
50|$|It is {{targeted}} for applications using basic and advanced regulatory control, and {{for much of}} the discrete control associated with those functions. <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> technology is mostly used in process industries, but has recently been implemented in powerplants.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the fastest}} growing {{segments}} in the world of process automation is remote operations management. As the name implies, remote operations refers to the management of automation assets that are located in or are dispersed throughout remote geographic locations where it is difficult or impossible to send personnel. This is not limited to remote offshore oil platforms and oil and gas pipelines. It can also include tank farms and terminals, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and any industry or application that requires remote access to automation assets FOUNDATION for Remote Operations Management (ROM) is a suite of technologies and additions to the <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>fieldbus</b> specification that provide for both a wireless and wired infrastructure for remote assets and applications. FOUNDATION for ROM provides for direct access to information and diagnostics in wireless and remote I/O devices. Conversely, FOUNDATION for ROM can take the data from those devices and place into the <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>fieldbus</b> environment for data management and quality. <b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>fieldbus</b> is much more than just a communications protocol. The user layer allows for all kinds of flexibility and standardization of data management, and it is all built around the requirements of process automation. FOUNDATION for Remote Operations Management provides an open path for integration of multiple wireless and wired networks, from conventional remote I/O to ISA 100.11a and WirelessHART™, and enables direct access to device information and diagnostics. It extends the range and capabilities of <b>Foundation</b> <b>fieldbus</b> to encompass many more devices throughout the plant — regardless of their communications technology.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2008, <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> and ISA {{entered into}} a {{cross-licensing}} agreement allowing the two organizations to collaborate on wireless networks. This agreement will assist the ISA100.15 working group in developing a wireless backhaul standard. Backhaul networks integrated remote locations and applications with central control facilities. The FOUNDATION for ROM specification provides for HSE as the backhaul network for remote applications, available in both wired and wireless configurations. Future Integration of ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pneumatic}} control signals are traditionally {{based on a}} pressure range of 3-15psi (0.2-1.0 bar), or more commonly now, an electrical signal of 4-20mA for industry, or 0-10V for HVAC systems. Electrical control now often includes a [...] "Smart" [...] communication signal superimposed on the 4-20mA control current, such that the health and verification of the valve position can be signalled back to the controller. The HART, <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation,</b> and Profibus {{are the most common}} protocols.|$|R
50|$|The {{interface}} {{for conventional}} wired remote I/O and wired HART, dubbed RIO, was launched back in 2007. The HSE remote I/O (HSE RIO) specification allows end users to access high data requirement devices {{directly in the}} fieldbus host system via HSE high-speed fieldbus. The remote I/O specification allows all forms of conventional I/O to {{be brought into the}} native fieldbus environment easily. This solution makes discrete-in, discrete-out, analog-in, analog-out and FOUNDATION H1 available over a common Ethernet network. <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> released the Remote I/O portion of the specification in April 2011.|$|R
50|$|DCS {{systems can}} {{normally}} also support such as <b>Foundation</b> <b>Fieldbus,</b> profibus, HART, Modbus, PC Link and other digital communication bus that carries not only {{input and output}} signals but also advanced messages such as error diagnostics and status signals.|$|E
50|$|<b>FOUNDATION</b> <b>Fieldbus</b> H1 - Operates at 31.25 kbit/s and is {{generally}} used {{to connect to}} field devices and host systems. It provides communication and power over standard stranded twisted-pair wiring in both conventional and intrinsic safety applications. H1 is currently the most common implementation.|$|E
50|$|Mimic Simulation Software is a {{simulation}} software developed by MYNAH Technologies that allows modeling of process plant unit operations. Mimic supports simulation of <b>Foundation</b> <b>Fieldbus,</b> ProfibusDP, DeviceNet, As-I Bus and HART smart field devices. Process industries using Mimic include hydrocarbon production, refining, petrochemical, specialty chemical, life sciences, food and beverage, pulp and paper, mineral production, and industrial energy.|$|E
50|$|WirelessHART was {{approved}} {{by a vote of}} the 210 member general HCF membership, ratified by the HCF Board of Directors, and introduced to the market in September 2007. On September 27, 2007, the <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation,</b> Profibus Nutzerorganisation, and HCF announced a wireless cooperation team to develop a specification for a common interface to a wireless gateway, further protecting users' investments in technology and work practices for leveraging these industry-pervasive networks. Following its completed work on the WirelessHART standard in September 2007, the HCF offered ISA an unrestricted, royalty-free copyright license, allowing the ISA100 committee access to the WirelessHART standard.|$|R
50|$|Current {{field devices}} for process and factory {{automation}} {{have a number}} of configuration options, to customize them to their individual use case. For these means they are equipped with a digital communication interface (HART, PROFIBUS, <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation).</b> Different software tools provide the means to control and configure the devices. In the 1990s, the DDL was developed to remove the requirement to write a new software tool for each new device type. Software can, through the interpretation of a device description (DD), configure and control many different devices. The creation of a description with the DDL is less effort than writing an entire software tool.|$|R
50|$|In September 2011, <b>Fieldbus</b> <b>Foundation</b> {{announced}} the preliminary specification addressing fieldbus transducer blocks for wired HART and WirelessHART devices, together with updates to the WIO System Architecture and WIO Data Structures {{related to the}} transducer block specification. The wired and WirelessHART technical specification defines a fieldbus transducer block used to represent HART devices within Foundation for ROM devices. Both wired HART and WirelessHART devices may be represented in this block. In addition, the specification describes the expected method for HART configuration tools and asset-managing hosts to access HART devices using the native HART command protocol transported through the Foundation High Speed Ethernet (HSE) network. The specification also defines structures to identify and maintain HART device status in wired multi-drop networks {{as well as in}} WirelessHART mesh networks connected to Foundation for Remote Operations Management devices.|$|R
