5000|$|In GPC, the {{concentration}} by weight of polymer in the <b>eluting</b> <b>solvent</b> may be monitored continuously with a detector. There are many detector types available {{and they can}} be divided into two main categories. The first is concentration sensitive detectors which includes UV absorption, differential refractometer (DRI) or refractive index (RI) detectors, infrared (IR) absorption and density detectors. The second category is molecular weight sensitive detectors, which include low angle light scattering detectors (LALLS) and multi angle light scattering (MALLS). [...] The resulting chromatogram is therefore a weight distribution of the polymer as a function of retention volume. The most sensitive detector is the differential UV photometer and the most common detector is the differential refractometer (DRI). When characterizing copolymer, it is necessary to have two detectors in series. [...] For accurate determinations of copolymer composition at least two of those detectors should be concentration detectors. [...] The determination of most copolymer compositions is done using UV and RI detectors, although other combinations can be used.|$|E
50|$|Affinity {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of separating biochemical mixtures based on a highly specific interaction between antigen and antibody, enzyme and substrate, or receptor and ligand. It {{is a type of}} chromatographic laboratory technique used for purifying biological molecules within a mixture by exploiting molecular properties. Biological macromolecules such as enzymes and other proteins, interact with other molecules with high specificity through several different types of bonds and interaction. Such interactions including hydrogen bonding, ionic interaction, disulfide bridges, hydrophobic interaction, and more. The high selectivity of affinity chromatography is caused by allowing the desired molecule to interact with the stationary phase and be bound within the column in order to be separated from the undesired material which will not interact and elute first. The molecules no longer needed are first washed away with a buffer while the desired proteins are let go {{in the presence of the}} <b>eluting</b> <b>solvent</b> (of higher salt concentration). This process creates a competitive interaction between the desired protein and the immobilized stationary molecules, which eventually lets the now highly purified proteins be released.|$|E

Due to their stability, mobility and long-term effects on living organisms, pesticides {{are among the most}} dangerous pollutants that can be monitored in the environment, and the determination of accurate contamination levels also constitutes a crucial step in environmental research. However, in the case of quantitative analyses, extraction of targeted analytes can turn out to be difficult since these compounds are often present below the detection limits. Consequently, the accuracy of environmental analyses mainly depends on the efficiency and the robustness of the extraction–preconcentration step.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aqueous, ethanolic and {{methanolic}} extracts {{of garlic}} at different concentration were tested against two new strains of Bacillus species isolated from poultry farm. Among all the extracts of garlic tested, the ethanolic extracts showed increased inhibitory effect with maximum zone of inhibition of 21 mm against Bacillus licheniformis strain BIHPUR 0104. The aqueous extracts were more effective compared to methanolic extracts against Bacillus subtilis strain AK but methanolic extracts were showing more inhibitory effect than aqueous extracts against Bacillus licheniformis strain BIHPUR 0104. The ethanolic and methanolic extracts of garlic were active even {{at low concentration}} (5 %) against Bacillus licheniformis strain BIHPUR 0104. Active compounds of garlic ethanol extracts were separated by Thin layer chromatography using Butanol:Ethanol (9 : 1 and 1 : 1) as <b>eluting</b> <b>solvent</b> and Rf values were calculated of the spots obtained. These results suggest that garlic is a potential spice to control pathogenic bacterial strain. Key words- Disc diffusion method, Garlic, Poultry farm bacteria, thin layer chromatography...|$|E

30|$|A {{modification}} of the column-switching HPLC procedure was used (Kenk et al. 2008) to analyse the radioactive metabolites from plasma and pancreas samples. <b>Eluted</b> <b>solvents</b> were analyzed via two detectors in series: a UV absorbance detector (Waters 2489) and a radiation detector (Raytest Gabi Star), which were connected to a chromatography data integration system (PeakSimple, using PeakSimple data analysis software, version 4.44). Using mobile solvent A (1 % CH 3 CN/H 2 O[*]+[*] 0.1 % TFA, 1 or 2 [*]mL/minute), samples were loaded onto an in-line refillable capture column (hand-packed with 20 [*]mg of Oasis HLB polymeric reverse phase sorbent) fitted with 2.5 [*]μm frits. The elution of biological macromolecules was monitored by UV absorbance (254 [*]nm) and radioactivity. When the UV signal returned to baseline, the solvent flow was switched to elute the capture column loaded sample onto the analytical column (Phenomenex Luna C 18, 250 [*]×[*] 4.6 [*]mm, 10 [*]μm) using mobile Solvent B (65 % CH 3 CN/H 2 O[*]+[*] 0.1 % TFA, 2 [*]mL/minute flow rate). Retention times were calculated {{from the time of}} switch. Radioactivity data are expressed as the percentage of the total radioactivity signal. For standards, samples of blood and pancreas from control rats were spiked with [18 F] 7 and processed as described above for each formulation tested. Use of such controls allowed for measurement of the proportion of radiotracer retained and not-retained by the capture column during loading. If radioactivity was eluted during loading of the capture column, this activity will be identified as authentic [18 F] 7 and not as a hydrophilic labeled metabolite.|$|R

The extract was centrifuged at 7, 197  g (Eppendorf 5430 R; 7, 830  rpm) for 15  min, and the supernatants {{were subjected to}} HPLC on a C 18 column (Eclipse XDB-C 18, 4.6  mm i.d. × 150  mm long, 5  μm; Agilent) and <b>eluted</b> with <b>solvent</b> (methanol: acetonitrile: acetone[*]=[*] 1 : 3 : 1) at a flow-rate of 1.0  mL min− 1 at 40 °C, as previously described (Zapata et al. 2000;Nakanishi et al. 2005;Tanaka et al. 19992010;Zhou et al. 2013). Elution profiles were monitored by measuring A 660, and Chl a and b standards (Sigma) were used as control.|$|R

This tetrol is excreted as a metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in a process catalyzed by cytochrome P 450 enzymes and epoxide hydrolases. Urine was hydrolysed to release activated benzo[a]-pyrene-diol-epoxides covalently bound to macromolecular species or conjugated tetrols. The relatively non-polar organic molecules from urine hydrolysates were collected on octadecasilane chromatography columns (Sep-Paks). Materials <b>eluted</b> in <b>solvent</b> (80 % CH 3 OH), were further purified on immunoaffinity columns with antibodies raised against anti-N 2 -[10 (7, 8, 9 -trihydroxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetra-hydrobenzo[a]pyrenyl) ]-guanosme.
