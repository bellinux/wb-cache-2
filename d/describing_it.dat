5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> {{as the new}} benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E

5|$|Super Smash Bros. has {{received}} praise for its multiplayer mode. Nintendo Power listed the series as {{being one of}} the greatest multiplayer experiences in Nintendo history, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as infinitely replayable due to its special moves and close-quarters combat. There were criticisms, however, such as the game's scoring being difficult to follow. In addition, the single-player mode was criticized for its perceived difficulty and lack of features.|$|E
5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore {{the brunt of}} the game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as lackluster and stating that the difference between the developer's vision for the game mode and the finished product made it difficult to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Zelda II {{was rated}} the 110th best game {{made on a}} Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list.

5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism were largely a {{response}} to Anabaptism, a movement which attacked the practice of infant baptism. He defended the baptism of children by <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> {{as a sign of}} a Christian's covenant with disciples and God just as God made a covenant with Abraham.|$|E
5|$|A {{departure}} from the hip-hop and R sound of her previous studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the most {{detailed}} account of the division, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as threefold. Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E

5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|Foo Fighters is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on July 4, 1995, by Capitol Records through Dave Grohl's label Roswell. Grohl wrote and recorded the entire album himself – {{with the exception}} of a guest guitar spot by Greg Dulli – with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington, in 1994. Grohl claimed he recorded the album just for fun, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as a cathartic experience to recover from the death of his Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Louis Bosc did {{not mention}} the earlier works when <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as Lycoperdon heterogeneum, {{although}} he also suggested it should be placed in its own genus. Jean Poiret transferred Persoon's S.callostoma to Lycoperdon in 1817, while including Bosc's L.heterogeneum separately. In the same year, Nees von Esenbeck noted Bosc's belief that the species deserved its own genus and created Mitremyces, without referencing Desvaux's prior assignment to Calostoma. An 1825 paper by Edward Hitchcock referred to the species with the entirely novel binomial name Gyropodium coccineum; although Hitchcock claimed this name was established by Lewis Schweinitz, he admitted that no such description had been previously published, and the name and its claimed origin are considered doubtful.|$|E

In 1982, Böhme <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Chamaeleo laterispinis brookesiaeformis, and in 1999, Necas <b>described</b> <b>it</b> as the Chamaeleo laterispinis.

5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E

5|$|The Seven Crystal Balls was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé concluded the arc begun in this story with Prisoners of the Sun, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have ranked The Seven Crystal Balls {{as one of the}} best Adventures of Tintin, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as the most frightening instalment in the series. The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
5|$|The {{design has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Architectural historian David Watkin described {{the house as}} 'large, irregular and rather featureless' and of a 'dull design'. On the other hand, historian, archivist and Maltravers Herald Extraordinary John Martin Robinson, in The architecture of Northern England, noted the 'complex building history' of the hall, <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> as a 'substantial and elegant Georgian house'. In his early 19th century work 'Views of the Seats, Mansions, Castles, Etc. of Noblemen and Gentlemen of England, Scotland and Ireland', John Preston Neale noted that the house is 'large and handsome'.|$|E
5|$|The fungus, first {{documented}} by naturalist John Burton Cleland {{in the early}} 20th century, was initially assumed to be the close relative Macrolepiota procera, a European species now known to be absent from Australia. Australian mycologist Cheryl Grgurinovic recognized Cleland's collections as a distinct species, officially <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> in 1997. The fungus {{has been referred to}} by several names: M.konradii, M.gracilenta, and M.mastoidea. Else Vellinga showed using molecular phylogenetic analysis that these names refer to European species and were misapplied by Australian authors.|$|E
