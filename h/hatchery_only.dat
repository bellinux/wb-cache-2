40|$|Study {{was carried}} out on the {{temperature}} regime {{on the surface of}} naturally hatched Muscovy duck eggs with the aim of its specifying during artificial incubation. Egg fertility and hatchability during the whole period of study were reported in the experimental hatches. Depending on the period of the embryo development, on the ambient temperature and the egg position in the nest, the surface temperature of the naturally hatched Muscovy duck eggs varied between 35. 78 and 38. 87 о С. The temperature increase of the upper egg surface after the 20 th – 23 st day of the embryonic development to 37. 92 - 38. 87 о С was due to the use of yolk fats by the embryos leading to the release of more heat. As a result of the observations on the temperature regime of the surface of naturally hatched Muscovy duck eggs, we recommend that during artificial hatching of eggs from the same waterfowl species the following temperature should be maintained: – until closing of the allantois - 37. 6 – 37. 8 о С. – from closing of the allantois until the transfer into the hatchery - 37. 2 – 37. 5 оС. – in the hatchery - 36. 7 – 37. 0 оС. – water cooling of eggs by it twofold per day sprying with distilled water at 18 – 20 °С, since 20 th, instead of 8 th or 16 th day of embryonary development, or accomplish it in <b>hatchery</b> <b>only...</b>|$|E
40|$|Multistate {{outbreaks}} of salmonellosis associated with live poultry contact have been occurring with increasing frequency. In 2013, multistate {{outbreaks of}} salmonellosis were {{traced back to}} exposure to live poultry, {{some of which were}} purchased at a national chain of farm stores (Farm store chain Y). This study was conducted at 36 stores of Farm store chain Y and was concurrent with the timing of exposure for the human outbreaks of salmonellosis in 2013. We used environmental swabs of arriving shipment boxes of hatchling poultry and shipment tracking information to examine the distribution, diversity and anti-microbial resistance of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) across farm stores and hatcheries. Isolates recovered from shipment boxes underwent serotyping, anti-microbial resistance (AMR) testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Postal service tracking codes from the shipment boxes were used to determine the hatchery of origin. The PFGE patterns were compared with the PFGE patterns of NTS causing outbreaks of salmonellosis in 2013. A total of 219 hatchling boxes from 36 stores in 13 states were swabbed between 15 March 2013 and 18 April 2013. NTS were recovered from 59 (27 %) of 219 hatchling boxes. Recovery was not significantly associated with species of hatchlings, number of birds in the shipment box, or the presence of dead, injured or sick birds. Four of the 23 PFGE patterns and 23 of 50 isolates were indistinguishable from strains causing human outbreaks in 2013. For serotypes associated with human illnesses, PFGE patterns most frequently recovered from shipment boxes were also more frequent causes of human illness. Boxes positive for the same PFGE pattern most frequently originated from the same mail-order <b>hatchery.</b> <b>Only</b> one of 59 isolates was resistant to anti-microbials used to treat Salmonella infections in people.

Body weight at 7 d of age appeared to be the best predictor of BW at slaughter age among all the quality measurements performed. Body weight at 1 d of age had the second greatest predictive value, closely followed by the ratio between BW at 1 d of age and chick length squared. Chick length and shank length both had low to no pre-dictive value whatsoever for posthatch performance.

The objectives of this survey were to document (1) the distribution of select microparasites in wild salmonids and (2) the prevalence, geographical distribution, and community composition of metazoan parasites infecting these fish. From 2011 - 2013, I surveyed 279 Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and 149 rainbow trout O. mykiss for one viral (IHNV) and four bacterial (Aeromonas salmonicida, Flavobacterium columnare, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and Renibacterium salmoninarum) microparasites known to cause mortality of fish in Willamette River <b>hatcheries.</b> The <b>only</b> microparasite detected was Renibacterium salmoninarum, causative agent of bacterial kidney disease, which was detected at all three sites. I identified 23 metazoan parasite taxa in these fish. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of metazoan parasite communities reflected a nested structure with trematode metacercariae being the basal parasite taxa at all three sites. The freshwater trematode Nanophyetus salmincola was the most common macroparasite observed at three sites. Metacercariae of N. salmincola have been shown to impair immune function and disease resistance in saltwater. To investigate if N. salmincola affects disease susceptibility in freshwater, I conducted a series of disease challenges to evaluate whether encysted N. salmincola metacercariae increase susceptibility of juvenile Chinook salmon to Flavobacterium columnare and Aeromonas salmonicida infection. These bacteria cause high mortality in juvenile hatchery salmonid populations in the Willamette River, and are a potential threat to wild juvenile salmonids. Juvenile Chinook salmon were first infected with N. salmincola through cohabitation with infected freshwater snails, Juga spp., then challenged through static immersion with either F. columnare or A. salmonicida. Cumulative percent mortality from F. columnare was higher in N. salmincola-parasitized compared to non-parasitized juvenile Chinook salmon. In contrast, cumulative percent mortality from A. salmonicida did not differ between N. salmincola-parasitized and non-parasitized juvenile Chinook salmon. No mortalities were observed in the N. salmincola-only and control groups from either challenge. These results show that a high infection intensity (> 200 metacercariae per posterior kidney) of encysted N. salmincola metacercariae does not cause mortality alone, but can increase susceptibility to certain bacterial infections in juvenile Chinook salmon...|$|R

The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife closed the surface water portion of the hatchery in March 2003 and initiated a monitoring program to evaluate the success of the closure in containing further parasite spread. From 2002 to 2005, rainbow trout sentinels were held in live cages for 2 weeks at locations upstream, downstream, and within the area of the facility and then were tested for M. cerebralis infection. Infection prevalence in groups held in the hatchery pond, the outflow, and downstream of the facility was initially high; however, by May 2004 infection was no longer detected in Clear Creek, although the parasite continued to be detected in the hatchery pond. A single rainbow trout collected approximately IS river kilometers upstream of the facility in 2002 was infected with M. cerebralis. The parasite was not detected in fish collected from other portions of the Clackamas River drainage, indicating that the introduction was limited. Tubifex tubifex, the invertebrate host for the parasite, were abundant in the <b>hatchery</b> ponds, but <b>only</b> a single specimen was identified in the main stem of Clear Creek. Actinospores of M. cerebralis were only detected in the hatchery waters. The monitoring indicated that the parasite had not become widely established in Clear Creek and that partial closure of the hatchery removed the primary source of infection for fish...|$|R

The published article can be found at: [URL] numbers of hatchery salmon spawn in wild populations each year. Hatchery fish with multiple generations of hatchery ancestry often have heritably lower reproductive success than wild fish and may reduce the fitness of an entire population. Whether this reduced fitness also occurs for hatchery fish created with local- and predominantly wild-origin parents remains controversial. Here, we review recent studies on the reproductive success of such ‘early-generation’ hatchery fish that spawn in the wild. Combining 51 estimates from six studies on four salmon species, we found that (i) early-generation <b>hatchery</b> fish averaged <b>only</b> half the reproductive success of their wild-origin counterparts when spawning in the wild, (ii) the reduction in reproductive success was more severe for males than for females, and (iii) all species showed reduced fitness due to hatchery rearing. We review commonalities among studies that point to possible mechanisms (e. g., environmental versus genetic effects). Furthermore, we illustrate that sample sizes typical of these studies result in low statistical power to detect fitness differences unless the differences are substantial. This review demonstrates that reduced fitness of early-generation hatchery fish may be a general phenomenon. Future research should focus on determining the causes of those fitness reductions and whether they lead to long-term reductions in the fitness of wild populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of fisheries stock enhancement, {{and its potential}} for generating benefits over and above those obtainable from optimal exploitation of wild stocks alone are poorly understood and highly controversial. I review pertinent knowledge of fish population biology, and extend the dynamic pool theory of fishing to stock enhancement by unpacking recruitment, incorporating regulation in the recruited stock, and accounting for biological differences between wild and hatchery fish. I then analyse the dynamics of stock enhancement and its potential role in fisheries management, using the candidate stock of North Sea sole as an example and considering economic as well as biological criteria. Enhancement through release of recruits or advanced juveniles is predicted to increase total yield and stock abundance, but reduce abundance of the naturally recruited stock component through compensatory responses or overfishing. Economic feasibility of enhancement is subject to strong constraints, including trade-offs between the costs of fishing and hatchery releases. Costs of hatchery fish strongly influence optimal policy, which may range from no enhancement at high cost {{to high levels of}} stocking and fishing effort at low cost. Release of genetically maladapted fish reduces the effectiveness of enhancement, and is most detrimental overall if fitness of <b>hatchery</b> fish is <b>only</b> moderately compromised. As a temporary measure for the rebuilding of depleted stocks, enhancement cannot substitute for effort limitation, and is advantageous as an auxiliary measure only if the population has been reduced to a very low proportion of its unexploited biomass. Quantitative analysis of {{population dynamics}} is central to the responsible use of stock enhancement in fisheries management, and the necessary tools are available...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} Columbia River flow, and survival from hatchery release to recovery of adults in catch and escapement for Columbia River chinook salmon. The <b>only</b> <b>hatchery</b> that was above the lower river dams and had a long time series of coded wire tag (CWT) release groups was the fall chinook stock at Priest Rapids hatchery. The survival as estimated by virtual population analysis (VPA) does show an increase with increasing flow. However, {{it is clear that}} major changes in survival at Priest Rapids hatchery were also seen in lower river hatcheries, and are presumably due to changes in general ocean condition. To correct for these ocean changes, we used lower river hatcheries as controls on ocean condition. The relationship between flow and survival when corrected for ocean condition shows a stronger correlation, which is highly significant. The slope indicates that an increase in flow of 100, 000 cfs at McNary dam would result in 65 % increase in survival of Priest Rapids hatchery fish. We {{explored the}} sensitivity of these results to the choice of statistical models, and the inclusion of experimental CWT groups. All sensitivity tests we conducted indicated a significant relationship between flow and survival. The study does have a number of weaknesses. including the fact that only the Priest Rapids hatchery stock was available to test the relationship between flow and survival. and this stock passed only through the four lower river dams. No Snake River or upper Columbia hatchery stocks were available for testing. Further. {{there are a number of}} weaknesses in the use of the CWT data base. which include problems in recreational catch sampling, inter-dam loss of migrating adults, and escapement sampling methods.

40|$|Rainbow trout eggs Salmo gairdneri, Richardson, were {{incubated}} under a {{range of}} different environmental conditions. Recovery of bacteria from egg surfaces revealed that increased water temperature, slow water flow rates and high egg density all significantly increased egg surface bacterial populations. Live eggs were mainly colonized by Cytophaga sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and Aeromonas hydrophila. In contrast, dead eggs supported considerable numbers of fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. Analysis of potential nutrient sources for bacteria colonizing live egg surfaces revealed that small amounts of amino acids, phosphate and potassium may be lost by incubating eggs. Subsequently these nutrients were shown {{to be capable of}} supporting limited bacterial growth and reproduction. Dead eggs `leaked' increased amounts of the above nutrients which in turn supported higher bacterial numbers. In addition, biochemical analysis of eggs revealed amino acids and fatty acids that might be utilized by bacteria colonizing dead egg surfaces. Assessment of adhesion properties of bacteria frequently recovered from egg surfaces revealed high cell surface hydrophobicity as an important factor in successful egg colonization. Analysis of egg mortalities from groups of rainbow trout and brown trout (S. trutta L.) eggs maintained under two different incubation systems revealed that potentially a close correlation existed between egg surface bacterial numbers and mortalities in the egg during incubation. Innoculation of newly-fertilized eggs with bacteria demonstrated that groups of eggs supporting high numbers of P. fluorescens suffered significantly higher mortalities during the early part of their incubation. Exposure of incubating eggs to oxolinic acid, chlortetracycline and chloramphenicol demonstrated that numbers of bacteria on egg surfaces could be significantly reduced. However, as no corresponding increase in egg hatching success was revealed, the treatment of incubating eggs with antibiotics or antimicrobial compounds can not be recommended. In commercial <b>hatcheries</b> bacteria are <b>only</b> likely to be responsible for egg deaths during incubation when environmental conditions are unfavourable. High water temperatures, slow water flow rates and high egg density all lead to increased bacterial number of egg surfaces, reduced water circulation and low levels of dissolved oxygen. Under such circumstances sufficient amounts of dissolved oxygen may not be available to support developing embryos...|$|R
40|$|The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources {{operates}} the Springville State Fish Hatchery for raising rainbow trout for stocking lakes and ponds throughout Utah. Since February 2011 the hatchery has observed excessive physical activity among the trout, including {{jumping out of}} the hatchery raceways onto the concrete walkways, which can result from free CO 2 levels above 15 ppm. Free CO 2 levels in the hatchery water have been measured as high as 40 ppm, although the temporal variation has not been well-documented. Thus far, {{the problem has been}} addressed by passing the water through aerators before it enters the hatchery and by greatly reducing the food intake of the trout, which both increase costs and reduce production. Current mitigation measures have reduced free CO 2 levels at the <b>hatchery</b> entrance by <b>only</b> 5 ppm, which is roughly equal to the increase in CO 2 due to fish respiration from the hatchery entrance to exit. The objective of this study has been to determine the source of elevated free CO 2 and provide the hatchery with recommendations for mitigation of the problem. The water source for the hatchery is a shallow pond, which is fed by 10 springs, both warm and cold. The pond was formerly used as a receptor for municipal stormwater and the bottom of the pond includes several feet of organic-rich mud, which may be a product of stormwater input. The objective was first addressed by collecting unfiltered water samples from each spring, the pond outlet, the hatchery entrance (outlet of aerator) and exit, and measuring temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved O 2, and free CO 2 on-site. The Hach DR- 2700 Spectrophotometer was used to measure Cu, Fe, Zn, ammonia, nitrite and hardness, which are the most common stressors of rainbow trout. The discharge of each spring was estimated based upon flow over sharp-crested weirs. Mixing calculations showed that the chemistry and discharge of the springs predicted the chemistry of the pond outlet within (2 - 9) % for all parameters except Cu, Fe and Zn. The free CO 2 at the pond outlet was over-predicted by 9 %, indicating that the organic mud in the pond is not a significant contributor of free CO 2. The heavy metals Fe, Cu and Zn were under-predicted by (22 - 27) %, suggesting that the organic mud is a sink for heavy metals. Mixing calculations showed further that the free CO 2 level at the hatchery entrance could be reduced as low as 12 ppm with acceptable discharge and other chemical parameters by diverting the four springs with the highest CO 2 levels. Current research involves improved documentation of the daily variation in free CO 2 levels at the pond outlet and hatchery entrance and exit along with monthly collection of both filtered and unfiltered samples and on-site measurements at all of the above-mentioned sites. In addition to measuring nitrite, ammonia and hardness with the spectrophotometer, Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Ti are being measured using the PerkinElmer Optima- 8000 ICP-OES. Further results will be reported at the meeting...|$|R
