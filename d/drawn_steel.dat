25|$|The E-3 was {{replaced}} by the E-4 (with many airframes being upgraded to E-4 standards starting {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Britain), which was different in some small details, most notably by using the modified 20mm MG-FF/M wing cannon and having improved head armour for the pilot. With the MG FF/M, it was possible to fire a new and improved type of explosive shell, called Minengeschoß (or 'mine-shell'), which was made using <b>drawn</b> <b>steel</b> (the same way brass cartridges are made) instead of being cast as was the usual practice. This resulted in a shell with a thin but strong wall, which had a larger cavity in which to pack a much larger explosive charge than was otherwise possible. The new shell required modifications to the MG FF's mechanism due to the different recoil characteristics, hence the MG FF/M designation.|$|E

This paper presents the influence of industrial thermal–mechanical treatment utilized in practical manufacturing on microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>drawn</b> pearlitic <b>steels.</b> After post thermal–mechanical processing, <b>drawn</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> features lower residual stress and improved yield/ultimate tensile strengths, and exhibits a more perfect 110 fiber texture characteristic. Nevertheless, the torsion test of treated steel wire demonstrates that delamination occurs during torsional deformation, which implicates that the studied thermal–mechanical {{treatment is}} whereas not the optimum process for manufacturing the high–performance steel wires. The sequential TEM observation shows the remarkable different structure of pearlite lamellae in drawn and treated wires. The local stress concentration resulting from the separately granular cementite precipitation may attribute to the delamination of steel wire after post drawing...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a fracto-metallographic {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} cracked specimens of cold <b>drawn</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> subjected to fatigue tests. Fatigue cracks are transcollonial and exhibit a preference for fracturing pearlitic lamellae, with non-uniform crack opening displacement values, micro-discontinuities, branchings, bifurcations and frequent local deflections that create microstructural roughness. At the micro-level, the cold <b>drawn</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> exhibits higher micro-roughness than the hot rolled bar (this is a consequence of the manufacturing process by cold drawing), so that the actual fractured surface in the cold drawn wire is greater than that in the hot rolled bar, {{due to the fact that}} the crack deflection events are more frequent and with higher angle in the former (the heavily <b>drawn</b> prestressing <b>steel</b> wire). These findings show the relevant role on the manufacturing process by cold drawing in the fatigue crack propagation in pearlitic steel...|$|R

40|$|The {{low carbon}} steels, {{used for the}} {{production}} of car bodies by deep drawing, are graduallu substituted by high strength steels for vehicle weight reduction. The drawn car body components are joined by welding and the welded points undergo a reduction of the local tensile strength. In developing an accurate welding process model, able to optimize process parameters and to predict the final local microstructure, a significant improvement can be given by the knowledge of the welded steels thermal diffusivity at different temperatures. The laser flash method has been used to compare the thermal diffusivity of two traditional deep <b>drawing</b> <b>steels,</b> two high strength steels already in common usage, i. e. a Dual Phase (DP) steel and a Transforming Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel, and one experimental high-Mn austenitic TWIP (Twinning Induced Plasticity) steel. The low carbon steels, at low temperatures, have a thermal diffusivity that is 4 - 5 times larger than the TWIP steel. Their thermal diffusivity decreases by increasing temperature while the TWIP steel shows an opposite behavior, albeit with a lesser slope, so that above 700 °C the TWIP thermal diffusivity is larger. The different behavior of the TWIP steel in respect to the ferritic deep <b>drawing</b> <b>steels</b> arises from its non ferro-magnetic austenitic structure. The DP and TRIP steels show intermediate values, their diffusivity being lower than that of the traditional deep drawing steels; this latter fact probably arises from their higher alloy content and more complex microstructur...|$|R
