5|$|In June, India toured Bangladesh for one Test {{and three}} One Day Internationals. Rahman was picked in the ODI squad. In his first match of the series, Rahman gave signs of his {{potential}} against the strong Indian batting line-up {{by taking a}} five-wicket <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> 9.2 overs in the first match. Bangladesh won the match and Rahman became the tenth bowler {{in the history of}} ODIs to take five wickets on debut. In the second ODI, Rahman took another six wickets. This helped him to earn the record of most wickets of any bowler after two ODIs, surpassing the record previously held by Zimbabwe's Brian Vitori. He completed the last ODI with 2 wickets and made history by taking 13 wickets in a three-match ODI series.|$|E
5|$|Thrown into further {{confusion}} by {{the loss}} of Favorite, the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships Flore and Bellona succeeded in only reaching Amphion, which was now {{at the rear of the}} British line. Amphion found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by Danaé, was able to strike at HMS Volage, now the leading British ship after overtaking Cerberus during the turn. Volage was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder carronades, short range guns that caused such damage to Danaé that the French ship was forced to <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured Volage's short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July, Calypso, Fleche (Captain Thomas White), and the 20-gun sixth-rate post ship Arab (Captain Kieth Maxwell) and two {{or three}} gun-brigs drove on shore six French gun-vessels. However, the bank off Cape Grinez, and the shot and shells from the right face of its {{powerful}} battery, soon compelled the British to <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> from the shore. Arab suffered seven wounded {{and a great deal of}} damage. Fleche was the closest inshore owing to her light draft of water; she had five men severely wounded and damage to her rigging. Forster received a severe shoulder wound and had to give up command of Calypso.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of September 19, 1863, Burnham was {{overseeing}} the [...] his artillery battery in the thick woods near Jay's Mill at the Battle of Chickamauga. [...] With Confederate troops charging his position, he attempted to bring his horses forward to <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> the guns, but alert Confederates shot the animals {{as soon as they}} were within sight. With no chance of escape, he ordered his gunners to load their four 12-pound Napoleons with double-shotted canister. [...] Battery H opened up as soon as the 18th Infantry skirmishers were clear, causing the Confederates to take cover. The 16th Infantrymen in front of the guns occupied a slightly lower elevation and saw the shells flying over their heads. [...] But Battery H did not have much infantry support and enemy fire quickly shot down their gunners. Burnham was shot in the chest, mortally wounded. [...] When his second in command, Lt. Joshua A. Fessenden, asked Burnham if he was hurt, he responded: [...] "Not much, but save the guns!".|$|E

60|$|I {{know nothing}} of the damage done the enemy. We had the best of it, so far as I could see; and I think, if the weather had not {{compelled}} us to <b>haul</b> <b>off,</b> something serious might have been done. As it was, we beat out with flying colours, and anchored {{a few miles from}} the light.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{did well}} this morning, mother," [...] Jack {{said as he}} came downstairs in a clean {{guernsey}} and pilot trousers. [...] "We had a fine <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> the lower Blyth, and not a bad one higher up. I fancy most of the boats did well. The Hope was close to us, and I expect she must have done {{as well as we}} did." ...|$|E

60|$|No {{one ever}} knew the reason {{of the order}} given at that time. Perhaps the pilot {{thought he was a}} little too near the land, and meant to <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> a little; but {{whatever}} the reason might have been, the command was only half carried out when the sheet of the jib gave way; the loosened sail flapped itself to shreds in a second, and the ship, missing stays, fell off towards the shore.|$|E
60|$|In {{their anxiety}} to save any who might yet survive, and be {{clinging}} to {{portions of the}} wreck, the boat cruised about for some time, and her captain was tempted to advance too far over the dangerous shoals. She struck suddenly with great violence, and remained fast on the sands. The utmost {{efforts were made to}} <b>haul</b> <b>off,</b> but in vain. The boat was hurled again and again on the ridges of sand;--passed over several of them, and became hopelessly entangled.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be so; but {{the wind}} has got round to nor-west, {{and has not been}} sighing these last twelve hours.

6000|$|... "Ay, {{this is one}} of your coral reefs, where a man goes on {{the rocks}} from off soundings, at a single jump," [...] muttered Marble, {{ordering}} the ship brought by the wind on the best tack to <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> shore. [...] "No notice, and a wreck. As for anchoring in such a place, a fellow might as well run a line out to Japan; and, could an anchor find the bottom, the cable would have some such berth as a man who slept in a hammock filled with open razors." ...|$|E
60|$|The fierce heat had {{not only}} driven back the firemen on shore, but had {{compelled}} the floating fire-engines to <b>haul</b> <b>off,</b> in consequence of the flaming matter which poured over the wharf wall and covered {{the surface of the}} river {{the entire length of the}} burning warehouses; while the whole of the carriageway of Tooley Street was ankle deep in hot oil and tallow.

Several of the Danish men-of-war have struck, but we cannot take possession, and fresh boat-loads of men came off from shore, and their fire has reopened. Our {{position}} is an unpleasant one. Sir Hyde Parker has signaled to me to draw off, but so far I have paid no attention. I fear that we shall have to <b>haul</b> <b>off</b> and leave some four or five ships to the enemy." ...|$|E
