40|$|All {{plants and}} {{vegetation}} require certain conditions for their proper growth. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to bring the environmental conditions under control in order to make those conditions as close to the ideal as possible. To create an optimal environment the main climatic and environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, ground water etc need to be controlled to create optimal environment. An automated management of a greenhouse provides the most proper conditions of plant growth. Greenhouse Automation system based on the embedded system is used for the control of the values of temperature, humidity, light intensity and soil moisture that are continuously modified and controlled in order to optimize them to achieve maximum plant growth and yield. A microcontroller receives data on greenhouse environment conditions from a number of sensors and transfers the data to and from a PC via RS 232 port. Accordingly, it changes the state of greenhouse control devices namely, heaters, fans, bulb etc according to the necessary condition of the crops. An <b>integrated</b> <b>Liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD) is also used for display of data acquired from the various sensors and the status of the various devices...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} enables efficient microfabrication of a fully <b>integrated</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> device. Initially, a sacrificial {{layer is}} formed on a substrate that has conductive pads connected thereto. The sacrificial layer is patterned, and {{portions of the}} sacrificial layer are removed to expose portions of the underlying layer supporting the sacrificial layer. Then, a permeable layer is formed on the sacrificial layer, thereby filling in the space vacated by the removed potions of the sacrificial layer. The structure is heated and the material of the sacrificial layer is allowed to dissolve into and dissipate through the permeable layer in order to leave a cavity. Once the sacrificial layer is removed, the permeable layer {{is supported by the}} portion of the permeable layer filling in the space vacated by the removed portions of the sacrificial layer. Accordingly, a monolithic liquid crystal display is easily and reliably formed without having to etch an opening in the structure to allow the sacrificial material to egress from the structure and without having to separately attach mechanical components to each liquid crystal display manufactured.

50|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, many {{attempts}} have been made to integrate the simplicity of a notebook with the editing, searching, and communication capacities of computers through the development of note taking software. Laptop computers began to be called notebooks when they reached a small size in the 1990s, but they did not have any special note-taking ability. Personal digital assistants (PDAs) came next, <b>integrating</b> small <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays</b> with a touch-sensitive layer to input graphics and written text.

40|$|Abstract- Monitoring {{and control}} of {{greenhouse}} environment {{play an important role}} in greenhouse production and management. To monitor the greenhouse environment parameters effectively, it is necessary to design a measurement and control system. The objective of this project is to design a simple, easy to install, microcontroller-based circuit to monitor and record the values of temperature, humidity, soil moisture and sunlight of the natural environment that are continuously modified and controlled in order optimize them to achieve maximum plant growth and yield. The controller used is a low power, cost efficient chip manufactured by ATMEL having 8 K bytes of on-chip flash memory. It communicates with the various sensor modules in real-time in order to control the light, aeration and drainage process efficiently inside a greenhouse by actuating a cooler, fogger, dripper and lights respectively according to the necessary condition of the crops. An <b>integrated</b> <b>Liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD) is also used for real time display of data acquired from the various sensors and the status of the various devices. Also, the use of easily available components reduces the manufacturing and maintenance costs. The design is quite flexible as the software can be changed any time. It can thus be tailor-made to the specific requirements of the user. This makes the proposed system to be an economical, portable and a low maintenance solution for greenhouse applications, especially in rural areas and for small scale agriculturists...|$|E
40|$|A {{dual band}} thermal/visible weapon sight (TVWS) {{prototype}} {{was developed by}} INO in collaboration with DRDC Valcartier. The TVWS operates in the 8 - 12 µm infrared (IR) and 300 - 900 nm visible wavebands for enhanced vision capabilities in day and night operations. It is equipped with lightweight athermalized coaxial catadioptric objectives, a bolometric IR imager operating in a microscan mode providing an effective resolution of 320 x 240 pixels and a visible image intensifier of 768 x 493 pixels. The TVWS {{is equipped with a}} miniature shutter for automatic offset calibration. Real-time imaging at 30 fps is available. Both the visible and IR images can be toggled with a single touch button and displayed on an <b>integrated</b> color micro <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD). The TVWS also has a standard video output via a coaxial connector. An integrated wireless analog RF link can be used to send images to a remote command control. The sight has an adjustable electronic crosshair and two manual focuses from 25 m to infinity. On-board processing capabilities were added to introduce specific functionalities such as image polarity inversion (black hot/white hot) and image enhancement. This TVWS model is also very lightweight (~ 1900 grams) and compact (volume of 142 cubic inches). It offers human size target detection at 800 m and recognition at 200 m (Johnson criteria) with the IR waveband while offering the human recognition at up to 800 m with the visible waveband. The TVWS is adapted for weaver or Picatinny rail mounting...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{deals with}} <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays</b> where the incident light and reflected light {{going through the}} display are not specularly related. The incident light can be at a range of angles to the display while the reflected light, i. e. the viewing direction is at or nearly normal to the display. For such nonspecular <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays,</b> the polarizer angles, the input/output directors of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> cell, and <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> cell retardation have to be specially optimized to obtain the best viewing effects. Conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> modes do not work optimally in this nonspecular situation. We also disclose the new image-mode and shadow-mode nonspecular <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays.</b> Such displays have very bright background and are free from viewing glare common in most <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays.</b> The present invention applies to all twist angles. e. g. the 90 ° TN, the 120 ° and 150 ° HTN, the 180 °, 240 ° and 270 ° STN displays...|$|R
