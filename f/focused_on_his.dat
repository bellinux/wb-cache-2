5|$|McGovern {{endorsed}} Humphrey at the convention, to {{the dismay}} of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon.

However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and most decisive victory of his career.|$|E
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of Jerusalem, as well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E
