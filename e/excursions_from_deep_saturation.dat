40|$|We {{show that}} {{incoherent}} quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) from molecular liquids reveals a two-state dynamic heterogeneity on a 1 ps timescale, where molecules are either highly confined or {{are free to}} undergo relatively large <b>excursions.</b> Data ranging <b>from</b> <b>deep</b> in the glassy state to well above the melting point allows us to observe temperature-dependent population levels and exchange between these two states. A simple physical picture emerges from this data, combined with published work, that provides a mechanism for "hopping" and for the Johari-Goldstein (β_JG) relaxation, and allows us to accurately calculate the diffusion coefficient, D_T, and characteristic times for α, and β_JG relaxations from ps timescale neutron data.

40|$|The {{solution}} to the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation {{is found in the}} <b>deep</b> <b>saturation</b> domain. The controversy between different approaches regarding the asymptotic behaviour of the scattering amplitude is solved. It is shown that the dipole amplitude behaves as 1 - (- z + z) with z = (r^ 2 Q^ 2 _s) (r -size of the dipole, Q_s is the saturation scale) in the <b>deep</b> <b>saturation</b> region. This solution is developed from the scaling {{solution to}} the homogeneous Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. The dangers associated with making simplifications in the BFKL kernel, to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the scattering amplitude, is pointed out. In particular, the fact that the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation belongs to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov -type of equation, needs further careful investigation.

40|$|The {{holographic}} kinetics {{of organic}} polymer thin films with low-saturated absorption are considered both for self-diffraction and diffraction of a weak probe beam in Raman-Nath conditions. The coupling effect between different diffracted orders is taking into account. The coupling effect results in considerable {{increase of the}} diffraction efficiency of self-diffracted beams compared with the diffraction of the probe beam were shown. For the region of <b>deep</b> <b>saturation</b> the maximum diffraction efficiency is {{higher than in the}} region far from the saturation. The maximum of diffraction efficiency is reached for considerable shorter time in grating recording kinetics in the region of <b>deep</b> <b>saturation.</b> This opens the perspective of using those materials for novelty filter. The experimental results on low-saturated dry bacteriorhodopsin films well agree the theoretical predictions...|$|R
