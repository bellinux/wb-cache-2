50|$|Franklin {{was born}} in London, the {{youngest}} {{of a family of}} 13, and educated at Finsbury Technical College in Finsbury, England, under Silvanus P. Thompson. After graduation in 1899 he joined the Marconi Company where he spent his entire professional career. He was first sent to South Africa to provide equipment for the Boer War, then spent 2 years in Russia. After his return to the UK, he invented a number of important radio devices including the variable capacitor (patented 1902), <b>ganged</b> <b>tuning</b> (1907), variable coupling (1907), coaxial cable, and the Franklin oscillator.|$|E
50|$|Early TRF sets had {{typically}} two {{or three}} tuning knobs and tube filament voltage-control rheostats, all of {{which had to be}} set correctly to receive a station. Later (late 1920s) TRF sets had <b>ganged</b> <b>tuning</b> (one knob was used to control all stage tuning capacitors simultaneously), AC house current operation, and eliminated the filament voltage adjustments. All of these changes greatly simplified operation and made radio a household appliance that even a small child could operate, instead of the highly skilled hobbyists of the brief preceding generation. Reaction sets also had the filament adjustment rheostats for each valve, and again settings had to be right to achieve reception.|$|E
50|$|A tuned radio {{frequency}} receiver (or TRF receiver) {{is a type}} of radio receiver that is composed of one or more tuned {{radio frequency}} (RF) amplifier stages followed by a detector (demodulator) circuit to extract the audio signal and usually an audio frequency amplifier. This type of receiver was popular in the 1920s. Early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station's frequency, but later models had <b>ganged</b> <b>tuning,</b> the tuning mechanisms of all stages being linked together, and operated by just one control knob. By the mid 1930s, it was replaced by the superheterodyne receiver patented by Edwin Armstrong.|$|E

50|$|Infantasia is in {{the central}} plain {{of the park and}} covers an area of 31 {{thousand}} square metres. It is an area geared toward children. In this region the guest can find attractions such as: Kastel di Lendas, where some stories of the folk of Brazil are told. This area of the park is themed with the Looney Tunes characters. The region now represents a major studio film, with each attraction representing a part of this studio led by Bugs Bunny and the Looney <b>Tunes</b> <b>gang.</b>|$|R
50|$|Punjabi mafia {{refers to}} the {{organised}} criminal gangs {{in the state of}} Punjab in India. There has been a spurt in the formation and activities of such criminal gangs in Punjab over the last decade even though some gangs, associated with those based in Uttar Pradesh, have been operational in the state since the end of militancy in Punjab. Post militancy, they took to contract killings. The real estate and industrial sector boom of the early 2000 saw several criminals surfacing with the primary objective of controlling unions. The flourishing of the banking sector, especially finance companies, spurred the demand for bouncers who ensured recovery of bad loans and helped in grabbing disputed properties. Cricket bookies too used their services. Around five years back when the boom in real estate ended, these <b>gangs</b> then <b>tuned</b> to extortion and protection money as their source of income. Most of these are inter-state gangs as well as the ones specialising in arms smuggling, narcotics and abduction. Kidnappings for ransom in Punjab, something which rarely happened earlier, are on the rise.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Bugs Bunny and {{the rest}} of the Looney <b>Tunes</b> <b>gang</b> {{returned}} to television in the Cartoon Network sitcom, The Looney Tunes Show. The characters feature new designs by artist Jessica Borutski. Among the changes to Bugs' appearance were the simplification and enlargement of his feet, as well as a change to his fur from gray to a shade of mauve (though in the second season, his fur was changed back to gray). In the series, Bugs and Daffy Duck are portrayed as best friends as opposed to their usual pairing as rivals. At the same time, Bugs is more openly annoyed at Daffy's antics in the series (sometimes to the point of aggression), compared to his usual carefree personality from the original cartoons. Bugs and Daffy are close friends with Porky Pig in the series, although Bugs tends to be a more reliable friend to Porky than Daffy is. Bugs also dates Lola Bunny in the show, although at first, he finds her to be [...] "crazy" [...] and a bit too talkative (he later learns to accept her personality quirks, similar to his tolerance for Daffy). Unlike the original cartoons, Bugs lives in a regular home, which he shares with Daffy, Taz (whom he treats as a pet dog) and Speedy Gonzales, in the middle of a cul-de-sac with their neighbors Yosemite Sam, Granny, and Witch Lezah.|$|R
