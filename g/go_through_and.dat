Consequently, the shinkansen is {{not affected by}} slower local or freight trains, and {{has the capacity to}} operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without road crossings at grade. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and viaducts to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>and</b> over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000meters (2,500meters on the oldest Tōkaidō Shinkansen).|$|E

500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> <b>and</b> the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community.

Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three reasons I decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, what he had to <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> <b>and</b> I felt I understood where he was coming from. And I just {{wanted to be a part}} of it." [...] Welling had always been a fan of Martin's and stated that he [...] "absolutely loved" [...] working with him.|$|E

500|$|... "Jerry's Painting" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis {{called the}} episode [...] "one that may just {{have been the}} season's best — and that’s saying something when a show is as consistent as this one". She called the main plotline about the painting [...] "brilliant" [...] and said the subplot with Ben, April and Andy was so funny she hoped they had more pairings in the future. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic called [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] {{one of the strongest}} episodes of the season, and said he enjoyed seeing Leslie's character so empowered. McHatton also praised seeing April and Andy facing adulthood, writing, [...] "It's something many of us young adults <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>and</b> it was nice to see it reflected" [...] in the characters. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said the show demonstrated how Leslie Knope has developed into a strong and confident character since the [...] "daffy, wide-eyed dreamer" [...] she was in the first season. He also praised the show's [...] "new funniest pairing" [...] of Ben, April and Andy, and said the episode demonstrated that [...] "even this late in the season, the show can still feel surprising and fresh".|$|E
500|$|For {{the filming}} of the chestburster scene, the cast members knew that the {{creature}} would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but {{they had not been}} told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and squibs. The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics. According to Tom Skerritt: [...] "What you saw on camera was the real response. She {{had no idea what the}} hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up." [...] The creature then runs off-camera, an effect accomplished by cutting a slit in the table for the puppeteer's stick to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>and</b> passing an air hose through the puppet's tail to make it whip about.|$|E
500|$|Celta Vigo made a {{loan offer}} for Mido in March, which was {{reported}} to have fallen through days later as it was not approved by FIFA. However, FIFA eventually allowed the move to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>and</b> it was completed on 18 March. He scored on his Celta Vigo debut against Athletic Bilbao, which Celta won 2–1. Ajax valued Mido between the values of €5million and €6million, amidst interest from clubs in Italy and Spain. Newcastle United were reportedly on the verge of making a bid for Mido in May, but this was ruled out by Mido's agent Christophe Henrotay. Ajax attempted to make him return to the club, but he declined this, in favour of staying at Celta. He suffered a muscle injury whilst training in May, but was available to play in Celta's match against Villarreal CF, which saw Mido sent off in a game which Celta lost 5–0. Mido was linked with a move to A.S. Roma in late May, with Roma chairman Franco Sensi stating [...] "I want Mido", but Ajax revealed they wanted €15million for him. Ajax turned down a loan move from Real Betis for Mido in June. Marseille were then believed to have made an offer for the striker and Celta were not ready to meet Ajax's asking price of €15million.|$|E

500|$|Ramsey's {{opinion that}} Dodgin had treated him unfairly was {{not shared by}} the other Southampton players, who {{respected}} Ellerington as a player of comparable ability. According to the wing-half Joe Mallett, Ramsey was also motivated to leave by a dressing-room row with his captain Bill Rochford at half-time during that final League match against Sheffield Wednesday: one of the Sheffield Wednesday goals was blamed on Ramsey's failure to play an opposing winger offside. The Southampton chairman and board tried to persuade Ramsey to stay, but his mind was made up—he told them that if {{he played in the}} reserve team it would hinder his chances of playing internationally. Liverpool, Luton Town and Burnley were among the clubs who expressed interest in buying him but {{by the time of the}} transfer deadline on 16 March only Sheffield Wednesday had made a concrete bid. Tottenham Hotspur came in with a last-minute offer, but there was no time for the transfer to <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> <b>and</b> Ramsey was forced to stay at Southampton for the rest of the season. [...] On 15 May 1949 the new Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe revived the offer, and signed Ramsey in a part-exchange deal for £4,500 and Wales international winger Ernie Jones—the transfer was widely reported as being worth £21,000, then a record for Tottenham.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> <b>and</b> as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E
500|$|He was {{not offered}} a {{professional}} contract at Chesterfield by manager Arthur Cox and so left the club {{without making a}} senior appearance at Saltergate. However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in Nunthorpe by Hartlepool United manager Billy Horner. Houchen joined the [...] "Monkey Hangers" [...] on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on £30 a week. When {{he arrived at the}} Victoria Park, Hartlepool were a struggling Fourth Division club. He made his debut in a 1–1 home draw with Crewe Alexandra. Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that [...] "we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>and</b> the rest would bounce." [...] He scored his first senior goal against Barnsley on 24 March 1978. He scored further goals against Darlington, Rochdale and Newport County to end the 1977–78 campaign with four goals in 13 games. He played regular first team football in 1978–79, and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer. He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in 1979–80, as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone. His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told Reading that even if Houchen was available then they {{would not be able to}} afford him. His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to £80,000 from Plymouth Argyle and Cardiff City. He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in 1980–81, yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth. He hit 19 goals in 38 games in 1981–82 to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.|$|E

Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>and</b> end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, {{this is one of my}} favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E
