25|$|Completion of the Low Horse Level in the 1840s {{meant that}} new ore {{dressing}} facilities were needed {{at a lower}} level than at the old High Mill. A new Low Mill was built near the smelt mill, with a self-acting incline to lower wagons of ore to the new mill. There it was crushed, washed, and the concentrated ore was delivered to the smelt mill. Leats from Glenridding Beck brought a plentiful supply of water to operate the machinery at the mill. Increased ore production in the 1840s also meant that the smelting capacity had to be increased. One reverberatory furnace {{seems to have been}} installed in 1844, with more in 1851. These could process much larger amounts of lead ore, but were expensive to run, consuming large amounts to coal, and needing frequent replacements of their <b>fireclay</b> <b>brick</b> linings. They were soon abandoned and a number of the simpler ore hearths were installed in 1855. Since these produced greater quantities of lead dust and fumes, the flue was extended {{at the same time to}} the new chimney.|$|E
40|$|In this Bureau of Mines study, {{portions}} of four acidproof bricks (two red shale and two fireclay) {{were exposed to}} 20 wt pct RCI at 900 C for periods of 30 days. Three different techniques were selected to deter-mine volume expansion of these materials after exposure. Linear expansions ranging from about 0. 02 to 0. 12 pct were noted from Ta pin and dilatometer measurements. The use of strain gages to measure expansions was not successful. The red shale and <b>fireclay</b> <b>brick</b> with the lowest apparent porosities had the lowest expansions. Expansion data obtained by direct measurement of samples exposed for 30 -day periods or by dilatometric measurement of autoclaved samples ex-posed for 2 h were comparable.

40|$|Most of the {{industries}} in Nigeria depend {{heavily on the}} use of refractory materials. For instance the iron and steel industries, cement, glass, refineries, bakeries and ceramic industries. However, almost all the refractory materials used by these industries are imported. Consequently, it leads to the draining of Nigeria’s foreign reserve and this in turn negatively affects the economy of the Country. Therefore, there is the need to increase the local production of the refractory materials in order to reduce their importation and thereby boost the economy Nigeria. Hence this researched work was carried out to investigate and see if the Birnin Gwari and Maraban Rido clays in Kaduna state, Nigeria can serve as refractory materials. The clay samples were obtained from the mining sites and processed to produce <b>fireclay</b> <b>brick</b> test specimens which were fired between 250 oC and 1400 oC. The fired bricks were then tested for refractory properties such as: the linear shrinkage, bulk density, apparent porosity, cold crushing strength, thermal shock resistance and refractoriness (Pyrometric Cone Equivalent) using ASTM standards.

50|$|RUL is a {{critical}} property for refractory bricks, which basically reflects the service temperature of the bricks, raw materials, etc. (Refractoriness Under Load) RUL values(T0.6 @0.2MPa) for fireclay-based refractory bricks are usually below 1500 °C. for medium duty <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks</b> only at about 1300 °C, high duty <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks</b> at 1350 to 1420 °C, superduty <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks</b> between 1420 and 1500 °C (sometimes even higher than 1500 °C).

40|$|AbstractThe work aimed on the {{improving}} the refractory properties of Kankara clay (alumino-silicate) found in Kankara Village, Katsina State, Nigeria by blending with coal ash {{for the production}} of refractory bricks was investigated. Coal ash additions were varied from 5 to 25  wt% in the blend. Refractory properties such as: linear shrinkage, apparent porosity, bulk density, cold crushing strength and thermal shock resistance were tested. The results were compared with standard refractory properties for <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks.</b> All the values obtained from the blends are within the recommended values for medium <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks.</b> Hence, addition of coal ash to Kankara clay enhanced the refractory properties; the bricks were used in the production of heat treatment furnace with good thermal resistance...|$|R

40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{investigating}} the acid resistance of ceramic materials to identify construction materials for emerging technology in chemical and metallurgical processes. Eight commercial ceramic materials, including two red shale, two fireclay, a silica, a silicon carbide, a carbon, and a high-alumina brick, were evaluated. Samples were exposed to 40 wt pct ho 3 at 70 deg and 90 deg c and 60 wt pct hno 3 at 50 deg, 70 deg, and 90 deg c for time periods of 110 days. Statistically significant changes in cold crushing strength were generally small or not detected, except for a strength drop in the high-alumina brick, which decreased in strength when exposed to the chosen acid concentrations at 90 deg c. Volume and weight changes were also measured. The leach rates of al, ca, fe, k, mg, na, si, and ti were monitored. Increasing temperature or {{a decrease in the}} acid concentration resulted in an increased ion leach rate. Of the conditions tested, the most severe corrosion occurred at 90 deg c for a 40 -wt-pct hno 3 solution. The silica brick had the best overall acid-resistant properties, followed by a red shale and a <b>fireclay</b> <b>brick.</b> The carbon and silicon carbide bricks are not recommended for service.

40|$|Development of {{products}} {{which can be}} produced from a country’s natural resources is very important {{as far as the}} industrialization of a nation and saving foreign exchange is concerned. Presently, industries in Uganda and the other states in the Lake Victoria region import all refractory-related-consumables, as the demand cannot be met locally. Based on the abundance of ceramic raw materials for high temperature applications in the region and the demand for refractories by industries it is pertinent to develop and manufacture firebricks by exploiting the locally available raw materials. This thesis thus, concerns the characterisation of ceramic raw mineral powders from the Lake Victoria region, more particularly, Uganda, with the aim of developing firebrick refractories from the minerals. Two main deposits of kaolin and a ball clay deposit were investigated to assess their potential in the manufacture of refractory bricks. Raw- and processed sample powders were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analysis (DTA-TG) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In addition, the chemical composition, particle size distribution, density, and surface area of the powders were determined. A comprehensive study on beneficiation of Mutaka kaolin was carried out using mechanical segregation of particles. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore other potential applications like in paper filling and coating. The beneficiation process improves the chemical composition of kaolin to almost pure, the major impurity being iron oxide. A general production process scheme for manufacturing fireclay bricks starting with raw powder minerals (Mutaka kaolin and Mukono ball clay) was used to make six groups of sample <b>fireclay</b> <b>brick.</b> Experimental results from the characterization of formulated sample bricks indeed revealed the viability of manufacturing fireclay bricks from the raw minerals. Based on these results, industrial samples were formulated and manufactured at Höganäs Bjuf AB, Sweden. Kaolin from the Mutaka deposit was used as the main source of alumina while ball clay from Mukono was the main plasticizer and binder material. The formulated green body was consolidated by wet pressing and fired at 1350 °C in a tunnel kiln. Characterization of the sintered articles was done by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and chemical composition (ICP-AES). In addition, technological properties related to thermal conductivity, thermal shock, alkali resistance, water absorption, porosity, shrinkage, permanent linear change (PLC), linear thermal expansion, refractoriness under load (RUL), and cold crushing strength were determined. The properties of the articles manufactured from the selected naturally occurring raw minerals reveal that the produced articles compare favourably with those of parallel types. Thus, the raw materials can be exploited for industrial production. QC 2010102...|$|E

A high-temperature adhesive was developed and the most chemically stable refractory materials were chosen for it.

These polishing by-products are essentially a mix of fine residues of the specific ceramic body and a coarse residue of the abrasive used for polishing {{the surface of the}} tiles. In the present work, it was studied the use of porcelain tile polishing sludges, as a raw material in manufacturing of aluminosilicate <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks</b> to be used in fireplaces. In order to establish the feasibility of the process and to develop the addition conditions, a set of appropriate ceramic compositions of white and red fireclays was studied.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{incinerators}} {{are important}} for eliminating hazardous waste from industry, there are few publications on the corrosion of secondary combustion chambers. The sudden refractory failure results in high costs and work stoppages. Thus, corrosion in fireclay and bauxite-clay refractories exposed for 50 months to the harsh atmosphere in the chamber (H 2 O, O- 2, CO 2, SO 2, HCl, alkali vapors, etc.) was investigated. The operating temperatures of 930 - 1000 degrees C heat the inner refractory face up to 950 degrees C and the exterior face to 750 degrees C. X-ray diffraction revealed that condensed alkali and sulfur compounds interacted with refractories. Thermodynamic calculations determined the critical chemical reactions. Our findings show a successive corrosion mechanism that starts with the condensation of thenardite (Na 2 SO 4) and finishes with expansive phases. In <b>fireclay</b> <b>bricks,</b> the reaction with free silica led to liquid phases and slow creep. Sudden lining breakdowns were provoked by nepheline and nosean. Contrary to expectations, nepheline was not formed in the bauxite-clay bricks. Instead, only nosean was formed. In the literature, under laboratory conditions, no nosean has been observed in hot corrosion experiments. Perhaps, nosean requires several months to years to form inside the secondary combustion chamber. Our work indicates that to impede these corrosion processes, refractories should contain as little silica as possible...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{commercial}} restrictions only the Abstract and Conclusion {{are available in}} the electronic version of this thesis. The unabridged version can be consulted, on request, at the University of Leicester’s David Wilson Library. The study attempts to define the problems arising from mineral land working in relation to after-use and to record the methods of assessment and treatment. The small Coalbrookdale Coalfield contains examples of most problems likely to be found in areas formerly subjected to intensive mineral working. Furthermore it is now an area of wholesale redevelopment for the new town or Telford. Ensuring the safety or these new developments has involved much documentary research and site investigation and this study records both the general aspects and describes some case histories. The problems involved in the study are concerned with the determination of the geology in detail, both stratigraphically and structurally, in relation to topography, mineral exploitation and industrial history. Other aspects of industrial activity which affect the development potential of the land's surface such as waste heaps, abandoned communication systems, disturbed natural drainage and disused massive structures are also considered. A general survey of the extent of dereliction and of the various definitions of 'derelict land' and of its causes is discussed. Underground mining has been carried out extensively for coal, ironstone, clay (both <b>fireclay</b> and <b>brick</b> and tile clays) and limestone {{and to a lesser extent}} for fullers earth and sandstone. In addition all these minerals have been heavily worked by surface methods as have the igneous and other 'hard' rocks, marl, sand and gravel, and the useful products of the mine waste heaps, shale (both weathered and burnt) and slag. It has also been found necessary to study the much smaller extractive industries of bitumen, pyrites and salt, since their working has produced cavities and shafts in unexpected positions. The geology of each mineral, the extent, methods and age or workings, and the effect of such workings upon the surface are studied together with the special problems associated with each mineral and their possible restraints on future development. A comprehensive study is made of the development restraints which result from past and present mineral working, the methods or assessment and manner of treatment. Past land reclamation activities, which have been applied patchily and with little or no control, can themselves form a restraint to development. The methods used in the past were not sufficiently developed to ensure that all potential causes of instability were removed. Adequate preliminary site investigation is shown to be of paramount importance when considering development and the methods and extent of investigation required and the type and form of reports to be produced are outlined and discussed. The general restraints resulting from mineral working are described under the following headings: Shafts, wells and gas emission; Shallow mineworkings, adits and subsidence: Opencast mining, quarries and ground settlement; Spoilheaps, lagoons and fires; Drainage, water supply, soughs and other tunnels. Examples or each are given as case histories and site investigation and treatment methods outlined. Special consideration is given to the methods used in dealing with disused mineshafts, or the use of opencast mining as a means of land reclamation and of the problems caused by present day quarrying, underground working and general tipping activities. Natural phenomena such as landslips and geological faults also form restraints to development. The occurrences and types of landslip are examined with a view not only of determining their cause and of defining their limits but of determining means by which they can be anticipated and controlled. 	Investigations are also described which have been carried out to locate geological faults and to assess the stability implications due to their presence on development sites. Two special studies carried out include;- (1) the use of geophysical methods as aids to site investigation and their application to mineral evaluation, location of faults, shallow workings and mineshafts; and (2) the policy of preservation of features of geological, industrial and mining interest is discussed. The problems associated with preservation, recording, identifying, selecting and ensuring that retention is compatible with both public safety and future planning are outlined. A number of recommendations are given which it is believed would assist if in the future it is decided to carry out a similar land reclamation/new town development scheme elsewhere...|$|R
