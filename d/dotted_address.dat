This shows that the resolution of the two levels persists if there is finite inter-dot coupling.

40|$|The {{radio-frequency}} superconducting {{single electron}} transistor (RF-SET) {{is a highly}} sensitive and fast electrometer operating near the quantum limit.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} Coulomb blockade phenomena and single-electron charging effects in two nanoscale structures: Long semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and gold nanoparticles that {{are linked to}} a CNT by an organic molecule. While gold nanoparticles naturally exhibit single-electron charging at low temperature, it is disorder that causes the formation of quantum dots in long semiconducting CNTs at low carrier density. Our instrument of choice is a lowtemperature atomic force microscope (AFM) that is sensitive to electrostatic sample forces. A theory of the interactions between single-electron charging of a quantum dot and the AFM tip and cantilever is worked out in linear response. In semiconducting CNTs we resolve single-electron charging events in the resonance frequency of the AFM cantilever. The AFM?s spatial resolution allows us to locate the quantum <b>dots</b> and <b>address</b> them individually. We extract {{the size of the}} quantum dots, their gate couplings, and exemplify how to extract their charging energy from the AFM measurements. We frequently observe interaction between neighboring quantum dots and characterize their interdot coupling. The evolution of the quantum dots in CNTs with gate voltage reflects the underlying potential energy landscape for the carriers on the tube. We observe the CNT band structure and extract quantitative information about the disorder potential. On the gold nanoparticle sample, we combine dissipation and frequency shift measurements by our AFM. In addition to the electrostatic gate couplings and the charging energy, this combination allows us to characterize the tunnel coupling between the gold nanoparticle and the CNT, which is acting as a lead. The power of the demonstrated force probe techniques lies largely in the local nature of the measurement.

40|$|The {{transportation}} system {{is an important}} network established to ensure the mobility of people and goods between destinations. In addition, it also serves {{a vital role in}} responding to disasters, and therefore deserves special attention when those disasters threaten to decrease its support capability. The task of securing a {{transportation system}} consisting of multiple interconnected assets is a complex responsibility. As an owner and operator of major transportation infrastructure, state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) {{have a vested interest in}} ensuring this balance and represent an important mediator between federal and local interests, assuming nine key security planning roles in their traditional transportation planning duties: Coordinator, Analyzer/Planner, Financial Administrator, Infrastructure Owner, Infrastructure Operator, Implementer, Regulator, Information Provider, and Influencer. Through their internal vulnerability assessments, the departments already perform a vital security planning function that can support their own planning efforts as well as others. Incorporating security into the transportation planning process requires modification as feedback of implementation methods is received. It does not mean transforming the DOT into a security agency, but rather incorporating a security perspective into the analysis of the system. This first involves establishing a more solid role as a coordinator in order to solidify vital linkages between agencies relevant to security planning. This interaction should reveal standardization issues the <b>DOT</b> can <b>address</b> in order to ensure effective collaboration, communication and coordination. Funding security measures may be difficult; but by incorporating security measures into initial analyzation and planning processes, they can be brought into the broader concept of the system rather than simply added as additional funding needs. The nine roles suggested earlier offer opportunities for state DOTs to overcome these and other challenges faced in the process of incorporating security into the transportation planning process. Through these roles, state DOTs can ensure that security efforts reach the parts of the system that require them and begin to build a more secure system. M. S.

40|$|Abstract: Although ICTs {{can help}} ignite social and {{economic}} development, they can also result in the marginalization of developing countries and, perhaps more alarmingly, of economically disadvantaged groups within both developing and even developed countries. Marginalization occurs most often when ICTs are haphazardly distributed. And this divide emerges when developing countries and certain disadvantaged groups can neither afford ICTs nor, even when available, use them effectively. The G 8 Heads of State launched a project of the Digital Opportunity Task Force (<b>DOT</b> Force) to <b>address</b> the digital divide and mobilize all countries {{to carry out a}} cooperative effort to identify ways of bridging the digital divide, especially the developing countries. As the largest developing country in the world, China faces a severe digital divide, which exists not only between China and developed countries, but also among its own regions and social groups. How to apply appropriate DOT-Force strategy to guide the dramatic development of ICT so as to bridge the digital divide is a big challenge to China. To clarify and tackle this increasingly pressing problem, the objective {{of this paper is to}} address three issues: (1) the digital opportunity and the challenges of the digital divide; (2) The current situation of digital divide inside China; (3) China’s DOT-Force strategy and relevant policies. The paper concludes that the Chinese government plays very important role in the bridging the national divide in both domestic and international context.
