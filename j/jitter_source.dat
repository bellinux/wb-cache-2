These micro-jitters may seriously affect the image quality from high-resolution observation satellites. A new application {{form of a}} passive vibration isolation system was proposed and investigated using a pseudoelastic SMA mesh washer. This system guarantees vibration isolation performance in a launch environment while effectively isolating the micro-disturbances from the on-orbit operation of <b>jitter</b> <b>source.</b> The main feature of the isolator proposed {{in this study is}} the use of a ring-type mesh washer as the main axis to support the micro-jitter source.

Taking ZiYuan- 3 (ZY- 3) multi-spectral camera as a prototype, this paper proposes a satellite platform jitter detection method by utilizing multi-spectral imagery. First, imaging characteristics of multispectral camera and the main factors affecting band-to-band registration error are introduced. Then the regularity of registration error caused by platform jitter is analyzed by theoretical derivation and simulation. Meanwhile, the platform jitter detection method based on high accuracy dense points matching is presented. Finally, the experiments were conducted by using ZY- 3 multi-spectral imagery captured in different time. The result indicates that ZY- 3 has a periodic platform jitter about 0. 6 Hz in the imaging period of test data, and the jitter amplitude across track is greater than that along track, which causes periodic band-to-band registration error with the same frequency. The result shows the possibility of the improvement in geometric processing accuracy for ZY- 3 imagery products and provides an important reference for satellite platform <b>jitter</b> <b>source</b> analysis and satellite platform design optimization...|$|E

A diagnostic platform or D-plate was used at {{the output of the}} DTL in order to measure various beam parameters. The D-plate and other diagnostic devices located in the IMS, provided measurement of the horizontal and vertical beam position, current, energy, and output phase. These instruments were installed to perform a complete beam jitter analysis based on the current beamline configuration to better understand the causes of any <b>jitter</b> <b>sources</b> as well as to prepare for the initial design of future feedback control systems. The study explored all types of jitter for various beamline configurations. Both interpulse jitter (jitter from pulse to pulse) and intrapulse jitter (jitter within each macropulse) were investigated. Spectral and statistical time analyses were used. Spectral analysis was employed to gain an understanding of the spectral contributions of various <b>jitter</b> <b>sources</b> to determine the degree of correction possible.

It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited {{in part by the}} spatial variation of photon detection events {{along the length of the}} wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at the readout at varied times. We define this <b>jitter</b> <b>source</b> as geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 μm x 3 μm device while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 μm x 20 μm device.

Acoustic disturbances, {{such as those}} caused by the pressure recovery system of the high power laser, are a significant <b>jitter</b> <b>source.</b> Several technologies may be appropriate for reducing the acoustically induced jitter. The first choice for mitigation will be passive approaches, such as acoustic blankets. There is, however, some uncertainty whether these approaches will provide sufficient attenuation and there is concern about the weight of these approaches. A testbed that captured the fundamental physics of the ABL acoustically induced optical jitter problem was developed. This testbed consists of a flexure-mounted mirror exposed to an acoustic field that is generated outside a beam tube and then propagates within the tube. Both feedback and adaptive feedforward control topologies were implemented on the testbed using either of two actuators (a fast steering mirror and a secondary acoustic speaker located near the precision mirror), {{and a variety of}} sensors (microphones measuring the acoustic disturbance, accelerometers and microphones mounted on the precision optic, and an optical position sensing detector).

40|$|International audienceGround {{motion is}} a severe problem for many {{particle}} accelerators, since it excites beam oscillations, which decrease the beam quality and create beam-beam offset (at colliders). Orbit feedback systems can only compensate ground motion effects at frequencies significantly {{smaller than the}} beam repetition rate. In linear colliders, where the repetition rate is low, additional counter measures {{have to be put}} in place. For this reason, a ground motion mitigation method based on feed-forward control is presented in this paper. It has several advantages compared to other techniques (stabilization systems and intratrain feedback systems) such as cost reduction and potential performance improvement. An analytical model is presented that allows the derivation of hardware specification and performance estimates for a specific accelerator and ground motion model. At the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF 2), ground motion sensors have been installed to verify the feasibility of important parts of the mitigation strategy. In experimental studies, {{it has been shown that}} beam excitations due to ground motion can be predicted from ground motion measurements on a pulse-to-pulse basis. Correlations of up to 80 % between the estimated and measured orbit jitter have been observed. Additionally, an orbit <b>jitter</b> <b>source</b> was identified and has been removed, which halved the orbit jitter power at ATF 2 and shows that the feed-forward scheme is also very useful for the detection of installation issues.

Traditional SPICE-based simulation techniques can precisely simulate various deterministic <b>jitter</b> <b>sources,</b> such as intersymbol interference (ISI) and crosstalk from passive channels. The inclusion of random jitter in SPICE simulations, however, results in long simulation time. Innovative simulation techniques based on a statistical simulation framework have been recently introduced to cosimulate deterministic and random jitter effects efficiently. This paper presents new improvements on this statistical simulation framework. In particular, we introduce an accurate jitter modeling technique which accounts for bounded jitter with arbitrary spectrum in addition to Gaussian jitter.

40|$|Networks on chip (NoCs) are {{communication}} infrastructures {{that offer}} parallelism and scalability. Most NoC designs employ wormhole packet switching, since this switching mode optimizes {{the use of}} NoC resources. However, this mode may introduce jitter, possibly producing packet loss, due to the violation of temporal QoS constraints. One technique to deal with jitter is to introduce a decoupling buffer (D-buffer) on the target IP. This buffer receives data from the NoC with jitter, while the target IP consumes data from this buffer at the application rate, without jitter. Two problems must be solved to implement D-buffers: (i) which size must the buffer have? (ii) how much buffer space should be filled before data consumption starts (threshold) ? This work proposes a general method to define D-buffer size and threshold, considering the influence of packaging, arbitration, routing and concurrency between flows. Before presenting the method, the paper extends a previous traffic model for stream applications and characterizes <b>jitter</b> <b>sources</b> in wormhole packet switching. The experimental results obtained with the proposed method showed that simple traffic models employing constant frame sizes result in small D-buffers.

ELETTRA is responsible {{for the development of the}} VME-controlled clock-delay board of the BAM sys-tem. A variable clock-delay circuit (a phase shifter) is required to adjust the acquisition sampling point of the pick-up-modulated optical pulses of the master-laser os-cillator.

The clock timing jitter of the acquisition system greatly affects the measurements: the output timing jitter from the clock-delay board should be less than 0. 5 ps-rms.

40|$|The {{generation}} of ultra-short electron bunches with ultra-small bunch arrival-time jitter is of vital importance for Laser-plasma wake field acceleration (LWFA) with external injection. We study {{the production of}} 100 -MeV electron bunches with bunch durations of sub-femtosecond (fs) and bunch arrival-time jitters of less than 10 fs, in an S-band photoinjector by using a weak magnetic chicane with a slit collimator. The beam dynamics inside the chicane is simulated by using two codes with different self-force models. The first code separates the self-force into a three-dimensional (3 D) quasi -static space-charge model and a one-dimensional CSR model, while the other one starts from the first-principle with a so-called 3 D sub-bunch method. The simulations indicate that theCSR effect dominates the horizontal emittance growth and the 1 D CSR model underestimatesthe final bunch duration and emittance because of the very large transverse -to-longitudinal aspect ratio of the sub-fs bunch. Particularly, the CSR effect is also strongly affected by the vertical bunch size. Due to the coupling between the horizontal and longitudinal phase spaces, the bunch duration {{at the entrance of}} the last dipole magnet of the chicane is still significantly longer than that at the exit of the chicane, which considerably mitigates the impact of space-charge and CSR effects on the beam quality. Exploiting this effect, a bunch charge of up to 4. 8 pC in a sub-fs bunch could be simulated. In addition, we analytically and numerically investigate the impact of different <b>jitter</b> <b>sources</b> on the bunch arrival-time jitter downstream of the chicane, and define the tolerance budgets assuming realistic values of the stability of the linac for different bunch charges and compression schemes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the performance of different schemes for generating short x-rays pulses via synchrotron radiation emission. A review is given of the methods that have been previously proposed for this task. From this review, three leading schemes are selected for in-depth investigations, each of which explores the boundary of what is presently achievable in accelerator-based light sources. The first scheme generates short x-ray pulses by operating an electron storage ring in a quasi-isochronous state using a ‘low-alpha’ lattice. High and low emittance lattices are developed, studied through simulation and then implemented on the Diamond storage ring. Beam dynamics and bunch length measurements are presented for a variety of machine conditions, and an assessment is made of the minimum practically achievable bunch length for stable user operation. Radiation pulses of 1 ps r. m. s. are demonstrated using this scheme. The second and third schemes investigate performance limits for a linac-based light source through numerical simulations. The first of these generates ultra-short pulses by passing a highly compressed electron bunch through a long undulator to radiate in the ‘single-spike’ regime. A comparison is made with theoretical predictions for the required electron bunch length to operate in this way, which highlights the need for accurate start-to-end simulations. The final scheme generates ultra-short x-ray pulses through laser manipulation of the electron bunches. The modulated electrons pass through a long undulator with tapered gap, such that only the centre of the modulated portion experiences high free-electron laser (FEL) gain. A method to enhance the FEL output from this scheme using a wavelength filter and grating-compressor is investigated. The sensitivity of the two schemes to <b>jitter</b> <b>sources</b> is determined, and it is demonstrated both schemes are capable of generating GW-level, fully coherent sub-fs soft x-ray pulses.

The detection of a 30 th magnitude planet located within 50 milli-arc-seconds of a 5 th (Visual) magnitude star is an exceptionally challenging objective. Observations in the thermal infrared (7 - 17 microns) are somewhat easier since the planet is "only" 15 (sup m) fainter than the star at these wavelengths, but many severe challenges must still be overcome. These challenges include: 1. Designing a coronagraph for star:planet separations {{less than or equal}} to lambda/D. 2. Developing the deployment scheme for a 28 m space telescope that can fit in an existing launch vehicle payload fairing. 3. Generating configuration layouts for the IR telescope, coronagraph, spacecraft bus, sunshade, solar array, and high-gain antenna. 4. Providing: Structural stability to within 10 microns to support the optics. Thermal control to achieve the necessary structural stability, as well as providing a stable (approx. 30 K) thermal environment for the optics. Dynamics isolation from potential <b>jitter</b> <b>sources.</b> 5. Minimizing launch mass to provide the maximum payload for the science mission Interfacing to an EELV Heavy launch vehicle, including acoustic and stress loads for the launch environment. 6. Identifying the key technologies (which can be developed by 2009) that will enable TPF mission to be performed. 7. Generating a manufacturing plan that will permit TPF to be developed at a reasonable cost and schedule. Many of these design challenges result in inherently conflicting requirements on the design of TPF. Drawing on our experience with large space telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Next Generation Space Telescope, we have created a conceptual design for TPF that successfully meets these challenging requirements. This paper describes our solution to these challenges...|$|R
