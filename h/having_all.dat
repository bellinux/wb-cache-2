5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, <b>having</b> <b>all</b> the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system was not designed with the operation of parties in mind, {{as they had been}} thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned to deal with this by <b>having</b> <b>all</b> their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Samaras {{has been}} {{described}} as <b>having</b> <b>all</b> the skills necessary for forward play. His height, , makes him difficult to handle in the air – and he is also a good header of the ball. This means he can be used as an effective target man and his team can hit long balls up to him. He can also score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E
5|$|Although {{in places}} {{there was a}} mixture of {{different}} companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton's Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions, both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North of them was the 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, <b>having</b> <b>all</b> taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of <b>having</b> <b>all</b> pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, {{but not all of}} the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E

5|$|Gregorio Leti's Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to {{make their}} Nephews Powerful (1667) {{is one example of}} {{contemporary}} criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of <b>having</b> <b>all</b> of his publications on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("List of Prohibited Books"). The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the crown-cardinals, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.|$|E

5|$|Lance Armstrong {{was removed}} from the head of the list after <b>having</b> <b>all</b> seven of his Tour {{victories}} stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences. Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would have joined the list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO have decided not to reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic doping problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a doping violation. Ullrich, therefore, has a single Tour victory to his name.|$|E

5|$|The final boss fight {{takes place}} at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without <b>having</b> <b>all</b> seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall {{off the edge of the}} temple. Peace is {{restored}} to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.|$|E

Burke, the brother of Brian Burke {{who went on to}} serve as Premier from 1983 until 1988, went on to hold the seat for 19 years until 1987.
