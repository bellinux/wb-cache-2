40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to isolate alkaline proteases from farmed giant catfish viscera by using a thermoseparating aqueous two phase system (T-ATPS). Different phase partitioning parameters [type of salts, NaCl addition and temperature were optimized. The optimum system contained 40 % EOPO 3900 - 10 % MgSO 4 with 17 %NaCl, induced phase separation at 55 ºC and provided the highest recovery (77. 98 %) and purity (PF: 21. 50 -fold) with a partition coefficient (KE) of 11. 90 and a volume ratio (VR) of 0. 19. In recycling step, the mixture of bottom salt-rich phase and bottom EOPO-rich phase in the ratio of 0. 5 : 1. 5 (w/w) provided the highest recovery and purity. Hence, the total recovery of 91. 62 % was obtained from the separation system. Three major clear zones (24, 36 and 130 kDa) can be distinctively observed on casein-substrate gel electrophoresis for protease activity staining. Major protein components of perilla seed hydrolysates were completely hydrolyzed by the alkaline proteases at 70 units while those of red kidney bean isolate were more resistant to protein hydrolysis.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Emerging {{science is}} proposing that <b>plant</b> <b>protein,</b> or some <b>plant</b> <b>proteins,</b> may affect cardiometabolic health for {{different}} reasons, starting from amino acid composition and continuing {{with the other}} substances and nutrients with which <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> (as compared to animal protein) is intimately associated. The final picture remains very unclear. Closely controlled trials of supplementation with a specific protein source given as selectively as possible remain little conclusive regarding the true effect of <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> on the intermediary endpoints of cardiometabolic risk such as plasma lipid levels. Trials using <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> foodstuffs rather than purified proteins have yielded more conclusive results, but the effects of protein per se cannot easily be disentangled from those of changes to other nutrients and substances associated with protein. Furthermore, these studies have mostly been restricted to specific protein sources, thus hampering any extrapolation to “plant protein” in general and more generally versus animal protein. Likewise, the effects of interventional trials comparing diets that may differ markedly at many levels cannot be ascribed directly to the pattern of protein sources. Observational studies have been very useful in revealing associations between plant/animal protein intakes using hard outcomes of cardiovascular health and under “real-life” conditions, although the risks of residual confounding factors are important. We have argued that a considerable part of the association between <b>plant</b> and animal <b>protein</b> intakes and cardiometabolic risk could be ascribed to the large cluster of nutrients and various other substances that they directly or indirectly convey, while a lesser part may also {{be linked to the}} amino acid content. Whatever the case, an intake of <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> has consistently been shown to be a robust marker of a healthy diet in developed countries, and it appears to provide a very good basis for recommending the sourcing of more <b>protein</b> from <b>plant</b> foods in developed countries, and maintaining a high proportion of <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> in developing countries.

40|$|International audienceBackground: <b>Plant</b> <b>protein</b> intake, {{which is}} favorably {{associated}} with the intake of many nutrients, is a marker of a healthy diet. However, the higher nutrient adequacy of diets rich in <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> may also originate from overarching factors associated with more healthful dietary behaviors, such as a greater dietary diversity. Objective: Our main objective {{was to determine whether}} the relation between <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> intake and nutrient adequacy could be explained, at least in part, by an association with overall dietary diversity. Methods: We used data from 1330 adults participating in the French Nutrition and Health Survey [Etude Nationale Nutrition Sante (ENNS); 2006 - 2007]. With the use of global, integrative approaches, we assessed nutrient adequacy (by using the probabilistic PANDiet (Probability of Adequate Nutrient Intake) scoring system] and overall dietary diversity (by using a 100 -point score that accounts for the relative number of subgroups consumed in 7 food groups). Linear multivariate modeling was used for the analysis. Results: We found a positive association between <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> (but not total or animal protein) intake and dietary diversity (beta = 0. 08) and a strong positive association between dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy (beta = 0. 33). However, the association between <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> intake and nutrient adequacy was not explained by dietary diversity (r= 0. 38 and partial r= 0. 36, P < 0. 0001). In multivariate analysis, nutrient adequacy was positively associated with dietary diversity (beta = 0. 44) and plant (beta = 0. 37) and animal (beta = 0. 15) protein intakes. Associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (total energy, energy density, sex, body mass index, income, occupational status, educational level, region, season, and smoking status). Conclusions: Overall dietary diversity is greater in French adults who consume more <b>plant</b> <b>protein.</b> Both <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> intake and dietary diversity are {{associated with the}} nutrient adequacy of the diet.

Potato protein concentrate (included up to 21 % of the diet) and soy protein concentrate (included at 19.7 % of the diet) did not inhibit the growth of Atlantic salmon compared to fishmeal-based diets (Refstie et al. 2001; Refstie and Tiekstra 2003). The growth of Atlantic salmon was inhibited by increasing <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> (full-fat soybean meal and corn gluten meal) up to 42 % of the diet compared to a fishmeal-based diet (Kraugerud et al. 2007). Kraugerud et al. (2007) reported that a diet containing 46 % soybean meal stunted the growth of Atlantic salmon (Torstensen et al. 2008). When included at 20 % of the diet, canola protein concentrate also inhibited the growth of Atlantic salmon.

40|$|In Northern Europe, {{interest}} in farming Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. has increased steadily {{over the past}} decade stimulated by the decline in landings from fisheries, and the more predictable supply by hatchery reared juveniles for on-growing. From 1999 to 2007 the sale volume of farmed cod has increased from 145 to 10000 tonnes, and in 2008 13500 tonnes were slaughtered. Until recently, the protein in cod diets has been based on expensive, highquality fish meal. Currently, most marine resources, which are used in production of fish meal, are exploited to the highest maximum level, simultaneously as the global production of farmed fish has increased. Pressure is laid on the farming industry to stop using unsustainable diets, and find solutions that are in agreement with sustainable management. It is therefore essential to evaluate the potential for using <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> in diets for Atlantic cod. Four feeding trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> in diets for Atlantic cod. A mixture of soybean concentrate and wheat gluten can replace 58 % protein from fish meal, and a mixture of soy protein concentrate, bioprosessed soybean and wheat gluten meal can replace at least 25 % of the fish meal protein without reducing growth. Inclusion of <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> reduces protein utilisation, but can to some extent be compensated for by increased feed intake. Corn gluten is not recommended used as it gave reduced nutrient digestibility and a yellow skin colour. <b>Plant</b> <b>protein</b> inclusion did not affect health negatively, except for severe gut damage when 100 % of fish meal was replaced by <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> (a mixture of protein concentrate, bioprosessed soybean and wheat gluten meal).

In the absence of experimentally verified LSPs we exploit the common-feature hypothesis behind SecretomeP and use known classically secreted <b>proteins</b> (CSPs) of <b>plants</b> as a proxy to evaluate its accuracy. We show that, contrary to the common-feature hypothesis, plant CSPs are a poor proxy for evaluating LSP detection due to variation in the SecretomeP prediction scores when the signal peptide (SP) is modified. Removing the SP region from CSPs and comparing the predictive performance against non-secretory proteins indicates that commonly used threshold scores of 0. 5 and 0. 6 result in false-positive rates in excess of 0. 3 when applied to <b>plants</b> <b>proteins.</b> Setting the false-positive rate to 0. 05, consistent with the original mammalian performance of SecretomeP, yields only a marginally higher true positive rate compared to false positives.

The descriptive statistics of the socio-economic characteristics of proteinous food consumers show that majority (56. 7 %) of the household heads are about 40 years old, most (73 %) of the households’ heads are males, of which about 68 % are married. A high percentage of the households heads are well educated with mean household size of 4 and mean monthly income of N 15, 000. 00. The per capita expenditures on the two classes of proteinous source of foods indicate that the mean per capita expenditure (N 1266. 11) on animal protein source food (APSF) is greater than the per capita expenditures (N 239. 12) on <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> source food (PPSF). The results show that animal <b>protein</b> and <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> consumption accounted for N 5, 064. 43 and N 956. 48 of the household monthly disposable income respectively, representing 41 % and 7. 8 % of household monthly disposable income of the household. With respect to the determinants of <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> source food (APSF) and <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> food consumption, the linear regression model was chosen as the lead equations on the basis of high R 2, the conformity of the signs of the coefficients with apriori expectations. The R 2 for animal protein source food (APSF) consumption is 0. 80 indicating that 80 % of the variations in APSF consumption is due to the influence of the explanatory variables while that <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> source food consumption is rather low (29 %). Household income, household size and years of schooling are the variables that significantly and positively influence APSF consumption while <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> source food (PPSF) consumption was only influenced by household disposable income...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals in proteomics and cell biology is to identify the functions of proteins in various cellular organelles and pathways. Information of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful insights for revealing their functions and understanding how they {{interact with each other}} in cellular network systems. Most of the existing methods in predicting <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> subcellular localization can only cover three or four location sites, and none of them can be used to deal with multiplex <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> that can simultaneously exist at two, or move between, two or more different location sites. Actually, such multiplex proteins might have special biological functions worthy of particular notice. The present study was devoted to improve the existing <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> subcellular location predictors from the aforementioned two aspects. A new predictor called “Plant-mPLoc” is developed by integrating the gene ontology information, functional domain information, and sequential evolutionary information through three different modes of pseudo amino acid composition. It can be used to identify <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> among the following 12 location sites: (1) cell membrane, (2) cell wall, (3) chloroplast, (4) cytoplasm, (5) endoplasmic reticulum, (6) extracellular, (7) Golgi apparatus, (8) mitochondrion, (9) nucleus, (10) peroxisome, (11) plastid, and (12) vacuole. Compared with the existing methods for predicting <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> subcellular localization, the new predictor is much more powerful and flexible. Particularly, it also has the capacity to deal with multiple-location proteins, which is beyond the reach of any existing predictors specialized for identifying <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> subcellular localization. As a user-friendly web-server, Plant-mPLoc is freely accessible at [URL] Moreover, for the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results. It is anticipated that the Plant-mPLoc predictor as presented in this paper will become a very useful tool in plant science as well as all the relevant areas...|$|R
