5000|$|Although {{the legal}} status of domain {{hijacking}} was formerly thought to be unclear, certain U.S. federal courts in particular have begun to accept causes of action seeking the return of stolen domain names. Domain hijacking is analogous with theft, in that the original owner is deprived of the benefits of the domain, but theft traditionally relates to concrete goods such as jewelry and electronics, whereas domain name ownership is stored only in the <b>digital</b> <b>state</b> of the domain name registry, a network of computers. For this reason, court actions seeking the recovery of stolen domain names are most frequently filed in the location of the relevant domain registry. In some cases, victims have pursued recovery of stolen domain names through ICANN's (Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), but a number of UDRP panels have ruled that the policy is not appropriate for cases involving domain theft. [...] Another method of cybercriminals doing [...] "domain hijacking" [...] is from the backend of hosting and registrar companies. Misusing their company systems to prevent the owner from being contacted by interested parties, for example by fraudulently entering whois-data, and even knowingly stopping or cancelling a customer's payment for renewal, allowing the [...] "stolen" [...] domain to then be expired and auctioned via a domain-auctioning site. This is considered to be backend computer-misuse, which is within the scope of the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the UK cybercrime legislation.|$|E

40|$|In summary form, the {{approach}} to demodulation in {{this paper is to}} use an HMM filter to evaluate an estimate for the transmitted digital signal, X ~ = E[X ~ IYo~], conditioned on the channel estimate, and substitute this directly into (1) to generate an estimate of y ~ for use in a Kalman filter adaptive channel estimator, which evaluates i~. The form of equation (1) allows us to easily see how the soft-outputs are used, because the full vector Xk is fed into the channel estimator instead of making a hard decision about the <b>digital</b> <b>state.</b> The particular HMM filter used in this paper is a modified version of that used in [3]. In this paper the <b>digital</b> <b>state</b> vector X ~ is subdivided into smaller vectors, one for each group of clusters in the signal constellation. This technique greatly reduces the computational requirements of the algorithm. This is an exact technique, involving no approximation, in cases where the transition probabilities of the digital signal (due to the coding scheme used, for example convolutional coding), form a lumpable matrix. In other cases the technique involves an approximation, the validity of which is tested via simulation studies. Simulation studies demonstrate that bit-error-rate performance, for this grouped <b>digital</b> <b>state</b> estimator approach, is comparable to the performance when using the full state vector X ~ (under reasonable noise conditions), however computational requirements are greatly reduced...|$|E
