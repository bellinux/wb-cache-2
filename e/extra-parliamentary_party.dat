50|$|Liberalism was a {{major force}} in Finland since 1894. After {{independence}} the current gradually decreased. A major other force, agrarianism, choose in 1965 to develop itself into a more centrist current. The liberal character of the Finnish Center (Suomen Keskusta), member of LI and ELDR, is based on liberal ideas like decentralization, peasant-like freedom and progressivism. The Swedish minority party Swedish People's Party (Svenska Folkpartiet i Finland) {{is also a member of}} LI, ELDR. The original liberal current is now organized in the Liberals (Liberaalit), a very small <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>party.</b> At the autonomous island of Åland the Liberals for Åland (Liberalerna på Åland) are a dominant force.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the wider}} party the split {{was not so}} clear. Liberal Associations which {{supported}} Liberal National candidates remained affiliated to the National Liberal Federation, the mainstream body for the official party, until that body was dissolved in 1936; in particular one Liberal National cabinet minister, Walter Runciman elected in 1899, of a wealthy shipping family, remained its President even after the Commons split. Its replacement, the Liberal National Council, the main organ of the local (<b>extra-parliamentary)</b> <b>party,</b> was founded in 1936. However, there were increasing divisions when some Liberal associations endorsed Liberal Nationals, especially at by-elections: frequently Independent Liberals came forward to oppose such a candidate endorsed by the local association that called itself 'Liberal' but was actually Liberal National.|$|E
5000|$|In Finland, the {{dominant}} LI and ALDE member {{party is the}} centrist and agrarian Centre Party (Suomen Keskusta), however the liberal character of this party is questioned. In actuality, the Centre Party has long since become socially more conservative than the liberal-conservative National Coalition Party, since it opted not to support same-sex marriage. The Swedish minority party Swedish People's Party (Svenska Folkpartiet i Finland, member LI, ALDE) has a clearer liberal profile. The original liberal current was until 2011 organized in the Liberals (Liberaalit), after 1995 a very small <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>party.</b> At the autonomous islands of Åland the Liberals for Åland (Liberalerna på Åland) and the centrist agrarian Ålandic Centre (Åländsk Center, member ALDE) are {{the dominant}} forces.

At the 2 March congress Bondarchuk urged to dissolve all current Ukrainian right wing <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>parties</b> and the creation of a single right-wing party.

Laporta was elected its president.|$|R
50|$|Even then by 1873 {{only six}} percent of the adult male {{population}} were franchised (Hacohen 2002). The initial divisions into Catholic, liberal, national, radical and agrarian parties differed across ethnic grounds further fragmenting the political culture. However, there was now emerging the presence of <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>parties</b> whereas previously parties were purely intra-parliamentary. This provided {{an opportunity for the}} disenfranchised to find a voice. These changes were taking place against a rapidly changing backdrop of an Austrian economy that was modernising and industrialising and economic crises such as that of 1873 and its resultant depression (1873-1879), and the traditional parties were slow to respond {{to the demands of the}} populace. By the election of 1901, the last election under the defined classes of franchisement (Curia) extraparliamentary parties won 76 of the 118 seats.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, some Slovenian {{politicians}} started {{threatening to}} also block Croatia's accession into NATO. Slovene Prime Minister Borut Pahor stated his regret on 29 January {{of the move}} by the opposition Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), which threatened to boycott the assembly {{that was supposed to}} decide about the ratification of accession protocols into NATO of the future member states Croatia and Albania; as a result, the assembly had to be postponed. However, the Slovenian parliament ultimately ratified Croatia's NATO accession. An unforeseen complication arose when the small, <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>Party</b> of Slovenian Nation (SSN) and the Institute 25 June gathered over 5,000 signatures; according to the Slovenian Constitution, this gave it time until March 2009 to gather an additional 40,000 signatures to mandate a referendum on Croatia joining NATO. NATO then expressed concern about such a complication. Controversy erupted over claims that Andrej Šiško, a SSN member convicted for an attempted murder and sentenced to 22 months in prison, was released for a day in Rogoza to attend the negotiations of the highest body of his Party with Pahor about preventing a referendum.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2014 {{parliamentary}} election, {{the short-lived}} Unity political alliance had gained only 38 seats, {{less than the}} 40 required to nominate a presidential candidate, thus Majtényi needed the support of Politics Can Be Different (LMP) which was not a member party of the Unity alliance, unlike the other left-wing parties. As early as 3 January, the Dialogue for Hungary (PM) expressed its support for Majtényi, who [...] "always fought for {{the people with the}} tool of the law". On the same day, party leader Gábor Fodor declared on Hír TV that the Hungarian Liberal Party (Liberals) would join Majtényi's initiative. Independent MP Péter Kónya, also chairman of the Solidarity for Republic <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>party,</b> added his signature on 5 January. LMP decided to support Majtényi's nomination [...] "in the light of the present realities" [...] on 3 February, but also argued in favour of introduction of a direct presidential election system. On 15 February, the parliamentary group of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) announced its support at a news conference. Party chairman Gyula Molnár said they had found a candidate who [...] "is able to represent their democratic commitment". On 24 February, the presidency of the Democratic Coalition (DK) authorized the party's four MPs to support and vote for Majtényi. Leader Ferenc Gyurcsány said their candidate represents [...] "solidarity and republican ideals". Finally, the Together (Együtt) party also declared its support on 27 February. In summary, 43 MPs (including two independents) supported Majtényi's nomination, and he thus became an official candidate for the position of President of Hungary, the first opposition candidate since András Balogh (2010) and the first non-partisan civil candidate since László Sólyom (2005).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In modern democracies {{political}} parties exist because (1) they reduce transaction {{costs in the}} electoral, parliamentary and governmental arenas and (2) help overcome the di-lemma of collective action. In Western Europe {{political parties}} are the central mechanism to make the constitutional chain of political delegation and accountability work in practice. Party representatives in public office are ultimately the agents of the <b>extra-parliamentary</b> <b>party</b> organization. In order to contain agency loss parties rely on party-internal mechanisms and the institutionalisation of party rights in public rules and, in contrast to US parties, they apply {{the full range of}} ex ante and ex post mechanisms. Generally, the role of party is weaker the further down the chain of delegation...|$|E
