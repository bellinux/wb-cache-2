50|$|Distribution of the seminole bat is {{the southeastern}} {{part of the}} United States. This {{includes}} Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and parts of Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina. There are also records of Seminole bats as far as Mexico. Reports have found seminole bats {{in the areas of}} Northeastern North Carolina in 2015. Since 2015, seminole bats have been cared for bat rehabilitators in Northern Virginia and recorded in the same area using an <b>Echo</b> <b>Meter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Echo is a five-channel deep tow, {{side scan}} sonar system rated to 3,000 <b>meters</b> water depth. <b>Echoâ€™s</b> {{operating}} frequencies are 100 and 400 kHz, which cover a total swath width up to 1,000 <b>meters.</b> <b>Echo</b> is also equipped with a 2-7 kHz sub-bottom profiler that permits identification of sub-seafloor features.|$|R
50|$|He also {{undertakes}} surveys {{related to}} navigational safety and port development, provides bathymetric data for all potential sites {{for planning and}} execution of various projects, and undertakes the work of publication of Tides every year.The Hydrographic Department has three full-fledged survey parties which are equipped with latest hydrographic equipment like Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), dual frequency <b>echo</b> sounders, current <b>meters,</b> automatic tide gauge, digital level & Hypack Hydrographic Software.|$|R
50|$|In 1961 {{his first}} book of poems, A Run of Jacks, was published. Soon after he took a {{creative}} writing teaching job at the University of Montana. He later became {{the head of the}} creative writing program there. His wife returned to Seattle in 1964, and they divorced soon after. He published five more books of poetry, a memoir, a highly respected book on writing, and also a mystery novel. His posthumous book of collected poetry, Making Certain It Goes On, evinces that his poems are marked by crisp, gorgeous images of nature that often stand in contrast to his own depression, loneliness, and alcoholism. Although almost always written in free verse, his poems have a strong sense of rhythm that often <b>echoes</b> iambic <b>meters.</b> He also wrote a large number of informal epistolary poems at a time when that form was unfashionable.|$|R
50|$|At the UK National Bat Conference, Wildlife Acoustics {{announced}} the <b>Echo</b> <b>Meter</b> handheld bat detector. The device {{will be available}} in December 2011. The detector is capable of monitoring for bats using heterodyne, frequency division or Real Time Expansion (RTE). RTE is Wildlife Acoustics proprietary technique for shifting bat sounds to the audible range while maintaining distinctive temporal and spectral characteristics of the call. In addition, the EM3 can record in full spectrum and/or zero-cross to an SD card while monitoring. A real time spectrogram shows calls as they are happening while monitoring and/or recording. The spectrogram can be scrolled back to analyze the spectrogram of previous bat calls. Calls can be played back using time expansion.|$|E
