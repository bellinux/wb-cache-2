40|$|Selected data {{obtained}} {{during the first}} year of operation of the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) on board the Nimbus 7 satellite (launched in late October 1978) have been used to calculate, on a global basis, various geophysical parameters over open oceans, polar regions, and terrain. Over open oceans these calculations have provided values for sea surface temperatures, near-surface winds, atmospheric water vapor in a column, and rainfall rates. In polar regions, sea ice concentration, multiyear ice fraction, and radiating temperatures have been obtained. Finally, the extent and water equivalence of snow cover over terrain have been calculated. These parameters have been compared with in situ measurements of the same geophysical parameters, where available, and the results of these comparisons are described.

In practice, the production and maintenance of geospatial data are scattered in different units, and the standard of the data grid varies between departments and systems. All these bring out the disunity of standards among different historical periods or orgnizations. Aiming at geospatial information security library for the national high resolution earth observation, there are some demands for <b>global</b> <b>display,</b> associated retrieval and template applications and other integrated services for geospatial data. Based on GeoSOT grid and encoding theory system, "geospatial information security library information of globally unified grid encoding management" data subdivision organization solutions have been proposed; system-level analyses, researches and designs have been carried out.

40|$|Forty-five {{participants}} {{performed a}} vigilance task {{during which they}} were required to respond to a critical signal at a local feature level, while the <b>global</b> <b>display</b> was altered between groups (either a circle, a circle broken apart and reversed, or a reconnected figure). The shape in two of the groups formed a configurative whole (the circle and reconnected conditions), while the remaining shape had no complete global element (broken circle). Performance matched the results found in the previous experiments using this stimulus set, where a configural superiority effect was found to influence accuracy over time. Physiological data, measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, revealed elevated activation in the right pre-frontal cortex compared to the left pre-frontal cortex during the task. Additionally, bilateral activation was found in the conditions that formed configurative wholes, while hemispheric differences over time were found in the condition that did not. These findings suggest that configural aspects of stimuli may explain why non-typical laterality effects have been found in similar research...|$|E

Unlike most publications on the revival, which study the Salentine "pizzica," my focus is on the revival of a less-known subgenre of the tarantella, the "tammurriata" from the Naples area. I illustrate how within the revival, the ethics of place embedded in the tammurriata shift from a rural, religious, and rooted setting to an urban, secular, and migrant one.

40|$|Sixty-one {{participants}} {{performed a}} sustained attention task {{in which they}} were required to respond to a critical signal requiring feature discrimination. Three separate groups performed the task with different <b>global</b> <b>display</b> configurations. The local feature elements (directional arrow shapes) were dis- played on either a circle, a circle broken apart or a reconnected figure. For two of the groups, the entire display consisted of a clear global shape (circle and reconnected), and for one of the groups, the display had no discernible global element (bro- ken circle) despite the critical signal being the same for all the groups. Analyses of hit rate and A′ scores indicated that the broken circle group had impaired performance compared to the global figure groups. A configural superiority effect was found in which performance was improved by having a global shape property to the entire display. These results provide a behavioural base for further research utilizing measures of cerebral activation, as cerebral activity during vigilance tasks may be dependent on both task difficulty and hierarchical aspects of the display. The configurable or hierarchical aspects of vigilance displays may be critical in understanding sustained attention performance and its hemispheric lateralization...|$|E
40|$|Advertising {{is often}} the key element in the {{business}} case for public display networks. However, {{this is still a}} limited medium in its support for key ad- vertising concepts, such as targeting or impact assessment. This chapter analyses how the evolution of the medium is creating the opportunity for re-shaping adver- tising models for Digital Signage. In particular, we consider how the increasing availability of sensing and interaction opportunities may generate the necessary digital footprints that will help to characterise advertising opportunities in Digital Signage and measure impact. A generic footprint model would enable advertising models to be specified at a higher level of abstraction, enabling them to be applied across <b>global</b> <b>display</b> networks composed by very diverse display types, managed by many different entities, and serving many different purposes. We propose a de- sign space that relates the multiple types of digital footprints that can be generated with multiple modes of campaign targeting and impact assessment, providing the ground for a fundamental shift from advertising based on measuring attention to advertising based on active engagement with people. “Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia” and “Programa Operacional Ciência e Inovação 2010 ” (POCI 2010), co-funded by the Portuguese Government and European Union by FEDER Program and by “Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia” training grant SFRH/BD/ 47354 / 2008...|$|E
40|$|Inversion {{effect in}} {{biological}} motion perception has been recently attributed to an innate {{sensitivity of the}} visual system to the gravity-dependent dynamic of the motion. However, the specific cues that determine the inversion effect in naive subjects were never investigated. In the present study, we have assessed {{the contribution of the}} local gravity-dependent motion (i. e., the orientation of individual dot trajectories) and the global configuration (i. e., the vertical location of the dots representing the feet within the display) in determining the inversion effect for biological motion in humans at birth. Results showed that 2 -day-old newborns, at their 1 st exposure to point-light displays, preferred a biological motion stimulus representing the legs of a walking animal compared with an identical display in which individual dot trajectories were locally inverted so that the motion violates the gravity force (Experiment 1). Interestingly, the global configuration affected the analysis of the gravity-dependent profile of dots motion. Indeed, the spontaneous preference disappeared when the local dots representing feet were embedded in a more complex <b>global</b> <b>display</b> and all the dots representing feet were located on the ground below {{the rest of the body}} (Experiment 2). Finally, results revealed that the orientation of the global configuration per se is not a crucial factor in determining newborns' preference (Experiment 3). These results suggest that humans possess an inborn predisposition about the direction of the gravity force that imprints biological motion and supports the hypothesis that a mechanism for the detection of biological motion is already at work before visual experience...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper deals with the {{analysis}} of layer buckling and delamination of thin film multilayer structures that are used in flexible display applications. To this end, 250 nm thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layers have been deposited on a 200 m thick high temperature aromatic polyester substrate (Arylite) with a 3 m silicaacrylate hybrid hard coat (HC). Typical buckle morphologies are determinedfrom two-point bending experiments, in which buckle geometries are measured after straightening of the sample. Finite element simulations have been performed to estimate the corresponding interface properties and compressive strains in the layers, and to illustrate the effect of sample straightening on the buckle geometry. The second part considers the fracture sensitivity analysis of an active matrix Thin Film Transistor (TFT) display containing 512 x 256 pixels, with a typical pixel dimension of 160 x 160 m. Due to the large scale differences between the display and the TFT patterning a multi-scale modelling framework has been developed, which allows to include realistic material stacks and a detailed pixel geometry. The resulting patterning effect shows an anisotropic behaviour at both the pixel level and the <b>global</b> <b>display</b> level due to the multi-scale approach. Using the Area Release Energy (ARE) method an energy-based failure criterion has been utilised to analyse cohesive failure at several (critical) locationsin the pixel geometry. Specifically, the sensitivity to tunnelling cracks in the dielectric layers is considered, which have been experimentally observed in comparable TFT samples that are subjected to tension. This local failure analysis allows for the identification of critical regions within the pixel geometry, which strongly depend on the location within a pixel...|$|E
40|$|DG ENTR and JRC/IPTS of the European Commission have {{launched}} {{a series of}} studies to analyse prospects of success for European ICT industries with respect to emerging technologies. This report concerns display technologies (Organic Light Emitting Diodes and Electronic Paper - or OLEDs and e-paper for short). It assesses whether these technologies could be disruptive, and how well placed EU firms would be {{to take advantage of this}} disruption In general, displays are an increasingly important segment of the ICT sector. Since the 1990 s and following the introduction of flat panel displays (FPDs), the <b>global</b> <b>display</b> industry has grown dramatically. The market is now (2009) worth about ¿ 100 billion. Geo-politically, the industry is dominated by Asian suppliers, with European companies relegated to a few vertical niches and parts of the value chain (e. g. research, supply of material and equipment). However, a number of new technologies are entering the market, e. g. OLEDs and electronic paper. Such emerging technologies may provide an opportunity for European enterprises to (re-) enter or strengthen their competitive position. OLEDs are composed of polymers that emit light when a current is passed through them. E-paper, on the other hand, is a portable, reusable storage and display medium, typically thin and flexible. Both OLEDs and e-paper have the potential to disrupt the existing displays market, but it is still too soon to say with certainty whether this will occur and when. Success for OLEDs depends on two key technical advances: first, the operating lifetime, and second, the production process. E-paper has a highly disruptive potential since it opens the door to new applications, largely text-based, not just in ICTs but also in consumer goods, pictures and advertising that could use its key properties. It could also displace display technologies that offer text-reading functions in ICT terminals such as tablet notebooks. There are three discrete segments in the OLED value chain where any discontinuity could offer EU firms the opportunity to play a more significant part in the displays sector: (1) original R&D and IPR for devices and for the manufacturing process and material supply/verification; (2) bulk materials for manufacture and glass; and (3) process equipment:. For the e-paper value chain, we can see that the entry of EU suppliers is perhaps possible across more value chain segments than for OLEDs. Apart from the ones mentioned for OLEDs, there are opportunities to enter into complete devices and content provision. In terms of vertical segments, the point of entry in OLED FPDs for Europe is most likely to be in the mass production of smaller FPDs for mobile handsets. In conclusion, OLEDs and e-paper have the potential to disrupt current displays market and in so doing they may enable EU companies to enter at selected points in the value chain to compete with the Asian ICT industry.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between industrial dynamics and corporate strategies, {{in the setting of}} the <b>global</b> flat panel <b>display</b> industry. The connections between strategizing by firms and industrial dynamics is explored {{in the case of the}} <b>global</b> flat-panel <b>display</b> (FPD) industry, which since the inception of the dominant Thin-Film Transistor – Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) technological trajectory in the late 1980 s, has evidenced clear industrial dynamics in terms of industry cycles, product cycles and value chain dynamics, all of which can be linked to the strategies of the firms involved in the industry. Patterns of fast followership become evident as a result of detailed industry case study analysis – as conducted in this paper on the FPD industry – and in a dynamic, disequilibrium analytical framework. The mainstream frameworks of Industrial Organization and Industrial Economics, with their comparative static and equilibrium-based bearings, have little traction when applied to these cases – or indeed give positively misleading results if applied uncritically, as in the fruitless debates over so-called “input-driven” industrial development in East Asia. It is the empirical investigation of these industrial dynamics, in a way that highlights the strategies being pursued by the major players, that promises to shed light on the underlying economic and industrial development processes involved. 15 page(s...|$|R
