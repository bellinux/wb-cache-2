Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus {{was responsible for the}} Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead.

Nevertheless, Oldenburg appointed Kulikovsky as an aide-de-camp, and allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the same residence as Oldenburg and the Grand Duchess on Sergievskaya Street.

5|$|Initially, Shaw {{refused to}} seek {{clerical}} employment in London. His mother allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{free of charge}} in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had no thought yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet. Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.|$|E

5|$|After {{forfeiting}} {{his title}} as World Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess {{and the public}} eye. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the U.S. government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match winnings, and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, he lived his life as an émigré. In 2004, {{he was arrested in}} Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the U.S. government. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Iceland until his death in 2008.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife. From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Synge visited Italy {{to study}} the {{language}} for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met W. B.

That year he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his Collected Works.) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.|$|E
5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him.

However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete.
