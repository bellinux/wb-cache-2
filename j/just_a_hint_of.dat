500|$|The {{scene in}} which Tooms enters Scully's home was {{initially}} filmed in Hutchison's absence. The crew shot his entrance later, using a larger blue screen set. These shots were digitally merged so that Tooms would appear to emerge from a much smaller hatch than was filmed. The effect was kept to a minimum; Hutchison's footage was not [...] "squeezed" [...] too much, as both Carter and visual effects supervisor Mat Beck have stated their belief that [...] "less is more: <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the supernatural {{is all that is}} required".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{describes}} herself as a [...] "singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [...] and maintains that honest songwriting {{is very important to}} her. She told Marie Claire: [...] "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." [...] Kristen Wiig commented that [...] "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [...] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [...] The New York Times labeled her [...] "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> experimentation". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent [...] "clichés". Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene, Jessie James, Kelly Clarkson, Lesley Roy, Britney Spears, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} from NME {{considered that}} the song sashays along with sass, while still remaining charming, {{and said that}} though it doesn't mark Allen out as excellent dating material, as a soundtrack to the summer, [...] "it’s a dead fackin’ cert". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called [...] "Smile" [...] {{just as good as}} [...] "LDN", [...] "its loose reggae arrangement augmented by the clever sample of Jackie Mittoo’s piano from the Soul Brothers’ 60s rocksteady tune [...] "Free Soul", as Allen sings bitterly about her ex, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability at first, before going to her friends for reassurance, and confronting the guy during the chorus with a mean-spirited confidence that has us cheering inside". While John Murphy of MusicOMH praised the song and its [...] "gently lilting reggae rhythm", Priya Elan from NME considered that the Althea & Donna groove of [...] "Smile" [...] is what made fans [...] "fall for her in the first place". The former argued that [...] "even people who profess to hate pop music will secretly be tapping a foot to it and claiming it is just downright perfect pop for lolling around during the lazy warm, guaranteed to cheer the listeners up, no matter how down they're feeling". Other reviews came from The Guardian reporter Sophie Heawood, who didn't consider the song as Allen's greatest effort, but still thought she was far better than being called [...] "the female Mike Skinner".|$|E

500|$|The 1960s {{setting of}} X-Men: First Class, technologically {{inspired}} by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they [...] "did a cool job representing the period, {{in a way it}} still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the [...] "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" [...] personality. The director said his goal was to [...] "feel like a '60s Bond film, but {{with a little bit of}} reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time." [...] At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the [...] "bloody hard balancing" [...] of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was [...] "not so alien to the kids that it looked like a period piece." [...] The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly [...] "that 60s misogynist vibe" [...] with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.|$|E
500|$|Midnight Heat was {{released}} in July 2012 following Heat Rush. It is packaged in a purple bottle. According to Beyoncé's official website, [...] "For , fragrance is an essential accessory to highlight your inner radiance, confidence and sex appeal. Midnight Heat is the ultimate evening scent, sensual and enticing with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> mystery." [...] The perfume's top notes are described as dragonfruit, apricot and starfruit; middle notes of orchid, tulip and peony; and base notes of sandalwood, patchouli and amber. A poster for the fragrance {{was released}} on July 18, 2012, and shows Beyoncé wearing a purple mini-dress. Idolator's writer X. Alexander wrote that she looked [...] "appropriately regal in purple in her new fragrance art" [...] while Julee Wilson of The Huffington Post wrote that the advertisement [...] "definitely screams sensual". Gaby Wilson of MTV commented that the photo appropriately sets the mood for the midnight perfume further praising Beyoncé's look. Ambika Mutto of VH1 gave a negative review for the poster, writing that she was [...] "really disappointed" [...] because the image was [...] "boring and literal". She noted, [...] "Sexy hair flying, sexy dress in a color reminiscent of midnight, on a rooftop against the midnight sky — we get it." [...] A writer of the website Digital Spy praised the scent, writing that it empowers [...] "your inner diva" [...] and added that [...] "there will be no Single Ladies left if you wear this". At the 2013 StyleBistro Awards, Midnight Heat was nominated in the category for Best New Fragrance.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Romances was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Terry Jenkins of AllMusic praised the collaborative work of Silvetti and Manzanero and called Romances [...] "a sensuous, enchanting album". Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune called Miguel's voice the album's strong point and noted the [...] "presence of electronic instruments and the darker, more somber mood". On the other hand, she felt that Miguel was beginning [...] "to slip", citing the tracks [...] "Jurame" [...] and [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] as examples. Fernando Gonzalez wrote for the Orange County Register noting although the album is [...] "Impeccably produced, arranged and recorded", he felt that boleros [...] "demand more than that". Gonzalez elaborated: [...] " [...] He sounds simply loud, rather than romantic, in [...] "Sabor a Mi; he comes across as (soap) operatic rather than tormented in [...] "El Reloj [...] "; he is a star -- not a humble student -- in [...] "Contigo Aprendi"." [...] The Corpus Christi Caller-Times music critic Rene Carbrera wrote a positive review of the album praising the string arrangements as [...] "elegantly done" [...] and complimented Miguel's take on [...] "Sabor a Mí" [...] and [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] {{as he had done}} it [...] "delightfully done in the traditional way and flavored with Trio Los Panchos requinto [...] "cling" [...] endings." [...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote an unfavorable review of the recording; he criticized its productions for having all the tracks [...] "awash in silky keyboards and airy strings with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> percussion in the background". He also panned its lead single [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] for coming off as a [...] "love song for the chaste" [...] due to its arrangements being [...] "so stifling, so precious, it's difficult to feel any sensuality".|$|E

2500|$|Overall, the {{character}} and Torv's performance has received generally positive reviews. Although, the initial response to Anna Torv's performance was mixed in the first season. In his review of the pilot episode for New York, John Leonarwas found Torv [...] "wonderfully played" [...] her character. IGN's Travis Fickett agreed, calling Torv's early work on Fringe [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show." [...] MSNBC was equally praiseworthy of Torv and her character, writing [...] "Olivia is {{the soul of the}} show — two-fisted and defiant, yet vulnerable. Torv knows how to convey authenticity, {{even in the midst of}} an outrageous scene. And sporting sensible pantsuits and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> makeup, she makes Olivia a plausibly gorgeous pro, not a crime-busting tootsie." [...] Conversely, SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall believed Torv's early performance to be [...] "downright wooden", while others criticized the actress and character for being [...] "cold and distant." [...] The New York Observer found her to be the one weak link of the main cast, criticizing Torv for her accent and for showing [...] "less emotion than a piece of plywood." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{fruit of}} the cashew tree is an {{accessory}} fruit (sometimes called a pseudocarp or false fruit). What {{appears to be the}} fruit is an oval or pear-shaped structure, a hypocarpium, that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower. Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as marañón, it ripens into a yellow and/or red structure about 5-11 cm long. It is edible and has a strong [...] "sweet" [...] smell and a sweet taste. The pulp of the cashew apple is very juicy, but the skin is fragile, making it unsuitable for transport. In Latin America, a fruit drink is made from the cashew apple pulp which has a very refreshing taste and tropical flavor that can be described as having notes of mango, raw green pepper, and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> grapefruit-like citrus.|$|R

The reason Adam was walking along the lanes at this time was because his work {{for the rest of the}} day lay at a country-house about three miles off, which was being put in repair for the son of a neighbouring squire; and he had been busy since early morning with the packing of panels, doors, and chimney-pieces, in a waggon which was now gone on before him, while Jonathan Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback, to await its arrival and direct the workmen.|$|R

The peltate leaves are often described as egg shaped, all of the leaves are hairless and often have five to seven shallow lobes around the edge. Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides do have fruits that are flat and the break in half when the plant reaches maturity. Once the fruit has broken open there is one seed on each side. The fruits are elliptical to round with thin ridges and no oil tubes (vitta) which is characteristic in the fruit of umbelliferous plants.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the release}} of The Avengers in 2012, Marvel ran a series of canon tie-in comics {{entitled}} [...] "Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week", which take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It may be nothing new but her punchy, {{uplifting}} set of pastiche Sixties and Seventies soul, r’n’b and disco is perfectly pitched with <b>just</b> <b>an</b> appealing <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> exaggeration." [...] The Independent gave the album 3 stars out of 5, commenting on a lack of originality but complimenting [...] "Can't Rely on You" [...] Allmusic gave the album a very positive review, giving it 4 stars out of 5, calling {{the production of the}} album slick and funky, complementing the new musical direction, highlighting the new sound of disco, and '70's soul-influences on the album. Further commented: [...] "Ultimately, it's Faith's irrepressible enthusiasm and unbridled vocal ability that shine the most on A Perfect Contradiction, and having musicians like Pharrell and Saadiq around just works to sweeten the deal." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily, who was eleven, {{was pretty}} also--or {{would have been}} had Felicity not been there. Felicity rather took the colour from other girls. Cecily looked pale and thin beside her; but she had dainty little features, smooth brown hair of satin sheen, and mild brown eyes, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> demureness in them now and again. We remembered that Aunt Olivia had written to father that Cecily was a true Ward--she had no sense of humour. We did not know what this meant, but we thought it was not exactly complimentary.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a glorious}} {{moonlight}} night, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> October frost in the air--enough to give sparkle and tang. After {{a few moments}} I became aware that Miss Ponsonby was also [...] "musing" [...] at her window {{in the shadow of}} the acacia tree. In that dim light she looked quite pretty. It was suddenly borne in upon me for the first time that, when Miss Ponsonby was young, she must have been very pretty, with that delicate elusive fashion of beauty which fades so early if the life is not kept in it by love and tenderness. It seemed odd, somehow, to think of Miss Ponsonby as young and pretty. She seemed so essentially middle-aged and faded.|$|E
60|$|The person {{reading was}} a trifle different; {{one would have}} said of {{him that he was}} of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his attire which attested a certain {{fellowship}} with the organisms of his environment. His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco: his footgear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on the floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had considered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have missed its meaning. In countenance the man was rather prepossessing, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> sternness; though that he may have assumed or cultivated, as appropriate to one in authority.

'Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,' Gabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way. I was very sorry, and I said, 'Ah!--and how did she come to die?' 'Well, she's dead in Casterbridge Union,' he said, 'and perhaps 'tisn't much matter about how she came to die. She reached the Union early Sunday morning, and died in the afternoon--that's clear enough.' Then I asked what she'd been doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and left off {{spitting}} a thistle with the end of his stick.

They then said I had better <b>just</b> name <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> her death to you, and away they went.

5000|$|Critical {{response}} to [...] "Reach for the Dead" [...] was very positive. Billboard writer Lars Bradle said that [...] "if of Canada's followers {{were hoping for}} an upbeat treat in the vein of 2005's 'Davyan Cowboy,' then think again. 'Reach for the Dead' finds the act in an experimental, and slightly off-key mode. It's a haunting track. There's not <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drum beat until the 2:50 minute mark. But it's unmistakably of Canada." [...] He added that [...] "the duo don't make bombastic music ... but {{in the world of}} low-key electronic music, they're arguably the best at what they do." [...] Brock Thiessen of Exclaim! wrote: [...] "much like you'd expect, the track takes a sombre route, hitting those of Canada touchstones while adding a whole new layer of updated and wicked-eerie atmospherics to the mix" [...] and The A.V. Clubs Marah Eakin noted that [...] "Reach for the Dead" [...] was [...] "for all intents and purposes, a Boards Of Canada single, complete with experimental tones and a complete lack of drums for most of the track." [...] Nick Neyland of Pitchfork Media stated that the song is [...] "much darker than most of their prior material, marrying the mournfulness of Popol Vuh’s soundtrack work with the swell of underground artists producing John Carpenter-indebted electronica." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum described the song as [...] "an ominous, humming instrumental drone-piece with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> the sad nostalgia that the group used to radiate." [...] He also stated that [...] "until the glitchy drums kick in two-thirds of the way through", the song sounds like [...] "something that would be playing on the score of a great ’80s sci-fi movie." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} about Reddie Ray that pleased all the senses. His lithe form seemed instinct with life; any sudden movement was suggestive of stored lightning. His position at the plate was on the left side, and he stood perfectly motionless, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> tense waiting alertness. Dorr, Blake and Babcock, the outfielders for the Grays, trotted round {{to the right of}} their usual position. Delaney smiled derisively, as if he knew how futile it was to tell what field Reddie Ray might hit into. Wehying, the old fox, warily eyed the youngster, and threw him a high curve, close in. It grazed Reddie's shirt, but he never moved a hair. Then Wehying, after the manner of many veteran pitchers when trying out a new and menacing batter, drove a straight fast ball at Reddie's head. Reddie ducked, neither too slow nor too quick, just right to show what an eye he had, how hard it was to pitch to. The next was a strike. And on the next he appeared to step and swing in one action. There was a ringing rap, and the ball shot toward right, curving down, a vicious, headed hit. Mallory, at first base, snatched at it and found only the air. Babcock had only time to take a few sharp steps, and then he plunged down, blocked the hit and fought the twisting ball. Reddie turned first base, flitted on toward second, went headlong in the dust, and shot to the base before White got the throw-in from Babcock. Then, as White wheeled and lined the ball home to catch the scoring Clammer, Reddie Ray leaped up, got his sprinter's start and, like a rocket, was off for third. This time he dove behind the base, sliding in a half circle, and as Hanley caught Strickland's perfect throw and whirled with the ball, Reddie's hand slid to the bag.|$|E

She didn't think then that she would live long, but she lived for twenty years, Master, and she held me to my promise all the time. Yes, it was hard"--for I had given an indignant exclamation--"but you see, Master, I had promised and I had to keep my word. Rose said I was right in doing it. She said she was willing to wait for me, but she didn't know, poor girl, how long the waiting was to be. Then her father's health failed completely, and the doctor ordered him to another climate. They went to California. That was a hard parting, Master. But we promised each other that we would be true, and we have been. I've never seen my Rose of joy since then, but I've had a letter from her every week. When the mother died, five years ago, I wanted to move to California and marry Rose. But she wrote that her father was so poorly she couldn't marry me yet. She has to wait on him every minute, and he's restless, and they move here and there--a hard life for my poor girl. So I had to take a new lease of patience, Master. One learns how to wait in twenty years. But I shall have her some day, God willing. Our love will be crowned yet. So I wait, Master, and try to keep my life and soul clean and wholesome and young for her.|$|E
60|$|The train bearing Yeovil on {{his visit}} to Torywood slid and rattled westward through the hazy dreamland of an English summer landscape. Seen from the train windows the stark bare ugliness of the metalled line was forgotten, and the eye rested only on the green {{solitude}} that unfolded itself as the miles went slipping by. Tall grasses and meadow-weeds stood in deep shocks, field after field, between the leafy boundaries of hedge or coppice, thrusting themselves higher and higher till they touched the low sweeping branches of the trees that here and there overshadowed them. Broad streams, bordered with a heavy fringe of reed and sedge, went winding away into a green distance where woodland and meadowland seemed indefinitely prolonged; narrow streamlets, lost to view in the growth that they fostered, disclosed their presence merely by the water-weed that showed in a riband of rank verdure threading the mellower green of the fields. On the stream banks moorhens walked with jerky confident steps, in the easy boldness {{of those who had}} a couple of other elements at their disposal in an emergency; more timorous partridges raced away from the apparition of the train, looking all leg and neck, like little forest elves fleeing from human encounter. And in the distance, over the tree line, a heron or two flapped with slow measured wing-beats and an air of being bent on an immeasurably longer journey than the train that hurtled so frantically along the rails. Now and then the meadowland changed itself suddenly into orchard, with close-growing trees already showing the measure of their coming harvest, and then strawyard and farm buildings would slide into view; heavy dairy cattle, roan and skewbald and dappled, stood near the gates, drowsily resentful of insect stings, and bunched-up companies of ducks halted in seeming irresolution between the charms of the horse-pond and the alluring neighbourhood of the farm kitchen.

If {{it was not for}} the {{drawback}} of her illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have <b>just</b> given you <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her." ...|$|R

They are also a means by which book owners can show part of their identity. From humble origins to works of art, Ex-Libris are also fantastic pieces of information. By popular demand, in February we shall be having Blind Date with a Book! Borrow a book based on <b>just</b> <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> <b>hints</b> – you never know who you’ll meet and what places you’ll visit! What’s great about it is that it’s completely no strings attached, you can always return the book if it’s not your type! In March we shall be celebrating Women’s Day by picking out books written about or by women who have had an impact. In the Did you Know section, we talk about Trench Coats and their unlikely origins together with a research tip that will take you out of your comfort zone. There are many kinds of libraries – some of them don’t even contain books. An example is the Fototeka which is the national collection of Photographs housed at the National Museum of Archaeology. This is a very interesting collection and we get a sneak peak thanks to the conservator, Ms. Lindsay Galea taking care of it. See how many boxes you can tick off by challenging yourself with the 2017 Book Challenge. This challenge is not about how many books you read, but to challenge yourself to try out new genres of books. JC Library {{is a great place to}} start, with many titles to choose from both Fiction and Non-Fiction!N/...|$|R
