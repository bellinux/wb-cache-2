25|$|Since the car {{was first}} invented, its {{controls}} have become fewer and simpler through automation. For example, all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with <b>electronic</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E

This method saves time and cost for making of an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> unit board and uses the <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> unit board having a type of microcontroller {{in which we can}} flash code many times for generation of control strategy. Based on the given circuit, development of <b>control</b> strategy for <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> unit is done in microcontroller’s supported IDE.

25|$|Motorized {{bicycles}} using {{electric motors}} have also re-entered the market. Electrically powered bicycles use batteries, {{which have a}} limited capacity and thus a limited range, particularly when large amounts of power are utilized. This design limitation means {{that the use of}} the electric motor as an assist to pedal propulsion is more emphasized than is the case with an internal combustion engine. While costly, new types of lithium batteries along with <b>electronic</b> <b>controls</b> now offer users increased power and range while reducing overall weight. Newer electric motor bicycle designs are gaining increasing acceptance, particularly in countries where increasing traffic congestion, aging populations, and concern for the environment have stimulated development and usage.|$|E
25|$|After 25 {{years from}} the {{introduction}} of the first-generation Range Rover, the second-generation Range Rover—model-designation P38A—was introduced for the 1995 model year, with an updated version of the Rover V8 engine. There was also the option of a 2.5-litre BMW six-cylinder turbo-diesel with a Bosch injection pump. This was the first diesel injection with <b>electronic</b> <b>controls</b> in a Land Rover, before common rails were introduced. This was a result of BMW's subsequent ownership of Rover Group and hence the Land Rover brand. The new model offered more equipment and premium trims, positioning the vehicle above the Land Rover Discovery to face the increased competition in the SUV marketplace. This model was the last to feature the Rover V8 and interior leather supplied by Connolly who went out of business in 2002. It was the first model to feature Satellite Navigation as an option.|$|E
500|$|However, {{according}} to General Motors, {{in a move}} illegal under WTO rules the Chinese government refused the allow Chevrolet Volt owners access to up to [...] in government subsidies available for plug-in vehicles unless GM had agreed to transfer intellectual property to {{a joint venture with}} a Chinese automaker for {{at least one of the}} Volt’s three core technologies: electric motors, complex <b>electronic</b> <b>controls,</b> and power storage devices, whether batteries or a fuel cell. General Motors negotiated with the Chinese government to let the Volt qualify for the subsidies without the technology transfer, but , the subsidies were available only for electric cars made by Chinese automakers. As a result of the high import duties, General Motors reported in August 2012 that sales are minimal, those of a very low-volume car. According to LMC Automotive, a total of 18 Volts have been sold in China through June 2012.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> devices has {{expanded}} worldwide {{during the last}} few years, the most widely used model being the Taser. However, the scientific knowledge about <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> devices remains limited. We reviewed the medical literature to examine the potential implications of electronic devices in terms of morbidity and mortality, and to identify and evaluate all the existing experimental human studies. A single exposure of an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> device on healthy individuals can be assumed to be generally safe, according to 23 prospective human experimental studies and numerous volunteer exposures. In case series, however, <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> devices could have deleterious effects when used in the field, in particular if persons receive multiple exposures, are intoxicated, show signs of "excited delirium," or present with medical comorbidities. As the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> devices continues to increase, the controversy about its safety, notably in potentially high-risk individuals, is still a matter of debate. The complications of <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> device exposure are numerous but often recognizable, usually resulting from barbed dart injuries or from falls. Persons exposed to <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> devices should therefore be fully examined, and traumatic lesions must be ruled out...|$|R

2500|$|An insulin pump {{to infuse}} a rapid-acting insulin {{is the first}} step in {{simulating}} the function of the pancreas. [...] The pump can accurately deliver small increments of insulin compared to an injection, and its <b>electronic</b> <b>controls</b> permit shaping a bolus over time to match the insulin profile required for a given situation. [...] The insulin pump is controlled by the pump user to bolus manually based on a recent blood glucose measurement and an estimate of the grams of carbohydrate consumed. [...] This predictive approach is said to be open-loop. [...] Once a bolus has been calculated and delivered, the pump continues to deliver its basal rate insulin in the manner that has been programmed into the pump controls based on the predicted insulin requirements of its user.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ability of}} the <b>electronic</b> <b>controls</b> of the {{infusion}} pump, particularly in the bolus shaping capability, suggests that the control algorithm may replicate {{the function of the}} healthy pancreas in a more copycat fashion. [...] At present, the insulin bolus is a predictive dose based on what is about to be eaten, and then infused completely. [...] Even with the benefit of the closed-loop control of the basal insulin, the standard bolus is still a [...] "guess and then fix it later" [...] approach. [...] Compare to the pancreatic physiology, where insulin and amylin are released from the beta cells in pulses almost directly to the liver in response to the immediate blood glucose level. The natural release from the beta cells is a closed loop response to sensed glucose, and the shape of the insulin delivery is adaptable and appropriate to the food eaten and the body's present metabolic capability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{need for}} {{instrumentation}} grew with {{the rapidly growing}} central electric power stations after the First World War. [...] Instrumentation was also important for heat treating ovens, chemical plants and refineries. [...] Common instrumentation was for measuring temperature, pressure or flow. [...] Readings were typically recorded on circle charts or strip charts. [...] Until the 1930s control was typically [...] "open loop", meaning {{that it did not}} use feedback. [...] Operators made various adjustments by such means as turning handles on valves. [...] If done from a control room a message could be sent to an operator in the plant by color coded light, letting him know whether to increase or decrease whatever was being controlled. [...] The signal lights were operated by a switchboard, which soon became automated. [...] Automatic control became possible with the feedback controller, which sensed the measured variable, measured the deviation from the setpoint and perhaps the rate of change and time weighted amount of deviation, compared that with the setpoint and automatically applied a calculated adjustment. [...] A stand-alone controller may use a combination of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electronic analogs to manipulate the controlled device. [...] The tendency was to use <b>electronic</b> <b>controls</b> after these were developed, but today the tendency is to use a computer to replace individual controllers.|$|E
