5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|The play is a {{statement}} {{on the idea that}} a man is valued by his position in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end and Miller uses Loman to make his point against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E
5|$|Most of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MIn tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MXn of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. potassium and calcium) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. silver) are the lowest of that element. In particular, silver iodide is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.|$|E

25|$|The Western High Plateau lies {{along the}} Cameroon line, {{a series of}} {{volcanic}} swells running from the Atlantic Ocean in the southwestern part of the plateau to the Adamawa Plateau in the northeast. The region is characterised by accidented relief of massifs and mountains. The Western High Plateau features several dormant volcanoes, including the Bamboutos Mountains, Mount Oku and Mount Kupe. The plateau rises in steps from the west. To the east, it terminates in mountains that range from 1,000 metres to 2,500 metres in height, terminating in the South Cameroon Plateau. The plateau <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Adamawa Plateau to the northeast, which is a larger but less accidented region.|$|E

25|$|Many {{species are}} ‘half-barks’ or ‘blackbutts’ {{in which the}} dead bark is {{retained}} in {{the lower half of}} the trunks or stems — for example, E. brachycalyx, E. ochrophloia, and E. occidentalis — or only in a thick, black accumulation at the base, as in E. clelandii. In some species in this category, for example E. youngiana and E. viminalis, the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top, where it <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smooth upper stems. The smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest, for example E. deglupta.|$|E
25|$|Cougars {{generally}} {{give the}} bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears.

When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet {{stay out of}} its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills. There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death.|$|E

To the south the border runs along Ashbourne Road from the A38 to Markeaton Lane until it meets Markeaton brook, which it follows. It then runs along Kedleston Road which it leaves and goes behind Woodlands Community School and Laburnum Crescent and finishes at Allestree Park.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one might call it atonality in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E
25|$|Sambalpur lies on {{the bank}} of the river Mahanadi. The river flows to the west of the city and {{separates}} Burla from Sambalpur and Hirakud. The Hirakud Dam lies upstream of Sambalpur. Budharaja is a small reserve forest located within the city. Sambalpur experiences an extreme type of climate with hot and dry summers followed by humid monsoons and cold winters. The hot season commences from the first week of March and lasts until the second half of June. In May, the temperature rises to 47°. In December, the temperature comes down to 5°C. Sambalpur gets rainfall from the south western monsoon. The most pleasant months in Sambalpur are from October to February, during which time the humidity and heat are at their lowest. During this period, temperatures during the day stay below 30°C (86°F) and drop to about 20°C (68°F) at night. This season is followed by a hot summer, from March to May. The summer <b>gives</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monsoon season. Since 1982 as per the data available with District Emergency section, Sambalpur, there has not been a single occurrence of cyclone in Sambalpur. There are possibilities of strong winds with the speed of 53km/ph before the onset of monsoon.|$|E
