Twenty-four pregnant Hanwoo heifers, averaging 438 ± 27. 8 kg in weight, 21 months in age, and 194 ± 8. 5 days in pregnancy, were involved in a two-month (eight weeks) experiment. The heifers were randomly assigned to either the single housing group (SG; one individual per pen, n = 12), or the paired housing group (PG; two individuals per pen, n = 12). All pens were of the same size (5 × 5 m) and provided with one <b>feed</b> <b>bin,</b> which automatically recorded the individual feed intake and eating behavior. As the experiment began, the diet of the heifers was switched from a total mixed ration (TMR; 250 g/kg ryegrass straw and 750 g/kg concentrate mix) to a forage-only diet (mixed hay cubes composed of 500 g/kg alfalfa, 250 g/kg timothy, and 250 g/kg blue grass hay). The heifers were fed ad libitum twice a day. The individual feed intake and eating behavior were recorded daily throughout the experiment, and body weights (BWs) were measured every four weeks before the morning feeding. PG animals visited the <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> 22 % less often than SG. PG, however, stayed 39 % longer in the <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> and consumed 40 % more feed per visit, compared with SG. Consequently, PG heifers spent 23 % more time in eating and had 16 % more daily dry matter intake than SG during the experiment. Average daily gain during the experimental period tended to be greater in PG than in SG. When pregnant Hanwoo heifers encountered a novel diet, social relationships (i. e., presence of a pen-mate) enhanced their time spent eating and feed intake.

40|$|Maize dried {{distillers}} grains with solubles (DDGS) is {{a valuable}} ingredient in the swine industry but when incorporated into diets at high levels (40 %) poor flowability of the feed often results. Researchers have investigated the physical properties of DDGS and use of anti-caking agents to determine their influence on flowability but few studies have evaluated effects of feed storage structures on flowability. Thus, two experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> design and passive agitator use on flowability of a commercial swine finishing diet containing 40 % DDGS. Six bins of three different designs were used, which included: a galvanized steel, seamless bin with a 60 ° cone (Steel 60; Dealers Livestock, Glenwood, Minn.); a galvanized, corrugated steel bin with a 67 ° cone (Steel 67; PigTek, Milford, Ind.); and a white, polyethylene bin with a 60 ° cone (Poly 60; Prairie Pride, Winnipeg, MB). In Experiment 1, rate of feed flow from each bin was assessed on days 3, 7, and 21 post-feed delivery. Feed flow from Poly 60 (736. 8 kg/min) was faster than Steel 60 (602. 9 kg/min), with Steel 67 having intermediate flow (663. 3 kg/min). In Experiment 2, passive feed flow agitators (Sure Flo Agitator, Farmer Boy Ag Supply, Myerstown, Pa.) were installed in one bin of each design. Feed flow was evaluated on days 2, 3, 6, 7, 20, and 21 post-feed delivery. Feed flow from Poly 60 (900. 7 kg/min) was greater than flow from either Steel 60 (826. 7 kg/min) or Steel 67 (843. 8 kg/min). The passive agitator increased flow in Poly 60 (970. 0 vs. 831. 4 kg/min), tended to improve feed flow in Steel 67 (880. 2 vs. 807. 4 kg/min), but had no effect in Steel 60 (826. 8 vs. 826. 7 kg/min).

40|$|Motivation {{to explore}} is {{believed}} to be widespread among animals, but exploratory behaviour varies within populations. Offering variety in feed is one simple way of allowing intensively housed dairy cattle to express exploratory foraging behaviour. Individuals’ exploration of different feed types, as with other new stimuli, likely reflects a balance between exploratory motivation and fear of novelty. We tested the degree to which Holstein heifers (n= 10) preferred variety in feed vs. a constant, high quality mixed ration, by first providing varying types of forages and then varying flavours of mixed feed. We also investigated individual differences in exploratory behaviour by measuring switching between <b>feed</b> <b>bins.</b> Individual consistency in preferences was assessed between tests, and longer-term consistency was evaluated by comparing these results with behaviour in novel object and novel feed tests before weaning. On average, the heifers preferred the constant, familiar feed (spending on average just 20 % of their time at varied <b>feed</b> <b>bins),</b> but this preference varied among individuals (from 0 to 46 % of time eating in the forage trial, and 0 to 93 % in the flavour trial). Preference for varied forages correlated positively with intake of novel feed as calves (rs= 0. 72, n= 9). Preference for varied flavours showed a negative correlation with latency to approach a novel object (rs=- 0. 65). It thus appears that preference for variety and exploratory foraging behaviour reflect consistent personality traits. These results suggest that offering novel feeds on a rotating schedule as a supplement to the regular diet may be an effective form of enrichment for at least some individuals within a herd...|$|R

40|$|The breath methane {{concentration}} method {{uses the}} methane {{concentrations in the}} cow's breath during <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> visits {{as a proxy for}} the methane production rate. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the uncertainty of a breath methane concentration method in a feeder and its capability to measure and rank cows' methane production. A range of controlled methane fluxes from a so-called artificial reference cow were dosed in a <b>feed</b> <b>bin,</b> and its exhaled air was sampled by a tube inside the feeder and analyzed. The artificial reference cow simulates the lungs, respiratory tract, and rumen of a cow and releases a variable methane flux to generate a concentration pattern in the exhaled breath that closely resembles a real cow's pattern. The strength of the relation between the controlled methane release rates of the artificial reference cow and the measured methane concentrations was analyzed by linear regression, using the coefficient of determination (R 2) and the residual standard error as performance indicators. The effect of error sources (source-sampling distance, air turbulence, and cow's head movement) on this relation was experimentally investigated, both under laboratory and barn conditions. From the laboratory to the dairy barn at the 30 -cm sampling distance, the R 2 -value decreased from 0. 97 to 0. 37 and the residual standard error increased from 75 to 86 ppm as a result of barn air turbulence, the latter increasing to a theoretical 94 ppm if modeled variability due to cow's head movement was accounted for as well. In practice, the effect of these random errors can be compensated by sampling strategies including repeated measurements on each cow over time, thus increasing the distinctive power between cows. However, systematic errors that may disturb the relation between concentration and production rate, such as cow variation in air exhalation rate and air flow patterns around sampling locations that differ between barns, cannot be compensated by repeated measurements. As a result, the methane concentrations of breath air will vary between cows with the same methane production. We conclude that the capability of the breath concentration measurement method to adequately measure and rank methane production rates among cows is highly uncertain and requires further investigation into variation sources with a systematic nature...|$|E

Journal of Animal Science, 94, 78 - 78. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 166 Two experiments were conducted at a commercial feed mill and 6 commercial wean to finish pig sites {{to determine the}} effects of feed truck unloading auger RPM on pellet quality and unloading time, and the effects of feed line location on pellet quality and nutrient concentration of intact pellets and their fines. In Exp. 1, pelleted feed was unloaded using 3 speeds (900, 1150, and 1400 RPM) from each of 8 compartments of a feed truck (Walinga Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada). Six samples per compartment were collected creating 16 replications/unloading speed. There was an unloading speed × trailer compartment interaction (P = 0. 031; SEM = 17. 4). The difference in unloading time from the front to rear compartment was greatest at the slowest unloading speed and similar at the 2 highest unloading speeds (70 vs. 35 and 37 s). The percentage of fines formed during unloading was not influenced by unloading speed, but tended to increase (quadratic; P = 0. 081; SEM = 2. 27) from the front (8. 2 %) to the rear compartment (10. 7 %). In Exp. 2, pelleted feed samples were collected during unloading into a commercial <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> at 6 finishing pig sites with 2 feed lines, resulting in 12 replications per feed line location. Samples were collected from the feed line at 6, 35, and 76 m from the <b>feed</b> <b>bin.</b> There were no interactions between feed line location and nutrient profile of the fines and pellets. There was no effect of feed line location on pellet durability index, percentage fines, percentage fines formed, or the nutrient profile of pellets or fines. Across locations, fines had decreased (P < 0. 05) CP (12. 4 vs. 15. 3 %; SEM = 0. 14) and P (0. 37 vs. 0. 40 %; SEM = 0. 006), but greater (P < 0. 05) ADF (3. 7 vs. 3. 2 %; SEM = 0. 24), crude fiber (2. 7 vs. 2. 2 %; SEM = 0. 09), Ca (0. 47 vs. 0. 44 %; SEM = 0. 012), ether extract (6. 2 vs. 5. 2 %; SEM = 0. 11), and starch (47. 4 vs. 44. 7 %; SEM = 0. 42) for the fines and pellets, respectively. In conclusion, the front compartments closer to the truck cab resulted in fewer fines formed from loading to unloading. Decreasing unloading speed significantly increased the amount of time taken to unload a feed truck but did not alter fines formed. Feeder distance from the bin did not influence fines formation. There were significant differences in nutrient profile between fines and pellets. Understanding the location of fines creation during the feed delivery process may allow for alternative methods to reduce the formation of fines and subsequent nutrient segregation...|$|E
30|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> {{vibrating}} feeder controls the feed rate to the separating table. As ROM coal is {{introduced to the}} separation zone, a thick bed of particles forms on the vibrating deck. The heavier or high-density particles transport through the bed, comes {{in contact with the}} deck, and move toward the back plate {{under the influence of the}} inertia force generated due to deck vibration. Particles when strike the back plate, they move inward and upward in the direction of the discharge side of the table. During operation, lighter or low-density particles float on the top of the bed as they are pushed up at the back plate, and flow to the discharge point. As such, the lighter particles create an upper layer that is collected alongside the deck length. Particles of sufficient high-density sinks through the autogenous medium formed due to the bed of particles fluidized due to constant air-flow, and report back to the deck surface. These high-density particles are then forced by both vibration and the continuous influx of new feed material to transport in a helical pattern at the narrow end of the deck where the final reject is collected. Two or three products are collected from the front side of the table. For pilot-scale evaluation, a 5 -tph air-table deshaling unit utilizing a 1  m 2 air table was tested at three different test sites in India. An immanent advantage of this technology is that it is a dry separator, which delivers a dry product without incurring any dewatering costs.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis {{is a serious}} and economically important disease of cattle. Badgers have been implicated in the transmission and maintenance of the disease in the UK since the 1970 s. Recent studies have provided substantial evidence of widespread and frequent visits by badgers to farm buildings during which there {{is the potential for}} close direct contact with cattle and contamination of cattle feed. METHODOLOGY: Here we evaluated the effectiveness of simple exclusion measures in improving farm biosecurity and preventing badger visits to farm buildings. In {{the first phase of the}} study, 32 farms were surveyed using motion-triggered infrared cameras on potential entrances to farm buildings to determine the background level of badger visits experienced by each farm. In the second phase, they were divided into four treatment groups; "Control", "Feed Storage", "Cattle Housing" and "Both", whereby no exclusion measures were installed, exclusion measures were installed on feed storage areas only, cattle housing only or both feed storage and cattle housing, respectively. Badger exclusion measures included sheet metal gates, adjustable metal panels for gates, sheet metal fencing, <b>feed</b> <b>bins</b> and electric fencing. Cameras were deployed for at least 365 nights in each phase on each farm. RESULTS: Badger visits to farm buildings occurred on 19 of the 32 farms in phase one. In phase two, the simple exclusion measures were 100 % effective in preventing badger entry into farm buildings, as long as they were appropriately deployed. Furthermore, the installation of exclusion measures also reduced the level of badger visits to the rest of the farmyard. The findings of the present study clearly demonstrate how relatively simple practical measures can substantially reduce the likelihood of badger visits to buildings and reduce some of the potential for contact and disease transmission between badgers and cattle...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} diurnal methane (CH 4) emission dynamics of grazing cattle and highlight {{their relationships with}} biotic {{factors such as the}} feeding behaviour as well as seasonal changes in pasture characteristics. Existing methods to assess grazing ruminants’ daily CH 4 emissions provide useful insights to investigate mitigation strategies relying on feeding and genetic selection. Nonetheless such methods based on tracer gases (SF 6) or <b>feeding</b> <b>bins</b> equipped with sniffers (e. g. GreenFeed) can hardly cover diurnal CH 4 emission fluctuations which can influence the accuracy of total CH 4 production estimations. Previous studies in barns showed that emission dynamics strongly vary during post feeding time, leading to a possible bias in estimates of daily CH 4 emissions as high as 100 %. To investigate whether such fluctuations are also taking place on pasture, a portable device was designed with infrared CH 4 and CO 2 sensors measuring concentrations in the exhaled air at a high sampling rate (4 Hz). Six grazing dry red-pied cows were equipped with the device and motion sensors during runs of 24 h to monitor CH 4 and CO 2 emissions and detect their feeding behaviours (grazing, rumination and other behaviours), respectively. This experiment was performed in summer and fall in order to cover seasonal changes in pasture forage quality. Methane emission was estimated from the CH 4 :CO 2 concentration ratio and the metabolic CO 2 production of the cows. As for barn studies, variations were observed in total daily CH 4 emission due to the seasons and diurnal variations were also observed due to animal behaviours. Relationships between animal feeding behaviour and CH 4 emissions patterns on pasture were also unravelled. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to describe the feed sorting, feeding behavior, and feed intake of cows consuming a close-up ration and to determine if these behaviors are affected by competition {{for access to the}} feed bunk. Thirty-six dry Holstein cows, consuming a close-up total mixed ration diet, were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: 1) noncompetitive (1 cow/feed bin) or 2) competitive (2 cows/feed bin). Dry matter intake, feed-ing behavior, and sorting behavior were monitored for each <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> on 4 separate days during wk 2 and 3 before the anticipated calving dates of the cows. Fresh feed and orts were sampled daily from each bin and were subjected to particle size analysis. The particle size separator consisted of 3 screens (18, 9, and 1. 18 mm) and a bottom pan resulting in 4 fractions (long, medium, short, and fine). Sorting was calculated as the actual intake of each particle size fraction expressed {{as a percentage of the}} predicted intake of that fraction. Regardless of treatment, the cows sorted against long particles and for short and fine particles. Competition at the feed bunk had no effect on the sorting behavior, dry matter intake, or feeding time of the cows, but did dramatically increase the feeding rate of the cows. The competitively fed cows also had fewer meals per day, and tended to have larger and longermeals. Our results suggest that increased competition at the feed bunk promotes feeding behavior patterns that will likely in-crease the between-cow variation in composition of total mixed ration consumed. Key words: competition, sorting, dry co...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInvestigations were {{undertaken}} to identify causes for {{the occurrence of}} high levels of the zootechnical feed additive nicarbazin in broiler liver at slaughter. The first investigation on 32 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for nicarbazin (as dinitrocarbanilide, DNC) in liver from birds during a 3 - 10 day period after withdrawal of nicarbazin from their feed and prior to commercial slaughter. DNC residues in liver samples of broilers scheduled as being withdrawn from nicarbazin for ≥ 6 days ranged from 20 to > 1600 μg/kg (the specified withdrawal period for nicarbazin is 5 days and the JECFA MRL is 200 μg/kg liver). Further on-farm investigations on 12 of these flocks, {{selected on the basis}} of the feeding system in use and the levels of DNC residues determined in liver, identified issues in feed management contributing to elevated residues in broiler liver. A significant correlation (0. 81, p < 0. 01, n = 10) between DNC residues in liver samples and in feed samples from the feeding pans was observed. The second investigation on 12 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for DNC in liver samples and feed samples from feeding pans and from the feed mill at the three thinnings of birds for commercial slaughter. In the case of one flock, a clear relationship between nicarbazin in feed from the feed mill (10. 5 mg/kg DNC), in feed from the feeding pans (6. 6 mg/kg DNC) and in liver (583 μg/kg DNC) at first thinning (9 days scheduled withdrawal from nicarbazin) was observed. Such a clear relationship was not observed in other cases, particularly at second and third thinnings, pointing to re-exposure of birds to nicarbazin late in the flock production cycle, probably from the litter. Guidelines outlining best farm practice to eliminate nicarbazin residues in poultry have been published in booklet and poster format for broiler producers and deal with feed system cleaning, <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> management, feed deliveries, feed usage and records...|$|E
40|$|Biosecurity {{protocols}} {{reduce the}} introduction and spread of pathogens among swine farms. For pigs, biosecurity ensures market stability, maintains export opportunities, and controls spread {{of production and}} public health diseases. Salmonella, {{the second most common}} cause of bacterial foodborne illness, causes gastrointestinal illness. Pigs can be asymptomatic carriers of the bacteria and pork products are a known source of salmonellosis in humans. Salmonella have been isolated from pigs, boots, flies, rodents, bird feces, feed, feed-ingredients, and feed trucks. Objective: to identify management factors {{to reduce the risk of}} disease spread among swine farms through feed trucks. Methods: Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted with managers, dispatchers and drivers of feed companies and swine producers. Participants rated the factors for economic and logistical feasibility and likelihood of reducing disease spread. Highly rated factors were used in a field trial. In total, 40 drivers from 3 companies, delivering feed to 2202 farms over 6 weeks (in the winter) collected descriptive data on the factors and compared use of different boots. Farm factors (prevalence) were: keeping areas (driveway, <b>feed</b> <b>bin</b> and barnyard) clean of mud and manure (82 %), and dead-stock (91 %); having an outbuilding to deliver bagged feed (24 %); providing farm boots and coveralls for the driver; ordering the correct amount of feed; and notifying feed mill of a disease outbreak. Feed truck driver factors included wearing new clean, disinfected, dried boots (25 %) and gloves (50 %) at each farm; remaining outside the barn (92 %); washing the steering wheel (49 %), floor mat (77 %) and outside of the truck (32 %) every 24 hours; following farm protocols; and leaving feed bill outside barn (54 %). Drivers given disinfected rubber boots were more likely to wear these on farms (42 %) than plastic disposable boots (4 %) (P< 0. 05). Biosecurity is a responsibility that is shared among all members of the industry. Feed personnel were encouraged to know more about disease transmission...|$|E

40|$|Measuring and {{mitigating}} methane (CH 4) {{emissions from}} livestock is of increasing {{importance for the}} environment and for policy making. Potentially, the most sustainable way of reducing enteric CH 4 emission from ruminants is through the estimation of genomic breeding values to facilitate genetic selection. There is potential for adopting genetic selection {{and in the future}} genomic selection, for reduced CH 4 emissions from ruminants. From this review it has been observed that both CH 4 emissions and production (g/day) are a heritable and repeatable trait. CH 4 emissions are strongly related to feed intake both in the short term (minutes to several hours) and over the medium term (days). When measured over the medium term, CH 4 yield (MY, g CH 4 /kg dry matter intake) is a heritable and repeatable trait albeit with less genetic variation than for CH 4 emissions. CH 4 emissions of individual animals are moderately repeatable across diets, and across feeding levels, when measured in respiration chambers. Repeatability is lower when short term measurements are used, possibly due to variation in time and amount of feed ingested prior to the measurement. However, while repeated measurements add value; it is preferable the measures be separated by at least 3 to 14 days. This temporal separation of measurements needs to be investigated further. Given the above issue can be resolved, short term (over minutes to hours) measurements of CH 4 emissions show promise, especially on systems where animals are fed ad libitum and frequency of meals is high. However, we believe that for short-term measurements to be useful for genetic evaluation, a number (between 3 and 20) of measurements will be required {{over an extended period of}} time (weeks to months). There are opportunities for using short-term measurements in standardised feeding situations such as breath ‘sniffers’ attached to milking parlours or total mixed ration <b>feeding</b> <b>bins,</b> to measure CH 4. Genomic selection has the potential to reduce both CH 4 emissions and MY, but measurements on thousands of individuals will be required. This includes the need for combined resources across countries in an international effort, emphasising the need to acknowledge the impact of animal and production systems on measurement of the CH 4 trait during design of experiments...|$|R
