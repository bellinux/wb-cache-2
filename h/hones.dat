25|$|Honing theory, {{developed}} principally by psychologist Liane Gabora, {{posits that}} creativity arises {{due to the}} self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is {{a way in which}} the individual <b>hones</b> (and re-hones) an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creative process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of differently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge.|$|E

It was likely in this medieval period that the tomb was heavily destroyed, evidenced by medieval material found in some of the pits created by those damaging the chamber and barrow. The destruction was carried out in a systematic manner. Initially, the barrow around the chamber was dug away, and an entrance into it was forced through the drystone wall at the north-western end. The chamber was then cleared down to the bedrock, with the spoil and contents of the chamber dumped behind the diggers. The medial stone of the chamber was pushed over on to the spoil heap, and covered over with soil. A pit was dug in the centre of the chamber, and against its walls from the outside; the central pit was then ceiled by the collapsing capstones. Finally, several more pits were then dug around the façade stones. Subsequently, the chamber collapsed, with a number of stones breaking on the impact of the fall. At some point after they had fallen, the inner pair of the chamber's tall-stones were further damaged, likely in a process involving heating them with fire and then casting cold water onto them, resulting in breakage.|$|E

However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi. Following a brief encounter with Tobi, the Akatsuki's true leader, Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi's army. As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces, Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight against Tobi. During the encounter, Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito, who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed horrible deeds since Rin's death to destroy the world order that allowed their friend's demise to occur with Kakashi being left greatly stunned and also horrified at Obito's actions. Despite the guilt for what Obito has become, Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi managing to impale Obito. When Naruto is nearly killed by Madara, Kakashi and a redeemed Obito joined forces to protect Naruto by spiriting him off into the latter's dimension to be healed.

50|$|The {{limitation}} on geometric accuracy is overcome in <b>honing</b> because the <b>honing</b> stone follows a complex path. In bore <b>honing</b> for example, the stone moves along two paths simultaneously. The stones are pressed radially outward {{to enlarge the}} hole while they simultaneously oscillate axially. Due to the oscillation, each slice of the <b>honing</b> stones touch a large area of the workpiece. Therefore, imperfections in the <b>honing</b> stone's profile cannot transfer to the bore. Instead both the bore and the <b>honing</b> stones conform to the average shape of the <b>honing</b> stones' motion, which {{in the case of}} bore <b>honing</b> is a cylinder. This averaging effect occurs in all <b>honing</b> processes; both the workpiece and stones erode until they conform to the average shape of the stones' cutting surface. Since the <b>honing</b> stones tend to erode towards a desired geometric shape, {{there is no need to}} true them. As a result of the averaging effect, the accuracy of a <b>honed</b> component often exceeds the accuracy of the machine tool that created it.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, <b>honed</b> parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of <b>honing</b> technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke <b>honing</b> process the tool, equipped with one or several abrasive <b>honing</b> stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the radial feed movement of the <b>honing</b> stone. This feed movement is one of the decisive factors for the results of the <b>honing</b> process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled <b>honing,</b> the position of the <b>honing</b> stone is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled <b>honing</b> the force of the <b>honing</b> stone {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the <b>honing</b> machine. A required force value is given and, if necessary, the <b>honing</b> stone is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the <b>honing</b> process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the <b>honing</b> process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts <b>honed</b> with the two different feeding strategies for the <b>honing</b> stone, force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters. In addition to the forces and moments measured during the <b>honing</b> process, the quality parameters of the <b>honed</b> parts have also been analyzed and compared...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHoning is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} that can produce very exact results regarding geometry, form and surface quality of the <b>honed</b> work piece. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready-made bores and has to meet high demands regarding process stability and repeatability. As it can create a high ratio of bearing contact area to total area together with a high surface quality it is often used for highly stressed parts. During the process, the <b>honing</b> tool combines three movement components: a rotation around the tool axis, an oscillation along the tool axis and a radial feeding movement of the <b>honing</b> stone. The interface between <b>honing</b> stone and workpiece {{and the movement of}} the <b>honing</b> stone are very important for the process. Nowadays, there are two different control strategies for the feeding movement of the <b>honing</b> stone: feed-controlled and force-controlled <b>honing.</b> While force- controlled <b>honing</b> tries to keep a constant process force, feed-controlled <b>honing</b> feeds the <b>honing</b> stone in certain steps in certain time intervals.
