We define contribution cycles as the number of contributors a player waits for before committing to a <b>further</b> <b>contribution,</b> <b>and</b> use a permutation test on contribution cycles to assign a measure of conditional cooperation to each group play. The validity of the measures is tested in an experiment. We find that roughly 20 % of the plays exhibit dynamics of conditional cooperation.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the relationship between work and family and how it affects satisfaction at work. The study involved a web-based questionnaire and 116 female and male workers participated in the study, all college and university employees. Differences between men and women in how they experience work and family as well as satisfaction at work, were examined. Also, significance of values regarding work and family and the experience of social support was investigated. Aspects such as age, education and free time were also seen in relation to the family-work experience. Few hypotheses were confirmed as findings indicated few gender differences. The results showed support to both expansionist theory and the scarcity hypotheses, as family and work interference was considerably more prevalent for those having children. <b>Further,</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> limitations to the study, as well as future suggestions are presented. </p...|$|R

40|$|Whistle-blowing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects in the fight against corruption. In most cases, it is impossible to commit a corrupt deed without at least one other person being involved in, or, knowing about it. Many businesses and public entities have a ‘crime lines’ in place to facilitate whistle-blowing but these facilities are mostly limited to a particular telephone number. Using a telephone to report corruption has inherent problems when anonymity is required. Organisations can easily trace calls made from their facilities. Even calls made from cellular phones can be traced. Eavesdropping, although illegal, is not technically difficult to achieve. The fact is: Telephonic whistle-blowing provides little protection for the whistle-blower who wants to remain anonymous. This paper focuses on the problem of current ways for whistle-blowing and suggests an improvement conceptually. It aims to open up debate and discussion on this topic with the intention to attract <b>further</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> stimulate research on this topic. Although the paper focuses strongly on the situation in South Africa, it is probably equally applicable anywhere else in the world.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{selection}} of responses to the report Fashion Victims, published by War on Want in December 2006. It offers a range of viewpoints presented by members of the Editorial Advisory Board of CPOIB. These are presented in chronological order of submission. There is some cross-reference by contributors to the work of others, but no attempt is made to present a unified argument. Design/methodology/approach – Presents the full contributions of involved participants, without mediation or editorial change. Findings – A number of different perspectives are presented on the central issue that is summarised by the opening heading in War on Want’s report – “How cheap is too cheap?” It is seen that the answer to this question is very much dependent upon the standpoint of the respondent. Originality/value – In presenting this form of commentary, members of the CPOIB Editorial Board seek to stimulate debate about an issue of concern to contemporary society, without resort to the time delay and mediating processes of peer-review normally attached to academic writing. It is hoped that this discussion will provoke <b>further</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> a widening of the debate.

40|$|Although it {{is perhaps}} the most {{prominent}} interdisciplinary theme to have emerged in the past decades, in the domain of planning studies the prevention of technological risks has only recently started the pathway towards a rigorous theoretical definition (Boholm and Lofsted 2004; Hayden Lesbirel and Shaw 2005; Schmidt-Thomé 2006). This article is a <b>further</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> tries to delimit the shared area of investigation among risk theories, planning theories and ethical inquiry. In particular it discusses the matter of accounting technological risk, and its counterpart safety, as an explicit spatial design factor; this, not only in relation to the immediate context of risk-bearing installations but rather in relation to the overall distribution of risks in society. This latter consideration relates to the inherently normative nature of the practice of risk prevention, whose moral implications cannot be limited to the site-specific context of hazards; it is in fact the overall risk distribution in society, taking place through planning instruments, that needs to be considered. This article is part of a series of writings that aim at promoting a debate on what theoretical perspectives different disciplinary domains can contribute with in order to elaborate a solid and consistent planning discourse on technological risks. As such it constitutes a contribution to the streams of research of the referenced sociology, planning, risk and ethics scholars...|$|R

40|$|Jürgen Moltmann’s {{desire to}} see the {{relationship}} between humans and our natural environment improve is long-standing. In later years {{he called for a}} ‘new theological architecture’ to help facilitate an ‘ecological reformation’ of Christianity and society. While Moltmann did not claim to have created this new architecture, one of his work’s aims has clearly been to contribute towards it. To what extent has Moltmann been successful in this aim? Firstly, his doctrine of the Trinity provides the themes of love and relatedness which pervade and colour his whole project. These themes then interact with other key areas of Moltmann’s thought that inform this architecture: creation, God’s ongoing care and openness towards creation (largely pneumatology and christology), and eschatology. Each of these areas contribute to a theological architecture in which non-human creation, past, present, and future, is a full recipient of God’s uniting love and openness. Naturally this leads towards a consideration of the ecological reformation. Less positively, Moltmann’s discussion of God’s creating through self-restriction presents some problems for this architecture’s coherence, although Moltmann’s developing views on this do help provide a solution. Furthermore, analysis of the criticisms made by various commentators suggests that several debated areas are actually particularly productive for Moltmann’s contributions to the architecture. Other criticisms do highlight areas of concern and possible development, but do not present terminal problems. The potential for this architecture to address practice, not simply theory, increases through elements of Moltmann’s theological anthropology that challenge humanity’s behaviour. Those elements thus form a lens through which Moltmann’s wider contributions to the architecture more powerfully speak of the need for creation care. Therefore, while Moltmann’s contribution towards a new architecture for ecological reformation would be helped by certain modifications, nevertheless it is highly significant. Its wide scope makes it fertile for <b>further</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> development...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{contribution}} the GATT has {{made to the}} world economy since 1948, substantial scope remains for <b>further</b> <b>contributions</b> from <b>and</b> adaptations by its successor since 1995, the World Trade Organization. After first reviewing why the world needs the WTO, this paper examines the main challenges confronting the organization {{as we approach the}} new millennium, and assesses the WTO's potential to address each of these issues. They include completing the integration of agriculture and textiles and clothing into the mainstream of the GATT, and coping with the WTO’s much-expanded roles in monitoring compliance and settling disputes. The Uruguay Round certainly did not handle all the key issues confronting the international trading system, and new challenges have since arisen. Thus, as well as digesting the latest agreements, the WTO needs to address such issues as the calls to use the WTO and its dispute settlement procedures for issues only peripherally related to trade (environment, labour, human rights more generally), the continuing growth of regional trading arrangements, the rapidly expanding importance of foreign investment and competition policy, the surge in applications from (especially forme...|$|R

40|$|Background The Environment Ontology (ENVO; [URL] first {{described}} in 2013, is a resource and research {{target for the}} semantically controlled description of environmental entities. The ontology's initial aim was {{the representation of the}} biomes, environmental features, and environmental materials pertinent to genomic and microbiome-related investigations. However, the need for environmental semantics is common to a multitude of fields, and ENVO's use has steadily grown since its initial description. We have thus expanded, enhanced, and generalised the ontology to support its increasingly diverse applications. Methods We have updated our development suite to promote expressivity, consistency, and speed: we now develop ENVO in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and employ templating methods to accelerate class creation. We have also taken steps to better align ENVO with the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry principles and interoperate with existing OBO ontologies. Further, we applied text-mining approaches to extract habitat information from the Encyclopedia of Life and automatically create experimental habitat classes within ENVO. Results Relative to its state in 2013, ENVO's content, scope, and implementation have been enhanced and much of its existing content revised for improved semantic representation. ENVO now offers representations of habitats, environmental processes, anthropogenic environments, and entities relevant to environmental health initiatives and the global Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030. Several branches of ENVO have been used to incubate and seed new ontologies in previously unrepresented domains such as food and agronomy. The current release version of the ontology, in OWL format, is available at [URL] Conclusions ENVO has been shaped into an ontology which bridges multiple domains including biomedicine, natural and anthropogenic ecology, ‘omics, and socioeconomic development. Through continued interactions with our users and partners, particularly those performing data archiving and sythesis, we anticipate that ENVO’s growth will accelerate in 2017. As always, we invite <b>further</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> collaboration to advance the semantic representation of the environment, ranging from geographic features and environmental materials, across habitats and ecosystems, to everyday objects in household settings...|$|R
