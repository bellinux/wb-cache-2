5|$|The NAIT 5si is the {{entry-level}} NAIT and {{the direct}} {{replacement of the}} NAIT 5i (with italic 'i'); the NAIT XS 2 is positioned as the mid-range product. The SUPERNAIT 2, the flagship integrated amplifier in the Naim stable individually decoupled inputs and no digital circuitry. Both incorporate a <b>headphone</b> output via a class-A <b>headphone</b> amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the <b>headphone</b> jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the <b>headphone</b> wire from draping across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} no speaker audio for {{services}} like web radio even though the speaker works fine when used as a telephone. This error {{may be due to}} a malfunctioning switch sensing the <b>headphone</b> plug and different handling of this information by different apps.|$|E
50|$|Bose Corporation {{produces}} <b>headphones</b> for consumer, aviation {{and military}} use.

25|$|<b>Headphones</b> are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance <b>headphones</b> {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and high-impedance <b>headphones</b> are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of <b>headphones</b> increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the <b>headphones</b> for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer <b>headphones</b> has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in <b>headphones</b> that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Headphone</b> Masterpiece is {{the debut}} album by American {{recording}} artist Cody Chesnutt. He recorded the album {{in his home}} bedroom with a 4-track recorder and played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an organ. A 36-song double album, The <b>Headphone</b> Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{redesigned}} MacBook {{line was}} launched on March 9, 2015. Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional MagSafe charging port (along {{with all other}} ports, except the <b>headphone</b> jack) {{in favor of the}} multi-purpose USB-C port. It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option.|$|E
5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The <b>Headphone</b> Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{performed}} at 3 junior and 2 senior {{high schools in}} Kagawa Prefecture, in order to carify the use of <b>headphones</b> {{and the possibility of}} auditory damage due to <b>headphones.</b> Out of 2, 217 students, 46. 1 % used “headphones”, including earphones and so-called Walkman-type <b>headphones.</b> Most of them used the <b>headphones</b> to listen to music. There was {{a significant difference in the}} incidence of cochlear symptoms between <b>headphones</b> users and non-users. In junior high school students, the incidence of cochlear symptoms was higher in those who had used <b>headphones</b> for more than four years and in those who used <b>headphones</b> for more than two hours per day. The extent of use correlated with the incidence of cochlear symptoms and the results indicate the possibility that acoustic injury could be caused by <b>headphones...</b>|$|R

30|$|MR <b>headphones</b> are {{of value}} in MRI {{scanning}} due to their noise-suppressing and communication-enhancing capabilities. Currently, the influence of <b>headphones</b> on PET attenuation is not accounted for in PET image reconstruction. Therefore, the use of <b>headphones</b> is not approved by the manufacturer for PET image acquisition of the head. However, the <b>headphones</b> may otherwise be of help in whole-body scans, thus justifying their delivery with current PET/MR systems.|$|R
25|$|The {{impedance}} of <b>headphones</b> is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of <b>headphones</b> is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance <b>headphones</b> presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the <b>headphones</b> it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the <b>headphones,</b> significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance <b>headphones</b> will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance <b>headphones</b> will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|R
