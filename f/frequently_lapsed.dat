In Nevada, she meets James Hanson, and immediately realizes that Hanson is also transgender, but doesn't realize it yet. The two travel to Reno together.

5000|$|After his {{attempted}} suicide, Walker {{was examined}} by a psychiatric board, which delivered its report in April 1949. The examining board reported that Walker was agitated by fear of his impending death and was [...] "negativistic, mute, fearful, and unresponsive and possibly reacting to hallucinations", <b>frequently</b> <b>lapsing</b> into semi-unconsciousness. The psychiatrists determined Walker [...] "does {{not know the}} difference between right and wrong", thus making him insane under the legal standard of the day and ineligible for execution.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to the {{creative}} abundance of earlier compositions, {{the music of}} Liszt's old age is unusually economic. Given barely enough notes to ensure their existence, his late pieces <b>frequently</b> <b>lapse</b> into monody, then silence. Sometimes a piece is open-ended, simply vanishing. This practice of [...] "abandoning" [...] a work in mid-air had been done previously by Frédéric Chopin and Robert Schumann. Liszt's practice, however, is more radical. An {{example of this is}} in the Mephisto Polka, where the piece is simply deserted at the end, without explanation, dying out on a solitary F-natural. Long passages are spun out on single notes and definite cadences are usually avoided, often leaving the overall tonality of pieces in doubt. A basic rhythmic unit, instead of becoming the foundation of an expansive Romantic melody, now becomes a stark end-product in itself. Throughout the late works, there is a freer, almostimprovisatory use of melody, yet one derived from the tightest structural cells Liszt could conceive.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Diana Reid (portrayed by Jane Lynch; seasons 1-4, 12; 8 episodes) is {{the mother}} of BAU team member Dr. Spencer Reid. Like her son, she has a high IQ. She was once a {{university}} professor of literature, but suffers from schizophrenia and is hospitalized in a Las Vegas sanitarium, where Spencer committed her when he was eighteen. Her husband, William Reid, left prior to her diagnosis, because of his inability to cope with her illness and he could not deal with protecting her after she witnessed a murder. She is functional when on her medication, but <b>frequently</b> <b>lapses</b> into regression to her university career. Diana spent much time reading aloud to Spencer while he was growing up, and he continues to write her a letter every day. She is proud of her son but disapproves of the FBI, as it is a government-run organization; she refers to his colleagues as [...] "fascists". She seems to be showing signs of improvement in later episodes, when Reid states that she went on a supervised field trip to the Grand Canyon without feeling the need to notify Reid. However, she did not forget him as Reid later receives a postcard and a gift from her.|$|R
5000|$|Reviews differ widely, Spectator opined, 'A subtle, {{brilliant}} and paradoxical novel... No {{one has ever}} written better than she does here about the English upper-class cult of fox-hunting pre-1914...'. and The Telegraph was similarly effusive, 'It is a beautiful, resonant book about a hidden world... The charm of this strange, haunting novel lies in her extraordinary ability not merely to describe, but to convey the very texture of whatever she is writing about...She inhabits not just human skins but those of horse, hound and fox. At times she even contrives to become the landscape across which all these creatures enact their drama of pursuit.' and concludes 'It {{is a piece of}} virtuosity that should be required reading for anyone who wishes to understand hunting, rather than merely hold a prejudice about it.' In start contrast, Alfred Hicklin in The Guardian complains 'what strikes you most about Rosalind Belben's evocation of early 20th- century countryfolk is her cacophonously awful prose. She <b>frequently</b> <b>lapses</b> into incomprehensible rural jargon - one chapter is bafflingly entitled [...] "Breaking off and the Poultry-Fund Certifier". I had begun to hope that it was a Stella Gibbons-style parody, but the stoic humourlessness suggests she might be in earnest.' ...|$|R
500|$|Of {{the five}} volumes, the second {{may be the}} most {{interesting}}: it dealt with more interesting times, and more consistent military operations. The army of the north was a [...] "bad army," [...] and the story of its command is one of [...] "honest and brave men hurried in turn to the guillotine, or of less honest men going over to the enemy." [...] Some of Phipps' own eccentricities also appear in volume two; he <b>frequently</b> <b>lapses</b> into sarcasm, revealing his disdain for civilian administration of military affairs, and there are points at which he fails to follow through fully on his criticism; for example, he holds back on his critique of Jean Victor Moreau despite his assertion that he wanted to demolish once and for all the myth that Moreau was as great a soldier as Napoleon. Phipps adeptly describes the game of cat and mouse that Moreau, Jean Baptiste Jourdan, and the Archduke Charles played with one another in the summer of 1796 as their armies criss-crossed south-western Germany; neither general came to grips with the other until October, and even then, after the Battle of Schliengen, Charles was content to chase Moreau and Jourdan over the Rhine, not to demolish the French army. They were lacking, Phipps postulated, the instinct and nerves of Napoleon.|$|R
40|$|Experiencing {{negative}} affect <b>frequently</b> precedes <b>lapses</b> in self-control for dieters, smokers, and drug addicts. Laboratory research has similarly shown that inducing negative emotional distress increases {{the consumption of}} food or drugs. One hypoth-esis for this finding is that emotional distress sensitizes the brainʼs reward system to appetitive stimuli. Using functional neuro-imaging, we demonstrate that inducing {{negative affect}} in chronic dieters increases activity in brain regions representing the reward value of appetitive stimuli when viewing appetizing food cues. Thirty female chronic dieters {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either a negative (n = 15) or neutral mood induction (n = 15) immediately followed by exposure to images of appetizing foods and natural scenes during fMRI. Compared with chronic dieters in a neutral mood, those receiving a negative mood induction showed increased activity in the OFC to appetizing food images. In addition, activity to food images in the OFC and ventral stria-tum was correlated with individual differences in {{the degree to which the}} negative mood induction decreased participants ʼ self-esteem. These findings suggest that distress sensitizes the brainʼs reward system to appetitive cues, thereby offering a mechanism for the oft-observed relationship between negative affect and disinhibited eating. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{treating}} HIV- 1 -infected patients {{is to achieve}} and maintain suppression of viral load (VL). Achievement of this aim is thwarted by variable adherence to prescribed anti-retroviral drugs. Variable adherence to an antiretroviral regimen creates variability in the patient’s internal exposure to the drugs. Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) enabled us to estimate, during the initial phase of treatment, the relationship between variable internal exposure and VL, accounting for measured time-varying confounders and feedback relations using an antiretroviral regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV, LPV/r). Our final SNMM predicts that the short term effect of treatment is modified by the most recent past VL, with higher initial VL’s being associated with larger treatment-induced reductions in VL for a given internal exposure to the drugs. Variation in internal exposure to LPV/r in the interquartile interval (P 25 %–P 75 %) only slightly affects the overall reduction in VL, supporting {{the conclusion that the}} relatively long duration of action of LPV/r lessens the impact on VL of the most <b>frequently</b> recurring intermittent <b>lapses</b> in dosing.

40|$|Insufficient {{sleep is}} a global public health problem {{resulting}} in catastrophic accidents, increased mortality, and {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars in lost productivity. Yet the effect of sleep deprivation (SD) on decision making and performance is often underestimated by fatigued individuals and is only beginning to be understood by scientists. The deleterious impact of SD is <b>frequently</b> attributed to <b>lapses</b> in vigilant attention, but this account fails to explain many SD-related problems, such as loss of situational awareness and perseveration. Using a laboratory study protocol, we show that SD individuals can maintain information in the focus of attention and anticipate likely correct responses, but their use of such a top-down attentional strategy is less effective at preventing errors caused by competing responses. Moreover, when the task environment requires flexibility, performance under SD suffers dramatically. The impairment in flexible shifting of attentional control we observed is distinct from lapses in vigilant attention, as corroborated by the specificity of the influence of a genetic biomarker, the dopaminergic polymorphism DRD 2 C 957 T. Reduced effectiveness of top-down attentional control under SD, especially when conditions require flexibility, helps to explain maladaptive performance that is not readily explained by lapses in vigilant attention...|$|R
5000|$|Racial {{antisemitism}} {{has existed}} alongside religious antisemitism since the Middle Ages, if not earlier. In Spain {{even before the}} Edict of Expulsion of 1492, Spanish Jews who converted to Catholicism (conversos in Spanish), and their descendants, were called New Christians. They were <b>frequently</b> accused of <b>lapsing</b> to their former religious practices ("Crypto-Jews"). To isolate conversos, the Spanish nobility developed an ideology of [...] "cleanliness of blood". The conversos were called [...] "New Christians" [...] to indicate their inferior status in society. That ideology {{was a form of}} racism, as in the past there were no grades of Christianity and a convert had equal standing. Cleanliness of blood was an issue of ancestry, not of personal religion. The first statute of purity of blood appeared in Toledo in 1449, where an anti-converso riot lead to conversos being banned from most official positions. Initially these statutes were condemned by the monarchy and the Church. However, the New Christians came to be hounded and persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition after 1478, the Portuguese Inquisition after 1536, the Peruvian Inquisition after 1570 and the Mexican Inquisition after 1571, as well as the Inquisition in Colombia after 1610.|$|R
40|$|T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and macrophages in vivo {{maintain}} orderly constant immunological adjustment {{mechanisms by}} acting {{with each other}} in a complex manner. T-lymphocytes, that are main actors of cell-mediated immunity and form the rosette by binding with sheep red blood cells, are by no means a single cell group, and along with functional differentiation they show peculiar markers on the cell surface {{so that they can be}} divided into individual subsets. In view of the fact that an early foreknowledge or diagnosis of immunological behaviors, especially the acute rejection, in the patient transplanted with kidney, would not only lessen disturbances of the transplanted kidney but also it would diminish the danger of subsequent complication, time-lapse measurements were taken frequently of total T-lymphocytes and active T-lymphocytes known to have biological activity using peripheral blood before and after kidney transplantation, and their changes were studied. The subjects consisted of 22 living related and 9 cadaveric kidney transplantations that we handled in the First Department of Surgery, Okayama University during the period from March 1974 to August 1978. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Conray method (a modification of Boyum's method) from 5 ml of fresh heparinized blood obtained from kidney-transplanted patients. By the method of Tachibana-Yata the sheep red blood cell suspension was prepared for measuring total T, active T, and B-lymphocytes, and the measurements were taken by the test-tube method of Felsburg et al, -Kerman et al. To total T and active T lymphocytes the nonspecific rosette formation reaction with sheep red blood cells was applied, and to B-lymphocytes the complement binding reaction with complementsensitized sheep red blood cells was used. The reaction of lymphocytes to sheep red blood cells was conducted in the ratio of about 1 : 100, and those sheep red blood cells showing the adhesion of over 3 sheep red blood cells were taken as the rosette formation positive cells. The lymphocyte subpopulation was measured frequently for a long period of time before and after the operation of kidney transplanted patients, and the percentage of total T (Tt), active T (Ta) and B-lymphocytes was calculated, and such a percentage was observed along with changes of clinical symptoms after the kidney transplantation, and these findings were used to serve for the early fore-knowledge of acute rejection crisis or lung infection, and also to serve for the determination of the optimal dose of immuno-suppressive agents. The results are described as follows. 1) The test results by the test-tube method with 36 materials from 20 normal individuals are: Tt 60. 3 ± 6. 1 %, Ta 40. 2 ± 10. 3 %, B 21. 0 ± 8. 0 %. The results of 18 cases undergoing hemodialysis prove to be Tt 52. 3 ± 8. 8 % (p< 0. 01), Ta 32. 5 ± 10. 6 % (p< 0. 02), and B 25. 0 ± 9. 7 %. 2) In those cases showing favorable progress after kidney transplantation there can be observed a marked decrease in Tt and Ta ratios, which gradually show a recovery tendency after 3 months, but the decrease of T-lymphocyte level continues for a fairly long period of time. Especially the decrease of Ta level is markedly prolonged. 3) Four to 9 days before the onset of acute renal rejection Tt and Ta showed a significant rise, but by MPSS-high-dosage treatment there was a rapid decreasing tendency. 4) In those cases having lung infection the decrease of T-lymphocyte level has been continued for a fairly long time before the onset of disease, especially marked is the decrease of Ta level. Those having favorable results after treatment showed a significant rise of T-lymphocyte level, showing a recovery tendency. 5) Ta ratio can be obtained by a simple procedure and the result can be clarified in a short period of time, and it is a useful immunological parameter that reflects sharply and accurately the immunity of the host. 6) From these findings it is concluded that the ratio of Tt and Ta lymphocytes, by measuring <b>frequently</b> along with <b>lapse</b> of time would give the foreknowledge of postoperative immunosuppressive conditions and acute rejection crisis in kidney-transplanted patients and the prognosis determination of lung infection cases. In addition, such a ratio is useful in determination of the optimal dose of immuno-suppressive agents...|$|R
