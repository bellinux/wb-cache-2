Workers in our model can also sell their labor to the highest bidder. The stationary equilibrium has both technology dispersion – different wages due to different job qualities, and contract dispersion – different wages due to different market experiences for workers. The equilibrium is also constrained-efficient – in stark contrast to undirected search models with technology dispersion. We then calibrate the model to the US economy and show that the implied dispersion measures are quite close to those in the data. JEL codes...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to assess the impact of}} participation of Port Harcourt indigenous women in poverty eradication programmes in Rivers State, Nigeria. The study used questionnaires to elicit responses from 385 indigenous women randomly selected in a multi-stage technique. Descriptive statistics and t-test were used to analyze the data collected. Results showed that majority (58. 3 %) of the women were members of a cooperative society, 63. 5 percent were members of community-based organizations (CBO) while 60. 9 percent were members of “Esusu” (rotator credit schemes). About 66. 3 percent of the women had engaged in <b>jobs</b> <b>aimed</b> at poverty alleviation. Only 6. 0 percent identified that they were not members of any poverty alleviation programmes (PAP) by government. It was found that after joining the PAP, 75. 5 percent of them experienced an increase in income of 36. 6 percent. Significant differences existed in the income of the women after joining poverty alleviation programmes. It was therefore recommended that more programmes designed to alleviate poverty in Rivers State should target indigenous women; government should also establish entrepreneurship capacity-building programmes to enable women to bring out their optimal input while participating in the poverty eradication programmes...|$|R
