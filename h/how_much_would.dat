500|$|Monetary values after 1830 are {{inflated}} {{to contemporary}} values using {{changes in the}} British Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This measures the social cost of construction or investment {{as a proportion of}} the economy's total output of goods and services. As GDP measures are not available prior to 1830, pre-1830 dates are inflated using changes in British (predominantly southern English) average wage labour earnings, this measures the social cost of dedicating labour to a particular project. [...] Both of these measures allow a reader to consider the equivalent social impact in current terms: <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>would</b> contemporary Britons need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of January 2017, the latest year for which contemporary figures are available is 2015.|$|E
500|$|Gateshead Council {{subsequently}} considered {{other sites}} {{for a second}} park, but it was discouraged by the high prices being asked by the estate owners at Redheugh and Shipcote. The Shipcote estate was owned by Sir Walter James, who was approached by a council park committee in 1874 and asked <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>would</b> be required to purchase {{at least part of}} his estate. Whilst negotiations were ongoing, James' offer to sell part of his estate at £650 per acre was met by fierce criticism from members of the public and the council began to seek an alternative to the Shipcote proposal. The town clerk wrote to William Wailes to ask if {{he would be willing to}} sell his [...] Saltwellside estate. On 11November1874, Wailes replied that the council could have his entire estate for £32,000, and in March 1875 James told the park committee that he did not wish to compete with Wailes but that he would offer a subscription if the council went ahead at Saltwellgate. Later that month the park committee formally opened talks with Wailes and, after various proposals were considered and rejected, in September 1875 the council decided to buy the entire Saltwellgate estate for an increased total price of £35,000 after securing a loan for the full amount from the Local Government Board. The agreement was formalised two months later and included a provision to lease Saltwell Towers back to Wailes for the remainder of his life.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{agricultural}} work as being seasonal and transient, the ability of employers to exploit these workers is high. [...] Such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities (i.e. immigration status). [...] In some cases, workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation, housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received, therefore further indebting the worker. Crew leaders may also provide workers with H-2A visas and transportation to the place of work from a home country. Part of the H-2A visa, {{is that it does not}} provide an adequate choosing of their employment, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>would</b> they be paid for their work, or even the hours, are not negotiable. Undocumented people who come without any visas, have a greater chance of choosing of where they wish to work and decide to leave the employment if they wish and have a better chance of not being exploited.|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Athrun's character {{has often been}} positive. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker cited him as strong character with his questions regarding war resembling Kira's. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment stated that while Gundam SEED was primarily focused on Kira's growth, Athrun often [...] "stole the show {{in a lot of}} ways" [...] citing their rivalry and his angst displayed during its final episodes. Comments have also been focused on Athrun's and Kira's relationship with IGN's Andy Patrizio disliking the number of times they shouted each other's names. Writing for Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme was worried about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>would</b> Kira's and Athrun's relationship would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked how Lacus's introduction added tension to it, because of how she and Kira started relating despite Athrun being engaged with her. Moreover, Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed the development from their rivalry as it resulted in well done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Furthermore, Athrun's confrontations with Cagalli across the series were praised due to how their characters' were developed while talking with each other.|$|E
