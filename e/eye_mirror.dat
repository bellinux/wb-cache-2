5000|$|A convex mirror, {{diverging}} mirror, or fish <b>eye</b> <b>mirror</b> is {{a curved}} mirror {{in which the}} reflective surface bulges toward the light source. Convex mirrors reflect light outwards, therefore they {{are not used to}} focus light. Such mirrors always form a virtual image, since the focal point (F) and the centre of curvature (2F) are both imaginary points [...] "inside" [...] the mirror, that cannot be reached. As a result, images formed by these mirrors cannot be projected on a screen, since the image is inside the mirror. The image is smaller than the object, but gets larger as the object approaches the mirror.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of image forming systems in animal eyes {{are based on}} refractive optics. However, there are several eye types that use as a main image forming devises biological mirrors hence they are called <b>mirror</b> <b>eyes.</b> Biological <b>mirrors</b> are special type of tissue that reflects light beams usually {{by means of the}} constructive interference on multi-layers of alternating refractive indices. The <b>mirror</b> <b>eye</b> arrangement can be found mostly in animals living in the dim or deep water. Different types of <b>mirror</b> <b>eyes</b> have been described among molluscs, crustaceans and fishes. Moreover, the reflective superposition eyes of decapod crustaceans served as an inspiration for construction of the lobster-eye X- ray telescopes used in astrophysics. In this thesis, various types of <b>mirror</b> <b>eyes</b> are described. The overview of animals with <b>mirror</b> <b>eyes</b> is supplemented by description of their habitat. Finally, different types of <b>mirror</b> <b>eyes</b> are compared and their possible biomimetic application especially in optical technology is discussed. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

In 1999 he directed Furia, a film based on Julio Cortázar's short story Graffiti. From Furia and his next features, he frequently works with Grégory Levasseur as writers such as in The Hills Have <b>Eyes,</b> <b>Mirrors,</b> P2, and Piranha 3D. Levasseur also made his works as production designer too.|$|R

50|$|All {{statues of}} this type are 1st century Roman copies of a lost Greek bronze, {{possibly}} a bronze of c. 430 BC by Kresilas. The oval face and the sharpness of the eyebrow ridge, nose and <b>eyes</b> <b>mirror</b> those of the bust of the helmeted Pericles at British Museum. That bust is identified with the statue of Pericles that Pliny the Elder (Natural History, XXXIV, 25) attributes to Kresilas and that Pausanias (I, 28, 2) records as sited on the acropolis in the 2nd century. This parallel gives us a date and author for this bronze Athena.|$|R

40|$|Myth, {{from the}} Greek mythos: “Mar-velous {{narration}} situated outside historic time told by divine or heroic characters. Often interprets the world’s origin or great human events”. The dragon, ex-cept for in China, {{has always been}} a symbol of “evil”, but, at the same time, the fire and power represented by the dragon are essential elements for hu-mankind. The modern city, symbolically under-stood as a dragon(because the individual always finds himself close to the fire, to the urban vortex that represents evolution {{at the same time as}} it absorbs us), is based on myths that are already a part of the col-lective imagination. These myths have left remnants scattered throughout the city in the form of statues or architec-tural styles. In the same way that myths come alive through architecture, films convert ar-chitecture into myth, a modern myth. Cinema is capable of indirectly my-thologizing a city through storytelling, showing us our reality anew as seen through someone else’s <b>eyes,</b> <b>mirroring</b> a reality that does not exist but that cre-ates the modern myth of the city...|$|R
