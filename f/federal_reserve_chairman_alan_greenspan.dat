5000|$|According to Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan's ideologically {{opposition}} to government regulation was unmoved either by complaints by grassroots [...] "housing advocates" [...] about {{the damage to}} low income communities by predatory mortgage lending in the early 1990s, {{by the failure of}} market forces to prevent an early, smaller subprime bubble and bust in the late 1990s, or by appeals by Reserve board governor Edward Gramlich to take {{a more active role in}} policing the subprime business.|$|R
500|$|The {{possibility}} of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists. Former US <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was [...] "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency".

At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy.

In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.|$|E

40|$|Views {{expressed}} do {{not necessarily}} reflect official positions of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> System. In 2004, former <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspanexpressed surprise that long-term nominal interest rates(e. g., 30 -year conventional, fixed mortgage rates) failed to increase as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased its federal funds interest rate target. Greenspan and others dubbed this a “conundrum. ” Today, a different type of financial market conundrum may have arisen: Why, with a high and rising overall U. S. and global inflation rate, has the nominal yield on the 10 -year U. S. Treasury security remained below 4 percent {{for most of the past}} year? Long-term Treasury yields often are viewed as a key barometer of inflation pressures. This rationale stems from the Fisher equation, which holds that the nominal yield is the sum of the real yield and a premium to compensate bondholders for inflation and the risk of higher inflation. Accordingly, a rise in 10 -year Treasury yields, without a concomitant increase in th...|$|R
