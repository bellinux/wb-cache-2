5|$|Due to {{an unfortunate}} {{accident}} during the Spring of April 6, 2009, Makoto Yuki (Akira Ishida) {{arrives in the}} city late at night on a delayed train. Upon disembarking at midnight, a strange phenomenon <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> city—shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become encased in coffins. Unperturbed, Makoto casually {{makes his way to}} the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy (Akira Ishida) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow dormmates, Yukari Takeba (Megumi Toyoguchi) and Mitsuru Kirijo (Rie Tanaka), albeit the pair weary of his arrival at midnight.|$|E
5|$|In Part Three, Henri Christophe {{has become}} the first King of Haiti and {{subjects}} the black population to worse slavery than that experienced under French rule. His regime carries out brutal torture and <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> city in fear. He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} a fortress on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} grips used. In Under <b>Grip,</b> <b>the</b> rod is <b>gripped</b> firmly with <b>the</b> {{back of the}} hands turned towards the body. In Top <b>Grip,</b> <b>the</b> rod is <b>gripped</b> with <b>the</b> {{knuckles}} turned outwards.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} <b>grips</b> - <b>the</b> palms-down <b>grip</b> and <b>the</b> {{baseball}} bat <b>grip.</b> For <b>the</b> palms-down <b>grip</b> <b>the</b> hands facing downward while holding the ski rope. For <b>the</b> Baseball Bat <b>grip</b> kneeboarders hold <b>the</b> handle just like a baseball bat.|$|R

5|$|Thor kills Jörmungandr but is {{poisoned}} by the serpent, and manages to walk only nine steps before {{falling to the}} earth dead. Fenrir swallows Odin, though immediately afterward his son Víðarr kicks his foot into Fenrir's lower jaw, <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw, and rips apart Fenrir's mouth, killing the great wolf. Loki fights Heimdallr and the two kill each another. Surtr covers the earth in fire, causing the entire world to burn. High quotes stanzas 46 to 47 of Völuspá, and additionally stanza 18 of Vafþrúðnismál (the latter relating information about the battlefield Vígríðr).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword <b>grips.</b> <b>The</b> Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5000|$|Twin chucking: tap is held at {{points of}} both its {{circular}} and square cross-section. <b>Gripping</b> <b>the</b> circular section assures concentricity {{to the machine}} spindle, and <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> square produces positive rotational drive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{overhand}} <b>grip,</b> {{or regular}} <b>grip,</b> is <b>the</b> standard <b>grip</b> used for <b>the</b> horizontal bar. On <b>the</b> overhand <b>grip</b> <b>the</b> hands circle {{the bar with}} {{the backs of the}} hands facing the gymnast.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> reverse <b>grip</b> and underhand <b>grip,</b> is <b>the</b> {{opposite}} of <b>the</b> overhand <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> palms {{of the hands}} face the gymnast. It is similar to <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> used in chin-ups. Forward giant swings are among the skills that use this grip.|$|R
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> hem of her red dress {{in a manner that}} recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} forms of {{construction}} for tweezers: two fused, angled pieces of metal, or {{one piece of}} metal bent in half. The bent tweezer is cheaper to manufacture, but gives weaker <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> fused tweezer is more expensive, but allows for a stronger <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> width between {{the tips of the}} tweezers when no force is applied also affects how powerful <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is.|$|R

25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is monogamous, with the male helping the female to {{establish}} a den, raise young and feed her when cubs are born. The mating season varies according to location; in Transcaucasia, hyenas breed in January–February, while those in southeast Turkmenia breed in October–November. In captivity, breeding is non-seasonal. Mating can occur {{at any time of}} the day, during which the male <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> skin of the female's neck.|$|E
25|$|Expo 58, {{the first}} major {{international}} fair after World War II, was {{to be held in}} Brussels in 1958. Franklin was invited to make a five-foot high model of TMV, which she started in 1957. Her materials included table tennis balls and plastic bicycle handlebar <b>grips.</b> <b>The</b> Brussels world's fair, with an exhibit of her virus model at the International Science Pavilion, opened on 17 April, one day after she died.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to these}} factors, a batsman in cricket needs to watch very {{carefully}} how the bowler <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> ball even during his run-up, {{as well as}} the type of revolutions on the ball as it approaches. Master spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan, who were able to dramatically vary the trajectory, direction and extent of spin, frequently bowled deliveries with a scrambled seam to disguise the type of ball actually bowled.|$|E

50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{motif of}} the Oseberg Style is <b>the</b> so-called <b>gripping</b> beast. <b>The</b> <b>gripping</b> beast motif is what clearly distinguishes the early Viking {{art from the}} styles that preceded it. The chief features of <b>the</b> <b>gripping</b> beast are <b>the</b> paws that <b>grip</b> <b>the</b> borders around it, neighbouring beasts or parts of its own body. The style is also characterized by traditions from the Vendel era, and it is nowadays not generally accepted as an independent style.|$|R

25|$|During mating, {{the male}} copepod <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> female {{with his first}} pair of antennae, which is {{sometimes}} modified for this purpose. The male then produces an adhesive package of sperm and transfers it to the female's genital opening with his thoracic limbs. Eggs are sometimes laid directly into the water, but many species enclose them within a sac attached to the female's body until they hatch. In some pond-dwelling species, the eggs have a tough shell and can lie dormant for extended periods if the pond dries up.|$|E
25|$|Mustafizur Rahman is {{probably}} the most successful bowler of the off cutter. Instead of rolling the fingers over the seam of sliding it back he flicks his wrists at the very last moment with very less change to his action. Thus the 'Fizz' <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> surface and deviates the ball from its line and gets a sudden jump like bounce with slower pace. He even bowls a fast off cutter. Thus Nasser Hossain rightly described him as a 'fast off spinner'. A good example would be Andre Russels dismissal by Mustafizur in the Vivo IPL 2016.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{a period}} of heavy rain {{followed}} by strong sun, there are signs of distress on the island: fishing boats do not put out to sea, carts do not go to market, people are ascending to the mountains. Then a storm causes a shipwreck and a survivor seeks refuge in Dan’s hut. As he comes in and out of consciousness, the man tells Dan the story of how he is a priest from Ireland come to help stop the “sweating sickness” which <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> island. Before the priest dies, Dan promises that he will take the priest's place and go to the Bishop's to instruct the people how to halt the sickness.|$|E

25|$|Anxiety over {{imminent}} events <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> {{main characters}} in Conu Leonida faţă cu reacţiunea, and {{plays a part}} in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies. A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of D-ale carnavalului, whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally. Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Miţa Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation. Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis {{on the fact that}} Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.|$|E
25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed {{in the folds of}} a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and he gestures with his right hand toward the mountain summit. His left hand <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds hang over the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is signed and dated.|$|E
25|$|A {{major element}} of {{strategy}} in these sports is {{the condition of}} the ball. Since bowling in cricket has more variations (such as bounce, swing, seam movement, off-spin, leg-spin and so on), {{the condition of the}} ball also affects play to a great degree. In Test cricket, the same ball must be used for at least 80 overs unless it is lost, damaged or illegally modified at which point it must be replaced with a used ball in a similar condition. After the 80 overs, obtaining a new ball is at the discretion of the fielding captain – who will often ask for a new ball immediately, since a new ball is harder, smoother, bounces higher and has an intact seam, which produces greater conventional swing. But when a captain feels that a spin bowling attack {{is more likely to be}} successful, he will persist with the old ball, which is rougher and better <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> surface as well the bowler's fingers. In baseball the ball is replaced numerous times during a game to ensure it is in optimum condition.|$|E
