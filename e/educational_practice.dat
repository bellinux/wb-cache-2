500|$|In his Philosophical Books review, Graham Haydon {{wrote that}} the book {{was part of a}} trend of {{political}} philosopher interest in how education works within liberal-democratic societies. He noted issues of compatibility between a society's self-described [...] "liberal" [...] values and the values of their <b>educational</b> <b>practice,</b> or between a society's <b>educational</b> <b>practice</b> and the wishes of its citizens. Haydon wrote critics of the common and detached public school would ask how the students would be raised without [...] "some cultural coherence". Writing in 2001, he said that her criticism of England's civics education already appeared outdated in view of England's then-new National Curriculum citizenship curriculum, which he felt Levinson would find the [...] "best model ... consistent with her own argument". He added that the [...] "radical pluralist" [...] societies used as examples do not accommodate citizens that hold other values over [...] "autonomy", and do not answer how citizens can be convinced to believe in [...] "autonomy-promoting" [...] schools. Haydon considered her book [...] "an important contribution" [...] to liberal theory and wrote that [...] "it would be a loss to political philosophy" [...] if she continued her work as a schoolteacher in lieu of an academic career.|$|E

2500|$|The phrase {{professional}} {{learning community}} began {{to be used in}} the 1990s after Peter Senge's book The Fifth Discipline (1990) had popularized the idea of learning organizations, related to the idea of reflective practice espoused by Donald Schön in books such as The Reflective Turn: Case Studies in and on <b>Educational</b> <b>Practice</b> (1991). Charles B. Myers and Lynn K. Myers used the phrase {{professional learning community}} in relation to schools in their 1995 book The Professional Educator: A New Introduction to Teaching and Schools, and a year later Charles B. Myers presented a paper at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association titled [...] "Beyond the PDS: Schools as Professional Learning Communities" [...] that proposed a path from professional development school (PDS) efforts to schools as professional learning communities. In 1997, Shirley M. Hord issued a white paper titled [...] "Professional Learning Communities: Communities of Continuous Inquiry and Improvement". A year later, Richard DuFour and Robert E. Eaker published the book Professional Learning Communities at Work. Since the late 1990s, a large literature on PLCs has been published.|$|E
60|$|Closely {{connected}} with this moral end {{is the more}} purely intellectual aim of education, the endeavour to make us see and imagine the world in an objective manner, {{as far as possible}} as it is in itself, and not merely through the distorting medium of personal desire. The complete attainment of such an objective view is no doubt an ideal, indefinitely approachable, but not actually and fully realisable. Education, considered as a process of forming our mental habits and our outlook on the world, is to be judged successful in proportion as its outcome approximates to this ideal; in proportion, that is to say, as it gives us a true view of our place in society, of the relation of the whole human society to its non-human environment, and {{of the nature of the}} non-human world as it is in itself apart from our desires and interests. If this standard is admitted, we can return to the consideration of science, inquiring how far science contributes to such an aim, and whether it is in any respect superior to its rivals in <b>educational</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{profession}} of teaching {{has long been}} characterised by certain habitual convictions, which Spencer undertook to shake rudely, and even to deride. The first of these convictions is that all education, physical, intellectual, and moral, must be authoritative, and need take no account of the natural wishes, tendencies, and motives of the ignorant and undeveloped child. The second dominating conviction is that to teach means to tell, or show, children {{what they ought to}} see, believe, and utter. Expositions by the teacher and books are therefore the true means of education. The third and supreme conviction is that the method of education which produced the teacher himself and the contemporary or earlier scholars, authors, and publicists, must be the righteous and sufficient method. Its fruits demonstrate its soundness, and make it sacred. Herbert Spencer, in the essays included in the present volume, assaulted all three of these firm convictions. Accordingly, the ideas on education which he put forth more than fifty years ago have penetrated <b>educational</b> <b>practice</b> very slowly--particularly in England; but they are now coming to prevail in most civilised countries, and they will prevail more and more. Through him, the thoughts on education of Comenius, Montaigne, Locke, Milton, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and other noted writers on this neglected subject are at last winning their way into practice, with the modifications or adaptations which the immense gains of the human race in knowledge and power since the nineteenth century opened have shown to be wise.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{evaluating}} psychologically the novel ‘Rose’, written by Era Natarasan. Era Natarasan, who currently lives in Cuddalore, a Southern town of India, is a Tamil children literature writer, translator and novelist. As an eminent scholar and teacher, he was conferred the Dr Radhakrishnan State Award for his contribution {{in the field of}} Education and Child – Rights. At present, there is a trend to analyse and evaluate creative literatures psychologically. However, such psychological evaluative studies are rare in Tamil. Yet, this study is carried out as an attempt to evaluate Era Natarasan’s novel ‘Rose” with the followings as objectives: (1) To identify the <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> that are found in the novel (2) To evaluate psychologically the appropriateness of those <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> for children. Accordingly, the descriptive and analytical methods are used to evaluate the novel. Psychological theories such as Piaget’s Intellectual Development Theory, Erikson’s Psychosocial Development Theory and Lewin’s Field Theory are applied to examine the appropriateness of the current <b>educational</b> <b>practices.</b> The study identifies the ‘life space’ of children found in the novel, amidst the sophisticated mechanical lives of parents. Also, it reveals the mismatches between the <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> for children and the theories of child psychology. Finally, the study raises some questions which need immediate actions in relation to children’s <b>educational</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} investigates teachers’ <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> {{in kindergarten}} and primary schools. Teachers {{should be able}} to ensure effective teaching-learning processes, but also to support a positive school climate thanks to a good classroom management. Self- evaluation instruments can help teachers to reflect on their own <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> and to improve professional skills. The aims of this study are (1) to analyse the internal validity of a new self-evaluation instrument, named Teachers’ <b>Educational</b> <b>Practices</b> Questionnaire (TEP-Q) and (2) to examine the possible use of this instrument in pre-service teacher training. The sample consists of 307 in-service teachers of Northern, Central and Southern Italy. The results of three distinct Principal Axis Factor Analysis with Promax Rotation revealed two-factor structure for Communication and Classroom Organization areas and one-factor structure for Relationship. Significant differences emerged for type of school, type of teacher and years of teaching. As to the second aim, the TEP-Q was used for different groups of pre-service and in-service teachers training resulting effective for the improvement of professional skills’ range through shared reflection on <b>educational</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

Decisions regarding the curriculum, disciplinary practices, student testing, textbook selection, the language used by the teacher, and more can empower or disempower students. It recognises that <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> favour some students over others and some practices harm all students. It also recognises that <b>educational</b> <b>practices</b> often favour some voices and perspectives while marginalising or ignoring others. Another aspect examined is the power the teacher holds over students {{and the implications of}} this.
