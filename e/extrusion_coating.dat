40|$|Nowadays, {{a lot of}} {{attention}} is focused on the possibilities for using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process in packaging solutions. The greatest benefit of an ALD layer is the loss of weight to the packaging. This leads to cost savings during the packaging life cycle. The main target concerning packaging solutions is to create a profitable way to manufacture an ALD layer to packages. At the moment, the most applicable solution seems to be the development of Roll-to-Roll ALD (RRALD) process being faster and cheaper than the batch ALD process. In this thesis the ALD process is first explained briefly. Then the materials in the process are presented followed by comparison between different ALD processes. Finally, the benefits of using ALD in packaging technology and new ideas about possible solutions based on ALD are discussed. Results indicate, that a few nanometers thick aluminum oxide layer produced by ALD can improve water vapour and oxygen barrier significantly, when this layer is deposited onto a polymer substrate. On polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surface and in the best scenario, an Al 2 O 3 ALD layer decreased moisture and oxygen permeation through the structure to one percentage of the original value. On top of polyolefins, such as low density polyethylene and polypropylene (LDPE and PP, respectively), and polylactic acid (PLA) the Al 2 O 3 ALD layer decreased the measured moisture and oxygen permeation through the structure tens of times lower level compared to the value of polymer only. An Al 2 O 3 ALD layer no thicker than 40 – 50 nm is enough to improve the water vapor permeation of LDPE, PP and PET films less than 1 g/m 2 / 24 h in normal conditions. A film with a top Al 2 O 3 ALD layer can be further <b>extrusion</b> <b>coated</b> with an extra LDPE layer to create a structure with excellent sealing properties. Currently RRALD process might be a slightly more expensive way to produce packaging than the conventional laminating process, but there will be savings in terms of material and transportation costs (empty packages, packaging with the product and packaging eventually as litter). Packaging in which aluminum foil is replaced by an ALD layer can also be recycled and thus avoid ending up in a landfill...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{provides}} an overview of activities performed in the framework of the EU-funded collaborative project RESTRUCTURE, the main goal of which was to develop and validate a compact structured reactor/heat exchanger for thermochemical storage driven by 2 -step high temperature redox metal oxide cycles. The starting point of development path included redox materials qualification via both theoretical and lab-scale experimental studies. Most favorable compositions were cobalt oxide/alumina composites. Preparation of small-scale structured bodies included various approaches, ranging from perforated pellets to more sophisticated honeycomb geometries, fabricated by <b>extrusion</b> and <b>coating.</b> Proof-of-concept of the proposed novel reactor/heat exchanger was successfully validated in small-scale structures and the next step included scaling up of redox honeycombs production.

40|$|Effects of {{moisture}} on the mechanical properties of one commercial solid fiberboard grade {{and on the}} compression strength of mill-fabricated transport boxes made from this material were studied. The solid fiberboard (1220 g/m 2) has four middle layers made of old corrugated container (OCC). The middle layers are strongly internally sized with rosin sizing. The outer layers on both sides are made of bleached machine finished kraft paper. The kraft paper has <b>extrusion</b> <b>coated</b> low-density polyethylene (LDPE) doublelayer as moisture barrier. The six paper and paperboard layers are glued together in an industrial lamination process. The boxes have unusual design including double-panel walls and webbed corners, and they are used in wet and humid conditions for transporting fresh round fish. The transportation takes up to eight days at the ambient environment of 4 °C and 90 - 100 % RH. These conditions are taken as {{the framework of the}} study. Results show that the LDPE coating considerably slows down the transverse moisture penetration. The in-plane diffusivity (5. 9 · 10 - 10 m 2 /s, 27 °C, 50 / 90 % RH) was determined with an integrated unsteady state moisture transport model and was found to be nine times higher than the transverse diffusivity through the PE layer. Based on the diffusivity, water vapor can theoretically affect 80 mm from the open unsealed board edge during transport. Experiments show that liquid water penetrates 40 - 50 mm during eight days. In the middle of the sheet the moisture content increases moderately, approximately 0. 3 percentage points during transport. The packaging producer’s main concern is thus to ensure that the open material edges are at least 80 mm away from the load bearing sections of the box. Due to uneven moisture penetration into the boxes, the average moisture of a box is a questionable measure {{of moisture}} pick-up. Instead one should consider the moisture content of the load bearing parts. The role of the adhesion layers in bending stiffness of the solid paperboard was modeled with laminate models. Results show that the adhesion layers affect the mechanical properties of the combined board and need to be addressed in the models. Best agreement with the measured bending stiffness values was obtained by a 11 -layer model, where the properties of the adhesion layers are taken from the paper-glue-paper sandwich tests. The PE and kraft paper are regarded as one layer in the model. With this model, the calculated bending stiffnesses are close to the measured reference at 50 % RH in MD (difference 1 %). In 90 % RH and in MD the results are 14 % lower. Neglecting the adhesion layers gives 5 % lower values in 50 % RH and 18 % in 90 % RH compared to the reference measurement in MD. In each of the cases, the difference from reference is larger for the CD material direction. Three thickness measurement techniques (ISO, STFI, and SEM) were used to gather input data for the bending stiffness model. In this application, the ISO technique provided best results compared to the other techniques. It was found that the top-to bottom failure of a box can be expressed as a critical vertical displacement that is independent of moisture content. Similar results have been previously discovered when studying simpler structures like corrugated board panels and regular slotted containers (RSC). This research indicates that the strain dependent failure criterion also applies on more complex box structures.

Fortified rice premix from the different techniques was mixed with normal rice in a 1 : 100 ratio. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The study confirmed the high stability of iron and zinc during storage while the retention of vitamin A was significantly affected by storage and the type of techniques used to make rice premix. Losses for iron and zinc were typically < 10 % for any type of rice premix. After 12 months at mild conditions (25 degrees C and humidity of 60 %), losses for vitamin A ranged from 20 % for cold extrusion, 30 % for hot extruded rice 77 % for coated rice premix. At higher temperatures and humidity, losses of vitamin A were 40 %- 50 % for extruded premix and 93 % for coated premix after 6 months. We conclude that storage does lead to a major loss of vitamin A and question whether rice is a suitable food vehicle to fortify with vitamin A.
