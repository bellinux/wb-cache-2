5000|$|Labor MLC Frank Blevins had {{resigned}} {{late in the}} previous term in order to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of Giles at the 1985 state election. Blevins was not due to face re-election that year, so the new parliament needed <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> casual <b>vacancy</b> <b>to</b> cover the remaining four years of his term. George Weatherill was appointed on 11 February 1986.|$|R
50|$|After the War, Minshall began a {{practice}} in Chillicothe, and was elected Prosecuting Attorney of Ross County. In 1877, {{he was elected}} Judge of the Court of Common Pleas <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy,</b> and elected <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full terms in 1878 and 1883.|$|R

He {{supported}} the parliamentarians during the First English Civil War. He died in 1646 {{as a new}} writ for Maidstone was issued, <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> stated <b>to</b> be caused by Sir Francis's death, but in Sir Roger Twysden's diary he is mentioned in 1649 as urging the release of his eldest son Robert, imprisoned by the Kentish committee.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Dibble {{served as}} {{member of the}} State house of representatives in 1877 and 1878.Trustee of the University of South Carolina at Columbia in 1878.He served as member of the Board of School Commissioners of Orangeburg County.He served as {{delegate}} to the Democratic National Convention in 1880.Presented credentials as a Democratic Member-elect to the Forty-seventh Congress <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> thought <b>to</b> exist by reason of the death (pending a contest) of Michael P.

She was {{on the board of}} directors of the Congress of Women of the Worlds Columbian Exposition of 1893.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, while {{covering}} {{a baseball game}} between the Youngstown Ohio Works club and a team from Homestead, Pennsylvania, Evans was approached by {{the manager of the}} local club, ex-major leaguer Marty Hogan, and asked <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>an</b> umpire <b>vacancy.</b> According <b>to</b> Evans's obituary, the aspiring reporter, who was on a date with a young woman, [...] "wasn't interested until Hogan mentioned he would be paid $15 a week for officiating the game", a figure equivalent to a week's salary at his sportswriting job.|$|R
25|$|Therefore, {{while the}} Prime Minister has {{a measure of}} {{latitude}} in deciding when to hold a by-election, the Court reiterated that {{this does not mean}} that the Prime Minister is entitled to defer the calling of <b>an</b> election <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> indefinitely, or <b>to</b> simply declare that he will not be advising the President to issue a writ of election. The Court opined that even if at a particular point in time the Prime Minister felt that it would not be appropriate to call for <b>an</b> election <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy,</b> he would still be compelled to review the circumstances from time to time and call one if and when the circumstances changed.|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} benefit from training apprentices {{can be measured}} by saved future recruitment costs (Stevens 1994 b), i.e., the costs a firm faces when searching for and training workers from the external labour market until they reach full productivity. Firms frequently have to hire new workers, either <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> or <b>to</b> expand their workforce. However, finding a suitable worker who matches the job profile and other possible requirements may be costly. While recruitment and training costs may depend on the general availability of skilled workers on the external labour market, long-term predictions for Europe suggest {{that there will be}} a shortage of skilled workers with intermediate skills in many countries despite the currently high unemployment rates (due to the demographic ageing of societies). Thus, apprenticeships may provide a less costly alternative for firms, reducing the need to spend time and effort to find suitable workers externally and training them for their firm-specific needs at the pay level of skilled workers.|$|R
30|$|Barlevi (2011) also {{estimates}} matching functions using a Cobb-Douglas specification {{and using}} data on unemployment from Haver analytics and vacancy data from JOLTS {{for the period}} from 2000 to 2011. He finds that the reduced matching productivity from normal times (defined as 2000 -August 2008) {{to the end of}} 2011 can explain an increase in unemployment to 7.1 percent. Given that the rise in unemployment from his defined normal times was 5.3 percent and 9.3 during the period after, then mismatches could explain 45 percent of the rise in unemployment, and 55 percent would be explained by other factors. However, Barlevi (2011) acknowledges that his assumption of a fixed ratio of the value of a job to the cost of <b>filling</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacancy</b> leads <b>to</b> <b>an</b> over-estimate of the effect of mismatches and, thus, provides an upper bound of the impact. Given these two studies, the impact of mismatch ranges between 33 percent and 45 percent (with the latter being an upper bound), while the impact of other factors (including slack demand) account for between 67 percent and 55 percent of the rise in unemployment during the Great Recession.|$|R
