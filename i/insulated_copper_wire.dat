40|$|Cooling in an end-winding {{region of}} a high-powered, large-sized {{generator}} still remains a challenge {{today because of}} a number of factors: a larger number of parts/components with irregular geometries, complexity in cooling flow paths, flow splitting and mixing, and interactions between rotor-induced rotating flows and nonrotating flows from stationary sections. One of the key challenges is to model cooling flows passing through armature bars, which are made up of bundles of strands of <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and are bent oppositely to cross each other. This work succeeded in modeling a complex generator end-winding region with great efforts to simplify the model by treating the armature bar region as a porous medium. The flow and pressure fields at the end-winding region were investigated numerically using an axial symmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Based on the analysis, the cooling flow rate at each flow branch (rotor-stator gap, rotor subslot, outside space block, and small ventilation holes to the heat exchanger) was determined, and the high-pressure gradient zones were identified. The CFD results have been successfully used to optimize the flow path configuration for improving the generator operation performance, and the control of the cooling flow, as well as minimizing windage losses and flow-introduced noises...|$|R
5000|$|An {{inductor}} usually {{consists of}} a coil of conducting material, typically <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire,</b> wrapped around a core either of plastic or of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) material; the latter is called an [...] "iron core" [...] inductor. Since power inductors require high induction levels, high permeability and low saturation points in the core materials are not ideal. The high permeability of the ferromagnetic core increases the magnetic field and confines it closely to the inductor, thereby increasing the inductance. Low frequency inductors are constructed like transformers, with cores of electrical steel laminated to prevent eddy currents. 'Soft' ferrites are widely used for cores above audio frequencies, since they do not cause the large energy losses at high frequencies that ordinary iron alloys do. Inductors come in many shapes. Most are constructed as enamel coated wire (magnet wire) wrapped around a ferrite bobbin with wire exposed on the outside, while some enclose the wire completely in ferrite and {{are referred to as}} [...] "shielded". Some inductors have an adjustable core, which enables changing of the inductance. Inductors used to block very high frequencies are sometimes made by stringing a ferrite bead on a wire.|$|E

[...] Each train {{consisted of two}} wagons, equipped with 5 miles of wire and a telegraph instrument. The first model train was constructed by Henry J. Rogers, a telegraphic engineer from New York City {{who had worked with}} Samuel F.B. Morse in building the first commercial telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore in 1844. Rogers's original telegraph instrument for the train replaced the traditional sending key and sound receiver with a dial indicator, a circular index plate bearing the letters of the alphabet and a pointer that turned to the letter to be transmitted. A similar pointer spelled out the message at the receiving end. Rogers provided a galvanic battery that eliminated the danger of acid spills. This equipment eliminated the need for skilled operators who had to be trained in Morse code. Field trials in February 1862 found that it worked satisfactorily over a test circuit of 2 miles of wire. A board of three signal officers recommended that such a train would be of great use as an auxiliary to permanent telegraph lines.|$|E

40|$|At the Forschungszentrum Juelich a coil {{system for}} {{magnetic}} ergodisation of the plasma edge {{is to be}} built in TEXTOR- 94 : the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED). The helical coils will be installed at the high field side inside the vacuum vessel. They are aligned in parallel to the magnetic field lines in the plasma at the q= 3 surface. The system will be fed by multiphase current to distribute the expected heat load on the divertor target plates over a wider area and e. g. to influence plasma rotation at higher frequencies. The aims of this thesis are to analyse different possible concepts for such a coil arrangement and to lay out selected DED components and thereby to contribute essentially to the final technical solution. The layout development is accompanied by field calculations of the different possible system designs. The path of the coils is calculated by means of the field line helix. A four phase current system with sixteen coils proves to be the most favourable; by connecting pairs of coils carrying opposite currents in series less power supplies (IGBT based) are needed. A coil design of complete turns has the advantage of a higher flexibility regarding the operation mode selection and needs less space than a module system. The coil outlets will be bundled {{to reduce the number of}} required flanges; additional coils above and below the ergodisation coils compensate the resulting asymmetry in the poloidal current distribution.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{methods and}} experiments {{for the assessment}} and evaluation of energy efficiency strategies for manufacturing processes {{in the field of}} electric drives production. First, the system for the Least Energy Demand Method will be explained. The basic idea of this calculation is the comparison and evaluation of energy efficiency based on the ratio of the theoretically required energy consumption to the measured energy consumption. Using these values as well as further derived indicators for energy efficiency, the main energy consumers within the field of electric drives production are identified. Subsequently, these processes are analysed and optimized to achieve major energy saving instructions. From an energy point of view during the stator production chain, especially the impregnation process and the joining process have to be optimized as, in the here presented measurements, the impregnation process amounts to more than 80  % of the cumulated energy demands. Moreover, the process of joining <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> of the stator windings to corresponding cables shoes is optimized, as it shows strong energy saving potentials. Additionally, the power consumption values within {{the state of the art}} joining process are varying strongly thus leading to higher load peaks within the production line, which have to be reduced. Regarding energy efficiency within the manufacturing of permanent magnet synchronous rotors, the process of magnet assembly also has to be evaluated. It can be subdivided into magnet manufacturing, logistics, magnetization and assembly. A major part of the energy used in this process is accounted for by means of transportation, especially when considering that magnetized magnets need larger packaging volumes and weights due to the ferromagnetic shielding and spacers to support handling of the magnet bodies. Thus, the energy efficiency can be increased considerably by shifting the magnetization step directly to right before the assembly step. In addition, energy can be saved by optimizing the magnetization process according to the magnetization strategy and the interaction of all process parameters, such as capacity of the magnetizer, inductivity and size of the magnetizing coil, magnet size, material and coating...|$|R

The purpose of this research was the identification of heavy metals and other potentially harmful elements emitted during the combustion and baling of polyvinyl chloride <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire.</b> Analysis of the smoke produced during the burning was conducted and compared to the airborne dust samples collected during the baling process. From these results, occupational exposures to heavy metals during the reclamation of PVC <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> were assessed. Bulk ash and dust samples were ?aken to compare {{to each other and to}} the air samples to examine the similarities and/or differences that existed between the samples. Neutron activation analysis was used to determine the components found in the bulk ash and dust samples. Atomic absorption was used to analyze the air samples collected during the baling and combustion of PVC <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire.</b> Particle size distributions were measured using an Anderson 2000 cascade impactor. All tests were performed according to existing standards. The air sampling data yielded some surprising results.

This was startling considering previous research indicated the potential for antimony, cadmium, and barium, to be found in quantities that could exceed occupational exposures, but not for lead or copper. The combustion samples taken for five minutes in the smoke plume showed lead and copper results exceeding the allowed daily exposure in 5 to 8 minutes. Although the lead and copper samples taken during the baling operation did not exceed the allowed daily exposure, the results did show potentially high exposures to workers if the baling of burned copper wire continued for the duration of the workshift. The bulk ash and dust samples showed antimony, bromine, and chromium in concentrations exceeding 100 ppm by mass.

OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of immediate and delayed post space preparation on the integrity of the apical seal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four extracted human incisors were biomechanically prepared using the step-back technique. Sixty roots were randomly assigned to 6 experimental groups of 10 teeth each and the remaining 4 roots served as positive and negative controls (n= 2). The root canals in the different groups were obturated with cold lateral and warm vertical condensation of gutta-percha and one of two sealers (Sealapex and Diaket). Post space was prepared either individually or simultaneously. An <b>insulated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> was cut into 10 -cm-long pieces. In each canal, one piece was inserted to maintain contact with gutta-percha and extended to the outside as one of two working electrodes. A stainless steel wire with the same dimensions of those of the copper wire, used as the other working electrode, was immersed into the background electrolyte from the center of the bottle. The electrical current between standard and experimental electrodes in canals was measured over a period of 10 days applying a conductivity meter. The Kruskal-Wallis test (p= 0. 05) determined whether there was a significant difference in microleakage among the groups and the Mann-Whitney U test (p= 0. 01) was used for multiple comparison grouping variables.
