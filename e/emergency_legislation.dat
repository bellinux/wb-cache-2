5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E
25|$|Iceland {{had been}} hit {{especially}} hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because {{of the failure of}} its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14billion ($19billion). In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Davíð Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old banks will be run into bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|The Commonwealth Bank {{received}} {{almost all}} central bank powers in <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> passed during World War II {{and at the}} end of the war it used this power to begin a dramatic expansion of the economy. This was also the aim of the government at the time, which attempted to compel the Australian states to conduct their banking with the Commonwealth under the Banking Act 1945 (Cth), but the High Court in Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth (1947) 74 CLR 31, blocked this move. The government also colossally expanded immigration programmes. To respond to this, the bank established a Migrant Information Service (later known as the Australian Financial & Migrant Information Service, or AFMIS). The bank expanded during this period. In just five years it opened hundreds of branches throughout Australia and in 1951 it established a branch in the Solomon Islands.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{critically}} examine the major constituent elements of the State Security system in Canada from a legal perspective. It is a historically-contingent notion essential not {{for the protection of}} the population as a whole, but for the preservation of State hegemony, which is directed almost exclusively against left-wing dissent and protest. As the ideological foundation of State Security in Canada, this notion constitutes the politico-legal framework for each of the arms of the State Security hydra, each of which is examined in some depth: (1) crimes against the State, (2) official State secrets, (3) the right of access to government and personal information, (4) the Crown privilege to refuse disclosure of National Security information, and (5) the centrepiece of State Security, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). While all of the traditional constituents of National Security (subversion, terrorism and espionage) are examined, the overwhelming emphasis of this study is on subversion, protest and dissent. Some areas have been omitted, however, and most notably <b>emergencies</b> <b>legislation,</b> due to time constraints. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{conduct of}} the Civil War {{resulted}} in long-lasting bitterness on both sides. In September special <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> came into effect under which military tribunals were empowered to pass death sentences. The head of the anti-Treaty forces, Liam Lynch, responded with an announcement that Free State TDs and Senators who had voted for the legislation would be targeted. A number {{of members of the}} Oireachtas were attacked, TD Sean Hales was killed and the property of parliamentarians burnt. In addition IRA men around the country burned many of the stately homes of the old Protestant Anglo-Irish landed class—a policy motivated by both class antagonism and nationalist resentment against a class traditionally seen as [...] "pro-British". The Free State Government, for its part, officially executed 77 anti-Treaty prisoners. Government forces also carried out a number of atrocities against prisoners. This was particularly pronounced in Kerry, where the fighting was most bitter. On at least three occasions in March 1923, IRA prisoners were massacred with land mines in reprisal for the killing of Free State soldiers. Ironically, the men accused of these war crimes were mostly from the Dublin Guard, themselves IRA veterans from 1919–21. See also: Executions during the Irish Civil War ...|$|E
2500|$|About a {{third of}} the world's supply, and most of Europe's supply, of medical {{isotopes}} is produced at the Petten nuclear reactor in the Netherlands. Another third of the world's supply, and most of North America's supply, is produced at the Chalk River Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. [...] The NRU started operating in 1957. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission ordered the National Research Universal reactor to be shut down on November 18, 2007 for regularly scheduled maintenance and an upgrade of the safety systems to modern standards. The upgrade took longer than expected, and in December 2007 a critical shortage of medical isotopes occurred. The Canadian government passed <b>emergency</b> <b>legislation</b> allowing the reactor to restart on 16 December 2007, and production of medical isotopes to continue. [...] In mid-February, 2009, the reactor was shut down once again due to a mechanism problem that extracts the isotope containing rods from the reactor. [...] The reactor was again shut down in mid May of the same year because of a heavy water leak. [...] The reactor was started again during the first quarter of 2010. [...] The NRU will cease routine production in the fall of 2016, however the reactor will be available for backup production until March 2018, at which point it will be shut down.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMost provincial <b>emergency</b> {{management}} <b>legislation</b> (Quebec excepted) {{fails to}} include regulatory guidelines {{as to how}} local authorities reduce community vulnerability. This exposes individual(s) and groups to greater vulnerability to disasters if the local authority decides not to act or provide inadequate management. In addition, access to financial resources to assist or compensate local governments and/or private landowners for damages endured often come with attachments or do not exist. When damages result from a government's action or inaction {{in the event of}} an emergency, provisions in provincial legislation and court findings have reduced government exposure to civil liability at common law further exposing private landowners to financial risk. This paper argues that a lack of standards in <b>emergency</b> management <b>legislation,</b> restrictive access to financial assistance and/or compensation and reduced government exposure to civil liability at common law expose private landowners to greater vulnerability to disasters and the liability attached. It is essential that those responsible for proactive/preventative planning for disasters work from a standard playbook, one which sets minimum safeguards for the public. Absent of clear and fulsome compensation guidelines, private landowners will bear an unfair and disproportionate financial risk...|$|R
