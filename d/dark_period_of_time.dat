Reaching for a larger value of the city (both in aesthetic and safety) after dark, and the <b>dark</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> making more significant part of the rhythm of life of the population, there must be conducted researches on city streets lighting. On this basis can and should be organised a separates specific city's or several cities lighting plans, studies in which would be solved aesthetic and technical questions. In foreign countries cities lighting plans were commenced preparing 20 years ago, and in Lithuania there are prepared just a few. Unlighted streets or public places play a huge role to the population of cities and towns and area development, improperly adjusted or badly operated lighting infrastructure. Currently, in Jonava's district, as well as throughout Lithuania, lighting equipment and electrical equipment repair costs are almost 2 times higher than lighting equipment and electrical equipment maintenance costs. Seeking to find out all the possibilities in final project an aim is raised – analyse the possibilities for {{street lighting}} infrastructure modernization, with regard to foreign and Lithuanian cities practice and the impact of lighting infrastructure on the territory's development. Master's final project object - street lighting infrastructure. To achieve this objective these tasks were raised: 1. Analyse the street lighting of accordant city and regions development and in the context of organiztion of public services. 2. Analyse in foreign countries and Lithuania existing street lighting systems and evaluate street lighting modernization pros and cons. 3.

40|$|The {{dark current}} is an {{important}} characteristic of a photoconductive X-ray detector, and can impact the dynamic range of the detector and its detective quantum efficiency. It is therefore essential that the dark current and its behavior with time and x-ray irradiation are well characterized and understood in amorphous selenium (a-Se) X-ray detectors for the future enhancement of these detectors. Throughout {{the course of this}} work, the dark current in practical a-Se multilayer photoconductors were studied as function <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and x-ray dose delivered to the detector material. The dark current in these multilayer structures has been measured as a function <b>of</b> different rest <b>time</b> <b>periods,</b> sample structure, single X-ray irradiation on the sample and multiple irradiation on the sample. Experiments were performed by resting the sample in <b>dark</b> for a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (24 hours) and then samples were exposed to X-ray radiation. It has been observed that most of the trapped charge carriers in the bulk of the material are discharged after resting the sample in dark for 24 hours. It was observed that multilayer sample structures p-i-n and n-i-p exhibit much less dark current compared to other samples with single layer and double layer structures, that is, i-layer only, n-i and p-i structures. The experiments support that the dark current is controlled by injection of charge carriers from contacts. Single X-ray irradiation and multiple irradiation experiments were performed on multilayer a-Se photoconductors at a dose rate of 0. 51 Gy s- 1 with an exposure duration of 3 s. Samples were exposed to single irradiation at 100 s and 400 s. The dark current following the photocurrent was recorded. Multiple irradiation experiments were also performed on these multilayer samples. With different reverse bias voltages, samples were irradiated 10 times from 200 s to 2000 s. It was found that the dark current tends to increase with repeated X-ray irradiation but the increase depends on the applied reverse bias; the increase is negligible at a field of 10 V μm- 1. After the cessation of the irradiation, the dark current decays and tends to reach a steady state value at t = 4000 s. After 24 hr of resting in the dark, the dark current was nearly as low as the original dark current before the X-ray irradiatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of multi-times feeding on rumination as related with eating behaviour using three male Tokara goats kept in individual cages under 12 hr-light (7 : 00 - 19 : 00) and 12 hr-dark (19 : 00 - 7 : 00) periods. The animals were fed lucerne haycubes ad libitum for continuous feeding and for multi-times feeding. In the latter, feed was given every two hours in the light <b>period</b> (six <b>times</b> <b>of</b> feeding) and once at the onset <b>of</b> the <b>dark</b> <b>period</b> (seven <b>times</b> <b>of</b> feeding a day). The behavioural data of rumination and eating behaviour were collected through the observation made every one minute for three days after seven-day preliminary acclimatization. The results obtained were as follows: For the pattern of eating behaviour in the light period, there was no particular tendency when the goats were kept on continuous feeding, but when kept on multi-times feeding there occurred a higher proportion of eating induced by each supply of diet. On the other hand, there was a similar tendency for both feeding systems in the <b>dark</b> <b>period,</b> but the proportion of eating for multi-times feeding was higher than for continuous feeding on the first one hour in darkness. The rumination showed a decrease during the four hours after the onset <b>of</b> light <b>period</b> on continuous feeding, but for multi-times feeding there was an increase in the proportion every two hours when the proportion of eating behaviour was decreased. In the <b>dark</b> <b>period,</b> there occurred an increase in the proportion of rumination for both feeding systems as time went by, except for a large decrease on the last one hour for continuous feeding. The rumination time was longer in the <b>dark</b> <b>period</b> than in the light period for both feeding systems, but the ratio was larger and rumination time a day was longer when conducting multi-times feeding. This was contrary to the eating time which was longer for continuous feeding. The mean duration of rumination was longer when the animals were kept on multi-times feeding than when kept on continuous feeding, and there was more frequencies of longer duration of rumination for multi-times feeding. The feed intake was slightly less on multi-times feeding than on continuous feeding, resulting in longer <b>time</b> <b>of</b> rumination per unit of intake affected by the multi-times feeding. It was suggested that multi-times feeding influenced diurnal rhythm in rumination and increased ruminatmg time. 本研究はトカラヤギを用い, 多回給餌が反芻行動に及ぼす影響について採食行動との関連で追究したものである. トカラヤギ雄 3 頭を単飼ケージ内で飼養し, 明暗周期を各々 12 時間とした. 破砕へイキューブを無制限給与とし, 連続自動給餌区並びに多回給餌区(明期に 2 時間ごとの 6 回及び暗期開始時 1 回の計 7 回給餌) を設定した. 試験は 3 頭の同一山羊を用い連続自動給餌区, 多回給餌区の順に 7 日の予備期後, 採食及び反芻行動を 3 日間記録した. 得られた結果は次のとおりである. 1. 採食行動は, 連続自動給餌区の場合明期では特定の傾向を示さなかったが, 暗期開始後に低下し暗期終了前に若干増加することが認められた. しかし, 多回給餌区においては明期では給餌に反応して 2 時間ごとに高い出現割合がみられ, 暗期開始直後においても給餌の影響を受けてその割合が増加したことが示された. 反芻行動の割合は, 連続自動給餌区の場合明期開始 1 時間後から 4 時間の間は減少傾向にあったが, 多回給餌区では採食行動の割合が小さくなる時間帯に高くなることが認められた. また暗期の反芻行動は両給餌区とも時間の経過とともに増加した. しかし, 暗期終了前の 1 時間においては連続自動給餌区では採食行動の増加に伴う著しい低下が示されたが, 多回給餌区での変動は小さいことが認められた. 2. 採食時間は両給餌区とも暗期より明期で多くなったが, 多回給餌区においては連続自動給餌区に比べ明期と暗期の比率が小さく, 1 日当りの採食時間は若干少なくなることが示された. 反芻時間は両給餌区とも明期よりも暗期において長いが, 多回給餌区でその傾向は著しく, 1 日の反芻時間は多回給餌区で長くなることが示された. 3. 採食の平均持続時間は, 両給餌区とも明期と暗期の間に大きな差は認められなかった. 反芻の平均持続時間は多回給餌区で連続自動給餌区の場合よりも長く, また持続時間の長い反芻の頻度についても多回給餌区で多いことが示された. 4. 多回給餌区において採食量が若干少なかったことと反芻時間が長くなったことから, 摂取飼料 1 g当りの反芻時間は多回給餌区で長くなることが認められた. 以上の結果から, 多回給餌はトカラヤギの反芻行動に影響を与え, 反芻時間を延長させることにより, 飼料摂取量を低下させることが示唆された...|$|R
