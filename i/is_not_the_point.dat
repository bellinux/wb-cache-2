5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
25|$|Quite often, {{textbook}} {{problems will}} treat the population standard deviation {{as if it}} were known and thereby avoid the need to use the Student's t-distribution. These problems are generally of two kinds: (1) those in which the sample size is so large that one may treat a data-based estimate of the variance {{as if it were}} certain, and (2) those that illustrate mathematical reasoning, in which the problem of estimating the standard deviation is temporarily ignored because that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that the author or instructor is then explaining.|$|E
25|$|Milky Way DHDs {{have sparked}} {{numerous}} discussions as {{the design and}} operation of the device has resulted in contradiction. In the Milky Way, the Dial Home Device contains 38 of the 39 symbols on the Stargate, meaning {{there is always a}} missing glyph on each DHD. This missing glyph, however, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin for the planet. This means that only certain addresses can be reached from specific positions in the galaxy safely. The only way to intervene and reach all destinations in the Milky Way from a specific stargate, is to manually dial the gate using an external power source. Another method for reaching any stargate is to use a Dialing computer like Stargate Command- however, this could lead to unforeseen side effects such as wormholes traveling through stars or solar flares. DHDs are designed to prevent these incidents from taking place by only allowing access to certain stargates from specific locations in the galaxy.|$|E
500|$|In 1957 Angelou {{appeared}} in an off-Broadway revue that inspired her first film, Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. [...] Also in 1957, the album Miss Calypso was completed and released; it was reissued as a CD in 1995. [...] According to reviewer Hilton Als, Angelou sang and performed calypso because she [...] "had followed {{the fashion of}} <b>the</b> time", and <b>not</b> to develop as an artist. Als states about Miss Calypso: [...] "But {{it was clear that}} <b>the</b> album itself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> Developing her artistry <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> Fame, <b>not</b> art, <b>was</b> her spur..." [...] In 1958, Angelou met blues singer Billie Holiday, who after walking out during one of Angelou's calypso performances, told her, [...] "You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing".|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{fluidity}} and volatility {{provided by}} the requirement to appoint subrulers and commanders, there were several occasions where one player possibly ruled enough supply centers (one-half plus one) to fulfill the standard Diplomacy victory condition.

500|$|The narrator, Edgar, Georg, and Kurt {{hail from}} similar backgrounds. All are German Romanian and {{students}} at the same university. They all suffer persecution, and oppose the regime. The characters—especially Edgar, Georg, and Kurt—are quite deliberately not developed in great detail, as noted by critics. [...] "Characterization <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> here. Müller is primarily a poet", and this poetic interest likewise is said to explain the lack of chapter organization and of transitional phrases. Only two of the six main characters who suffer oppression survive {{at the end of}} the book: Lola dies by hanging, Georg commits suicide after fleeing to Germany, Kurt is found hanged, and Tereza, the narrator's friend who betrays her to the Securitate, dies of cancer.|$|E

2500|$|The Fringe's own {{position}} on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book Sore Throats & Overdrafts, [...] "No-one can say what the quality will be like overall. It does not much matter, actually, for that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the Fringe ... The Fringe is a forum for ideas and achievement unique in the UK, and {{in the whole world}} ... Where else could all this be attempted, let alone work?". Views from the middle ground of this perennial debate point out that the Fringe is not complete artistic anarchy. Some venues do influence or decide on the content of their programme, such as the Traverse and Aurora Nova, who used to run their own venue but are now just a production group.|$|E
