50|$|From the <b>fundamental</b> <b>observation</b> that hadrons are composite, there grew {{two points}} of view. Some {{correctly}} advocated {{that there were}} elementary particles, nowadays called quarks and gluons, which made a quantum field theory in which the hadrons were bound states.

This was called S-matrix theory.|$|E
5000|$|This result goes back, in {{different}} form, before {{the notion of}} quasi-isometry was formally introduced, {{to the work of}} Albert S. Schwarz (1955) and John Milnor (1968). [...] Pierre de la Harpe called the Švarc-Milnor lemma ``the <b>fundamental</b> <b>observation</b> in geometric group theory" [...] because of its importance for the subject. Occasionally the name [...] "fundamental observation in geometric group theory" [...] is now used for this statement, instead of calling it the Švarc-Milnor lemma; see, for example, Theorem 8.2 in the book of Farb and Margalit.|$|E

5000|$|Wells's <b>fundamental</b> <b>observation</b> is {{to suggest}} that the {{earliest}} extant Christian documents from the first century, most notably the New Testament epistles by Paul and some other writers, show no familiarity with the gospel figure of Jesus as a preacher and miracle-worker who lived and died in the recent decades. Rather, the early Christian epistles present him [...] "as a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past". Wells believed that the Jesus of these earliest Christians was not based on a historical character, but a pure myth, derived from mystical speculations based on the Jewish Wisdom figure.|$|E

40|$|The {{modern era}} in {{spectral}} line broadening {{began with the}} understanding that the slow(quasistatic) ion and fast(impact) electron perturbers could be treated separately. The problem remained of unifying these two theoretical limits. A scheme for this unification is presented here that has at its foundation a <b>fundamental</b> <b>observation</b> that is supported by analytical theory and is further demonstrated by computer simulation. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>observation</b> is that the ions and electrons can be separated most of the time, and that a frequency separation within each perturber subsystem can be used for unification. That is, the rigorous inclusion of slow, but not necessarily static ions together with the correct impact ion perturbations, will produce valid ionic line shapes. We show that a frequency separation may be effected to exactly include the fast modulation limit in a variety of modern methods that can deal with the intermediate regime between the fast and slow frequency limits of the perturbation.
