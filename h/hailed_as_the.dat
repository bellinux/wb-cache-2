Harvey's run-scoring tapered away {{in the last two}} matches of the season; he made 74 runs in three innings in the match. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 699 runs at 49.92; he had made the same number of runs in his first six first-class seasons since his debut in 1947–48.

5|$|Although {{individual}} members of the regiment had served as advisors with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) since 1962, {{it was not until}} April 1965 that the government announced that a battalion would be deployed to Vietnam. Between June 1965 and March 1972 the units of the regiment would conduct sixteen rotations in Vietnam, with the first seven battalions completing two 12-month tours, while 8 and 9 RAR would each serve one. Consequently, following a period of hurried training and administration 1 RAR joined the US 173rd Airborne Brigade at Bien Hoa airbase outside of Saigon in June 1965. After initially defending the airbase, 1 RAR steadily increased the scope of its patrols. For example, in January 1966, 1 RAR assaulted a large Viet Cong headquarters complex in the Ho Bo Woods as a part of Operation Crimp; which the Americans <b>hailed</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first strategic intelligence victory of the war. The battalion subsequently completed a 12 month-tour attached to US forces, during which it developed new tactics and techniques that later became standard for Australian battalions and supporting arms and services that would subsequently operate in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|As Dan travels across Gallowmere, {{fighting}} his {{way through}} Zarok's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices.

As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse, Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber.

5|$|Having {{broken through}} {{at the end}} of the {{preceding}} summer, Harvey played his first full season for Victoria in 1953-54. He scored two centuries and five half-centuries against full-strength teams from other states. He was <b>hailed</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> best player outside the Australian Test team, and at the start of the following season, Harvey was included in an Australian XI for a match against the touring England team for a Test trial match. However, rain curtailed the match and turned the playing surface into a sticky wicket hostile to batting. Harvey made only seven in his solitary innings. He played in all of Victoria's matches for the season, but his form slumped and he was overlooked for state selection until 1958-59, when he regained his position and made 97 and 86 in consecutive innings. However, the following season, he made only sporadic appearances and was dropped after some low scores. He shone mainly for Fitzroy; his club first-grade records for the most career runs and centuries, and the most runs in a season, still stand. He ended his first-grade career in 196061 with 19 centuries and 9,146 runs at an average of 36.15 from 247 matches.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, {{securing}} {{his first}} full, six-year {{term in the}} Senate. Newly elected President John F. Kennedy– Cooper's former Senate colleague– chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and New Delhi. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Cooper to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War, consistently advocating negotiation with the North Vietnamese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with Idaho Democrat Frank Church {{on a series of}} amendments designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were <b>hailed</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first serious attempt by Congress to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
