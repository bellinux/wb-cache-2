5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> each tile can be reflected over an edge {{to take up the}} position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of}} the spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E

5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

40|$|Using Giddens’s (1984) {{structuration}} theory, {{this study}} explored the communicative processes surrounding the divorce decree in coparenting relationships in stepfamilies. Participants included 21 adults who were coparenting children in stepfamilies who completed diary entries of all interactions with coparents over a 2 -week period, and who completed follow-up interviews. Results revealed two structures of signification {{with respect to the}} divorce decree that enabled and constrained coparenting interactions. The first signification structure <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the decree <b>was</b> framed as a legal document, dictating the rights and responsibilities of parenting, especially with respect to child access and financial issues. The second signification structure <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the decree <b>was</b> viewed as a negotiating guide for more informal coparental decision-making processes...|$|R

40|$|Domains such as {{multiple}} trauma management, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{there are multiple}} interacting goals that change over time, <b>are</b> <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> plan recognition <b>'s</b> standard inductive bias towards a single explanatory goal is inappropriate. In this paper we define and argue for an alternative bias based on identifying contextually "relevant" goals. We support this claim by showing how a complementary planning system in TraumAID 2. 0, a decision-support system {{for the management of}} {{multiple trauma}}, allows us to define a four-level scale of relevance and therefore, of measurable deviations from relevance. This in turn allows definition of a bias towards relevance in the incremental recognition of physician plans by TraumAID 's critiquing interface, TraumaTIQ.
