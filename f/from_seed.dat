5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily <b>from</b> <b>seed,</b> with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} to flower <b>from</b> <b>seed.</b> Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly <b>from</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} <b>from</b> <b>seed.</b> As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards <b>from</b> <b>seed.</b> Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

5|$|Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} paludosa is a slow-growing shrub which regenerates from bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} lignotuber. After fire, plants take around {{three years to}} flower significantly, but are flowering well by five years afterwards. Flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire. Plants are estimated to live to around 60 years of age. Seedlings also appear <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> dispersed after bushfire. All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to the}} nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus).|$|E
5|$|Coastal plants {{begin to}} flower at around five years <b>from</b> <b>seed,</b> but {{plants in the}} Stirling Range take much longer to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
40|$|This study {{intends to}} {{evaluate}} {{responses on the}} growth of soybeans plants <b>from</b> <b>seeds</b> with high and low vigor in different drought periods. Experimental design was completely randomized in factorial AXB (Factor A: variables 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5 water stress; Factor B: level of seed vigor, high and low). Evaluations of fresh matter, plant height, leaf area and dry weight of shoots, 10, 20, 30 and 40 days after emergence (DAE). Soybean plants originated <b>from</b> <b>seeds</b> with high physiological quality perform better than the plants originated <b>from</b> <b>seeds</b> of low vigor, until 40 DAE. Water stress reduces the initial growth of soybean plants originated <b>from</b> <b>seeds</b> of both high and low force, until 40 DAE. Soybean seeds of high vigor generate plants with higher growth rate of the culture until 30 DAE, besides generating plants with greater capacity for growth after returning water stress. </p...|$|R

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
5|$|Killed by fire, {{the species}} regenerates <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> afterwards. The {{resultant}} seedlings {{have been recorded}} flowering {{two or three years}} after bushfires, although records are few. No pollinators were recorded during observations for the Banksia Atlas, although banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds, mammals and insects.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.ericifolia has proteoid roots—roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, and so is killed by fire and regenerates <b>from</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates <b>from</b> <b>seed,</b> which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire.|$|E
5|$|Pitfour, an Episcopalian, {{had a small}} Qualified Chapel {{built on}} the estate at Waulkmill in 1766. This large plain {{building}} could accommodate up to 500 parishioners.

5|$|Propagated <b>from</b> <b>seed</b> {{collected}} by William Baxter in southern Australia, common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825. Due to its frost-tenderness, {{it was mostly}} restricted to greenhouse cultivation. In 1873, a variety known as Epacris impressa alba was recorded as being grown commercially for cut flowers in Boston in the United States. While initially popular – over seventy cultivars appeared in the literature at the time – most have since disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years <b>from</b> <b>seed.</b> Information is limited on its reliability, {{but it has been}} grown {{successfully}} in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in habit, and would benefit from regular pruning. Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit, and are more promising for horticulture.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only <b>from</b> <b>seed,</b> as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Although B.cuneata {{was first}} {{collected}} before 1880, {{it was not}} until 1981 that Australian botanist Alex George formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This Banksia is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As Banksia cuneata is killed by fire and regenerates <b>from</b> <b>seed,</b> it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency—fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. Banksia cuneata is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.|$|E
