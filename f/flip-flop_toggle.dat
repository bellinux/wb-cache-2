It will develop advanced manufacturing processes and communication ICs using its sub-micron VIP- 2 InP HBT technology. The initial 18 -month contract contains option phases, which, if implemented, would bring {{the total value of}} the contract to more than $ 15 m. The contract allows Vitesse to enhance the capabilities of its VIP- 2 process, selected for its ability to enhance speed, power, performance, circuit reliability and production-worthy manufacturing practices required for the DARPA specification. InP technology allows direct digital synthesis of high-frequency signals, simplifying the system design and reducing the number of discrete components required in advanced satellite, aircraft and terrestrial communication systems. Vitesse will collaborate with BAE Systems on the design of communications circuits; initially, these are for direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) for electronic warfare and radar applications. UIUC will focus on research for the next-generation transistor structures meant to further extend circuit performance and applications. A factor of two improvements in critical performance parameters has already been attained in early VIP- 2 experiments at 0. 45 μ. Further scaling is planned, incorporating UIUC’s findings, the ultimate goal to shrink device geometry to 0. 25 μ. This will result in static <b>flip-flop</b> <b>toggle</b> frequencies of 150 GHz.

40|$|Abstract—Gating of {{the clock}} signal in VLSI chips is {{nowadays}} a mainstream design methodology for reducing switching power consumption. In this paper we develop a probabilistic model {{of the clock}} gating network {{that allows us to}} quantify the expected power savings and the implied overhead. Expressions for the power savings in a gated clock tree are presented and the optimal gater fan-out is derived, based on <b>flip-flops</b> <b>toggling</b> probabilities and process technology parameters. The resulting clock gating methodology achieves 10 % savings of the total clock tree switching power. The timing implications of the proposed gating scheme are discussed. The grouping of FFs for a joint clocked gating is also discussed.

40|$|When the {{conventional}} superconductor niobium and the cuprate superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 - (YBCO) are connected in a ring-shaped geometry, the ground state {{is characterized by}} a spontaneously generated current corresponding to a half-integer magnetic flux quantum in the large inductance limit. The spontaneously generated currents result from a -phase shift originating from the difference in order parameter symmetry for niobium (s-wave) and YBCO (dx 2 -y 2 -wave). The fractional magnetic flux quanta in high-Tc/low-Tc superconducting structures have been used for an angle-resolved phase sensitive study to the order parameter symmetry in YBCO, which was found to contain an s-wave admixture of at least 9 %. Moreover, the experiments set an upper limit of a few percent on any complex admixture. The fractional flux quanta have also been used for the realization of a novel superconducting logic circuit element: a <b>toggle</b> <b>flip-flop</b> with integrated -rings. The dx 2 -y 2 -wave-induced -phase shifts alleviate the need for bias current lines and improve design-, fabrication- and operation margins.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{developed}} and experimentally evaluated at high-speed, {{a complete set}} of arithmetic circuits (multiply, add, and accumulate) for high performance digital signal processing (DSP). These circuits take advantage of the unique features of the Rapid Single-Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logic/memory family, including fusion of logic and memory functions at the gate level, pulse representation of clock and data, and the ability to maintain inter cell propagation delays using Josephson transmission lines (JTLs). The circuits developed have been successfully used in the implementation of a serial radix 2 butterfly, a decimation digital filter, and of an arithmetic unit for digital beam forming.

40|$|A new on-chip {{microwave}} generator for manipulating superconductive quantum bits (qubits) have been proposed. To perform practical quantum computation, on-chip {{microwave generator}}s, {{which can be}} controlled by single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits, are desirable because multiple qubits can be driven simultaneously with high accuracy by an SFQ control circuit {{and the number of}} wires between qubits and room-temperature electronics can be reduced.

A sinusoidal microwave can be obtained by filtering an output of the SFQ clock generator. Simulation results indicate that the generated microwave has a sharp spectrum, which can be chopped by controlling the SFQ clock generator. Moreover, a phase of the generated microwave can be accurately controlled by adding a phase control circuit, which is composed of cascaded <b>toggle</b> <b>flip-flops,</b> between the SFQ clock generator and the filter.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{propose a}} new {{paradigm}} in computing where bits can simultaneously transport and manipulate materials and information. Information representation is invariably physical. Though this insight is fundamental to understanding the physical limits of computation, {{it has never been}} exploited as a scheme for material manipulation. Bringing together notions from computer science and fluid dynamics, I present a new logic family "Bubble Logic" capable of both universal computation and programmable material manipulation in an all-fluidic two-phase system. This removes the distinction between materials and mechanisms to control them, bringing the programmability of the digital world into the physical world - {{with a wide range of}} promising applications in biotechnology, highthroughput screening, genomics and fluidic control systems for soft robotics, printing and digital fabrication. Microfluidics, the art of handling nano-to pico-liter volume fluids, is leading to a revolution in large-scale automation of biology and analytical chemistry. However, current lab-on-chip technologies are dependent on external macro-scale control elements, thus requiring a lab to run the chip. Bubble logic provides a dropletel,internal, inherently digital flow control mechanism at kHz frequencies with no moving parts or off-chip components. Nonlinearity is introduced in an otherwise linear, reversible, low Reynolds number flow via bubble-tobubble hydrodynamic interactions. I demonstrate bubble logic AND/OR/NOT gates, a <b>toggle</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> a ripple counter, a timing restoration device, a ring oscillator, a bistable valve and an on-demand bubble generator. These show the nonlinearity, gain, bistability, synchronization, cascadability, feedback and programmability required for scalable universal computation and control. (cont.) The representation used in this thesis makes possible encapsulation and manipulation of a large variety of micro-to nanocale materials including single molecules like DNA or proteins, live cells, liquid crystals, nano-particles and other biological and chemical reagents. Bubble logic provides a scheme to transport, store and operate on this new class of "digital materials" in an integrated, high-throughput fashion. Furthermore, microfluidics has also been extensively employed in biological systems. This thesis describes the discovery of two new physical fluid dynamic mechanisms motivated by a common theme of microfluidics in biology. Firstly, I describe a new superhydrophobic waterrepelling surface that has a characteristic of directional anisotropy to fluid resistance. The discovery, made while studying the integument of water-walking insects, helps rationalize the origin of thrust and hence propulsion of water-walking insects on a fluid interface. Secondly, this thesis uncovers a new physical mechanism for directed droplet transport, which I term "Capillary ratchet". Discovered in a class of surface feeding shorebirds, it is the only physical mechanism that is known to exploit contact angle hysteresis for fluid transport. Capillary ratchet is a promising candidate for implementing global clocking for integrated microfluidic devices. by Manu Prakash. Thesis (Ph. D.)
