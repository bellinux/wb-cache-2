5|$|Firebird Suiteâ€”1919 Version by Igor Stravinsky. A Sprite is awoken by her companion, an <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> accidentally wakes the Firebird, a fiery {{spirit of}} {{destruction}} {{in a nearby}} volcano who destroys the forest and seemingly the Sprite. The Sprite survives and the elk encourages her to restore the forest to its normal state. Introduced by Angela Lansbury.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} habitat, <b>elk</b> <b>and</b> other deer species, {{especially}} white tails, {{were introduced in}} areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates. Brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat, hides and antler velvet, they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems. <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> red deer were introduced to Argentina in the early 20th century. There they are now considered an invasive species, encroaching on Argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous Chilean huemul and other herbivores. This negative impact on native animal species has led the IUCN to identify the elk {{as one of the}} world's 100 worst invaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests and}} meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the habitat to support diverse animal life {{including}} foxes, badgers, porcupines, elk, black bears, bobcats, and woodpeckers. Mule deer {{are the most}} common large mammals in the park. <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> pronghorn, which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.|$|E

5|$|The local fauna of the Three Sisters {{includes}} fish such as brook and rainbow trout, birds such as {{blue and}} ruffed grouse, and larger species like the Columbian black-tailed deer, mule deer, Roosevelt <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> American black bear. In addition to predator bobcats, cougars, and coyotes, raccoons, martens, weasels, and American minks live throughout the Three Sisters area.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} large {{herbivore}} is the black-tailed deer, a subspecies of the mule deer. <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> moose are less common. Mountain goats are well-adapted to steep terrain and cold temperatures, {{and are not}} usually found at lower elevations. There are eight species of bats {{that live in the}} North Cascades.|$|E
5|$|The {{red maple}} is a {{used as a}} food source by several forms of wildlife. <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> white-tailed deer in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of red maple as {{an important source of}} winter food. Several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.|$|E

5|$|Goat Rocks {{obtained}} {{its name}} from a population of mountain goats that can be observed around the mountain. Other fauna include marmots and pikas at high elevations. Deer and elk can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from Yellowstone National Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer are especially common.|$|E
5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways. Drivers are often drunk and not wearing seat belts. Speeding is common. Deer, <b>elk</b> <b>and</b> moose crossing the highway {{add to the}} risk compared to urban highways. In {{the event of an}} accident in a remote area, injured victims may not receive emergency medical care in time to save their lives.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, <b>elk</b> <b>and</b> walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 the Supreme Executive of the Order of Royal Purple {{decided to}} secede from the <b>Elks</b> <b>and</b> start a new organization, the Canadian Royal Purple Society. Some locals, however, wished to remain with the <b>Elks</b> <b>and</b> these were {{integrated}} into {{the organization of the}} Elks of Canada as Royal Purple Elks Lodges. Approximately 75 of these new Canadian Royal Purple lodges were formed between August 2014 and Feb. 2015.|$|R

5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects the wolves, it can either {{approach}} the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.|$|E
5|$|Old Baltimore Pike is a {{road in the}} U.S. {{state of}} Delaware. The road, known as New Castle County Road 26, runs from Maryland Route 281 (MD 281) at the Maryland state line south of Newark, Delaware and {{continues}} east to Christiana, ending near Delaware Route 1 (DE 1). The road is paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95, Delaware Turnpike) {{to the north and}} U.S. Route 40 (US 40, Pulaski Highway) to the south. The Old Baltimore Pike was built before 1720 and connected Elkton, Maryland to Christiana. It was a turnpike called the <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> Christiana Turnpike between 1817 and 1838. In the past it served as a major connection between Philadelphia and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E

5|$|South of Shingleton, M-94 {{runs through}} forest lands {{as a part}} of the Great Manistique Swamp. Along the way are {{national}} forest campgrounds located near Steuben. South of Crooked Lake, M-94 curves to the east before turning almost due south to the Manistique area. In Manistique, M-94 enters town on North 5th St before turning to follow Deer Street and River Street. On River Street, the trunkline uses the Siphon Bridge to cross the Manistique River and then uses <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> Maple streets before terminating at US 2 at Lakeshore Drive.|$|E
5|$|The road, {{also known}} as Old Post Road, was {{incorporated}} in 1813 as the <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> Christiana Turnpike {{in order to get}} more money for repairs. The turnpike was completed in April 1817. As a turnpike, tolls were collected to pay for the maintenance of the road. The construction of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public road again in 1838. The road historically went through agricultural areas; however, the surroundings have become more developed over the years. Much of the Old Baltimore Pike remains two lanes.|$|E
5|$|The state holds {{populations of}} white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, {{mountain}} lions, bobcats, <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, {{and some of}} the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator.|$|E

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow <b>elk</b> <b>and</b> will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|After {{about half}} of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat USS <b>Elk</b> <b>and</b> an armed private ship, the Grey Eagle, arrived on the scene. The Elk fired a shot into {{the deck of the}} Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both of the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate {{artillery}} opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies across the river. By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried across the river. On the last trip across, most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, <b>elk,</b> <b>and</b> pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E
