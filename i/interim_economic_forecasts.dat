40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> play an {{increasing}} role in U. S. budgetary and fiscal policies. This paper analyzes the accuracy and bias of <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{prepared by the}} Executive Branch and Congress. Short-run forecasts by the Executive Branch for the forthcoming year do not appear biased. They are as accurate as private forecasts and the forecasts of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO); they are not sensitive to political {{factors such as the}} size of the deficit. At the same time, the accuracy of Executive branch's short-run <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> has not improved over the period from 1962 to 1984, and the forecasts themselves can be well approximated by simple, single-equation models that use a small number of variables. In contrast to short-run <b>forecasts,</b> long-run <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> of both the Executive branch and CBO are consistently optimistic. The degree of optimism increases with the length of the forecasting horizon and the degree of fiscal pressure the year in which they are issued. The Reagan Administration's long-run forecasts, while typically optimistic, have not been rosier than those issued under previous administrations. ...|$|R
40|$|The world {{economic}} environment is currently undergoing drastic changes, such as <b>economic</b> <b>forecasting.</b> It {{is a complex}} and challenging task because of the following reasons: i) there is no economic model which carries conviction, ii) economic time series are intrinsically very unreliable and generally have poor signal to accurate results, iii) non stationary and iv) non linearity. In this paper we propose an <b>economic</b> <b>forecasting</b> based on association rules and neural network. Our study concludes that our model can improve the prediction ability by using frequent itemsets and predicted attribute as input fields.
