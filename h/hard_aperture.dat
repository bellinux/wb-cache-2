50|$|To {{favor the}} pulsed mode over cw, the cavity {{could be made}} {{unstable}} for cw-operation, but more often a low stability is a by-product of a cavity design putting emphasis on aperture effects. Older designs used a <b>hard</b> <b>aperture,</b> that simply cuts off, while modern designs use a soft aperture, that means the overlap between the pumped region of the gain medium and the pulse. While {{the effect of a}} lens on a free laser beam is quite obvious, inside a cavity the whole beam tries to adapt to this change. The standard cavity with flat mirrors and a thermal lens in the laser crystal has the smallest beam width on the end-mirrors. With the additional Kerr lens the width on the end-mirror gets even smaller. Therefore, small end-mirrors (<b>hard</b> <b>aperture)</b> favor pulses. In Ti:Sapphire oscillators telescopes are inserted around the crystal to increase the intensity.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{generate}} saturable absorber action. One can use real saturable absorbers, such as semiconductors or dyes and solid-state laser media. One can also exploit artificial saturable absorbers. The two most prominent artificial saturable absorber modelocking techniques are called Kerr-LensModeLocking(KLM) andAdditivePulseModeLocking(APM). APM is sometimes also called Coupled-Cavity Mode Locking (CCM). KLM was invented in the early 90 ’s [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], but was already predicted to occur much earlier [8][9][10]· 7. 1 Kerr-Lens Mode Locking (KLM) The general principle behind Kerr-Lens Mode Locking is sketched in Fig. 7. 1. A pulse that builds up in a laser cavity containing a gain medium and a Kerr medium experiences not only self-phase modulation but also self focussing, that is nonlinear lensing of the laser beam, due to the nonlinear refractive index of the Kerr medium. A spatio-temporal laser pulse propagating through the Kerr medium has a time dependent mode size as higher intensities acquire stronger focussing. If a <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> is placed at the right position in the cavity, it strips of the wings of the pulse, leading to a shortening of the pulse. Such combined mechanism has the same effect as a saturable absorber. If the electronic Kerr effect with response time of a few femtoseconds or less is used, a fast saturable absorber has been created. Instead of a sep- 257 258 CHAPTER 7.

40|$|Abstract Saccades {{are made}} {{thousands}} of {{times a day and}} are the principal means of localizing objects in our environment. However, the saccade system faces the challenge of accurately localizing objects as they are constantly moving relative to the eye and head. Any delays in processing could cause errors in saccadic localization. To compensate for these delays, the saccade system might use one or more sources of information to predict future target locations, including changes in position of the object over time, or its motion. Another possibility is that motion influences the represented position of the object for saccadic targeting, without requiring an actual change in target position. We tested whether the saccade system can use motion-induced position shifts to update the represented spa-tial location of a saccade target, by using static drifting Gabor patches with either a soft or a <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> as saccade targets. In both conditions, the aperture always remained at a fixed retinal location. The soft aperture Gabor patch resulted in an illusory position shift, whereas the <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> stimulus maintained the motion signals but resulted in a smaller illusory position shift. Thus, motion energy and target location were equated, but a position shift was generated in only one condi-tion. We measured saccadic localization of these targets and found that saccades were indeed shifted, but only with a soft-aperture Gabor patch. Our results suggest that motion shifts the programmed locations of saccade targets, and this remapped location guides saccadic localization. Keywords 2 -Dmotion. Eyemovements.

In a hollow electron beam collimator, electrons enclose the circulating beam. Their electric charge kicks halo particles transversely. If their distribution is axially symmetric, the beam core is unaffected. This device is complementary to conventional two-stage collimation systems: the electron beam can be placed arbitrarily close to the circulating beam; and particle removal is smooth, so that the device is a diffusion enhancer rather than a <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> limitation. The concept was tested in the Tevatron collider using a hollow electron gun installed in one of the existing electron lenses.

On {{the basis of}} the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and by introducing a <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> function into a finite sum of complex Gaussian functions, the approximate analytical expression for the spectral intensity of chirped Gaussian pulses diffracted by an annular aperture in the turbulent atmosphere is derived.

The relative spectral shift of diffracted chirped Gaussian pulses in the turbulent atmosphere versus the different values of the radius of the annular aperture and the different values of the position parameter are also studied and illustrated with numerical calculations. The results of this work have potential applications in information encoding and transmission in a turbulent atmosphere. (c) 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

40|$|Estimating {{the angular}} {{separation}} between two incoherently radiating monochromatic point sources is a canonical toy problem to quantify spatial resolution in imaging. In recent work, Tsang et al. showed, using a Fisher Information analysis, that Rayleigh's resolution limit {{is just an}} artifact of the conventional wisdom of intensity measurement in the image plane. They showed that the optimal sensitivity of estimating the angle is only {{a function of the}} total photons collected during the camera's integration time but entirely independent of the angular separation itself no matter how small it is, and found the information-optimal mode basis, intensity detection in which achieves the aforesaid performance. We extend the above analysis, which was done for a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) to a hard-aperture pupil proving the information optimality of image-plane sinc-Bessel modes, and generalize the result further to an arbitrary PSF. We obtain new counterintuitive insights on energy vs. information content in spatial modes, and extend the Fisher Information analysis to exact calculations of minimum mean squared error, both for Gaussian and <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> pupils.

Its functions include protection of components from accidental and intentional energy deposition, reduction of backgrounds, and beam diagnostics. Conventional multi-stage systems based on scatterers and absorbers offer robust shielding and efficient collection of losses. Two complementary concepts have been proposed to address some of the limitations of conventional systems: channeling and volume reflection in bent crystals and collimation with hollow electron beams. The main focus of this paper is the hollow electron beam collimator, a novel concept based on the interaction of the circulating beam with a 5 -keV, magnetically confined, pulsed hollow electron beam in a 2 -m-long section of the ring.

40|$|Electron vortex beams (EVBs) are an {{appealing}} topic, both in fundamental science and for practical applications in electron microscopy [1, 2]. Some {{of the most}} promising applications require beams that have large orbital angular momentum (OAM) [2, 3, 4]. Here, we demonstrate the largest (L= 1000 ħ) high quality EVB by using electron beam lithography (EBL) to fabricate a phase hologram. EBL provides superior fabrication quality and a larger number of addressable points when compared with focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We measure the OAM of the generated EVB through propagation after a <b>hard</b> <b>aperture</b> cut [5]. Comparisons with simulations confirm an average OAM of (960 ± 120) ħ, which is consistent with the intended value. A clear improvement when compared with a FIB-nanofabricated hologram is demonstrated in terms of 1) the maximum OAM that can be reached; 2) the minimum feature size (33 nm in the present study); 3) the improved uniformity of the frequency response; 4) the better suppression of higher order diffraction due to a nearly perfect rectangular groove profile. We believe that EBL will be the fabrication technique of choice for most new diffractive optics with electrons in the future, permitting more complex holograms and new applications in material science...|$|E
