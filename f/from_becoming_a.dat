On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population.

5|$|Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll is {{an annual}} survey of roller coasters {{from around the}} world. It {{is widely regarded as}} the best and most accurate of any roller coaster poll available due to its ranking algorithm which prevents the poll <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> popularity contest. In the poll, Thunder Run entered at position 30 in 1994, maintaining an average of 54 for the 17 years that followed. The ride's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below.|$|E

It was Ralph Hawkes who championed Britten {{when he was still}} {{relatively}} unknown, often against the rest of the board of directors, until the première on 7 June 1945 of Peter Grimes, which was a critical and popular success. Sheet music sales soared during the War, enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy Editions Russes which held the rights to the most valuable works of Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. The company also purchased the lease of the Royal Opera House in London in 1944, rescuing it <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> permanent dance hall and providing a venue for world-class ballet and opera in the capital.|$|E

5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that had been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E

5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry.

5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry {{was run by}} Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; Bird was {{formally}} fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper arrived on Antigua. Blom-Cooper began work on 4 June, with Bird retaining a team of six lawyers for his defence; the inquiry, concluded in November, recommended banning Bird from holding public office {{for the rest of}} his life. The report was acted on and Bird was banned <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> minister again, although he retained his seat in the House. The report did not, however, recommend that Bird be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally; it was felt that the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough. Bird was later re-hired by the government, not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities. After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda's leader on 5 September 1995, Bird was made Chairman of the ALP.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E

5|$|In February 1770, Pulaski moved near Nowy Targ, and in March, {{helped to}} subdue the mutiny of Józef Bierzyński. Based in Izby, he {{subsequently}} operated in southern Lesser Poland and on May 13 his force was defeated at the Battle of Dęborzyn. Around June 9–10 in Prešov, {{in a conference}} with other Confederate leaders, he met Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who complimented Pulaski on his actions. On July 3–4, Pulaski's camp was captured by Johann von Drewitz, and {{he was forced to}} retreat into Austria. Early in August he met with the French emissary, Charles François Dumouriez. He disregarded an order to take Lanckoronna and instead cooperated with Michał Walewski in a raid on Kraków on the night of August 31. He then departed for Częstochowa. On September 10, along with Walewski, he used subterfuge {{to take control of the}} Jasna Góra monastery. On September 18 he met Franciszka z Krasińskich, an aristocrat from the Krasiński family and the wife of Charles of Saxony, Duke of Courland; he impressed her and she would become one of his protectors. Around September 22–24 Walewski was made the commandant of Jasna Góra, which slighted Pulaski. Nonetheless he continued as the de facto commander of Confederate troops stationed in and around Jasna Góra. Between September 10, 1770, and January 14, 1771, Pulaski, Walewski and Józef Zaremba commanded the Polish forces during the siege of Jasna Góra monastery. They successfully defended against Drewitz in a series of engagements, the largest one on November 11, followed by a siege from December 31 to January 14. The defense of Jasna Góra further enhanced his reputation among the Confederates and abroad. A popular Confederate song taunting Drewitz included lyrics about Pulaski and Jasna Góra. Pulaski intended to pursue Drewitz, but a growing discord between him and Zaremba prevented this <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> real option.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and final case, Phoenix is visiting a {{mountain}} retreat with Maya and Pearl when a fellow guest, Elise Deauxnim, is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and prosecutor to keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains that Elise is really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death {{was the result of}} a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now deceased Dahlia, who turns out to be Iris's twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is Dahlia impersonating Iris, she is using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, Dahlia is exorcised from Maya and Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent many years blaming Phoenix for Mia's death, he sought revenge, but concedes that Phoenix has done more to continue her legacy than him. Iris also reveals that she posed as Dahlia while Phoenix was attending college to protect him, ended up falling in love with him, and that she regrets her failure to stop her sister <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> criminal. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-day}} rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with {{three games in}} five days, {{starting}} with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead {{to open up the}} game, only to give it back up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would not get any closer than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, but still a few seasons away <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.|$|E

He runs to the laboratory to shift to the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe <b>from</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> dictator, leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a catastrophy and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and is not expected to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that they are like family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E
