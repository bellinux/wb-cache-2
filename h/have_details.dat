60|$|In {{the whole}} range of Turner's works, recent or of old date, you will not find an {{instance}} of anything near enough to <b>have</b> <b>details</b> visible, painted in sky blue. Wherever Turner gives blue, there he gives atmosphere; it is air, not object. Blue he gives to his sea; so does nature;--blue he gives, sapphire-deep, to his extreme distance; so does nature;--blue he gives to the misty shadows and hollows of his hills; so does nature: but blue he gives not, where detail and illumined surface are visible; as he comes into light and character, so he breaks into warmth and varied hue; nor is there in one of his works, and I speak of the Academy pictures especially, one touch of cold color which is not to be accounted for, and proved right and full of meaning.|$|E

6000|$|One {{sad thing}} there was, though Friedrich {{did not yet}} know how sad, in this Review-journey: the new fit of illness that overtook his Majesty. From Pollnitz, who was of the party, we <b>have</b> <b>details</b> on that head. In his Majesty's last bad illness, five years ago, when all seemed hopeless, it appears the {{surgeons}} had relieved him,--in fact recovered him, bringing off the bad humors in quantity,--by an incision in the foot or leg. In {{the course of the}} present fatigues, this old wound broke out again; which of course stood {{much in the way of}} his Majesty; and could not be neglected, as probably the causes of it were. A regimental surgeon, Pollnitz says, was called in; who, in two days, healed the wound,--and declared all to be right again; though in fact, as we may judge, it was dangerously worse than before. [...] "All well here," [...] writes Friedrich; [...] "the King has been out of order, but is now entirely recovered (TOUT A FAIT REMIS)." [...] ["Konigsberg, 30th July, 1739," [...] to his Wife (OEuvres, xxvi. 6).] ...|$|E
60|$|So Raleigh returns, anchors in Plymouth. He {{finds that}} Captain North has brought home {{the news of}} his mishaps, {{and that there is}} a {{proclamation}} against him, which, by the bye, lies, for it talks of limitations and cautions given to Raleigh which do not appear in his commission; and, moreover, that a warrant is out for his apprehension. He sends his men on shore, and starts for London to surrender himself, in company with faithful Captain King, who alone clings to him to the last, and from whom we <b>have</b> <b>details</b> of the next few days. Near Ashburton he is met by Sir Lewis Stukely, his near kinsman, Vice-Admiral of Devon, who has orders to arrest him. Raleigh tells him that he has saved him the trouble; and the two return to Plymouth, where Stukely, strangely enough, leaves him at liberty and rides about the country. We should be slow in imputing baseness: but one cannot help suspecting from Stukely's subsequent conduct that he had from the first private orders to give Raleigh a chance of trying to escape, in order to have a handle against him, such as his own deeds had not yet given.|$|E
