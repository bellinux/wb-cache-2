Jackson also joined criticism of the British National Party (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 controversy surrounding party leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the panel show Question Time. He accused the BNP of [...] "hijacking" [...] military symbols, saying [...] "the BNP <b>is</b> <b>claiming</b> that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. How dare they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?" [...] He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces' reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannatt [...] "war criminals". A disagreement between Jackson and then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in Afghanistan, saying that the Army had pushed [...] "too hard" [...] when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Jackson countered by saying that the UK should play a decisive role and that the drawdown of troops from Iraq meant the UK had the capability for a larger increase.|$|E

500|$|The CPC's {{organizational}} {{principle is}} democratic centralism, {{which is based}} on two principles; democracy (synonymous in official discourse with [...] "socialist democracy" [...] and [...] "inner-party democracy") and centralism. This has been the guiding organizational principle of the party since the 5th National Congress, held in 1927. In the words of the party constitution, [...] "The Party is an integral body organized under its program and constitution and on the basis of democratic centralism". Mao once quipped that democratic centralism was [...] "at once democratic and centralized, with the two seeming opposites of democracy and centralization united in a definite form." [...] Mao claimed that the superiority of democratic centralism lay in its internal contradictions, between democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline. Currently, the CPC <b>is</b> <b>claiming</b> that [...] "democracy is the lifeline of the Party, the lifeline of socialism". But for democracy to be implemented, and functioning properly, there needs to be centralization. The goal of democratic centralism was not to obliterate capitalism or its policies but instead it is the movement towards regulating capitalism while involving socialism and democracy. [...] Democracy in any form, the CPC claims, needs centralism, since without centralism there will be no order. According to Mao, democratic centralism [...] "is centralized on the basis of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance. This is the only system that can give full expression to democracy with full powers vested in the people's congresses at all levels and, at the same time, guarantee centralized administration with the governments at each level exercising centralized management of all the affairs entrusted to them by the people's congresses at the corresponding level and safeguarding whatever is essential to the democratic life of the people".|$|E

The speaker states that his art is [...] "poor but free", [...] "poor" [...] in a sense that it is missing one of the perfect seven rhymes found in typical sonnet structure, but has only six, an imperfect structure missing an important piece, alluding to the mindset of the speaker in his loss of the Fair Youth's affections, directly corresponding to the [...] "mutual render" [...] embodied in the rhyme scheme and the [...] "mutual render" [...] he feels towards his beloved. In effect, the atypical character of the [...] "mutual render" [...] binding the a rhymes of sonnet 125 is a literal testimony of the selfless generosity that the speaker ascribes to the [...] "mutual render” he and his beloved share - [...] "only me for thee".|$|E
