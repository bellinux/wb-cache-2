5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit.</b> However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

5|$|Luongo {{recorded}} a 3–1 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> for fears his windpipe would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E

25|$|Cryoablation: Cryoablation is a {{technique}} used to destroy tissue using cold temperature. The tumor is not removed and the destroyed cancer is left to be reabsorbed by the body. Initial results in properly selected patients with unresectable liver tumors are equivalent to those of resection. Cryosurgery involves the placement of a stainless steel probe {{into the center of}} the tumor. Liquid nitrogen is circulated through the end of this device. The tumor and a half inch margin of normal liver are frozen to -190nbsp&°C for 15 minutes, which is lethal to all tissues. The area is thawed for 10 minutes and then re-frozen to -190nbsp&°C for another 15 minutes. After the tumor has thawed, the probe is removed, bleeding is controlled, and the procedure is complete. The patient will spend the first post-operative night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> and typically is discharged in 3 – 5 days. Proper selection of patients and attention to detail in performing the cryosurgical procedure are mandatory in order to achieve good results and outcomes. Frequently, cryosurgery is used in conjunction with liver resection as some of the tumors are removed while others are treated with cryosurgery.|$|E
40|$|Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is {{associated}} with nosocomial infections worldwide. Here, we used phage as a potential agent to evaluate the efficacy of daily cleaning practices combined with a bacteriophage-containing aerosol against CRAB. A two-phase prospective intervention study was performed at a 945 -bed public teaching hospital. From March to December 2013, we performed terminal cleaning using standard procedures plus an aerosol with active bacteriophage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> units to evaluate the impact on nosocomial incidence density, carbapenem-resistance rates and antimicrobial drug consumption amounts. Patients with culture proven CRAB infection were transferred to the isolation room when the phage aerosol cleaning had been completed. A total of 264 new acquisitions of CRAB were identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> units (191 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-intervention period and 73 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intervention period). The rates of new acquisitions of CRAB <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> units decreased from 8. 57 per 1000 patient-days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-intervention period to 5. 11 per 1000 patient-days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intervention period (p = 0. 0029).
