5|$|In the October 1917 elections, the Social Democrats {{lost their}} {{absolute}} majority, which radicalized {{the labor movement}} and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with political development based on the commoners' interpretation of the ideas of Fennomania and socialism, the events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives easily {{passed the}} bill in just seven days. The most {{contentious}} issue was the inclusion of Section 7(a), which protected collective bargaining rights for unions.

Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E

Thus, while he deposed John Langton, Prior of Tynemouth, for disobedience to his ‘Visitors’, he gave letters testimonial for the absolution of a priest who, by misadventure, had committed homicide. [...] He manumitted certain villeins and their children.

She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike croquet, both balls must be {{staked out}} in the same turn <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> {{outright}} <b>win</b> the game.

Thus, unlike croquet, one side cannot defensively [...] "stake-out" [...] an opponent's rover in roque.|$|R

5|$|Quwatli {{returned}} to Syria in 1955, following {{the ouster of}} President Adib al-Shishakli and during the presidency of Hashim al-Atassi. Quwatli entered his candidacy in the August 1955 presidential elections, {{at the age of}} 63. Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win,</b> Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.|$|E
5|$|The date of Paston’s letter {{suggests}} {{the marriage was}} still being negotiated in February 1472. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> his brother George’s final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of Warwick’s land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife’s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E

5000|$|Although Marois {{was widely}} {{perceived}} as a staunch supporter of the centre-right direction of the PQ under Lucien Bouchard who promised [...] "zero deficit" [...] <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> gain <b>winning</b> conditions for a future referendum on Quebec sovereignty, the government's capitulation in the student protests {{was seen as a}} political move to ensure student support in the upcoming general election. Historically, students had been a key voting bloc for the PQ.|$|R
