2500|$|In the end, a new {{long-range}} jungle penetration {{operation was}} planned, this time using {{all six of}} the brigades recently allocated to Wingate. The second long-range penetration mission was originally intended as a coordinated effort with a planned regular army offensive against northern Burma, but events on the ground resulted in cancellation of the army offensive, leaving the long-range penetration groups without a means of transporting all six brigades into Burma. Upon Wingate's return to India, he found that his mission had also been cancelled for lack of air transport. Wingate took the news bitterly, voicing disappointment to all who would listen, including Allied commanders such as Colonel Philip Cochran of the 1st Air Commando Group, which {{proved to be a}} blessing in disguise. Cochran told Wingate that cancelling the long-range mission was unnecessary; only a limited amount of aerial transport would be needed since, in addition to the light planes and C-47 Dakotas Wingate had counted on, Cochran explained that 1st Air Commando had 150 gliders to haul supplies: [...] "Wingate’s dark <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> as Phil explained that the gliders could also move a sizable force of troops. The general immediately spread a map on the floor and planned how his Chindits, airlifted deep into the jungle, could fan out from there and fight the Japanese".|$|E

40|$|Living dolls’ is a {{term that}} emerged online during 2010 to {{describe}} {{a group of women}} who participate in the practice of appearing ‘doll-like’. Living dolls take part in a number of beauty techniques in order to achieve a doll appearance through, for example, using wide-rimmed contact lenses, hair extensions and corsetry.

500|$|At peak intensity, Maysak had {{a nearly}} {{symmetric}} eye {{with an almost}} perfect ring of convection around it, with characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone. On April1, the <b>eye</b> <b>widened</b> to about [...] after undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, and the storm began to weaken, with diminished intensity of the convection. The convection weakened significant in the storm's southern quadrant due to drier air and worsening upper level conditions. On April1, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started tracking Maysak, giving it the local name Chedeng. The <b>eye</b> <b>widened</b> further as dry air wrapped into the center, and stronger wind shear diminished the convection. On April4, the JMA downgraded Maysak to a severe tropical storm, and later that day further to a tropical storm. The storm continued to weaken as it approached the Philippines, and late on April4 the convection began dislocating from the circulation. On April5, Maysak made landfall along east-central Luzon as a minimal tropical storm, {{making it one of}} only eight storms to strike the island between January and April since 1945. Soon after it degraded into a tropical depression, and the weakening storm crossed Luzon with scattered thunderstorms. After emerging into the South China Sea, the system continued to the west-northwest, and Maysak dissipated on April7.|$|R
