Data were obtained with instrumentation capable of directly observing the variation of shock wave movement with time. Good similarity of <b>free</b> <b>air</b> shock peak <b>overpressure</b> with larger scale data was found to exist. The net effect of surface roughness on shock {{peak overpressure}}s slightly. Surface roughness delayed the Mach stem formation at the greatest charge height and lowered the growth at all burst heights.

40|$|Mines, quarries, and {{construction}} sites face environmental damages due to blasting environmental impacts such as ground vibration and <b>air</b> <b>overpressure.</b> These phenomena may cause damage to structures, groundwater, and {{ecology of the}} nearby area. Several empirical predictors have been proposed by various scholars to estimate ground vibration and <b>air</b> <b>overpressure,</b> but these methods are inapplicable in many conditions. However, prediction of ground vibration and <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> is complicated {{as a consequence of}} the fact that a large number of influential parameters are involved. In this study, a hybrid model of an artificial neural network and a particle swarm optimization algorithm was implemented to predict ground vibration and <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> induced by blasting. To develop this model, 88 datasets including the parameters with the greatest influence on ground vibration and <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> were collected from a granite quarry site in Malaysia. The results obtained by the proposed model were compared with the measured values as well as with the results of empirical predictors. The results indicate that the proposed model is an applicable and accurate tool to predict ground vibration and <b>air</b> <b>overpressure</b> induced by blasting...|$|R

A total of 210 explosive shots were monitored producing 2048 time histories of ground motions recorded in the vertical, radial, and transverse directions, in addition to recording <b>air</b> <b>overpressures.</b> The data were analyzed for peak particle velocities and peak <b>air</b> <b>overpressures,</b> then plotted versus scaled range.

AIREAL is a novel haptic technology that delivers effective and expressive tactile sensations in <b>free</b> <b>air,</b> without requiring the user to wear a physical device. Combined with interactive computers graphics, AIREAL enables users to feel virtual 3 D objects, experience <b>free</b> <b>air</b> textures and receive haptic feedback on gestures performed in free space. AIREAL relies on air vortex generation directed by an actuated flexible nozzle to provide effective tactile feedback with a 75 degrees field of view, and within an 8. 5 cm resolution at 1 meter. AIREAL is a scalable, inexpensive and practical <b>free</b> <b>air</b> haptic technology {{that can be used in}} a broad range of applications, including gaming, mobile applications, and gesture interaction among many others.

50|$|Barrier {{isolator}} is {{a general}} term that includes two types of devices: isolators and restricted access barriers (RABS). Both are devices that provide a physical and aerodynamic (<b>air</b> <b>overpressure)</b> barrier between the external clean room environment and a work process. The isolator design is the more dependable of the two barrier design choices, as it prevents contamination hazards by achieving a more comprehensive separation of the processing environment from the surrounding facility. Nonetheless, both Isolator and RABS designs are contemporary approaches developed over the last 35 years and a great advancement over designs of the 1950s-70s that were far more prone to microbial contamination problems.|$|R
40|$|Open Top Chamber (OTC) and <b>Free</b> <b>Air</b> CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) are {{currently}} the prevailing approaches to study plant responses to elevated carbon dioxide. Method-inherent characteristics of either method distinctively influence results. Advantages {{and disadvantages of}} both methods are reviewed here, leading {{to the conclusion that}} Open Top Chambers seem to be more suitable for investigating the physiological responses of single trees to high levels of carbon dioxide, while <b>Free</b> <b>Air</b> CO 2 Enrichment systems are more useful for studying the effects of elevated carbon dioxide on whole forest ecosystems since they have a large diameter, thus allowing to work with larger trees. <b>Free</b> <b>Air</b> CO 2 Enrichment systems also provide a natural microclimate, thus leading to ecologically more meaningful results. Methods involving Screen-Aided CO 2 Control (SACC) are proposed as a compromise eliminating disadvantages and combining advantages of both the Open Top Chamber and the <b>Free</b> <b>Air</b> CO 2 Enrichment methods. Considering the wide variety of experiments under a range of additional environmental factors it is difficult to identify a typical bias that may be inherent in the data generated by the Open Top Chamber and the <b>Free</b> <b>Air</b> CO 2 Enrichment. Meta analysis of large number of past studies revealed that Open Top Chamber experiments produce a stronger growth enhancing effect of carbon dioxide than <b>Free</b> <b>Air</b> CO 2 Enrichment experiments.
