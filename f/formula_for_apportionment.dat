[...] Under it, the state's population was divided by 100, with the resulting quotient being {{the ratio of}} representation in the House of Representatives. Any county with a population equal to {{at least half the}} ratio was entitled to one representative; a county with a population of less than half the ratio was grouped with an adjacent county for districting; a county containing a population of at least one and three-fourths the ratio was entitled to two representatives; a county with a population equal to three times the ratio was entitled to three representatives. To determine Senate districts, a similar procedure was followed; the starting point, however was figured by dividing the state's population by 35. The ratios for the House and Senate and the resulting apportionment was determined by a board consisting of the governor, auditor, and secretary of state." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} analysed the apportionment of dual-purpose expenditure. In doing so, {{two categories}} of dual-expenditure were examined: expenditure that has been incurred for both trade and non-trade purposes, and expenditure that has been incurred to produce both taxable and exempt income. In conducting this analysis, this thesis set out to answer three questions: has the apportionment of dual-purpose expenditure been officially sanctioned in South Africa, when does the need <b>for</b> <b>apportionment</b> arise, and on what basis should a taxpayer apportion expenditure that has been incurred for a dual purpose? A doctrinal methodology {{was applied to the}} documentary data which consisted of relevant tax legislation; South African, Australian and English case law; and commentary of experts in the field of tax law. From the analysis performed, it was revealed that the apportionment of dual-purpose expenditure has been officially sanctioned in South Africa. In addition, it was concluded that the applicable legal principles for determining the need <b>for</b> <b>apportionment</b> and <b>for</b> performing the <b>apportionment</b> calculation are clear and well-established. The difficulty which taxpayers, the courts and the South African Revenue Service face, however, is applying these principles in practice. This research therefore concluded {{that there is a need}} for further guidance in this complex area of tax law.
