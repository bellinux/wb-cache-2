50|$|Tax-free {{commuter}} benefits, {{also known}} as qualified transportation fringes, are employer provided voluntary benefit programs that allow employees to reduce their monthly commuting expenses for transit, vanpooling, bicycling, and work-related parking costs. The benefit is a federal tax benefit authorized under the Internal Revenue Code Section 132(a), Qualified Transportation Fringes.

40|$|The {{child and}} {{dependent}} care tax credit (CDCTC) is a nonrefundable tax credit {{designed to help}} offset the expenses of providing care for {{children under the age}} of 13 or disabled dependents as long as a parent or caretaker is working or searching for work. 1 One-earner couples are not eligible for the credit. Under current law, <b>eligible</b> <b>expenses</b> are limited to the lesser of $ 3, 000 per child (up to a maximum of $ 6, 000) or the earnings of the lesser-earning spouse. The maximum credit is reduced by any tax-free child-care benefits paid by an employer. The credit rate applied to <b>eligible</b> <b>expenses</b> is 35 percent for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) less than $ 15, 000, phasing down to 20 percent for those with AGI greater than $ 43, 000. Thus, in theory, a low-income family could qualify for a maximum $ 2, 100 credit (35 percent of $ 6, 000). The credit is not refundable, however, and families with incomes under $ 15, 000 generally owe little or no income tax. Thus, the theoretical maximum rarely applies in practice. The expansions to the CDCTC enacted by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) expire at the end of 2010. After that, the maximum <b>eligible</b> <b>expenses</b> revert to $ 2, 400 per child (up to a maximum of $ 4, 800) and the highest credit rate falls to 30 percent. Finally, a temporary provision that allowed the use of the CDCTC against both regular tax and AMT liability regardless of tentative AMT expired at the end of 2006. Unless the provision is extended (or the AMT is reformed or repealed) many middle- and upper-middle-income households could lose some or all of the benefits of the CDCTC beginning in 2007.
