25|$|Low {{conscientiousness}} {{has been}} linked to antisocial and criminal behaviors, as well as unemployment, homelessness, and imprisonment. Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness taken together are also associated with substance abuse. People low in conscientiousness have difficulty saving money and have different borrowing practices than conscientious people. High conscientiousness is associated with more careful planning of shopping trips and less <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> of unneeded items. Conscientiousness {{has been found to be}} positively correlated with business white collar crime.|$|E
25|$|Parrots may {{not make}} good pets for most people because of their natural wild {{instincts}} such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> from unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated budgerigar, a small parrot, {{is the most popular}} of all pet bird species. In 1992, the newspaper USA Today published that 11 million pet birds were in the United States alone, many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the rose-ringed parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the Elder. As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl says in his 1987 book The Grey Parrot that some importers had parrots drink only coffee while they were shipped by boat, believing that pure water was detrimental and that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that the caffeine in coffee is toxic to birds.|$|E

2500|$|Herd {{behaviour}} {{in marketing}} {{has been used}} to explain the dependencies of customers' mutual behaviour. The Economist reported a recent conference in Rome {{on the subject of the}} simulation of adaptive human behaviour. It shared mechanisms to increase <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> and get people [...] "to buy more by playing on the herd instinct." [...] The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including smart card technology and the use of Radio Frequency Identification Tag technology. A [...] "swarm-moves" [...] model was introduced by a Florida Institute of Technology researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can [...] "increase sales without the need to give people discounts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Impulse {{purchases}} are unplanned purchases. <b>Impulse</b> <b>buying</b> can {{be defined}} as “a sudden and powerful urge to buy immediately” and occurs when a consumer purchases an item which they had no intention of purchasing prior to entering the store. <b>Impulse</b> <b>buying</b> can be influenced by external stimuli such as store characteristics and sale promotions, internal stimuli such as enjoyment and self-identity, situational and product related factors such as time and money available, and demographic and socio-cultural factors such as gender, age, and education. Stern introduced the four broad classifications of <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> including pure <b>impulse</b> <b>buying,</b> reminded <b>impulse</b> <b>buying,</b> suggestion <b>impulse</b> <b>buying,</b> and planned impulse buying: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Impulse</b> <b>buying</b> {{results from}} consumers’ failure to weigh their options before buying a product. <b>Impulse</b> <b>buying</b> is “any {{purchase}} that a shopper makes {{that has not}} been planned… is sudden and immediate”. [...] For example, if a consumer has no intention of buying a product before entering a store, but purchases an item without any forethought, that is <b>impulse</b> <b>buying.</b> Product manufactures want to promote and encourage this instant purchase impulse in consumers. Buyers can be very quick to make purchases without thinking about the consequences when a product is perceived to be a good deal. [...] Therefore, sales companies “increasingly implement promotional campaigns that will be effective in triggering consumer <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> behavior” to increase sales and profit.|$|E
50|$|In {{shopping}} mall design, the Gruen transfer (also {{known as the}} Gruen effect) is the moment when consumers enter a {{shopping mall}} or store and, surrounded by an intentionally confusing layout, lose track of their original intentions, making consumers more susceptible to make <b>impulse</b> <b>buys.</b> It is named for Austrian architect Victor Gruen, who disavowed such manipulative techniques.|$|R
50|$|Large {{hardware}} {{stores such as}} Home Depot often sell larger tools, such as drills or electric saws, for cost or below. They do this expecting customers to buy accessories such as blades, drill bits, stands, or cases, along with the new tool.

5000|$|<b>Impulse</b> <b>buying</b> {{disrupts}} the normal decision making models in consumers' brains. The logical {{sequence of the}} consumers' actions is replaced with an irrational moment of self gratification. Impulse items appeal to the emotional side of consumers. Some items bought on impulse are not considered functional or necessary in the consumers' lives. Preventing <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> involves techniques such as setting budgets before shopping and taking time out before the purchase is made.|$|E
50|$|Suggestion impulse buying: Occurs when a {{consumer}} sees {{a product that}} they have no prior knowledge about, envisions a use for it, and decides that they need it. An example of suggestion <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> is when {{a consumer}} is encouraged to purchase an electric hand-mixer after having picked up a brochure from the baking department of a home-ware store. The brochure convinces the consumer of the hand-mixer's superiority over the wooden spoon she has been using. Marketing techniques that can also trigger suggestion <b>impulse</b> <b>buying</b> include long-term warranties or a free trial period.|$|E
50|$|The Cadbury {{purchase}} gave Kraft 14.8 {{percent of}} the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of Cadbury distribution in the developing markets of India, Brazil, and Mexico.

50|$|This {{contrasts}} with the three more easily influenced parent types, ‘Kids Pals’, ‘Indulgers’ and ‘Conflicteds’. Kids Pals are identified as being relaxed and young, indulgers seem to buy their children’s affection, making up for their lack of parental contact time, and thirdly the Conflicteds who don’t deliberately <b>impulse</b> <b>buy,</b> but {{continue to do so}} anyway, this group is more likely to submit to persistence. Indeed, when parents say 'no' they are often then subjected to family conflict and strife. The scale of the issue is widespread as 74% of households said that pester power impacted on their buying habits.|$|R
50|$|For example, Simplifiers {{make over}} 50 {{percent of all}} on-line transactions. Their main {{characteristic}} is that they need easy (one-click) access to information and products as well as easy and quickly available service regarding products. Amazon.com {{is a good example}} of a company who created great on-line environment for Simplifiers. They also ‘dislike unsolicited e-mail, uninviting chat rooms, pop-up windows intended to encourage <b>impulse</b> <b>buys,</b> and other features that complicate their on- and off-line experience’. Surfers like to spend lot of time online, thus companies must have a variety of products to offer and constant update, Bargainers are looking for the best price, Connectors like to relate to others, Routiners want content and Sportsters like sport and entertainment sites.|$|R

2500|$|Chrysta Cherrie of AllMusic {{concluded}} her {{review by}} stating that, [...] "Muppets: The Green Album freshens up the franchise for the newish millennium, and Generation Z listeners will enjoy hearing current artists in this different context, but other listeners may be left reaching for their classic Muppets fare." [...] A Sputnikmusic reviewer said that [...] "too {{few of the}} artists approach the material with the right ideas". Jeremy Frye wrote that the album's potency largely depended on the nostalgia factor; [...] "If you were to see The Green Album sitting on the counter at Starbucks and consider making an <b>impulse</b> <b>buy</b> because you love The Muppets, I’d say go for it.

To entice customers into their stores from larger supermarket chains, Poundland advertise familiar brands at competitive prices, with the hope customers may then be inclined to <b>impulse</b> <b>buy</b> other products such as own-brand that they otherwise wouldn't have purchased.

40|$|Introduction In the {{physical}} world, a person experiences products and places, explores physical surroundings, and participates in location-specific activities. A buying decision {{reached in the}} real world such as which of several similar products to purchase may be influenced by the opinions and actions of others present, by clues left by those who were recently in that place, or by personal interactions with goods. For example, a nearly sold-out item surrounded by similar, heavily-stocked items suggests that many shoppers selected one model over all the others. Discussions with other customers may reveal new information about the utility of a product. A buyer tries on clothing before deciding to purchase it. A chance walk past a store advertising a discount on a favorite item may trigger an <b>impulse</b> <b>buy.</b> Electronic shopping on the Internet cannot replicate {{the physical}} shopping experience.

50|$|<b>Impulse</b> <b>buying</b> {{can also}} extend to more {{expensive}} {{items such as}} automobiles and home appliances.
