40|$|National audienceCoal power {{stations}} {{as well as}} waste incinerators produce humid acid gases which condensate in industrial chimneys. These condensates may cause corrosion of the <b>internal</b> <b>cladding</b> made of stainless steels, nickel base alloys or non metallic materials. In the aim of polluting emission reduction and material optimal choice, {{it is necessary to}} determine all the phenomena which occur throughout the chimney such as condensation and dissolution of acid gases (in this particular case, sulphur dioxide SO 2). The production of energy from fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc.) brings about the emission of gas containing sulphur compounds (SO 2, SO 3) as well as chlorine and fluorine compounds. To avoid this atmospheric pollution and its harmful effects (acid rains, impact on the health) due to hydrochloric, sulphuric and hydrofluoric acids produced in the presence of air, it is necessary to steam these flue gases. Nevertheless, a considerable quantity of residual acid gases remains in the gas discharge which also contains large amounts of water vapour. Thus, condensation may occur and by the way an acid attack of the <b>internal</b> <b>cladding</b> of the chimney. This results in high costs of maintenance and a reduction of their structural stability.

40|$|AbstractPipeline {{material}} with <b>internal</b> <b>cladding</b> or liner of corrosion resistant material {{has become more}} customary in the later years {{as a replacement for}} carbon steel with high corrosion allowance due to the high corrosivity of unprocessed hydrocarbons. Clad material however, offer new challenges in the fracture assessment methodology due to inhomogeneous material, where the backing steel usually is low alloy carbon steel of 415 or 450 MPa yield stress and the clad layer basically has a significantly lower yield stress. In addition, the weld metal mechanical properties may only be partly overmatching compared to the base material. For operational conditions where the local material utilization exceeds the elastic limit, commonly used assessment methods based on analytical fracture models such as BS 7910 might be inadequate for clad pipelines, and more detailed finite element modeling must be performed. This paper addresses the relevant load scenarios for a clad steel pipeline installed by S-lay. A dedicated finite element program, LINKpipe has been used for the analyses to verify the acceptance criteria for defects in the girth welds.

40|$|The task of {{the work}} {{presented}} here was to develop an inner diameter laser cladding head for <b>internal</b> <b>cladding</b> of barrels with a length up to 1800 mm and an internal diameter of 58 mm. The small dimensions were a big challenge for the cladding process and especially for the cladding head. So {{it was necessary to}} develop a new slim process head to reach the small and long internal depth of immersions. The new optic design of the MINIID includes many advantages of the former established IWS ID cladding head COAXID and further special features. The big challenge was to integrate all media supply like powder, water cooling, and inert gas as well as to include all optic components like optical fiber cable, lenses, mirror and finally a process control camera plus a thermocouple element. On the basis of the high immersion depth and the small diameter it was really necessary to integrate a process and temperature monitoring system. The new design of the head has enabled us to clad barrels with a minimum diameter of 50 mm. Depending on the length of the barrels even a minimum diameter of 43 mm with an immersion depth of 280 mm is possible. The head is modularly designed and can be extended in steps of 500 mm to a total immersion depth of 3000 mm. In summary the newly developed MINIID head is capable to deliver our requirements for inner cladding barrels with small dimensions...|$|E

40|$|During {{the normal}} {{operation}} of a Light Water Reactor (LWR), the fuel–cladding gap may close, {{as a result of}} several phenomena and processes, including different thermal expansion and swelling of both the fuel and the cladding (Pellet Cladding Interaction – PCI). In this equilibrium state, a significant increase of local power (like a transient power ramp in the order of 100 kW/m h), induces circumferential stresses in the cladding. In presence of corrosive fission products (i. e. iodine) and beyond specific stress threshold depending on the material, cracks typical of stress corrosion may appear and grow-up (stress corrosion cracking – SCC). These cracks may spread out from the <b>cladding</b> <b>internal</b> surface, causing the fuel failure. Investigations on fuel behavior are carried out in close connection with experimental research, operation feedback and computational analyses. To address the issue of PCI/SCC, the ‘‘BWR Inter-Ramp Project’’ is investigated by means of TRANSURANUS code. The BWR Inter-Ramp Project is part of the OECD/NEA International Fuel Performance Experiments database. It provides the experimental data of 20 BWR fuel rods during power ramp. The objective was to establish the failure-safe operating limits of representative BWR fuel rods when subjected to power ramp tests after short to medium irradiation time. The burn-up ranges from 10 to 20 MWd/kgU. The aim of the activity is to compare, investigate and summarize the main outcomes achieved after the simulations of 20 Zircaloy- 2 – UO 2 rods of various types and designs by TRANSURANUS code. Focus is given to the main variables, which are involved or may influence the simulation of cladding failure and characterize the power ramp tests. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to address the relevance of the knowledge of the boundary conditions, as well as the impact of selected parameters and code options on the simulations.

This experimental activity, called “Integral Circulation Experiment (ICE) ”, has been implemented merging the efforts of several research institutes, among which, besides ENEA, FZK, CRS 4 and University of Pisa, allowing to design an appropriate test section to be installed in the CIRCE facility. The goal of the experiments is therefore to demonstrate the technological feasibility of a heavy liquid metal (HLM) nuclear system pool-type in a relevant scale (1 MW), investigating the related thermal–hydraulic behaviour (heat source and heat exchanger coupling, primary system and downcomer coupling, gas trapping into the main stream, thermal stratification in the pool, forced and mixed convection in rod bundle) under both steady state and transient conditions.

40|$|Fuel {{performance}} {{models have}} been developed to assess the performance of ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuels that can be operated to a high burnup up to 80 - 100 MWd/kgHM in current and future Light Water Reactors (LWRs). Among the various issues raised in high burnup fuel applications, the pellet rim effect, fission gas release (FGR), and response to reactivity initiated accidents (RIA) were of special interest in this work. These phenomena were modeled by modifying the NRC licensing codes FRAPCON- 3 for normal operation and FRAP-T 6 for transient conditions. These models were verified and compared to the results of previous thorium fuel studies and high burnup uranium fuel evaluations. The buildup of plutonium in the outer rim of LWR UO[subscript 2] pellets has been observed to create a region of high fuel burnup, fission gas buildup and high porosity at the fuel rim. The power distribution of the thoria and urania fuel was calculated using a neutronics code MOCUP. Due to the lower build-up of Pu- 239 (less U- 238 in ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel) and flatter distribution of U- 233 (less resonance capture in Th- 232), thoria fuel experiences a much flatter power distribution and thus has a less severe rim effect than UO[subscript 2] fuel. To model this effect properly, a new model, THUPS (Thoria-Urania Power Shape), was developed, benchmarked with MOCUP and adapted into FRAPCON- 3. Additionally a porosity model for the rim region was introduced at high burnup to account for the larger fuel swelling and degradation of the thermal conductivity. The mechanisms of fission gas release in ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel have been found similar to those of UO[subscript 2] fuel. Therefore, the general formulations of the existing fission gas release models in FRAPCON- 3 were retained. However, the gas diffusion coefficient in thoria was adjusted to a lower level to account for the smaller observed gas release fraction in the thoria-based fuel. To model accelerated fission gas release at high burnup properly, a new athermal fission gas release model was developed. Other modifications include the thoria fuel properties, fission gas production rate, and the corrosion model to treat advanced cladding materials. The modified version of FRAPCON- 3 was calibrated using the measured fission gas release data from the Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR) program. Using the new model to calculate the gas release in typical PWR hot pins gives data that indicate that the ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel will have considerably lower fission gas release beyond a burnup of 50 MWd/kgHM. Investigation of the fuel response to an RIA included: (1) reviewing industry simulation tests to understand the mechanisms involved, (2) modifying FRAP-T 6 code to simulate the RIA tests and investigate the key contributors to fuel failure (thermal expansion, gaseous swelling, cladding burst stress), and (3) assessing thoria and urania performance during RIA event in typical LWR situations. ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel has been found to have better performance than UO[subscript 2] fuel under RIA event conditions due to its lower thermal expansion and a flatter power distribution in the fuel pellet (less power and less fission gas in the rim region). Overall, thoria has been found to have better performance than urania in both normal and off-normal conditions. However, calculations using the modified FRAPCON- 3 showed that the <b>internal</b> pressure and <b>cladding</b> corrosion at the required high burnup of 80 - 100 MWd/kgHM are not acceptable with the current fuel design. Therefore, advanced fuel designs (including larger gas plenum, larger fuel grains, advanced cladding materials), and carefully designed operating strategy (i. e. decreasing power history) were assessed and the results showed that the targeted high burnup can be achieved. Further investigation of burnup issues is needed, such as the distribution of hydrogen in the cladding for heterogeneous fuels, and response of high pressure fuel pins to a loss of coolant accident, in order to assure satisfactory high burnup behavior.
