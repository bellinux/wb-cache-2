40|$|The {{solar wind}} carves out a cavity, known as <b>the</b> heliosphere, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> warm <b>local</b> {{interstellar}} cloud, which is itself {{embedded in a}} larger hot cloud.

Thermal pressure and magnetic field pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> interstellar cloud should therefore balance the inward pressure from the hot cloud(1 - 3), and determine the size of the heliosphere. Here we present direct measurements of the density and speed of interstellar hydrogen and helium ions deep inside the Solar System, from which we derive <b>the</b> thermal pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> interstellar cloud.

50|$|Assuming {{that dark}} energy {{continues}} to make the universe expand at an accelerating rate, in about 150 billion years all galaxies outside <b>the</b> <b>Local</b> Group will pass behind the cosmological horizon.

However, an observer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Local</b> Group will continue to see distant galaxies, but events they observe will become exponentially more time dilated (and red shifted) as the galaxy approaches the horizon until time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distant galaxy seems to stop. <b>The</b> observer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Local</b> Group never actually sees the distant galaxy pass beyond the horizon and never observes events after 150 billion years in their local time.
