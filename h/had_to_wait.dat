5|$|After {{using the}} plot of the aborted 1884 {{collaboration}} with Archer to complete Widowers' Houses (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; The Philanderer, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E
