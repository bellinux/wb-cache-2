50|$|Rovering is the college-age {{program of}} the Scout Association of Japan. Usually a {{distinctive}} group emblem or the university logo is worn on the right sleeve or as a neckerchief pattern. The level itself is signified by a golden <b>hat</b> <b>brush</b> on a deep sky blue background, encircled by a rope annulus, symbolic of the World Scout Emblem.|$|E
50|$|The hat box {{became a}} popular {{item in the}} 19th century - {{matching}} the popularity of hats for both day and evening wear - and accessories were produced to assist with both storage and cleaning. While milliners often packaged designs they sold in cardboard hat boxes, more robust designs were produced for travelling. Some designs were made to store more than one hat - including designs that could store both a daytime top hat and a collapsible version for evenings, known as a gibus. They might also include storage space for items such as a <b>hat</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 25 August 1887, six {{citizens}} of Triengen found BÃ¼rstenfabrik AG Triengen with a share capital of CHF 40,000. A local businessman, Xavier Pfenniger-Vonnarburg becomes the commercial manager. By {{the start of}} the 20th Century, the company finishes building a brush woods production plant and starts production of toothbrushes, subsequently followed by hair <b>brushes,</b> cloth <b>brushes,</b> <b>hat</b> <b>brushes,</b> moustache brushes and other equipment for gardening and farming activities.|$|R
6000|$|The waiter at the Langham {{understood}} American ways perfectly, {{and when}} a young man called between three and four o'clock, asking for Mrs. Boncassen, said that Miss Boncassen was at home. The young man took off his <b>hat,</b> <b>brushed</b> up his hair, and followed the waiter up to the sitting-room. The door was opened {{and the young man}} was announced. [...] "Mr. Longstaff." ...|$|R
25|$|Lice have no wings or {{powerful}} {{legs for}} jumping, so they move using their claw-like legs to transfer from hair to hair. Normally, head lice infest a new host only by close contact between individuals, making social contacts among children and parent-child interactions more likely routes of infestation than shared combs, <b>hats,</b> <b>brushes,</b> towels, clothing, beds, or closets. Head-to-head contact {{is by far}} the most common route of lice transmission.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Pengarth's visitor looked {{positively}} annoyed. She {{leaned across}} the table towards him so that the roses in her large <b>hat</b> almost <b>brushed</b> his forehead. Her wonderful brown eyes were filled with reproach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] said Mr. Kelley, to the General, [...] "but you got balled {{up in the}} shuffle, didn't you? Let me assist you." [...] He {{picked up}} the General's <b>hat</b> and <b>brushed</b> the dust from it.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{removing}} his top <b>hat,</b> he <b>brushed</b> it round with a cuff. The great clumsy thing heated his forehead; {{in these days}} he often got a rush of blood to the head--his circulation was not what it had been.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave bowed, {{his glass}} in his hand. His lips were curled into the {{semblance of a}} smile, {{but he did not}} say a word. Lady Ruth leaned a little across the table so that the {{feathers}} of her <b>hat</b> nearly <b>brushed</b> his forehead.|$|R
60|$|I rose to my feet, {{and taking}} down my <b>hat</b> {{commenced}} to <b>brush</b> it. Mabane {{looked up from}} his work.|$|R

60|$|Presently {{they found}} {{themselves}} established between a rawboned young workingman who smelled strongly of soap, whose hair was plastered tightly against his forehead, and {{a young woman who}} leaned against the wall. The black in which she was dressed enhanced the whiteness and weariness of her face, and she sat gazing ahead of her, apparently unconscious of those who surrounded her, her hands tightly folded in her lap. In their immediate vicinity, indeed, might have been found all the variety of type seen in the ordinary street car. And in truth there were some who seemed scarcely to realize they were not in a public vehicle. An elaborately dressed female in front of them, whose expansive <b>hat</b> <b>brushed</b> her neighbours, made audible comments to a stout man with a red neck which was set in a crease above his low collar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pick up a heart," [...] he said, [...] "you fool! The {{worst of}} it is done. Why could you not say at first there was enough for two? Two?" [...] he repeated, [...] "ay, and for two hundred! But come away from here, where we may be observed; and, {{for the love of}} wisdom, {{straighten}} out your <b>hat</b> and <b>brush</b> your clothes. You could not travel two steps the figure of fun you look just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{with his}} two ladies had apartments {{in the town of}} Rosenbad; honest Warrington had lodgings hard by; the Major, on arrival at Rosenbad, had, as befitted his dignity, taken his {{quarters}} at one of the great hotels, at the Roman Emperor or the Four Seasons, where two or three hundred gamblers, pleasure-seekers, or invalids, sate down and over-ate themselves daily at the enormous table-d'hote. To this hotel Pen went on the morning after the Major's arrival, dutifully to pay his respects to his uncle, and found the latter's sitting-room duly prepared and arranged by Mr. Morgan, with the Major's <b>hats</b> <b>brushed,</b> and his coats laid out: his despatch-boxes and umbrella-cases, his guidebooks, passports, maps, and other elaborate necessaries of the English traveller, all as trim and ready as they could be in their master's own room in Jermyn Street. Everything was ready, from the medicine-bottle fresh filled from the pharmacien's, down to the old fellow's prayer-book, without which he never travelled, for he made a point of appearing at the English church at every place which he honoured with a stay [...] "Everybody did it," [...] he said; [...] "every English gentleman did it," [...] and this pious man would as soon have thought of not calling upon the English ambassador in a Continental town, as of not showing himself at the national place of worship.|$|R
60|$|What {{is called}} an awkward pause ensued; {{in fact it}} was a very awkward pause. The die was cast, the matter ended, and what were the {{principals}} to do until the ratifications had been exchanged or, a better simile perhaps, the decree nisi pronounced absolute. Mr. Champers-Haswell remarked that the weather was very cold for April, and Alan agreed with him, while Sir Robert found his <b>hat</b> and <b>brushed</b> it with his sleeve. Then Mr. Haswell, in desperation, for in minor matters he was a kindly sort of man who disliked scenes and unpleasantness, muttered something as to seeing him--Alan--at his house, The Court, in Hertfordshire, from Saturday to Monday.|$|R
5000|$|To make felt, the underhairs were shaved {{from the}} beaver pelt and {{mixed with a}} {{vibrating}} hatter's bow. The matted fabric was pummeled and boiled repeatedly, resulting in a shrunken and thickened felt. Filled over a hat-form block, the felt was pressed and steamed into shape. The <b>hat</b> maker then <b>brushed</b> the outside surface to a sheen. Beaver hats were made in various styles {{as a matter of}} civil status: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} house half-an-hour later, after dictating some letters to a newly {{installed}} secretary. He accepted a carefully <b>brushed</b> <b>hat</b> from a well-trained and perfectly respectful servant, who placed also in his hands his stick and gloves. He descended a few immaculate steps and turned westward, frowning thoughtfully. The matter with him! He knew well enough. He had taken his fate into his hands, played his cards boldly enough, but Fate {{was beginning to get}} her own back.|$|R
60|$|The {{ejaculation}} {{had been}} drawn from my companion {{by the fact that}} our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his <b>hat</b> actually <b>brushed</b> the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned {{from one to the other}} of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.|$|R
60|$|Leeby came {{but with}} a faded little book, the title already rubbed from its shabby brown covers. I opened it, and then all at once I saw before me again {{the man who wrote}} and printed it and died. He came hobbling up the brae, so bent that his body was almost at right angles to his legs, and his broken silk <b>hat</b> was {{carefully}} <b>brushed</b> as in the days when Janet, his sister, lived. There he stood {{at the top of the}} brae, panting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want any}} more {{loitering}} in the shade, and I made haste towards the station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up {{that in the first}} moment I took him for a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No <b>hat.</b> Hair parted, <b>brushed,</b> oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "People!" [...] Dickory exclaimed, and {{his heart}} beat fast with joy. Why his heart should be joyful {{he could not have}} told himself except that there was no earthly {{reason to believe that the}} persons who were making that fire near that thatched-roof house were pirates. To go to this house, {{whatever}} it might be, to take his chances there instead of remaining alone in the wide forest, was our young man's instant determination. But before he started there was something else he thought of. He took off his coat, and with a bunch of leaves he brushed it. Then he arranged the plumes of his <b>hat</b> and <b>brushed</b> some mud from them, gave himself a general shake, and was ready to make a start. All this by a fugitive pursued by savage pirates on a desert island! But Dickory was a young man, and he wore the uniform of a naval officer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} the man whose long-preserved <b>hat</b> is always <b>brushed</b> carefully, whose coat is the pattern of neatness, but still a little threadbare {{when you look at}} it,--in the colour of whose cheek there is still some touch of juvenility, but whose step is ever heavy and whose brow is always sad? The {{seriousness}} of life has pressed the smiles out of him. He has learned hardly to want anything for himself but outward decency and the common necessaries of life. Such little personal indulgences as are common to you and to me are as strange to him as ortolans or diamonds." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{they are}} made of prunes, these little figures are really decorations, {{although}} they can be eaten after Christmas. Pflaumentoffel means plum devil; (also called FeuerrÃ¼pel or Fiery Santa), although they {{are not meant to}} be devils or Santas, but chimney sweeps, all dressed in black (the prunes) with a top <b>hat</b> and a <b>brush.</b> Until the 20th century, Pflaumentoffel were sold at the Striezelmarkt on trays carried by children trying to earn some Christmas money. The artist Ludwig Richter famously portrayed these Striezelkinder in 1853 in his woodcut [...] "Ausverkauft wegen GeschÃ¤ftsaufgabe" [...] ("Sold out as giving up business"). In 1910, however, sale by children was banned at the Striezelmarkt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I may as well," [...] {{said the}} surgeon, coolly. [...] "I was about observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that {{spite of my}} best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I {{measured}} it with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule"-- pointing at it with the marlingspike--"that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir"--removing his <b>hat,</b> and <b>brushing</b> aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound-- [...] "Well, the captain there {{will tell you how}} that came there; he knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{older woman}} sank back. A long feather on her large <b>hat</b> <b>brushed</b> Isabel's cheek. The niece moved away. In {{the corner of}} the {{carriage}} she held the lilies closer, praying that her companion might restrain frank opinions. Fortunately both women enjoyed independent fortunes. Affluence represented distinct value for each one. The aunt loved money for what it bought, the niece for what it brought. Mrs. Grace reveled in splendid things, Isabel in unusual opportunities. The one reverenced abundance, the other freedom and the luxury of not overdoing anything. Neither one was congenial with the other, yet for a time, at least, it seemed necessary for their conflicting tastes to remain politely sugared. Before the world aunt and niece appeared to be in well-bred harmony. To-night the irritating chatter of Mrs. Grace kept Isabel silent. Shrugged in her corner she scarcely heard, for suddenly she was wishing that she had written to her friend in trouble, instead of going to him. But for her aunt, she would have turned back. But Isabel had done many difficult things, things that other women shrank from. Her intuitions were fine, and she seldom regretted a first impulse. Almost at once Philip Barry's letter seemed rewritten for her eyes. Sentence by sentence she pondered the tempestuous, then broken, despondent appeal. Yes, he needed her; she was glad that she had ventured to come to him. A jar against the curb furnished Mrs. Grace with petulant opportunity, and while that lady settled her hat and adjusted her ermine, Isabel grew calm for an approaching ordeal. As her aunt alighted, hotly deploring the careless driving of a new coachman, a flood of light burst from Father Barry's temporary refuge. Two women, going forth from their dead friend's little home, tarried a moment with the son, who stood in the illuminated doorway. Suddenly the priest accompanied them forward. His eager eyes had clearly outlined a coupe and faultless horses. She had come! Isabel was before his house. He bade his neighbors a crisp good night and hurried to the side of Mrs. Grace. [...] "So good of you, so good of you both!" [...] he exclaimed, searching beyond for the lady's niece, still within the carriage. Mrs. Doan moved to the open door. [...] "I was not intending to get out," [...] she told him softly. [...] "I came only with Aunt Julia, to bring these lilies for to-morrow, {{to let you know that}} I understand. When you have leisure to listen I want to help you to be brave and steadfast. You cannot--you must not give up." [...] Her voice swept over him like music.|$|R
60|$|All {{these details}} I {{observed}} afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes {{staring up at}} the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top <b>hat,</b> well <b>brushed</b> and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.|$|R
5000|$|Appearance was {{of great}} {{importance}} to Bowery B'hoys, who dressed for both flair and convenience. A typical Bowery B'hoy wore: âa black silk <b>hat,</b> smoothly <b>brushed,</b> sitting precisely upon {{the top of his}} head, hair well oiled, and lying closely to the skin, long in front, short behind, cravat a-la sailor, with the shirt collar turned over it, vest of fancy silk, large flowers, black frock coat, no jewelry, except in a few instances, where the insignia of the engine company to which the wearer belongs, as a breastpin, black pants, one or two years behind the fashion, heavy boots, and a cigar about half smoked, in the left corner of his mouth, as nearly perpendicular as it is possible to be got. He has a peculiar swing, not exactly a swagger, to his walk, but a swing, which nobody but a Bowery boy can imitate.âGeorge Foster, a travel writer, wrote in 1850:âWho are the bâhoys and gâhals of New York?...sometimes a stout clerk in a jobbing-house, oftener a junior partner at a wholesale grocery, and still more frequently a respectable young butcher with big arms and broad shoulders, in a blue coat with a silk hat and a crape wound about its base, and who is known familiarly as a âBowery Boy!'â ...|$|R
60|$|A fresh-colored, rather {{young man}} [Endnote: 3] entered the study, {{a person of}} rather cold and ungraceful manners, yet genial-looking enough; at least, not repulsive. He was dressed in rather a rough, {{serviceable}} travelling-dress, and except for a nicely <b>brushed</b> <b>hat,</b> and unmistakably white linen, was rather careless in attire. You would have thought twice, perhaps, before deciding {{him to be a}} gentleman, but finally would have decided that he was; one great token being, that the singular aspect of the room into which he was ushered, the spider festoonery, and other strange accompaniments, the grim aspect of the Doctor himself, and the beauty and intelligence of his two companions, and even that horrific weaver, the great dangling spider,--neither one nor all of these called any expression of surprise to the stranger's face.|$|R
60|$|A very sullen-faced {{man stood}} {{at the corner of}} O'Connell Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home. He was full of {{smouldering}} anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got drunk. He began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when he thought of the woman in the big <b>hat</b> who had <b>brushed</b> against him and said Pardon! his fury nearly choked him.|$|R
6000|$|Hurrying on Fogson in his dress, I {{conducted}} him, panting, {{up to the}} Major's quatriÃ¨me, {{where we}} were cheerfully bidden to come in. The little gentleman was in his travelling jacket, and occupied in painting, elegantly, one of those natty pairs of boots in which he daily promenaded the Boulevards. A couple of pairs of tough buff gloves had been undergoing some pipe-claying operation under his hands; no man stepped out so spick and span, with a <b>hat</b> so nicely <b>brushed,</b> with a stiff cravat tied so neatly under a fat little red face, with a blue frock-coat so scrupulously fitted to a punchy little person, as Major British, about whom we have written these two pages. He stared rather hardly at my companion, but gave me a kind shake of the hand, and we proceeded at once to business. [...] "Major British," [...] said I, [...] "we want your advice in regard to an unpleasant affair which has just occurred to my friend Pogson." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{made his}} appearans reglar at church--me {{carrying}} a handsome large black marocky Prayer-book and Bible, with the psalms and lessons marked out with red ribbings; and you'd have thought, as I graivly laid the volloms down before him, {{and as he}} berried {{his head in his}} nicely <b>brushed</b> <b>hat,</b> before service began, that such a pious, proper morl, young nobleman was not {{to be found in the}} whole of the peeridge. It was a comfort to look at him. Efry old tabby and dowyger at my Lord Bobtail's turned up the wights of their i's when they spoke of him, and vowed they had never seen such a dear, daliteful, exlent young man. What a good son he must be, they said; and oh, what a good son-in-law! He had the pick of all the English gals at Paris before we had been there 3 months. But, unfortunately, most of them were poar; and love and a cottidge was not quite in master's way of thinking.|$|R
