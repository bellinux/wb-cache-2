40|$|Background: Due to the {{positive}} relation between platelet size and platelet reactivity, a high value of the mean platelet volume (MPV) is an independent risk factor to predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its adverse outcome. Few data are available to determinate the prognostic value of MPV in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical value of MPV to predict impaired reperfusion and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in acute STEMI treated with primary PCI. Methods: This study included 203 STEMI patients referring for blood sampling before primary PCI to estimate MPV and determine the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade, corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC), and in-hospital MACE. Results: The frequency of in-hospital MACE in the group of patients with a <b>high</b> <b>MPV</b> (≥ 10. 3 ng/dl) was significantly more than that of the group with a low MPV (< 10. 3 ng/dl) (37. 8 % vs. 4. 4 %, P< 0. 001). The no-reflow phenomenon was more frequent in the patients with a <b>high</b> <b>MPV</b> than that of the patients with a low MPV (17. 8 % vs. 1. 9 %, P< 0. 001). The mean MPV in the group of patients with CTFC≥ 40 was significantly more than that of the group of patients with CTFC< 40 (10. 9 ± 0. 92 vs. 9. 45 ± 0. 85, P= 0. 001). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, a <b>high</b> <b>MPV</b> remained a strong independent factor to predict the no-reflow phenomenon (Odds Ratio [OR]= 2. 263, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]= 1. 47 to 5. 97; P< 0. 002), in-hospital MACE (OR= 2. 49, 95 % CI= 1. 34 to 4. 61; P< 0. 004), and CTFC≥ 40 (OR= 2. 09, 95 % CI= 1. 22 to 3. 39; P< 0. 003).

Method: Forty-four diabetic patients with myocardial perfu-sion defect (group 1) and 44 diabetic patients without myocar-dial perfusion defect (group 2), matched for age and gender, were retrospectively examined. Levels of mean platelet volume (MPV) in the two groups were assessed. Results: MPV was higher in group 1 than group 2 patients (8. 76 ± 0. 76 and 8. 25 ± 0. 78 fl), respectively, p = 0. 003). Levels of glucose, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, haemoglobin (Hb) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and body mass index (BMI) in the two groups were not statistically significantly different. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that MPV was the only variable independently associated with myocardial perfusion defects (OR: 2. 401, 95 % CI: 1. 298 – 4. 440, p = 0. 013).

Objectives To assess the platelet count and mean platelet volume (MPV) of pregnant women with GDM and gestational impaired glucose tolerance (GIGT) to determine whether GDM and GIGT are risk factors for future development of CVD. Patients and methods A 50 g oral glucose load (OGL) was administered to all participants (400 pregnant women), and routine hematologic parameters and MPV were studied at 24 - 28 gestational weeks using a Beckman/Coulter MAXM Hematology Analyzer. When a plasma glucose level of at least 140 mg/dl was measured after administering OGL, a 100 g 3 -h oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Of these women, 296 (74 %) had normal oral glucose tolerance, 48 (12 %) had GIGT, and 65 (14 %) had GDM. The mean platelet counts {{were higher in the}} normal OGL group than in the GIGT group, and higher in the GIGT group than in the GDM group, with no statistically significant differences among the three groups.

40|$|Objective: Platelet {{functions}} {{have important}} roles {{in the development of}} vascular complications in diabetic patients. Platelets with increased volume have increased activity compared to smaller ones; therefore, mean platelet volume (MPV) is used as a marker for platelet activity. In the present study, we evaluated MPV in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and its associations with diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications. Methods: Consecutive type II diabetic patients were screened from outpatient clinic of Internal Medicine Department of Diskapı Yıldırım Beyazıt Education and Researsch Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. A total of 48 patients with type II DM and 30 age and gender matched healthy subjects constituted the study population. For all subjects a complete blood count including MPV, fasting blood glucose level and lipid parameters were studied. In diabetic patients, duration of diabetes and HbA 1 C level, presence of microvascular and macrovascular complications were noted additively. Mean platelet volume was compared between diabetic patients and healthy counterparents. Then, among diabetic patients, MPV was compared between the ones with and without microvascular and macrovascular complications.

In this study, we aimed to investigate mean platelet volume (MPV) in patients with idiopathic CMP and ischemic CMP and to compare with those of the controls, and aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between MVP and echocardiographic parameters in patients with CMP. Methods: This study was designed as an observational cross-sectional study. A total of 100 subjects with idiopathic CMP (n= 35), ischemic CMP (n= 35) and controls (n= 30) were included in the study. The MPV values were measured in all participants. All subjects underwent transthoracic echocardiography and angiographic evaluation. We used Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation tests for statistical analysis. Results: The MPV values were significantly higher in patients with idiopathic CMP and ischemic CMP than those of the controls (9. 03 ± 1. 3 and 8. 77 ± 0. 9 vs. 7. 95 ± 1. 0 fl, respectively, p< 0. 001). The MPV values were although not statistically significant also tend to be higher in patients with idiopathic CMP than in patients with ischemic CMP (p= 0. 328). The MPV values were found to be positively correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (r= 0. 369, p< 0. 0001; r= 0. 325, p= 0. 001, respectively), and left atrial diameter (r= 0. 403, p< 0. 0001), but inversely correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r=- 0. 392, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract. Gastric {{cancer is}} the fourth most {{frequent}} cancer and the second cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Platelets play an important and multifaceted role in cancer progression. Elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) detected in peripheral blood has been identified in various types of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the application value of MPV in the prediction of chemotherapy response and prognosis in patients with unresectable gastric cancer. A total of 128 patients with unresectable gastric cancer were included and divided according to the median values of baseline MPV (low MPV: < 11. 65 or high MPV: ≥ 11. 65). A low baseline MPV level was correlated with reduced metastasis. The results showed that patients with a low baseline level of MPV improved response to chemotherapy. Changes in MPV were associated with therapeutic efficacy. Patients who remained in or were transferred into the low MPV level subgroup following first‑line chemotherapy had improved response, compared to those remaining in or being transferred into the <b>high</b> <b>MPV</b> level group. The patients with a <b>higher</b> baseline <b>MPV</b> had decreased progression-free and overall survival ratios.

30|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which elevated MPV might {{play a role in}} the development or progression of cardiovascular diseases are not completely understood, but there are some possible explanations. First, platelet reactivity is increased with ischemic stroke as evidenced by the increased levels of soluble platelet P-selectin and increased levels of thromboxane A 2 which are considered as atherogenic factors [44, 45]. Second, cytokines such as interleukin- 3 or interleukin- 6 which plays an important role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke influence megakaryocyte ploidy which in turn affect the platelet size and can lead to the production of more reactive, larger platelets [28] and so the proinflammatory condition before the ischemic stroke may lead to a <b>higher</b> <b>MPV</b> which in turn lead to prothrombotic condition. Finally, large platelets may be a consequence of secretion and metabolism of biologically active substances during aging, diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity and consequently cause increased risk of ischemic stroke [41, 46, 47].|$|E

The mean platelet volume (MPV) is considered a marker and determinant of platelet function since larger platelets are hemostatically more reactive than platelets of normal size, increasing the propensity to thrombosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate MPV in patients with RMS and healthy control subjects. MethodsWe selected 30 consecutive patients with RMS and 31 consecutive healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. All subjects were in sinus rhythm. We measured MPV in a blood sample collected in EDTA. ResultsDemographic data of the RMS (mean age: 39. 5 ± 9. 9 years, 22 [71 %] female) and control groups (mean age: 39. 2 ± 9. 3 years, 20 [67 %] female) were similar.

30|$|MPV is {{a useful}} {{prognostic}} marker in myriad medical conditions, including ischemic heart disease, infective endocarditis and cerebral infarction [[11]–[13]]. Only {{a few studies have}} assessed MPV in critical illnesses. Four of these, case series performed in the 1980 s and 1990 s, highlighted that sepsis is associated with increased MPV [[14]–[17]]. More recently, in a larger prospective study, Oncel et al. also reported <b>high</b> <b>MPVs</b> in septic newborns [[7]]. Aydemir et al. reported that increases in MPV in septic adults persist for days, being more prolonged in patients with fungal infections [[18]]. Becchi et al. evaluated the impact of MPV and platelet count on prognosis of critically ill septic patients and concluded that lower MPVs on admission were associated with increased mortality [[6]]. However, these authors also highlighted that MPV tends to increase in non-survivors and decrease in survivors, with platelet counts having an inverse trend [[6]]. Taken together, these findings suggest that trends in changes in MPV and platelet counts may be more reliable markers of poor prognosis than the corresponding absolute values. The discrepancies between baseline MPV values in previous reports may be related to variations in sources of samples (septic versus non-septic, newborns versus adults) [[6],[7]].|$|R
40|$|Objective: Morning blood {{pressure}} surge (MBPS) {{is an independent}} predictor of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. There is evidence from studies supporting the validity of mean platelet volume (MPV) as a marker of vascular risk and predictor of thrombotic complications. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the relationship between MPV and MBPS in hypertensive patients. Methods: Measurements were obtained from 298 patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension (Mean age: 51. 9 ± 11. 7 years). The patients were divided into two groups (MPVlow group; < 10. 8 fL, MPVhigh group; ≥ 10. 8 fL). The MBPS was calculated as mean systolic BP during the 2 hours after awaking minus the mean systolic BP during the 1 hour that included the lowest sleep BP. Results: MPV was independently associated with MBPS (β= 0. 554, p< 0. 001) and hs-CRP level (β= 0. 286, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Finally, <b>higher</b> <b>MPV</b> values related to enhanced MBPS which are associated with atherothrombotic cardiovascular events...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{interest}} {{about the}} role of platelet (PLT) number and function in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD patients have abnormalities of PLT number and function, especially mean platelet volume (MPV) which is known as a novel biomarker for atherosclerosis. We decided to compare PLT number and function between NAFLD and healthy participants. Materials and Methods: In this case–control study, two groups of patients (65 cases with NAFLD and 65 cases without NAFLD) were included consecutively. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made using ultrasound examination of the liver. Venous blood samples were taken, and the required laboratory markers including PLT number and function (MPV, platelet distribution width [PDW]), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), lipid profile, hepatic transaminases, ferritin, and fasting blood sugar were assayed. Results: Mean (± standard deviation [SD]) MPV in NAFLD group (10. 29 ± 0. 95 fL) was significantly higher than in control group (9. 56 ± 1. 18 fL); P < 0. 001. No significant difference was observed regarding mean (± SD) PLT count between NAFLD (271. 20 ± 52. 11 × 103 /mm 3) and healthy participants (262. 86 ± 75. 81 × 103 /mm 3) (P = 0. 46). Mean (± SD) PDW values were not significantly different between NAFLD and control groups. Logistic regression showed that NAFLD was positively associated with <b>higher</b> <b>MPV</b> (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 20 – 3. 02) and body mass index (OR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 05 – 2. 15) values. However, PT (OR = 0. 14, 95 % CI = 0. 02 – 0. 82) and PTT (OR = 0. 72, 95 % CI = 0. 58 – 0. 88) had negative association with NAFLD. Conclusion: <b>Higher</b> <b>MPV</b> was found to be significantly associated with NAFLD. However, such significant association was not detected regarding PLT count or PDW. As MPV is a reported risk factor for atherosclerosis, this marker may be useful in follow-up of patients with NAFLD. These findings provide basis for further studies to address this marker in long-term follow-up of NAFLD patients...|$|E
40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the mean platelet volume (MPV) of patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Methods. Hundred and ninty-three patients with the diagnosis of RVO and 83 healthy control subjects were included in this retrospective study. Retinal vein occlusion was diagnosed based on clinical examination. All patients and control subjects underwent complete ocular examination. MPV, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and platelet count of the participants were recorded. The data of patients with RVO was compared with the control subjects. Results. Patients with RVO had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>MPV</b> values ([*]fL) compared with the control subjects ([*]fL) (). No significant difference was found in platelet counts between RVO group and the control group ([*] 109 /L and [*] 109 /L, resp.,), Mean platelet volume was an independent predictor of RVO (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 43; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 09 – 1. 89;). Conclusion. Our results demonstrated that the MPV values were significantly higher in patients with RVO, suggesting that larger platelets may contribute to the pathogenesis of the RVOs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prediabetes is an {{independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Mean platelet volume (MPV) can reflect platelet activity, and <b>high</b> <b>MPV</b> is associated with thrombogenic activation and {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease. In diabetic patients, <b>MPV</b> is <b>higher</b> when compared with normal subjects. However, the relationship between MPV and prediabetes is poorly understood. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to compare MPV in prediabetic and normoglycemic subjects, and to evaluate the relationship between MPV and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels in these two groups. Methods We retrospectively studied 1876 Japanese subjects who had undergone health checks at Iida Municipal Hospital. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, medical history, smoking habits, alcohol intake, lipid profiles, FPG levels, and MPV were evaluated. Subjects were categorized into four groups according to FPG: Q 1 (70 mg/dL ≤ FPG Results The MPV increased with the increasing FPG levels, in the following order: Q 1 (9. 89 ± 0. 68 fl), Q 2 (9. 97 ± 0. 69 fl), Q 3 (10. 02 ± 0. 72 fl), and Q 4 (10. 12 ± 0. 69 fl). After adjusting for the confounding parameters, MPV of the prediabetic group was higher than that in other groups (P Conclusions MPV in patients with prediabetes was higher than that in normal subjects, and was positively associated with FPG levels in prediabetic and normal subjects. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the platelet activity in patients with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED). Materials and methods: The total blood count, including hemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT) and mean platelet volume (MPV) parameters were measured in the patient (n = 70) and control groups (n = 50). Results: The average age was 48. 1 ± 11. 7 and 47. 6 ± 12. 3 in the patient and control groups (p = 0. 8217), respectively. <b>MPV</b> was <b>higher</b> in the patient group and there was a statistically significant difference between two groups (11. 27 ± 0. 56 and 9. 8 ± 0. 91, p < 0. 0001). PLT counts were lower in the patient group but there was not a statistically significant difference (196. 23 ± 37. 01 and 209. 07 ± 36. 71, p = 0. 0626). In terms of haemoglobin, WBC and RBC values, there was no difference in the patient and control groups. Conclusions: Finding <b>high</b> <b>MPV,</b> which reflects the platelet activity, in the patient group shows that platelets also have a role in the VED etiopathogenesis. In the case of the confirmation of this result with additional studies, the efficiency of anti-platelet therapy in the vasculogenic ED should also be researched...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Acute {{mesenteric}} ischemia (AMI) is a disease, usually seen in {{elderly people}} {{and accompanied by}} comorbid diseases. Mean platelet volume (MPV), the significant indicator of platelet activation and function, is associated with AMI. In this study, we considered {{that we can use}} MPV as a reliable indicator in the diagnosis of AMI. Methods. This study was conducted among AMI patients with two control groups. Age, gender, MPV, platelet count, concomitant diseases, abdominal computed tomography, and patient outcomes were recorded for evaluation. Control group I contained 41 healthy patients whose ages-genders were matched. Control group II contained 41 patients with no AMI, whose ages-genders-concomitant diseases were matched. Results. Of the total 41 AMI patients, 22 were female and 19 were male. The average age of them was 72. 12 ± 13. 2 (44 – 91) years. MPV was significantly increased in the AMI (p= 0. 001) and control group II (p< 0. 001) in comparison with healthy control groups. In the comparison of the AMI patients with their matched controls for concomitant diseases, no statistical difference was found in the MPV values. Conclusion. MPV may be used as an indicator of AMI only if the patient has no concomitant diseases. The existence of a concomitant disease brings into question the reliability of <b>high</b> <b>MPV</b> values as a suitable indicator...|$|R
