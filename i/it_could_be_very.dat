In 1958, it was estimated that roughly one out of every five employees in the United States was required to pass some sort of loyalty review. Once a person lost a job due to an unfavorable loyalty review, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to find other employment.

500|$|Due to {{the broad}} nature of the law, {{as it would have}} allowed the firing of public school {{employees}} for the way they voted or spoke their opinions in favor of gay rights, conservative Republican politicians spoke out against it. Primarily, former governor Ronald Reagan voiced his opinion, saying [...] "Prop. 6 is not needed to protect our children. We have that legal protection now. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> costly to implement and has the potential for causing undue harm to people." [...] Reagan's statement turned public opinion against the proposition almost overnight. Gay activists were not optimistic in light of the record of voter turnout against them in the previous year, but they were overwhelmed to learn that on election day more than a million voters turned out to strike down the proposition.|$|E

[...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts.

60|$|All this Romulus {{seems very}} adroitly to have arranged. The {{time for the}} final {{execution}} of the scheme {{was to be the}} last day of the celebration. The best spectacle and show of all was to take place on that day. The Romans were directed to come armed to this show, but to keep their arms carefully concealed beneath their garments. They were to do nothing till Romulus gave the signal. He was himself to be seated upon a sort of throne, in a conspicuous place, where all could see him, presiding, as it were, over the assembly, while the spectacle went on; and finally, when he judged that the proper moment had arrived, he was to give the signal by taking off a certain loose article of dress which he wore--a sort of cloak or mantle--and folding it up, and then immediately unfolding it again. This mantle was a sort of badge of royalty and was gayly adorned with purple stripes upon a white ground. It was well adapted, therefore, to the purpose of being used as a signal, inasmuch as any motions that were made with <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> easily seen.|$|E

Breeding with unrelated individuals might seem to be most advantageous choice of mating because it increases genetic variation and avoids inbreeding depression, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> time consuming process.|$|R
