This state has a major negative outcome: growth of power losses in electric lines and transformers belonging to the transmission and distribution systems. In the design stage of the electric grids, the power and energy losses calculus is performed considering a sinusoidal balanced functioning state. In the operation stage, this fact can generate the overloading of the active and neutral conductors or even the degradation of the entire network. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the recent}} and future {{increase}} of the distributed generators there is a rising need to review {{the concept of the}} traditional <b>electric</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> [1, 2]. This has {{led to the development of}} the "Microgrid "- concept. A Microgrid is a small partial grid located on the secondary side of the medium voltage / low voltage transformer [1, 2]. It includes decentralized generators, loads and storage units as autonomous and can meet local energy needs. It can operate both in grid-connected mode and in island mode. Reliability and security of power are issues that are nowadays addressed to the utility grid. Short circuit currents that are needed to trigger the protection devices are delivered by the big rotating mass from the generators in the power stations. In the "Microgrid "- concept there is a lack of rotating mass when it is in island mode [2, 3]. Distributed generators are connected via converters who cannot supply the needed large short circuit currents [2, 3]. This is due to the limited power density and low temperature range of silicon transistors. With the recent introduction of the wide bandgap semiconductor materials (GaN, SiC, [...] .) for power electronic devices, having vary high power densities and temperature resistances, a potential solution for this problem can be found in the design of the powe...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 35) Distributed Generation (DG) is {{an electric}} power production that {{is capable of}} generating electricity from small energy sources. Renewable Energy Source generation refers to power generation from renewable sources like solar, tidal, geothermal, biomass, etc. From the past few years, distributed generation from renewable energy source in the United States has experienced tremendous increase owing to the targets set up by the state which accounts for DG penetration into Grid. High penetration of photovoltaic into the existing distribution networks might result in voltage increase in case renewable source generation crosses the demand on the consumer side. To deal with this challenge, use of energy storage systems is done and integrated with the renewable source generation. The excess energy generated from photovoltaic charges, the storage system during the day-time and the same stored energy helps in reducing the evening peak load. The energy storage system helps in reducing the intermittent issue of renewable energy source generation.

The modeling of control schemes in the electric subsystem is another key issue of the paper in view of providing efficient energy production from distributed generation: an active power-voltage (PV) control is adopted for the inverter in case of the operation of a microturbine connected to the grid.

One of the widely used algorithms for tree-structured approximation and modeling is the Chow-Liu algo- rithm. While this algorithm is optimal for Gaussian distributions {{in the sense of}} the Kullback- Leibler (KL) divergence, it is not optimal when compared with other information divergences and criteria such as Area Under the detection Curve (AUC) and reverse KL divergence. In this paper, we discuss the optimality of tree approximation methods. We show that different information theory divergences and criteria such as the KL divergence, the Jeffreys divergence and the AUC are all related of the correlation approximation matrix (CAM), Δ. We also show some explicit relations between these different information divergences and criteria and investigate the relation between quality of the tree approximation by formulating a detection problem and considering the AUC and the Jefferys divergence which is a distance between two conditional means, as alternative approaches for the tree approximation. The tree structure approximation algorithms have interesting applications. In general, the tree structured enables us to do distributed algorithms such as belief propagation and also to do inference. Because of computational complexity, it is important to consider simpler graphical models such as trees when modeling systems for many applications.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{profitable}} commercialization path for fuel cells and H 2 can be executed by coordinating convergent trend in several industries. This strategy relies on existing technologies, can begin immediately, and proceeds in a logical and viable sequence. It has two preconditions: uncompromised ultra light-hybrid vehicles whose inherently high efficiency permits their full-cell stacks {{to rely on}} conveniently compact onboard thanks of compressed gaseous H 2, making onboard liquid- fuel reformers unnecessary and uncompetitive; and integration of fuel-cell market development between vehicles and buildings. 	As a first step, fuel-cell co-or three generation could currently compete in many buildings {{by virtue of its}} thermal credit. It could yield even greater economic value wherever <b>electric</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are old or congested, or where other “distributed benefits” are important and rewarded, Its H 2 could be made in the building by a mass-produced “hydrogen appliance”-either an off-peak electrolyzer or a natural-gas steam reformer. 	Next, the huge fuel-cell market, in buildings (which use two-thirds of all U. S. electricity), supplemented by industrial niche markets, would soon cut fuel-cell costs to levels competitive in vehicles. Low-tractive-load hyper cars could adopt fuel cells at several fold higher prices, hence several years earlier, than conventional cars. The general-vehicle market could then be opened to hydrogen by first using the spare off-peak capacity of buildings, H 2 sources to serve vehicles too-particularly vehicles whose drives work or live in or near the sane buildings. Further, those vehicles daytime use as plug-in 20 +-kWe power plants could repay a significant fraction of their lease cost. This building/vehicle integration could make gaseous-H 2 fueling practical without first building a new upstream bulk-supply and distribution infrastructure. It would work better and cost less than onboard liquid-hydrocarbon reforming. Ultimately it could provide more than 3 TWe of U. S. generating capacity, enough in principle to displace virtually all central thermal power stations. 	As both stationary and mobile applications for fuel cells built volume and cut cost for dispersed but stationary reformer and electrolyzer appliances, those H 2 sources would also start to be installed freestanding outside buildings. Before, long the growing H 2 market would then justify further competition from upstream bulk supply, especially from climatically benign sources. Such options include converting hydroelectric dams (or other renewables) to “ Hydro-Gen” plants that earn far higher profit by shipping each electron with a proton attached, and R. H. Wiliams,s concept of wellhead reforming of natural gas with CO 2 reinjection. The latter option, s three possible profit streams-high-value hydrogen-fuel sales, enhanced hydrocarbon recovery and potential carbon-sequestration credits are already attracting large energy companies. Its 200 year climate-safe CH 4 reserves (at roughly current rates of consumption) could also provide a long bridge to a fully renewable energy system. The diverse and dynamic portfolio of hydrogen sources up and downstream; renewable and nonrenewable; based on electrolysis, reforming or other methods and with small to no net climatic effect would ensure healthy price competition and robust policy choices. ...|$|R

The development of an information and communication technology (ICT) support infrastructure was identified as the key challenge in the design of an end-to-end smart grid. A multiagent system, with agents located at the edges and nodes of the grid and representing the interests of end-users, distributors, and providers, enables intelligent decisions to be made at each node in the <b>electric</b> power <b>distribution</b> network (<b>grid).</b> The seminar fostered discussions among experts from all relevant disciplines is to develop the foundation for the necessary interdisciplinary solution from engineering, computer science, and business management. The outcome was an understanding and identification of the requirements on the information systems for future smart grids...|$|R
