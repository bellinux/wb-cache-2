5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but {{in the absence of}} skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E

5|$|The priory {{may also}} have owned a cell at Scarth Wood at Whorlton. A grant issued by Stephen de Meynell in the reign of Henry I records the {{donation}} of the hamlet of Scarth to enable the priory to establish a cell for habitation by a single monk or canon. It is unclear whether the cell was built as Scarth is {{not mentioned in the}} priory's deeds or in Henry VIII's commissioners' valuation of its property. Fragmentary building remains at Scarth are recorded as existing in the mid-18th century. They were cleared by the start of the 19th century so there is no trace of whatever might once have stood there or <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it might have been used for.|$|E

50|$|Halcyon {{was based}} around the Z80 microprocessor, with its 64K memory {{partitioned}} out to ROM and RAM. A separate speech recognition computer provided the additional power needed to recognize human speech. Its firmware was proprietary, and its chief communications with the Z80 were <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> word it had recognized, and <b>what</b> probability <b>of</b> confidence it {{calculated for the}} match.

25|$|Another {{traditional}} {{element of}} the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems before their entry into the headquarters. Mishima planned his suicide meticulously {{for at least a}} year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members had any <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he was planning. His biographer, translator John Nathan, suggests that the coup attempt was only a pretext for the ritual suicide of which Mishima had long dreamed. Mishima made sure his affairs were in order and left money for the legal defense of the three surviving Tatenokai members.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater part}} of the museum's {{classical}} sculpture collection largely comes from the Farnese Marbles, important since they include Roman copies of classical Greek sculpture, which are {{in many cases the}} only surviving <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the lost works by ancient Greek sculptors such as Calamis, Kritios and Nesiotes looked like.

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter of 2007, {{development}} began on the L10 series GS under Yoshihiko Kanamori, with the design process finalizing under new president and CEO Akio Toyoda's direction in 2009. Design patents were filed in Japan on 6 October 2010 for the production model and a conceptual variant on 29 March 2011. In April 2011, Lexus showed the LF-Gh concept (Lexus Future Grand-Touring Hybrid) at that year's New York International Auto Show, previewing the stylistic direction of future Lexus models. The LF-Gh featured a large, spindle-shaped front grille, and press information further indicated that it had a new interior design which included an analog clock. The LF-Gh concept vehicle was taken by automotive journalists as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the fourth generation Lexus GS would look like.|$|E
25|$|No volcanoes in the Canadian Cascade Arc are {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide a good <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is happening under them. It may sense an increase in seismic activity they become very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only once a volcano has started erupting. If they were to erupt, relief efforts would probably be orchestrated. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that will have effects in Canada.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, the most {{prominent}} noblemen established themselves on the upper Sablon and on rue aux Laines. The Egmonts, the Culemborgs, the Brederodes and the Mansfelds were the first, and the De Lannoys, the De Lalaings, the Thurn und Taxis, and the Solres joined them. The result was that by the seventeenth century, the Sablon area had grown {{to become the most}} aristocratic and prosperous area in the city. The Egmont Palace on the Petit Sablon is still standing, and gives the best <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the area was like at the height of its splendour; the grandiose houses of the Lannoys and the Mérode-Westerloo family still stand in rue aux Laines. In 1566 the Culemborg mansion on rue des Petits Carmes/Karmelietenstraat was the site of the drafting of the Compromise of Nobles which ultimately led to the Dutch Revolt. To eliminate any trace of this seditious act against the king, the Duke of Alba razed the mansion to the ground in 1568.|$|E

500|$|Allied {{intelligence}} {{failed to}} detect the German intention. In Ultra transcripts, {{there are only a}} few <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening on the other side of the front. On 4 December 1944, II Jagdkorps had ordered stockpiling for navigational aids, such as [...] "golden-rain" [...] flares and smoke bombs. Allied intelligence made no written observations of this communication. They also disregarded communications to Junkers Ju 88 groups regarding the use of flares when leading formations. Intelligence concluded that these instructions were designed for a ground support mission rather than an interception operation. This was reasonable, but no <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> possible ground targets were given.|$|R
25|$|Currently, no volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma chambers are. An existing network of seismographs {{has been established}} to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is {{too far away to}} provide a good <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is happening beneath them. It may sense an increase in activity if a volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only once a volcano has started erupting. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan, Canada's volcanic emergency notification program, was established to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to a volcanic eruption in Canada, an eruption close to Canada's borders, or an eruption significant enough to have an effect on Canada and its people. It focuses primarily on aviation safety because jet aircraft can quickly enter areas of volcanic ash. The program notifies all impacted agencies that have to deal with volcanic events. Aircraft are rerouted away from hazardous ash and people on the ground are notified of potential ash fall.|$|E
25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and {{it will be interesting to}} find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E
