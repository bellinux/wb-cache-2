40|$|<b>Injection</b> stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> PET bottles are {{the most}} widely used {{container}} type for carbonated soft drinks. PET offers excellent clarity, good mechanical and barrier properties, and ease of processing. Typically, these bottles have a petaloid-shaped base, which gives good stability to the bottle and it is the most appropriate one for beverage storage. However, the base is prone to environmentally induced stress cracking and this a major concern to bottle manufacturers. The object {{of this study is to}} explain the occurrence of stress cracking, and to prevent it by optimising both the geometry of the petaloid base and the processing parameters during bottle moulding. A finite element model of the petaloid shape is developed in CATIA V 5 R 14, and used to predict the von Mises stress in the bottle base for different combinations of three key dimensions of the base: foot length, valley width, and clearance. The combination of dimensions giving the minimum stress is found by a statistical analysis approach using an optimisation and design of experiments software package ECHIP- 7. A bottle mould was manufactured according to the optimum base geometry and PET bottles are produced by <b>injection</b> stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> (ISBM). In order to minimise the stresses at the bottom of the bottle, the ISBM process parameters were reviewed and the effects of both the stretch rod movement and the temperature profile of the preform were studied by means of the process simulation software package (Blow View version 8. 2). Simulated values of the wall thickness, stress, crystallinity, molecular orientation and biaxial ratio in the bottle base were obtained. The process parameters, which result in low stress and uniform material in the bottle base, are regarded as optimum operating conditions. In the evaluation process of the optimum bottle base, bottles with standard (current) and optimized (new) base were produced under the same process conditions via a two-stage ISBM machine. In order to compare both the bottles, environmental stress crack resistance, top load strength, burst pressure strength, thermal stability test as well as crystallinity studies ¬¬¬via modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and morphology studies via environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and optical microscopy were conducted.

Rectangular finite elements with quadratic and linear interpolations have been employed for velocity and the elastic left Cauchy Green tensor. Second, an axi symmetric formulation involving 4 fields (global velocity V, lagrange multiplier p associated with the global incompressibility condition, and multiplier q associated with the incompressibility of the elastic part) has been performed using rectangular elements.

In industrial applications like thermoforming, aimed at obtaining products by deforming polymeric preforms or sheets, the study of the thermal stage allows to get a successful forming process and directly affects the mechanical properties of the end product [2]. Moreover, studying the heating stage in the design phase of such processes can lead to a significant increase in the process efficiency, with consequent energy savings and reduced environmental impact. Many authors developed models to analyze the thermal phase of <b>Injection</b> Stretch <b>Blowing</b> <b>Moulding</b> (ISBM) technology. In [3] a finite element model was realized for the thermal analysis of a preform which rotates in front of infrared lamps located along its axis; the same industrial process has been investigated also in [4] using the identical numerical approach of [3]; in the latter case, however, the ray tracing method was adopted to model the heat source term. The thermal phase represents the most critical stage for the end-forming process of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes too, where one end undergoes a deformation process in order to allow piping connection. To soften the material before deformation, the end of the tube is slid into an oven equipped with infrared lamps and a rotation is imposed on the tube so as to ensure uniform heating. Different kinds of defects (e.g. localized burns, wall thinning, excessive shrinkage and loss of elasticity) can occur in the final product due to an uneven temperature distribution within the material, thus causing the pipe to be discarded [5]. Consequently, a fundamental parameter of a successful end-forming process is represented by the tube angular velocity.|$|R

They control the preform temperature distribution and strongly affect the blowing kinematics via the important influence of temperature on mechanical behaviour. The temperature affects the orientation induced by biaxial stretching, which in turn, affects mechanical properties of PET. Therefore, thermal proprieties {{are one of the}} most important variables in the ISBM. In order to achieve accurate simulation of the ISBM process, it is necessary to: (i) measure the initial temperature distribution of the preform when the blowing operation begins; (ii) follow the history of the temperature field and consequently to identify the thermal proprieties of the PET; (iii) to model the behaviour law of PET coupled to the thermal laws. In this work, we modelled the PET behaviour in ISBM strian rate and temperature conditions by a thermo-viscohyperelastic model which has been inspired from Figiel and Buckley 2009 [1] and already presented by Luo et al. 2011 [2]. A procedure is proposed for the identification of the thermal parameters from experimental results of a test where PET sheets are heated using infrared (IR) lamps. The Monte Carlo method is used to provide the parameters best fit from the temperature evolution measured on the face in front of the lamps and from the rear face. The beginning of the temperature evolution gives information on the IR flux and the final stage of the heating gives information on the convection exchange. Difference between the front and the rear faces gives information on the PET conductivity. Using a finite element approach implemented in Matlab, the coupled thermo-visco-hyperelastic model has been used to simulate the ISBM process.

However, one of the drawbacks for these simulations is the lack of knowledge on the biaxial stress-strain behaviour of PET at processing conditions relevant to ISBM and the effect of biaxial stretching on the final properties. The main objective ofthis study was to understand and. characterize the biaxial behaviour of PET and quantify how biaxial stretching under different processing conditions influenced the final mechanical and structural properties. The results were. implemented within a numerical simulation with the aim of accurately predicting both the thickness and modulus distribution in the final container. Initially, a comprehensive stu:dy of the biaxial defonnation behaviour of three different grades of PET was carried out at conditions applicable to the ISBM process using the Queen's Biaxial Stretcher. The stress strain data generated from these biaxial tests was used to generate material constants for the Buckley-Jones-Adams material model. A new procedure for generating the constants was developed using the mathematical package MATLABÃ‚Â®. This semi-automated procedure was found more efficient than the original manual procedure by Buckley et al. Post-stretching analysis was carried out by using tensile and DSC methods. The modulus development of PET was found to be strongly dependent on the stretching temperature, strain rate, stretch ratio, and defonnation mode. Among those parameters, stretch ratio and defonnation mode play the most important role. A two dimensional ISBM simulation of a 1 litre PET bottle was developed for the prediction of thickness and modulus distributions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the development of simulation and design optimization capabilities, for polymer forming processes, in the context of addressing industrial needs. Accomplishments generated from close to twenty years of research in this field, at the National Research Council (NRC), are presented. Polymer forming processes such as extrusion <b>blow</b> <b>moulding,</b> stretch <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> and thermoforming have been the focus of the work, yet the research is extendable to similar polymer forming operations such as micro-blow <b>moulding,</b> sheet <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> and composites stamping. The research considers material models, process sequence integration and design optimization, derivative processes and 3 D finite elements with multi-body contact.

40|$|Thesis (MEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{represents}} {{the results of}} a study for the use of conformal cooling in <b>blow</b> <b>mould</b> design. As a part of this, design case studies and comparative experiments were conducted to determine the difference in performance of <b>blow</b> <b>moulds</b> incorporating conventional cooling and those with conformal cooling. The cooling configurations are compared using simulation to identify the shortcomings of conventional cooling. In addition modern manufacturing methods able to manufacture complex conformal cooling designs, are evaluated. The relevant cooling principles are explained using mould designing handbooks as well as heat flow handbooks. The tie between them is made and the differences explained. The moulding cycles of injection as well as <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process are explained and the applicable simulation software used in these fields is described...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blow</b> <b>moulding</b> is an {{essential}} stage of manufacturing glass and polymer containers, i. e. bottles or jars. A preform is brought into a <b>mould</b> and subsequently <b>blown</b> into the <b>mould</b> shape to produce the container. Two different problems regarding <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> are considered: the forward problem, which consists of determining the mould shape from the preform shape, and the inverse problem, which consists of determining the optimal preform shape corresponding to the designed container shape. This paper {{is concerned with the}} constraints on the mould surface and sensitivity to perturbations in the shape for both problems...|$|R
40|$|In this study, one of {{the plastic}} {{automotive}} parts, Air Duct, manufactured through <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process is reviewed and investigated with a practical process point of view using structural mechanics approach. First, current <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process was examined to find governing factors of the process which can be improved or adjusted for better quality control of finished product. Secondly, numerical analysis {{was conducted on the}} post-mould process in order to predict the deformation in the final products with properly assumed initial and boundary conditions. The simulation results showed that the degree of warpage under current <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process could be predicted at a reasonable accuracy. It was also discovered that the distortions of the holes are strongly dependent on it location and surrounding, and the current cooling method should be improved to improve the quality. Based on the simulation results and literature survey, a better post-mould cooling method was suggested. In addition, the problem in cooling system was identified, and redesigning scheme was recommended...|$|R
