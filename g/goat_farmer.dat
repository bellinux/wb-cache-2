The entry point to start working with farmers was brucellosis control. The NGO was the channel through which governmental financial support for brucellosis control was given to <b>goat</b> <b>farmers.</b> The activities for brucellosis control included vaccination and testing to detect seropositive goats.|$|R

30|$|Controlling {{brucellosis}} {{could be}} an opportunity for farmers to find a niche market for a high-quality dairy product. Currently, such a market is exploited by a relatively small group of <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> approximately 20 km from the neighbour state of Guanajuato. Farmers might need to team up to achieve a better market. Stories of smallholder crop farmers forming cooperatives can be found elsewhere (King et al. [2012]). A cooperative led by women may {{be a way to}} empower women. Women are mostly involved in milking and cleaning corrals, but they could be playing a key role when goat milk is further processed (e.g. cheese making). Poorer households should be included in such plans too. Farmers’ social capital such as cooperation and trust can be a starting point for developing cooperatives with the help of NGOs or governmental institutions. Unfortunately, good institutional support is lacking. Credit given to acquire ‘modern’ equipment in a ‘one size fits all’ package indicates the governmental institutions’ desire for a modern agriculture sector. However, there was a mismatch between the package designed and the extensive grazing system used by the majority of <b>goat</b> <b>farmers.</b> A programme aiming to improve the pens of all farmers (not only the ‘better-off’) would have had a higher impact than the ‘Proyecto de los tejabanes’. The project only reached a really small fraction of the <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> of the region. In the whole state, there are 11, 281 <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> (INEGI [2007]).|$|R

30|$|Other {{significant}} objectives set by {{the sheep}} and <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> were to avoid any losses regarding the livestock, the animal feed and lairage facilities, the increase in capital to prevent abandonment and the sound farm management. A high percentage of sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> considered important to have time for other activities, while family participation in the farm was viewed as being equally important. In order to examine the potential existence of a statistical difference between the farmers’ views on {{the significance of the}} noted objectives, the Friedman’s statistical test was applied. According to the results, it was established that “damage avoidance” is the main goal of the farmers with a mean ranking of 4.84 (Ν =  90, χ 2  =  82.893, df =  6, Asymp. Sig <  0.001).|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I discuss the {{evaluation}} of quality of goat milk coming from small-scale <b>goat</b> <b>farmers.</b> In the Czech Republic, goats have been bred for many years.

The result of this is an increasing amount of <b>goat</b> <b>farmers,</b> especially those operating on smaller scale. In my thesis I describe the historical, as well as the current state of goat keeping in the Czech Republic and worldwide. The nutritional and dietary values of goat milk, its quality features and hygienic requirements are described as well.

40|$|The Creole goat {{is a local}} meat breed well {{adapted to}} the {{tropical}} environment of Guadeloupe, a French island in the Caribbean. A survey of 47 <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> was conducted in May 2008 to describe the Guadeloupean goat farming systems. It was the preliminary step {{for the implementation of}} a breeding programme for Creole <b>goats.</b> <b>Farmers</b> had 31 does on average. A small number (4 %) kept only Creole goats. Most of them (62 %) had a mixed herd of Creole and crossbreds. One-third of them (34 %) reared only crossbred <b>goats.</b> <b>Farmers</b> appreciate the rusticity and resistance of the Creole goat but consider its growth as too slow. The most desired traits for goat selection were conformation and growth for males (77 % of the answers). These traits were also important for females (30 % of the answers). Maternal qualities were also frequently cited (maternal behaviour 23 %, reproduction 20 % and milk production 17 %). Disease resistance was not seen as an important trait (10 % and 7 % of the answers for bucks and does, respectively). A typology constituted of five groups of farmers was also created. Farmers of three groups were retained to participate at a selection programme. They kept Creole goats and have expressed a strong willingness to join a selection programme. The results of the survey suggest that a breeding programme should mostly focus on the Creole goat as a maternal breed. Real consideration should be given to disease resistance. The Creole goat has indeed a key role to play in the sustainability of local farming systems...|$|R

[...] In response to a <b>goat</b> <b>farmer,</b> their spokesman acknowledged radioactive [...] "iodine can contaminate milk... but he was cheerful about the prospect.

50|$|In Heggestad's {{first four}} years at Sogndal, Tommy Øren was mostly chosen as the left winger in the {{starting}} line-up, while Heggestad was on the bench. Before the summer break of the 2003 season, Heggestad had only played 60 minutes, but when Øren was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season with an injury, Heggestad was playing regularly. As Sogndal already had the wingers Øren, Ødegaard, Kim Tangedal and Kim Rune Hellesund, head coach Jan Halvor Halvorsen persuaded Heggestad to be retrained as a left-back ahead of the 2004 season. Sogndal was however relegated after the season, and during the four seasons in Tippeligaen Heggestad played a total of 53 matches. Heggestad joined the Second Division side Årdal on loan for the second half of the 2006 season. He returned to Sogndal in 2007, and played every match for the team in the First Division. Sogndal wanted to sign a new contract with Heggestad after the season, but he rejected the offer and stepped down from professional football at the age of 26.

30|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the sheep and goat farmers’ perceptions and attitudes on {{issues related to the}} future growth of the sector in the Greek region of Evros. It can be argued that the study is considered significant due to the exceptional characteristics of the region, if the specific sector and its former involvement in livestock farming is adapted to modern production systems. The main objective set by sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>farmers</b> is to avoid any damage or additional cost to their farming activities. This is largely related to profit maximization rather than soil maintenance and conservation that is placed at the bottom of their list of priorities. Apparently, a major ethical question arises that in combination with the farmers’ low educational level and lack of information, results in ignorance regarding the sustainable management of natural resources. Consequently, livestock farming seems to face a grim future. As regards animal management practices, the sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>farmer’s</b> attitude towards sanitation conditions is deemed satisfactory, however they do not seem to pay sufficient attention to production, health and reproduction related issues.|$|R
