5|$|In 1974 it was {{discovered}} that propranolol could prevent attacks. The concept of channelopathies and the link with specific <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> mutations emerged {{at the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Of {{people with}} TPP, 33% from various populations were {{demonstrated}} to have mutations in KCNJ18, the gene coding for Kir2.6, an inward-rectifier potassium <b>ion</b> <b>channel.</b> This gene, too, harbors a thyroid response element.|$|E
2500|$|G protein-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are {{associated}} with a specific type of G protein-coupled receptor. [...] These <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are transmembrane <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> with selectivity filters and a G protein binding site. [...] The GPCRs associated with G protein-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are not involved in signal transduction pathways. [...] They only directly activate these <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> using effector proteins or the G protein subunits themselves (see picture). Unlike most effectors, not all G protein-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> have their activity mediated by Gα of their corresponding G proteins. For instance, the opening of inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels is mediated by the binding of Gβγ.|$|R

50|$|Light-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are a {{group of}} transmembrane {{proteins}} that form ion channels; pores which open or close in response to light. Most light-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> have been synthesized in the laboratory for study, though one naturally occurring example, Channelrhodopsin, is currently known. Photoreceptor proteins, which act {{in a similar manner}} to light-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are generally G protein-coupled receptors and not actually gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Transmembrane {{proteins}} {{can also}} serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell. Many <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for {{only one of the}} two ions.|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates {{produce their}} {{pharmacological}} effects {{by increasing the}} duration of chloride <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> opening at the GABAA receptor (pharmacodynamics: This increases the efficacy of GABA), whereas benzodiazepines increase {{the frequency of the}} chloride <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> opening at the GABAA receptor (pharmacodynamics: This increases the potency of GABA). The direct gating or opening of the chloride <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> is the reason for the increased toxicity of barbiturates compared to benzodiazepines in overdose.|$|E
25|$|Additional <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> {{populations have}} been {{incorporated}} based on experimental data.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>channels</b> may be {{classified}} by gating, i.e. what opens {{and closes the}} <b>channels.</b> Voltage-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> open or close depending on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, while ligand-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> open or close depending on binding of ligands to the channel.|$|R

25|$|G protein-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are {{a family}} of transmembrane <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> in neurons and atrial myocytes that are {{directly}} gated by G proteins.|$|R
25|$|Ionotropic receptors, {{otherwise}} known as ligand-gated ion channels, are fast acting receptors that mediate neural and physiological function by <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> flow with ligand-binding. Nicotinic, GABA, and Glutamate receptors are {{among some of the}} cell surface receptors regulated by ligand-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> flow. GABA is the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter and glutamate is the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{inorganic}} and organic molecules can modulate <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> activity and conductance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{criteria}} for <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> classification, including multiple pores and transient potentials.|$|E
50|$|Although {{voltage-gated}} <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> {{are typically}} activated by membrane depolarization, some channels, such as inward-rectifier potassium <b>ion</b> <b>channels,</b> are activated instead by hyperpolarization.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>channels</b> are abundantly {{expressed}} in both excitable and non-excitable cells, thereby regulating the Ca 2 + influx and downstream signaling pathways of physiological processes. The {{immune system is}} specialized {{in the process of}} cancer cell recognition and elimination, and is regulated by different <b>ion</b> <b>channels.</b> In comparison with the immune cells, <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> behave differently in cancer cells by making the tumor cells more hyperpolarized and influence cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Therefore, <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> comprise an important therapeutic target in anti-cancer treatment. In this review, we discuss the implication of <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> in regulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis during the crosstalk between immune and cancer cell as well as their role in cancer progression...|$|R
25|$|Most {{of these}} genes are ion {{channels}} {{with the one}} non-ion channel gene having been shown to affect <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> currents.|$|E
25|$|Temperature-gated channels: Members of the {{transient}} receptor potential <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> superfamily, such as TRPV1 or TRPM8, {{are opened}} either by {{hot or cold}} temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Membrane receptors {{are mainly}} divided by {{structure}} and function into 3 classes: The <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> linked receptor; The enzyme-linked receptor; and The G protein-coupled receptor.|$|E
50|$|Phase two is repolarization. During repolarization, {{voltage-gated}} sodium <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> inactivate (different {{from the}} closed state) {{due to the}} now-depolarized membrane, and voltage-gated potassium channels activate (open). Both the inactivation of the sodium <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> {{and the opening of}} the potassium <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> act to repolarize the cell's membrane potential back to its resting membrane potential.|$|R
5000|$|Synthetic <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are de novo {{chemical}} compounds that insert into lipid bilayers, form pores, and allow ions to flow {{from one side}} to the other. [...] They are man-made analogues of natural <b>ion</b> <b>channels,</b> and are thus also known as artificial <b>ion</b> <b>channels.</b> Compared to biological channels, they usually allow fluxes of similar magnitude but are ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>channels</b> can be {{classified}} by how they respond to their environment. For example, the <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> involved in the action potential are voltage-sensitive channels; they open and close {{in response to the}} voltage across the membrane. Ligand-gated channels form another important class; these <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> open and close in response to the binding of a ligand molecule, such as a neurotransmitter. Other <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> open and close with mechanical forces. Still other ion channels—such as those of sensory neurons—open and close in response to other stimuli, such as light, temperature or pressure.|$|R
25|$|The {{sensation}} of heat or cold that camphor produces {{on the skin}} is caused by activating the <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> TRPV3. This {{may account for the}} antimicrobial effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{analgesic}} {{properties of}} duloxetine {{in the treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy and central pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia are believed to be due to sodium <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> blockade.|$|E
25|$|There is cross {{tolerance}} between alcohol, the benzodiazepines, the barbiturates, the nonbenzodiazepine drugs, and corticosteroids, {{which all}} act by enhancing the GABAA receptor's function via modulating the chloride <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> {{function of the}} GABAA receptor.|$|E
50|$|Threshold is {{when the}} {{summation}} of MEPPs reaches a certain potential and induces {{the opening of the}} voltage-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels.</b> The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane potential to reach a positive charge. The potassium <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are slower-acting than the sodium <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and so as the membrane potential starts to peak, the potassium <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> open and causes an outflux of potassium to counteract the influx of sodium. At the peak, the outflux of potassium equals the influx of sodium, and the membrane does not change polarity.|$|R
25|$|Generally, G protein-gated <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> are {{specific}} <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> {{located in the}} plasma membrane of cells that are directly activated by a family of associated proteins. <b>Ion</b> <b>channels</b> allow for the selective movement of certain ions across the plasma membrane in cells. More specifically, in nerve cells, along with ion transporters, {{they are responsible for}} maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the cell.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>channels</b> and receptors are the {{structural}} basis for neural signaling and transmission. Recently, {{the function of}} <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and receptors has been demonstrated to be modulated by many intracellular and extracellular chemicals and signaling molecules. Increasing evidence indicates that the complexity and plasticity of the function of central nervous system {{is determined by the}} modulation of <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and receptors. Among various mechanisms, Ca 2 + signaling pathways play important roles in neuronal activity and some pathological changes. Ca 2 + influx through <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and receptors can modulate its further influx in a feedback way or modulate other <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and receptors. The common feature of the modulation is that Ca 2 +/calmodulin (CaM) is the universal mediator. CaM maintains the coordination among ion channels/receptors and intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis by feedback modulation of ion channels/receptors activity. This review focuses on the modulating processes of <b>ion</b> <b>channels</b> and receptors mediated by CaM, and further elucidates the mechanisms of Ca 2 + signaling...|$|R

25|$|Alcohol is {{classified}} as a sedative hypnotic drug. Alcohol produces a sedative effect by acting on receptors of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. GABA receptors contain a binding site for the chemical, GABA, a chloride <b>ion</b> <b>channel,</b> and an additional binding site for alcohol molecules.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{channels}} {{are the most}} widely distributed type of <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> and are found in virtually all living organisms.
