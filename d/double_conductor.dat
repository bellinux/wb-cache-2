A wire of copper sixty-seven feet long was bent in the middle so as to form a double termination which could be communicated with the electromotor; one of the halves of this wire was made into a helix and the other remained in its extended condition. When these were used alternately as the connecting wire, the helix half gave by much the strongest spark. It even gave a stronger spark than when it and the extended wire were used conjointly as a <b>double</b> <b>conductor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Transmission line towers carry heavy {{electrical}} transmission conductors at a sufficient and safe height from ground. In {{addition to their}} self-weight they have to withstand all forces of nature like strong wind, earthquake and snow load. Therefore transmission line towers should be designed considering both structural and electrical requirements for a safe and economical design. This paper introduces different types of transmission tower and its configuration as per Indian Standard IS- 802. A typical type of transmission line tower carrying 220 kV <b>double</b> circuit <b>conductors</b> is modeled and analyzed using STAAD-Pro considering forces like wind load, dead load of the structure and earthquake load as per Indian Standard IS 1893 : 2000 (part 1). The transmission tower has height of 40 m which includes the ground clearance(h 1),maximum sag of the lower most conductors wire(h 2),vertical spacing between the conductors wires(h 3) and vertical distance of earth wire from the uppermost conductor wire(h 3). The earth wire or ground wire is always located {{at the top of}} the transmission tower. It has a square base width of 11. 5 m The type of transmission tower considered is a tangent tower having no deviation located on a plain landscape with minimal obstacles. It is located at the wind zone 6 with basic wind speed of 55 m/s. The wind pressure on the tower depends on the gust response factor (GT) which increases with height. The transmission tower is situated in the most seismic sensitive region i. e. Zone V where response reduction factor steel frame with concentric braces is of 4 and the damping for steel structures is 2 %. The members are designed for maximum deflection and load for the most critical load combination as per code IS 802. The members are also grouped for better fabrication. Steel optimization has been carried out to find the most suitable and economical section for the design...|$|R
40|$|Stability of a {{superconducting magnet}} is {{critical}} for reliable operation of a device in which the magnet plays a role. With the advent of high temperature superconductors (HTS), liquid nitrogen {{may be used to}} cool HTS devices. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), an HTS with critical temperature of 93 K, is a promising HTS for transmission cables and electric power devices. However, before the coated YBCO conductor can be used, stability of the superconductor must well understood. One important component for the superconductor to be used in these power devices is highly conductive normal metal such as copper that electrically shunts the superconductor when it is driven to the normal state, intentionally or during a fault mode. In this thesis work, stability of coated YBCO conductor samples were studied both experimentally and analytically. Each test sample, 10 -cm or 15 -cm long and cooled directly by boiling liquid nitrogen, was investigated for its stability by means of an over- current pulse that exceeded the sample's nominal critical current at 77. 3 K. Variables of the investigation include: 1) presence or absence of copper layer incorporated into the sample; 2) thickness of copper layer; 3) nominal operating current before and after the application of a current pulse; 4) pulse current amplitude, and 5) pulse current duration. Recorded signals were sample voltages, measured by two sets of voltage taps, and sample temperatures, measured by three thermocouples placed at the center and two ends. The experimental and analytical results both demonstrated that for coated YBCO conductor to operate stably under operating conditions expected in the real device, it requires copper lamination whose thickness nearly <b>doubles</b> the original <b>conductor</b> thickness. by Joseph Edward Jankowski.

40|$|UnrestrictedBilayers of Pb and the {{alkali metals}} Cs, Rb, K and Na were quench {{condensed}} on the quartz plate. The transition temperature measurement provides information about interface barriers between the Pb and the alkali metals. Such a barrier, {{which is not}} due to impurities or oxidation, is particularly large in Pb/Cs sandwiches.; The thin K film is forced into an insulating state by being covered with sub-mono-layers of Pb. The SPE is used to investigate the electronic change in the alkali film. The K film behaves as if itselectrons are unable to carry a current in the x-y-plane but can easily move in the z-direction. This shows on the length scale of the K film thickness, the electronic properties of the film do notchange noticeably during the metal-insulator transition.; The superconducting proximity effect is investigated for SN-double layers in the thin film limit. In this regime, the normalized initial slope S{sn}=(d{s}/T{s}) |dT{c}/dd{n}| is independent of {{the thickness of the}} superconductor, the mean free path of the films and the transparency of the interface if it is not too small. The transition temperature T{c} is compared with a numerical calculation developed in our group. The deviation between the experiment and theory decreases from the normal metal to the superconductor with a relative high transition temperature. The deviation factor decreases from 2. 5 for Cu, Ag, Au, Mg to 1. 5 forCd, Zn, Al and finally no disagreement for In and Sn.; A weak perpendicular magnetic field is applied on the super- and normal <b>conductor</b> <b>double</b> layers. The difference of the transition temperature dT{c} measured with and without magnetic field increases with increasing the normal metal thickness. A quantitative explanation is given based on the increased dephasing of the electrons in the magnetic field. Numerical calculation of the transition temperature based on the strong coupling theory is also given and compared with the experimental results...|$|R
