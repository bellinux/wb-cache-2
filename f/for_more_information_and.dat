500|$|But {{some time}} later, Calvin Comfort, a [...] "prohibited mailing specialist" [...] for the region, found Jacobson's name in another file, and the {{government}} decided to try again, this time {{as part of an}} operation aimed at purchasers. In May 1986, they sent him mail from another fictitious organization, [...] "Midlands Data Research", which was for those who [...] "believe in the joys of sex and the complete awareness of those lusty and youthful lads and lasses of the neophite [...] age". Jacobson confessed to them that he was [...] "interested in teenage sexuality", asked <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> that his name be kept confidential. This led to Jacobson getting mail from the [...] "Heartland Institute for a New Tomorrow" [...] (HINT), [...] "an organization founded to protect and promote sexual freedom and freedom of choice. We believe that arbitrarily imposed legislative sanctions restricting your sexual freedom should be rescinded through the legislative process." [...] Jacobson seemed to sympathize, writing in response that sexual freedom and freedom of the press were under attack by [...] "right-wing fundamentalists".|$|E

500|$|Prime Minister Harper said {{he would}} move forward with his top five {{priorities}} from the campaign. At least four of these would require legislative action: {{the passage of a}} Federal Accountability Act in response to the sponsorship scandal; setting longer mandatory sentences; lowering the Goods & Services Tax to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6; and negotiating with the provinces to shorten wait-times (this priority was replaced, post-election, with combating crime by creating more police officers). The child allowance and first GST were in place by July 1, 2006. On December 6, 2006, another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling [...] "on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages." [...] The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled. (See Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>information.)</b> <b>and</b> on January 1, 2008 the second GST reduction came into effect.

2500|$|There {{are other}} multidimensional FFT {{algorithms}} that are {{distinct from the}} row-column algorithm, although {{all of them have}} O(NlogN) complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the vector-radix FFT algorithm, which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector [...] of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides all of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary. [...] Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. , is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977), which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products.

These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise such as cycling for example. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia. [...] Other significant effects include fluid redistribution (causing the [...] "moon-face" [...] appearance typical of pictures of astronauts in weightlessness), a slowing of the cardiovascular systemas blood flow decreases {{in response to a}} lack of gravity, a decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face.
