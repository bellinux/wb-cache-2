40|$|Abstract. Current flood {{protection}} {{policies in the}} Netherlands are based on design water levels. This concept {{does not allow for}} a proper evaluation of costs and benefits <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> protection. Hence, research is being carried out on the introduction <b>of</b> a <b>flood</b> risk approach, which looks into both the probability <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> and the consequences <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> This research is being carried out within the framework of a major project called the Floris project (FLOod RISk in the Netherlands). To assess the probability <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> the Floris project distinguishes different failure modes for dikes and structures within the dike ring. Based on a probabilistic analysis of both loads and resistance the probability of failure is determined for each failure mode. Subsequently the probabilities of failure for different failure modes and dike sections are integrated into an estimate of the probability <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> the dike ring as a whole. In addition the Floris project looks into the different consequences <b>of</b> <b>flooding,</b> specifically the economic damages and the number of casualties to be expected in case <b>of</b> <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> a particular dike ring. The paper describes the approach in the Floris project to assess the <b>flood</b> risk <b>of</b> dike rings in the Netherlands. One of the characteristics of the Floris project is the explicit attention to different types of uncertainties in assessing the probability <b>of</b> <b>flooding.</b> The paper discusses the different starting-points adopted and presents an outline on how the Floris project will deal with uncertainties in the analysis of weak spots in a dike ring {{as well as in the}} cost benefit analysis <b>of</b> <b>flood</b> alleviation measures...|$|R
