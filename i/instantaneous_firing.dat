50|$|One of the {{simplest}} types of neural-spiking models is the Poisson process. This however, is limited {{in that it is}} memory-less. It does not account for any spiking history when calculating the current probability of firing. Neurons, however, exhibit a fundamental (biophysical) history dependence by way of its relative and absolute refractory periods. To address this, a conditional intensity function is used to represent the probability of a neuron spiking, conditioned on its own history. The conditional intensity function expresses the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>firing</b> probability and implicitly defines a complete probability model for the point process. It defines a probability per unit time. So if this unit time is taken small enough to ensure that only one spike could occur in that time window, then our conditional intensity function completely specifies the probability that a given neuron will fire in a certain time.|$|E

Emissions of CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons are then estimated using ecosystem-dependent emission ratios.

For the case of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on R(t), was introduced in our recent work to characterize the spike synchronization transition. Unlike the case of spiking neurons, the IPFR R(t) of bursting neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we decompose the IPFR R(t) into the instantaneous population bursting rate R_b(t) (describing the bursting behavior) and the instantaneous population spike rate R_s(t) (describing the spiking behavior) via frequency filtering, and extend the realistic order parameter {{to the case of}} bursting neurons. Thus, we develop the frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters which are just the bursting and spiking "coherence factors" β_b and β_s of the bursting and spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of R_b and R_s (i. e., "signal to noise" ratio of the spectral peak height and its relative width). Through calculation of β_b and β_s, we obtain the bursting and spiking thresholds beyond which the burst and spike synchronizations break up, respectively.

Thus, noise-induced slow burst synchronization and fasg spike synchronization are found to appear in a synchronized region of the $J-D$ plane. As the rewiring probability $p$ is decreased from 1 (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the region of spike synchronization shrinks rapidly in the $J-D$ plane, while {{the region of the}} burst synchronization decreases slowly. Population synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in experiments. <b>Instantaneous</b> population <b>firing</b> rate, $R(t) $, which is directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes, is a realistic population quantity exhibiting collective behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales.

Then, we develop thermodynamic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures, based on $R_b (t) $ and $R_s (t) $, for characterization of the burst and spike synchronizations of the bursting neurons and show their usefulness in explicit examples. With increase in $p$, both the degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations are found to increase because more long-range connections appear.
