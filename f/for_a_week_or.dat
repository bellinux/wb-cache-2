5|$|Until a road {{could be}} opened from Lae, the Kaiapit area {{could only be}} {{supplied}} by air {{and there were a}} limited number of transport aircraft. Even flying in an airborne engineer aviation battalion to improve the airstrip would have involved taking aircraft away from operations supporting the 7th Division at Nadzab. Moreover, Whitehead warned that he could not guarantee adequate air support for both Kaiapit and the upcoming Finschhafen operation at the same time. However, Herring calculated that the 7th Division had sufficient reserves at Nadzab to allow maintenance flights to be suspended <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so after the capture of Kaiapit. He planned to seize Kaiapit with an overland advance from Nadzab by independent companies, the Papuan Infantry Battalion, and the 7th Division's 21st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E

25|$|The most {{promising}} candidates {{are invited to}} return {{for a second or}} third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule of thumb, longer {{endurance}} events are generally preceded by longer tapering periods, with the curious exception of particularly long endurance competitions, such as ultramarathons and multiday races.

25|$|Other {{applications}} are being developed. For example, {{it was reported}} that coating of aluminium or various aluminium alloys produces very corrosion-resistance surface, which then resisted immersion into concentrated aqueous solution of NaCl for two months without sign of pitting. The coating is produced either by immersion into aqueous solution of NdCl3 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> by electrolytic deposition using the same solution. In comparison with traditional chromium based corrosion inhibitors, NdCl3 and other rare-earth salts are environment friendly and much less toxic to humans and animals.|$|E
25|$|Salmon was the {{preferred}} food of the Stó:lō and {{was seen as}} superior to other types of meat. Meat and salmon were classified differently and salmon was said to give individuals energy while meat makes you feel heavy and lazy. In order to have salmon through the off seasons it was preserved through two different methods. In the summer salmon was wind dried with salt in the Fraser Canyon. In the fall salmon was smoked, this was traditionally done <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two but with modern refrigeration technology smoking is only done for a few days. Dried salmon was then either boiled or steamed before eating.|$|E

25|$|A {{qualified}} sleep specialist {{should be}} consulted for {{the diagnosis of}} any sleep disorder so the appropriate measures can be taken.

The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment. A sleep diary can be used {{to keep track of the}} individual's sleep patterns. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening and subjective feelings in the morning.
