5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by <b>frost</b> <b>heaving</b> into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{generalized}} {{model for}} secondary <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> is developed {{based on the}} one-dimensiona model of O’Neill and Miller. Secondary <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> arises during freezing owing to cryostatic suction effect. that can increase the upward water permeation to facilitate ice-lens growth and increased heave. Nondi mensionalization and scaling are used to simplify the model equations and to identify a dimensionles group whose magnitude characterizes the nature of secondary <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> in different soils. Computationa problems encountered by O’Neill and Miller are avoided by recognizing the boundary layer nature of th water permeation and by reducing the frozen fringe, wherein freezing and ice-lens growth occur, to moving planar boundary across which jump boundary conditions are prescribed. This generalized model ca 1 predict the <b>frost</b> <b>heave</b> behavior of different soils. Its predictions for the initiation time, spacing, am thickness of sequential ice lenses agree {{with the results of}} qualitative observations.
