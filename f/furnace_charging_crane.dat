50|$|The scrap basket is {{then taken}} to the melt shop, the roof is swung off the furnace, and the <b>furnace</b> is <b>charged</b> with scrap from the basket. Charging {{is one of the}} more {{dangerous}} operations for the EAF operators. A lot of potential energy is released by the tonnes of falling metal; any liquid metal in the furnace is often displaced upwards and outwards by the solid scrap, and the grease and dust on the scrap is ignited if the furnace is hot, resulting in a fireball erupting. In some twin-shell furnaces, the scrap is charged into the second shell while the first is being melted down, and pre-heated with off-gas from the active shell. Other operations are continuous charging—pre-heating scrap on a conveyor belt, which then discharges the scrap into the <b>furnace</b> proper, or <b>charging</b> the scrap from a shaft set above the furnace, with off-gases directed through the shaft. Other <b>furnaces</b> can be <b>charged</b> with hot (molten) metal from other operations.|$|R

40|$|The modem, highly {{competitive}} business of producing low cost, premium quality iron via the blast furnace route requires precise process control and {{a thorough understanding}} of the key operational variables. Much of the understanding of the factors influencing the process can only be obtained from measuring and testing on each individual furnace. This is particularly the case with regard to the raw materials charging system, as local factors including raw material specification and specific equipment design greatly influence the process. When BHP Steel Flat Products Division embarked on the massive project of adding a new blast furnace to the Port Kembla Steelworks a decision was made to ensure the plant would begin operations only after it was thoroughly understood. In keeping with this approach, a significant program of testing was undertaken on the new No. 6 Blast <b>Furnace</b> <b>charging</b> system. This thesis details the work done, the results gained and the application of the information on the now operating plant. As the ultimate purpose of the blast <b>furnace</b> <b>charging</b> system is to enable the raw materials to be placed inside the furnace accurately and consistently in a predictable and controlled way, the aim of the test work undertaken on the charging system was to build the understanding necessary to allow the plant to be set up to achieve the desired burden distribution on the stockline. The testing covered the raw materials handling system from the point where the material is first diverted to No. 6 Blast Furnace {{all the way to the}} inside of the furnace on the burden surface.

5000|$|An {{induction}} furnace {{consists of a}} nonconductive crucible holding the charge of metal to be melted, surrounded by a coil of copper wire. A powerful alternating current flows through the wire. The coil creates a rapidly reversing magnetic field that penetrates the metal. The magnetic field induces eddy currents, circular electric currents, inside the metal, by electromagnetic induction. [...] The eddy currents, flowing through the electrical resistance of the bulk metal, heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic materials like iron, the material may also be heated by magnetic hysteresis, the reversal of the molecular magnetic dipoles in the metal. Once melted, the eddy currents cause vigorous stirring of the melt, assuring good mixing. An advantage of induction heating is that the heat is generated within the <b>furnace's</b> <b>charge</b> itself rather than applied by a burning fuel or other external heat source, which can be important in applications where contamination is an issue.|$|R
