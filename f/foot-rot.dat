60|$|Old Bates was an {{excellent}} man, of whose fidelity the young squatter was quite assured. No one understood <b>foot-rot</b> better than Old Bates, or was less sparing of himself in curing it. He was a second mother to all the lambs, and when shearing came watched with the eyes of Argus {{to see that the}} sheep were not wounded by the shearers, or the wool left on their backs. But he had no conversation, none of that imagination which in such a time as this might have assisted in devising safeguards, and but little enthusiasm. Shepherds, so called, Harry kept none upon the run; and would have felt himself insulted had any one suggested that he was so backward in his ways as to employ men of that denomination. He had fenced his run, and dispensed with shepherds and shepherding as old-fashioned and unprofitable. He had two mounted men, whom he called boundary riders, one an Irishman and the other a German--and them he trusted fully, the German altogether, and the Irishman equally as regarded his honesty. But he could not explain to them the thoughts that loaded his brain. He could instigate them to eagerness; but he could not condescend to tell Karl Bender, the German, that if his fences were destroyed neither his means nor his credit would be sufficient to put them up again, and that if the scanty herbage were burned off any large proportion of his run, he must sell his flocks at a great sacrifice. Nor could he explain to Mickey O'Dowd, the Irishman, that his peace of mind was destroyed by his fear of one man. He had to bear it all alone. And there was heavy on him also the great misery of feeling that every thing might depend on own exertions, and that yet {{he did not know how}} or where to exert himself. When he had ridden about all night and discovered nothing, he might just as well have been in bed. And he was continually riding about all night and discovering nothing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first sign}} of a <b>foot-rot</b> {{infection}} is when the skin between the claws of the hoof begins to swell (cellulitis). Swelling usually appears 24 hours after infection. The skin between the toes may be very red and tender and the toes may separate {{because of all the}} swelling. This is very painful to the animal and can cause lameness. The animal may also have a raised body temperature. A crack can develop along the infected part and is yellow in color. The foot will have a foul odor. Tendons and joints in the area can become infected, which is much harder to treat. A condition known as [...] "super foot rot" [...] is seen in some animals. Super foot rot infection occurs much faster and is usually much more severe. Most normal foot rot treatments will not cure this foot rot and a veterinarian should be contacted immediately.|$|E

In January 1826, a company agent, Robert Dawson (1782-1866), set up camp near the shoreline at Port Stephens. He confined his settlement activities to the coast, with farms on Stroud creek, outposts on the Manning River, stock-mistering in Gloucester Vale. Despite good reports, according to a modern historian, Dawson's numerous improvements, were judged inadequate and the area around Port Stephen was seen as disappointing, with useless outskirts, the central zone rocky, steep and the Gloucester flats water-logged: sheep suffered from <b>foot-rot.</b> The Company wanted to push beyond the hills that hemmed the settlement in, and Dawson was dismissed for mismanagement and replaced by the Arctic explorer, William Parry.|$|E
50|$|While {{attending}} school in Biggar, Riddell was {{a contributor to}} the Clydesdale Magazine, and wrote ‘The Crook and Plaid,’ one of his most successful songs. A visit to Pinkie, Midlothian, in his student days inspired the vigorous lyric ‘Ours is the Land of Gallant Hearts.’ He contributed pieces about the same time to the collections of Robert Archibald Smith and Peter McLeod, the latter publishing his picturesque song, ‘Scotland Yet.’ Wilson included, with hearty commendation, in the ‘Noctes Ambrosianæ’ for March 1825, Riddell's lyric, ‘When the Glen all is still.’ Riddell published in 1831 ‘Songs of the Ark,’ sacred pieces which are not of much account. In 1844 appeared the ‘Christian Politician,’ a doctrinal volume displaying argumentative power and force of character. A volume entitled ‘Poems, Songs, and Miscellaneous Pieces,’ was issued in 1847. To ‘Hogg's Instructor,’ in 1847, Riddell contributed a discriminating account of the Ettrick shepherd. He translated into lowland Scotch, in 1855 and 1857 respectively, St. Matthew and the Psalms of David, the latter for Prince Lucien Bonaparte. For the ‘Scottish Agricultural Journal,’ in 1848-9, he wrote substantial papers on ‘Store-farming in the South of Scotland,’ and about the same time received from the Highland and Agricultural Society a prize of 10l. for an ‘Essay on <b>Foot-rot</b> in Sheep.’ In 1871, the year after his death, appeared, in two volumes, ‘The Poetical Works of Henry Scott Riddell,’ edited, with a memoir, by Dr. Brydon.

40|$|<b>Foot-rot</b> in sheep has troubled farmers {{for many}} years {{not because of any}} {{spectacular}} epidemics associated with high mortality but because the chronic lameness associated with foot infection, and its consequences, frequently interfere with farm husbandry. Methods of control and eradication have been known since 1940 but as they generally involve many hours of strenuous work, the development of more efficient methods of <b>foot-rot</b> control has been the aim of different research groups. Two findings which suggested that <b>foot-rot</b> organisms might be accessible to blood-borne inhibitors helped change the attitude of researchers involved with this problem. The first was the successful use of parenterally administered antibiotics against <b>foot-rot</b> infection and the second was the demonstration that serum globulins were able to make contact with Fusiformis nodosus Fusiformis nodosus was shown to be the primarily important and transmitting organism of sheep <b>foot-rot.</b> in situ. The results of these experiments carried out at the McMaster Institute, Sydney led to a reappraisal of existing research projects and the formation of a new policy leading towards the development of experimental vaccines. By 1970 when the writer's course of study began, it had been shown that bench scale vaccines conferred some protection against <b>foot-rot</b> infection and that vaccination was effective in stimulating resistance even after infection had become established. There were no methods available other than direct sheep challenge experiments for evaluating different types of vaccine and although the existence of anti-F. nodosus bactericidal antibody was known, there was still considerable doubt about the immune mechanisms involved in protection. There had been no investigation of the antigenic potential of F. nodosus products of growth or indeed of the bacterial cells themselves and as a consequence the influence of media components on the immunogenicity of the resulting culture had received little attention...|$|E

There are other wheat diseases which do not admit of simple straightforward methods of control. Rust (Puccinia spp.) and the <b>Foot-rot</b> diseases have not received attention from New Zealand workers. Rust is recognised as an important disease, yet, because it is not a simple problem, it has been left alone. The Foot-rots are in the same category. They are not so conspicuous as rust, unless present in a severe form, and are generally overlooked. This, however, should not preclude an investigation of the disease. Of recent years, a number of workers in Europe, America and Australia have turned their attention to the <b>Foot-rot</b> diseases with the result that much information is available about the causal organisms. The virulence of the parasite, however, is influenced by complex factors acting on the host plant and on the organism so that specific control measures cannot be given.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Strawbreaker <b>foot-rot</b> {{is a major}} {{limiting}} factor to cost efficient winter wheat production in the Pacific Northwest. Development of resistant cultivars has been hindered {{by the lack of}} adequate levels of genetic resistance and screening techniques which can consistently detect desired genotypes. Studies were conducted to determine if the reported strawbreaker <b>foot-rot</b> resistance of the cultivar "Rendezvous" is effective on isolates of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides found in the Pacific Northwest. Protected, naturally infected and artificially inoculated treatments were employed to determine the level of resistance of 10 cultivars including Rendezvous. Different concentrations of inoculum and stages of development were also used to determine if observations on leaf sheath penetration of seedlings obtained in the greenhouse were related to disease severity index readings taken in the field for selected cultivars. In addition, the nature of inheritance of strawbreaker <b>foot-rot</b> was studied in two crosses involving Rendezvous. Experiments were conducted at three locations and over two years at one location. Despite cultivar x treatment interaction, consistent levels of infection were observed in all experiments at each location. Significant differences were found for treatments and cultivars for most attributes. Yield losses, including the components of yield spikes per square meter, 1000 kernel weight, and kernel number per spike were proportional to the severity of the disease. Losses were greater when lodging occurred, which was also associated with disease severity. However, {{even in the absence of}} lodging losses were recorded in the naturally and artificially inoculated plots. Traits measured involving Rendezvous and Vpm/Mos 95 //* 2 Hill were only slightly influenced by the treatments. Under greenhouse conditions, it was possible to distinguish the level of resistance of Rendezvous from susceptible cultivars at concentrations of 100 spores/ml, two weeks after inoculation at the seedling stage. Leaf sheath penetration of seedlings was found to be closely associated with the disease severity index obtained under field conditions. Generation means analysis performed in crosses involving Rendezvous indicated that additive and additive x additive gene action were responsible for most of the genetic variability associated with resistance. Narrow-sense heritability estimates also confirmed these fmdings. It would appear that Rendezvous has at least two major genes for resistance to strawbreaker <b>foot-rot...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} were to present {{descriptive}} epidemiological characteristics of lameness in intensively and semi-intensively reared flocks of Chios-breed dairy sheep in Greece, as well as to identify potential factors that may affect development, severity and duration of the disorder. In total, 1618 ewes in nine flocks were used for assessment of locomotion score and detailed clinical examination, which were performed fortnightly throughout a milking period. Subsequently, two logistic regression models were employed to assess impact of various variables on occurrence and severity of lameness. Mean lameness incidence in the nine flocks under surveillance during the milking period was 6. 8 % (110 cases in 1618 ewes); between flocks range of the incidence was 0. 4 %- 22. 0 %. In 48 % of the cases, lameness was considered to be severe. <b>Foot-rot</b> was found to be the commonest lameness-causing disorder, accounting for 66 % of all cases. During the investigation, incidence of lameness in relation to the causing factor was 4. 5 % for <b>foot-rot,</b> 1 % for white line abscesses, 1 % for white line disease, < 0. 5 % for pedal joint abscesses and < 0. 5 % for hoof injuries.

Benign strains secrete a closely related, but distinct, proteinase {{which has the}} same molecular mass and N-terminal sequences as the 'virulent' basic proteinase, but a lower pI of approximately 8. 6. The basic proteinases from both strains appear to interact with other proteins present in the culture medium, which results in anomalous behavior on gel filtration. Pure D. nodosus 'virulent' basic proteinase has a molecular mass of 36 kDa and showed a low solubility at I < 0. 05 precipitating quantitatively from solution as microcrystals. The proteinase shows optimal activity at pH 8. 0 and is stable to heating to 55 degrees C for 30 min, but at higher temperatures activity is rapidly lost. Bivalent-metal ions (e. g.

40|$|Background: During the FMD {{outbreak}} in Ireland and the UK in 2001, there was significant uncertainty amongstveterinary practitioners and government veterinary inspectors surrounding the clinical diagnosis of FMD insheep. This situation was complicated by reports of idiopathic oral ulcers that closely resembled FMD ongross appearance which {{at that time}} were referred to as ovine mouth and gum obscure disease. Methods: A field and abattoir study was carried out to determine the frequency, appearance and significance of oraland digital lesions in sheep in Ireland. A total of 3, 263 sheep were examined in 22 flocks, including 1, 969 lambs and 1, 294 adults. A further 2, 403 animals were examined by abattoir inspections.

40|$|Bacillus necrophorus is an {{important}} organism in animal dis-ease since it produces severe septic processes in a num-ber of domestic animals. The organism is widely distributed and is responsible for considerable losses. It may invade almost any tissue and is associated with various necrotic foci, as in calf diphtheria, necrotic ulcers of the intestine in hog cholera, <b>foot-rot</b> of sheep and cattle, grease heel or necrotic scratches of horses, lip and leg ulceration of sheep, gangrenous dermatitis of horses, metastatic necrosis of liver and lungs of cattle and swine, necrotic stomatitis of calves, lambs and pigs. A few human cases of infection with a similar organism have been reported. These are referred to by Harris and Brown (1927) who isolated from cases of puerperal infection in women cultures closely resembling B. necrophorus and designated by them Act. pseudo-necrophorus.

The several propogules of P. parasitica were then studied {{to determine their}} survival capabilities in soil and irrigation water. Chlamydospores of P. parasitica were present in field soils from <b>foot-rot</b> infested citrus groves and persisted for at least 60 days in air-dried or moist soils. They germinated in irrigation water or moist soil and formed sporangia within 16 hr. Sporangia were also present in these field soils and survived for at least 60 days in moist soil. They germinated, releasing zoospores into irrigation water 5 min after being inundated. Zoospores were not present in water flooded on air-dried field soil until after 20 hr incubation. Citrus leaves became infected by zoospores within 15 min when placed in zoospore infested water. Although they remained motile in irrigation water for up to 20 hr at 20 C, zoospores encysted when agitated or upon the addition of nutrients, orange peel, or citrus leaves. At low nutrient levels (< 5 mg glucose/liter of sterile distilled water) zoospores germinated and upon cessation of growth the protoplasm contracted within the hyphae and pseudo-septa were formed. Empty cysts or hyphae often lysed; remaining hyphal fragments containing protoplasm survived for at least 40 days at 25 C in untreated waste water and resumed growth upon addition of nutrients. At higher nutrient levels (10 - 1, 000 mg glucose/liter of sterile distilled water) the hyphal tips often produced appressorium-like structures when {{in contact with the}} container surface. Exudates from orange peel or citrus leaves stimulated similar activity. The appressorium-like structures usually germinated to produce microsporangia when the nutrients were replaced with untreated irrigation waste water.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} by way of personal interviews with 562 respondents comprising 459 farmers and 103 butchers/traders in selected districts in the central and western parts of Kenya, consisting of three predominantly smallholder and four predominantly pastoral/extensive districts. The study aimed to provide {{a better understanding of}} smallholder and pastoral/extensive sheep and goat farming systems in the tropics, by taking Kenya as an example. The results showed that 58 % of the pastoral/extensive farmers and 46 % of the smallholders indicated livestock as their main activity. Small ruminants ranked closely behind cattle in their importance. Thirty-four percent of the households kept only sheep, 18 % only goats and 48 % both species. The survey demonstrated the relative importance to the farmers of tangible benefits of farming sheep and goats (e. g., regular cash income, meat, manure and, in the case of goats, milk) versus intangible benefits (e. g., the role of small ruminants as an insurance against emergencies). Regular cash income and an insurance against emergencies were the highest priorities. Seventy-eight percent of the farmers reported animal sales over the previous 12 months of the survey date. Of these sales, the income was spent on school fees (32 %), purchase of food (22 %), farm investment (18 %), medical expenses (10 %), off-farm investment (9 %), social activities (5 %) and re-stocking (4 %). Indigenous genotypes were predominant among the pastoralists and mixed crosses predominant among the smallholders. A range of traits: growth rate, body size, body shape, drought tolerance, meat quality, fertility, disease and heat tolerance, prolificacy and temperament were all considered important for both sheep and goats in both farming systems and across the different genotypes. Compared with other pure breeds, the Red Maasai sheep and the Small East African goats were rated poorly in terms of body size, body shape, growth and fertility, but highly in terms of drought and (for the Red Maasai) heat tolerance by both smallholder and pastoralist farmers. In general, crosses were perceived less favourably than indigenous pure breeds. Body size and performance ranked as the most important traits in the choice of breeding males. Approximately half the farmers inherited their males, reared them on the farm and kept them for an average of 2 - 3 years. Uncontrolled mating within the household's flock was predominant in both farming systems. Over 98 % of the farmers reported incidence of disease, especially pneumonia (in pastoral/extensive areas), helminthosis, tick-borne diseases, diarrhoea and <b>foot-rot.</b> Over 95 % of the farmers fed supplements in both dry and wet seasons. Pure exotic and indigenousÃ—exotic genotypes fetched higher prices than indigenous genotypes due to their heavier body weight. In conclusion, the foregoing issues need attention in genetic improvement programmes, with more emphasis on the conservation and utilisation of indigenous small ruminant genotypes...|$|E
40|$|Trials {{were carried}} out from 1959 to 1967 on the {{secondary}} sexual characteristics of asparagus and on the inheritance of sex. Growth rate of the seedling is closely dependent on the seed size. Seed size depends not only on number of seeds per berry but also it is genetically controlled independently of sex. Seeds giving rise to ♀plants germinate faster than those giving rise to ♂plants. Among 119 crosses 1000 grain weight varied from 15. 4 to 28. 7 g. In crosses of 17 ♀plants with 7 ♂plants {{it was evident that}} both parents, but particularly the ♀plants, control seed size. Crop observations on seedlings showed that the number of stalks developing was the same in ♂and ♀plants. ♂plants flower earlier. In a field trial at Maasbree set out in the previous year no difference was observed initially in 1962 in the number of stalks in ♂and ♀plants. After berries had first been produced ♀plants lagged. ♂plants had more stalks, thinner stalks and a higher stalk product (sum of the squares of the diameters of all the stems of each plant) than ♀plants. From 1963 to 1965 production of ♂plants differed from ♀in: a. a higher yield; the difference increased over the years from 27 to 48 %; b. thinner spears; the average spear weight was about 10 % less; c. more spears; d. earlier production; e. more spears at each harvest. The observations on this field in the summers of 1963 and 1964 confirmed the results for 1962. ♀plants which produced a lot of berries in 1962 produced less stalks in the next three years than ♀plants producing few berries in 1962. Thus there is a tendency for berry production to inhibit stalk production. Determination of sexes in plots varying from 1 to 100 years old showed that as the fields became older the percentage of ♂plants rose from 50 to 85. Thus over the years more ♀than ♂plants die. ♂plants have a longer life, as seen in their greater resistance to <b>foot-rot.</b> In severely diseased fields there are more ♂than ♀plants because more of the ♀plants have died. Flowers of ♀plants hardly vary in the form and size of the rudimentary stamens, whereas ♂plants vary considerably {{in the development of the}} pistil. ♂flowers could be divided into five classes ranging from those with a tiny rudimentary ovary to a completely developed pistil. The latter could form berries. Flower structure is such that self-pollination occurs and hence self-fertilization. Plants with most flowers ♂can also have flowers of other classes; no plants were found with flowers only of the class with a fully developed pistil and stamens. On seedbeds and commercial fields ♂plants flowered more heavily than ♀; on very old fields ♀plants hardly ever flowered. In a young field 50 % of the plants are ♂and 50 % ♀. However among crosses of 17 ♀plants with the same ♂plant, one ♀plant gave significantly more ♂than ♀offspring. As ♂plants were more productive than ♀plants, ways were sought of sexing the seedlings before planting out to allow entirely ♂beds to be set out. Two year-old ♂plants can be planted out but the work is laborious and the plants take poorly. The difficulties cannot be solved by selecting seedlings by weight and by recovery after removing the tops or by sexing the seedlings with potassium chlorate. When the material is pollinated with old pollen, the percentage ♂plants exceeds 50 %. The size of X and Y pollen grains was the same. As the trials failed to give a practical method of obtaining an entirely ♂field, it was decided to resort to genetics. Both ♂and ♀plants occur in the fields. The obligate cross-fertilization yields a population of XX and XY in the proportion 1 : 1. There may be an occasional andromonoecious XY plant. With self-fertilization the offspring is XX, XY and YY in the proportions 1 : 2 : 1. These YY plants are necessary to produce entirely ♂offspring (XY) by crossing with ♀(XX). XY and YY plants cannot be distinguished phenotypically; this is only possible by test crosses with ♀plants. Seeds giving rise to YY plants germinate more slowly than those developing XY plants. The YY plants tend to start flowering earlier, although this difference is not significant. The XY and YY plants are the same in average pollen grain size. Cytological studies showed that asparagus has 10 pairs of chromosomes. In somatic root-tip cells the 10 pairs can be divided into 3 groups: long, medium and short. Five pairs are long, one is medium and the other four are short. One of the five pairs of long chromosomes has a satellite. One author called this pair the sex pair. Despite careful observations on this pair of chromosomes in XX, XY and YY plants, I found no differences. It was impossible to distinguish the sex chromosome in the somatic cells of root tips. As stated before the ♂flowers are divided into 5 classes. If many plants have to be studied, this method is quite time-consuming. Hence the classification is based on berry production, for this procedure requires less time. The ♂and andromonoecious plants were divided into 4 groups: a. purely ♂, no berries; b. slightly andromonoecious, 1 - 10 berries per plant; c. moderately andromonoecious, 11 - 100 berries per plant; d. strongly andromonoecious, over 100 berries per plant. Development of the pistils in andromonoecious plants and consequently berry production depend upon day-length and temperature. Short days and low temperatures promote pistil development. The position of the flower on the plant does not effect development of the pistil. The degree of andromonoecy depends on the plant's age as well as on external influences. In general the plant is most andromonoecious at maximum growth, which is achieved when three years old. They become less andromonoecious as the plants grow older. Strongly andromonoecious plants resemble ♀in crop development, both groups being characterized by few stalks per plant. There is no difference in average pollen grain size between andromonoecious XY, ♂XY, andromonoecious YY and ♂YY plants. Gibberellic acid was unsuccesful as a spray to stimulate te development of the ovary in ♂flowers and the stamens in ♀flowers. The tests of inheritance of andromonoecy can be divided into 3 groups: a. crosses of some YY plants with one ♀plant and of various ♀plants with one YY plant; b. segregation in I 1, I 2 and I 3 and in the progeny of crosses of I 1 and I 2 plants with one ♀plant; c. segregation in I 3 and I 4 and in the progeny of reciprocal crosses of I 2 and I 3 plants. The results of tests a and b gave rise to the following hypothesis. The autosomes of ♀and ♂plants possess genes with a weak to strong female influence. These genes, called G, have no influence in ♀plants, because they already possess berries, or in ♂plants, because these have the genes AA and consequently produce no berries. But if the plant has the genotype XYAa a few berries are produced, as the G genes may manifest themselves. Inbreeding of it yields the following offspring: XXAA ♀ XXAa ♀ XXaa ♀ XYAA ♂ XYAa slightly andromonoecious, if G factors are present XYaa strongly andromonoecious, if G factors are present YYAA ♂ YYAa mostly ♂ YYaa andromonoecious, if G factors are present The following genotypes could be called extreme: XXaaGG [...] strongly ♀ not visible in the phenotype XXAAgg [...] slightly ♀ not visible in the phenotype XYaaGG [...] strongly andromonoecious XYAAgg [...] entirely ♂ After self-fertilization the XYAa plants can segregate into ♀, andromonoecious and ♂plants in the proportion 4 : 7 : 5. If growing conditions are optimum the YYAa plants with their two Y chromosomes can segregate into andromonoccious and 3 plants 1 : 3; sometimes, however, YYAa can be slightly andromonoecious. The degree of andromonoecy can be influenced in various ways, e. g. by the difference in number of G factors. Crossed with one ♀plant the YY plants (progeny of selffertilized I 1 XYAa plants) can segregate into 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa; the first group gives purely ♂progeny, the second slightly to moderately andromonoecious and the third group strongly andromonoecious. The segregation of the crosses of some ♀plants with one YY plant can be explained by assuming one or more pairs of genes influencing the degree of andromonoecy. The influence of these genes depends largely upon environment. Test (segregation in the I 3 and I 4 and in the progeny of reciprocal crosses of I 2 and I 3 plants) showed that germination of pollen decreased in 4 of the 5 inbred lines. The average pollen germination of the inbred progeny of one XY plant and one YY plant is 3, 7 and 1, 6 %, respectively. These inbred lines include various plants whose pollen did not germinate at all so that inbreeding depression results in male-sterile XY and YY plants. Although the pistils were well formed, few berries were produced because the pollen of inbred lines germinated poorly and of crosses only moderately. (These tests were all in a greenhouse and hence the flowers were self-pollinated). Although as a result of repeated inbreeding the plants used in this test would possess the genotype aa and many G factors, the degree of andromonoecy in the inbred lines and crosses did not come up to expectation, probably because the observations were on young plants in the greenhouse. There are differences in number and degree of andromonoecy between reciprocal crosses. As both the genetic constitution of the reciprocal crosses and the growing conditions of the plants are the same, andromonoecy tends to be influenced cytoplasmatically. Despite a thorough search among ♀plants no gynomonoecious counterparts of the andromonoecious plants could be found. Instructions were drawn up for the production of ♂material from the hypothesis of how andromonoecy is inherited. As starting material XXAA and YYAA plants are needed, whatever the number of G factors. A male variety may be produced as follows. First search is made for XXAAGG [...] plants, which are needed to trace YYAA plants, irrespective of G factors, in the progeny of self-fertilized XYAa or YYAa plants. The YYAA plants are then crossed with many productive ♀plants. Productive F 1 plants are subsequently traced by observing flowering and yield of spears. Largescale production of this F 1 requires vegetative propagation of the XXAA and YYAA, e. g. by rootstock division. In the course of several years 1596 and 500 divisions respectively, have been obtained from 14 ♀and 3 ♂plants. An entirely ♂ 3 F 1, can be produced from inbred lines. The best plan for inbreeding is to self-fertilize XYAa plants which give rise to XXAA and YYAA offspring. When self-fertilized the XYAa segretates into: 1 / 16 XXAA, 2 / 16 XXAa, 1 / 16 XXaa, 2 / 16 XYAA, 4 / 16 XYAa, 2 / 16 XYaa, 1 / 16 YYAA, 2 / 16 YYAa and 1 / 16 YYaa. After inbreeding for five or six generations entirely homozygous XXAA and YYAA plants can be produced...|$|E
