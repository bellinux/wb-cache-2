Direct utilization of <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> is mainly considered for space heating. But <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> could be widely use in balneology and recreation too. The Polish Lowlands covers huge area, which is about 80 % of Poland's territory. The most perspective disposable resources of <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> are accumulated in the Lower Jurassic aquifers containing about 1. 88 E + 18 J/year = 4. 48 E + 07 TOE/year (TOE -tons of oil equivalent, 1 TOE = 4. 18 · 1010 J) (Górecki 2006). The two main types of water occurring in the area are chloride waters, which are the most common and sulphate-sulphide waters, both used in balneology. <b>Geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> when used for balneology must fulfil some specific conditions. Water must contain appropriate chemical composition and TDS level. Also temperature of water for baths is very important and it is determined in connection to human's body temperature. Additionally, waters, which are labelled as healing waters must be accepted by the Ministry of Health. In the Polish Lowlands there are a very few geothermal health resorts, such as Ciechocinek, Konstancin and Grudziądz. There are also a few geothermal recreation and spa centres. However, the possibility of <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> utilization in balneology is much better.

We analyzed samples for major ions and trace element concentrations. Temperature of <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> in deep wells showed extreme ranges (40 and 230 °C), while, temperature of hot spring fluids was up to 90 °C. The Piper plot illustrated two dominant water types: Na-HCO 3 - type for <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> in deep wells and Ca-HCO 3 - type for hot spring fluids. Arsenic concentration ranged from 0. 03 to 1. 5 mg/L. Dominance of reduced As species, i. e., As(III), was observed in our samples. The Eh value ranged between - 250 and 119 mV, which suggests diverse geochemical conditions. Some of the measured trace elements were found above the World Health Organization guidelines and Turkish national safe drinking water limits. The variation in pH (range: 6. 4 - 9. 3) and As in <b>geothermal</b> <b>waters</b> suggest mixing with groundwater.
