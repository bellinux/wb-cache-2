25|$|Rosé making has a {{long history}} in the Loire valley, {{particularly}} in the Anjou wine region around the town of Angers where two AOCs, Rosé d'Anjou and Cabernet d'Anjou exist. The former, made from the Groslot (Grolleau) grapes that are often harvested to very high yields around 50 hl/ha, tends to be lighter and often sweet. The latter, made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, is often drier (though some styles can be sweet), with grapes that are limited to smaller harvests of no more than 40 hl/ha. Cabernet d'Anjou are usually noted for their high acidity levels that give these rosé the rather unusual capability of being able to age <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|E
25|$|The {{decolonization}} of Africa {{started with}} Libya in 1951, although Liberia, South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia were already independent. Many countries {{followed in the}} 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the Year of Africa, which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including {{a large part of}} French West Africa. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were Guinea-Bissau (1974), Mozambique (1975) and Angola (1975) from Portugal; Djibouti from France in 1977; Zimbabwe from the United Kingdom in 1980; and Namibia from South Africa in 1990.

25|$|The Bucs {{started off}} the season 0–3, with Simms {{throwing}} only 1 touchdown to 7 interceptions. In the third {{game of the}} season, a last-minute loss to the Panthers, Simms's spleen was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for {{the balance of the}} season. After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start Gradkowski, a 6th-round pick from Toledo. After nearly beating the Saints, Gradkowski led the team to last-minute wins over the Bengals and Eagles. The success was short-lived, however, and the Bucs lost five of the next six games. Tim Rattay replaced Gradkowski as quarterback late in the season, and the team finished 4–12.

500|$|In {{the postwar}} years, the heavy {{production}} of cents was scaled back, as hoarding ceased {{and some of}} the slack was taken up by other base-metal coins. Nevertheless, the various issues of small coins, at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel cents, of both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage. [...] Fifty-five million bronze cents were also sold to the government; beginning in 1874, the Mint re-issued these in response to commercial requests for cents, lowering the demand for new coins. [...] Drops in the price of silver brought coins of that metal, hoarded <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more, back into commerce, also decreasing demand. Between 1866 and 1878, production only occasionally exceeded ten million; the 1877 coin, with a circulation mintage of 852,500, is a rare date for the series. After 1881, there were few redemptions of bronze cents, due to high demand for the denomination, though copper-nickel cents continued to be redeemed and melted.|$|E

Krissi Murison of the NME disagreed, calling it one of [...] "the best bits of the decade of decadence" [...] and referring to it as [...] "Salt-N-Pepa's cartoon rap". Jason Shawhan of About.com stated that the song's [...] "great Narada Michael Walden bleepy synth noises [...] pop out of the mix like the car stereo just decided to sing along", and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music commented that the track had [...] "icy-cool schoolyard sass". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B argued that the track [...] "carelessly revisits Stefani's blatant fondness for 80's pop, but not even [...] Tony Kanal can save her from lifeless retreads like these." [...] The Washington Post reviewer Sean Daly compared it to Salt-n-Pepa's 1987 single [...] "Push It" [...] and added that Stefani [...] "pushes it real good". PopMatters's Jason Damas gave it a very strong review, stating that [...] "Stefani nails all the vocal mannerisms" [...] and that Kanal [...] "reveals a major mainstream pop jones here, especially {{in the way he}} layers the cut [...] with dozens of orchestra hits [...] which have been absent from almost all pop albums <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more now."

500|$|Two {{charters}} of 681 show Æthelred granting {{land near}} Tetbury, {{on what is}} now the border between Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. [...] This may indicate that Æthelred was able to extend Mercian influence further into the territory of the West Saxons, as Wulfhere had done before him. [...] The West Saxons managed a significant military resurgence under Cædwalla, king of Wessex from about 685 to 688, but when Cædwalla departed for Rome on pilgrimage there may have been internal strife before Ine, his successor, took the throne. Cædwalla had successfully conquered the kingdoms of Sussex and Kent, and his abdication {{may have contributed to the}} unsettled history of the southeast over the next few years. In Kent, Oswine emerged as king, though only in eastern Kent; the western half of the kingdom was ruled by Swæfheard, son of Sæbbi, the king of Essex. It is possible that Æthelred provided support to both Swæfheard and Oswine; for each king a charter survives in which Æthelred confirms land grants they made in Kent, and Æthelred's invasion of Kent in 676 indicates his opposition to the traditional Kentish royal house. A charter of Swæfheard's dated 691 is also of interest as it indicates that Æthelred had invaded Kent; it has been suggested that Æthelred intended to place Wilfrid in the Archbishop's seat at Canterbury, but if so he was unsuccessful. Alternatively, Æthelred may have needed assistance in Kent from the East Saxons who may have been independent of Mercia <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more by that time. [...] The East Saxons did return to the Mercian orbit over the next few years: a charter of Æthelred's, dated between 693 and 704, shows him granting land to Wealdhere, the bishop of London, and in 704 Æthelred consented to a grant made by Swæfheard. The latter charter also appears to show that a comes, or local official, was put in place by the Mercians to protect their interests.|$|E

2500|$|Alcoholic {{liver disease}} (ALD). Alcoholic {{cirrhosis}} develops for 10–20% {{of individuals who}} drink heavily <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more. Alcohol seems to injure the liver by blocking the normal metabolism of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. This injury happens through the formation of acetaldehyde from alcohol which itself is reactive, but which also leads to the accumulation of other reactive products in the liver. [...] Patients may also have concurrent alcoholic hepatitis with fever, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and anorexia. AST and ALT blood levels are both elevated, but at less than 300 IU/liter, with an AST:ALT ratio > 2.0, a value rarely seen in other liver diseases.

However, for many academics, the time demands of parenting create a hidden dilemma: “parent and perish. ” Can academics incorporate parenting into an intensive research agenda? This is <b>a</b> particular challenge <b>for</b> many women. Recognizing this problem, many universities have made attempts to “level the playing field ” for women by instituting family-friendly policies, like parental leave and stopped tenure clock, so that female professors who give birth will have a fairer chance to get tenure without neglecting their child-care responsibilities. Indeed these policies {{have been in place}} <b>for</b> nearly <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more at many major universities.
