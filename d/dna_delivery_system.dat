When asialoorosomucoid conjugated with poly(L-lysine) was used to deliver the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene into primary hepatocytes through binding with the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, only a low level of beta-galactosidase was detectable, with less than 0. 1 % of the hepatocytes being transfected. This level of activity can be greatly enhanced by the cointernalization of the DNA. protein complex with a replication-defective adenovirus, resulting in 100 % of the hepatocytes staining blue with 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl beta-D-galactoside. Quantitative analysis of beta-galactosidase expression also showed a 1000 -fold enhancement of activity. To test the applicability of this <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> for the correction of phenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder that causes severe mental retardation in children, we have delivered the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene to hepatocytes derived from a PAH-deficient mouse strain and demonstrated complete reconstitution of enzymatic activity.

Furthermore, LAH 4 -L 1 peptide can enhance the hepatitis B antigen plasmid induced immune responses in vitro: Firstly, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that significant increase of IL- 6 and TNF-α secretion was observed after delivering hepatitis B surface antigen encoding plasmid by LAH 4 -L 1 to RAW 264. 7 macrophages and JAWSII dendritic cells.

Spray drying and spray coating bead techniques were employed in the preparation of the DNA vaccine microparticles. The spray drying technique allowed production of spherical shape enteric-coated microparticles with a particle size range of 0. 18 to 20 μm. Larger particle sizes of 40 - 50 mesh were obtained from the spray-coated bead technique. The resultant DNA vaccine microparticles were granulated with regular fish feed and given to fish to investigate the efficacy of the <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> in providing protection against IHNV, and to demonstrate the ease of administration in fish. An in vivo fish trial experiment showed improvement in fish survival rate when fish were immunized with larger particle size DNA vaccine microparticles.

Phospholipids are in contrast intrinsically safe; yet their association with DNA is problematic because of unfavorable electrostatic interactions. We achieve the phospholipid-DNA complexation through the like-charge attraction induced by cations. Monovalent cations are inappropriate due to their poor binding affinity with lipids as inferred from electrophoretic mobility, whereas x-ray diffractions reveal that with multivalent cations, DNA is complexed within an inverted hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase. Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations confirm the self-assembly of a DNA rod wrapped into a lipid layer with cations in between acting as molecular glue. Transfection experiments performed with Ca 2 + and La 3 + demonstrate efficiencies surpassing those obtained with optimized cationic DOTAP-based systems, while preserving the viability of cells. Inspired by bacteriophages that resort to polycations to compact their genetic materials, complexes assembled with tetravalent spermine achieve unprecedented transfection efficiencies for phospholipids.

In addition, these efforts have {{opened the door to the}} opportunity to develop novel genetic therapies to treat a broad range of inherited disorders, Through a joint effort by the University of Vermont, the University of Rome, Tor Vergata, University of Rome, La Sapienza, and the CSS Mendel Institute, Rome, an international meeting, 'Genome Medicine: Gene Therapy for the Millennium' was organized. This meeting provided a forum for the discussion of scientific and clinical advances stimulated by the explosion of sequence information generated by the Human Genome Project and the implications these advances have for gene therapy. The meeting had six sessions that focused on the functional evaluation of specific genes via biochemical analysis and through animal models, the development of novel therapeutic strategies involving gene targeting, artificial chromsomes, <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> and non-embryonic stem cells, and on the ethical and social implications of these advances...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} {{have been}} used widely in experimental primate models of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their effectiveness has been limited. In this study, we evaluated three technologies for increasing the potency of DNA vaccines in rhesus macaques. These included DNA encoding Sindbis virus RNA replicons (pSINCP), cationic poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) microparticles for DNA delivery, and recombinant protein boosting. The DNA-based pSINCP replicon vaccines encoding HIV Gag and Env were approximately equal in potency to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven conventional DNA vaccines (pCMV). The PLG microparticle <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> was particularly effective at enhancing antibody responses induced by both pCMV and pSINCP vaccines and had less effect on T cells. Recombinant Gag and Env protein boosting elicited rapid and strong recall responses, {{in some cases to}} levels exceeding those seen after DNA or DNA/PLG priming. Of note, Env protein boosting induced serum-neutralizing antibodies and increased frequencies of gamma interferon-producing CD 4 T cells severalfold. Thus, PLG microparticles are an effective means of delivering DNA vaccines in nonhuman primates, as demonstrated for two different types of DNA vaccines encoding two different antigens, and are compatible for use with DNA prime-protein boost regimens...|$|E
40|$|Nonviral {{delivery}} system receives attention {{over the last}} decade. Chitosan (CS) is a cationic polymer whereas saponin (SP) is classified as glycoside. In this study, a spherically-shaped CS-SP nanoparticle was synthesized and characterized. The ability of the nanoparticle to protect DNA from enzymatic degradation, its thermostability and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The particle size was found below 100 [*]nm as determined by Zetasizer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and field scanning electron microscopy (FSEM) results. The surface charge ranges from 43. 7 [*]mV to 38. 5 [*]mV before and after encapsulation with DNA plasmid, respectively. In terms of thermostability, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) revealed that CS-SP nanoparticle had a melting temperature of 110 °C, with rapid decomposition occurring at 120 °C. Encapsulation of DNA with the synthesized nanoparticle was evidenced by changes in the FTIR spectra including characteristic peaks at 3267. 39 and 1635. 58 [*]cm− 1, wavenumbers. Additional peak was also observed at 1169. 7 [*]cm− 1 following encapsulation. Electrophoretic mobility showed that CS-SP nanoparticle protected plasmid DNA from enzymatic degradation, while cell viability assays confirmed that the synthesized nanoparticle exhibited low cytotoxicity at different concentrations in avian cells. Taken together these, CS-SP nanoparticle showed potentials for applications as a <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The biodistribution, metabolism, {{cellular}} targeting, {{and gene}} {{expression of a}} nonviral peptide DNA gene delivery system was examined. 125 I-labeled plasmid DNA was condensed with low molecular weight peptide conjugates and dosed i. v. in mice to {{determine the influence of}} peptide DNA formulation parameters on specific gene targeting to hepatocytes. Optimal targeting to hepatocytes required the combined use of a triantennary glycopeptide (Tri-CWK 18) and a polyethylene glycol-peptide (PEG-CWK 18) to mediate specific recognition by the asialoglycoprotein receptor and to reduce nonspecific uptake by Kupffer cells. Tri-CWK 18 /PEG-CWK 18 DNA co-condensates were stabilized and protected from metabolism by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. An optimized formulation targeted 60 % of the dose to the liver with 80 % of the liver targeted DNA localized to hepatocytes. Glutaraldehyde crosslinking of DNA condensates reduced the liver elimination rate from a t ½ of 0. 8 to 3. 6 h. An optimized gene delivery formulation produced detectable levels of human Α 1 -antitrypsin in mouse serum which peaked at day 7 compared to no expression using control formulations. The results demonstrate the application of formulation optimization to improve the targeting selectivity and gene expression of a peptide <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association J Pharm Sci 89 : 499 – 512, 200...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of non-viral <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> using nanomaterials has attracted much research interest for its potential in biomedicine. However, for these new nanocarriers to be successfully used in therapeutic applications {{they have to}} overcome many barriers. Here, we report the development and characterisation of polyethyleneimine-modified tetramethylrhodamine-doped silica nanoparticles {{as a vehicle to}} deliver siRNA in the presence of serum. We have demonstrated that polyethyleneiminemodified tetramethylrhodamine-doped silica nanoparticles bind and protect siRNA against nuclease degradation and facilitate cellular uptake and intracellular delivery of the siRNA in HeLa-derived TZM-bl cells. The nanoparticles can penetrate TMZ-bl cells at concentrations as low as 1 3 ̆bcg/mL and can escape the lysosomal and endosomal cavities. Following delivery, the nanoparticles release active siRNA targeting the co-receptor CXCR 4 for HIV- 1 to achieve reduction in the targeted mRNA and protein expression. These nanoparticles are also non-toxic for the cells and are capable of carrying out all of these functions in the presence of serum, a characteristic that is critical if such nanoparticles are to be employed in any type of in vivo application.

40|$|Self-assembled <b>DNA</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> {{based on}} {{cationic}} lipids are simple {{to produce and}} weakly hazardous in comparison with viral vectors, but possess a significant toxicity at high doses. Phospholipids are in contrast intrinsically safe; yet their association with DNA is problematic because of unfavorable electrostatic interactions. We achieve the phospholipid-DNA complexation through the like-charge attraction induced by cations. Monovalent cations are inappropriate due to their poor binding affinity with lipids as inferred from electrophoretic mobility, whereas x-ray diffractions reveal that with multivalent cations, DNA is complexed within an inverted hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase. Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations confirm the self-assembly of a DNA rod wrapped into a lipid layer with cations in between acting as molecular glue. Transfection experiments performed with Ca 2 + and La 3 + demonstrate efficiencies surpassing those obtained with optimized cationic DOTAP-based systems, while preserving the viability of cells. Inspired by bacteriophages that resort to polycations to compact their genetic materials, complexes assembled with tetravalent spermine achieve unprecedented transfection efficiencies for phospholipids. Influence of complex growth time, lipid/DNA mass ratio, and ion concentration are examined. These complexes may initiate new developments for nontoxic gene delivery and fundamental studies of biological self-assembly...|$|R
