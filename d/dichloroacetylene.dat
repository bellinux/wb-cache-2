2500|$|When inhaled, {{trichloroethylene}} produces {{central nervous}} system depression resulting in general anesthesia. Its high blood solubility results in a less desirable slower induction of anesthesia. At low concentrations it is relatively non-irritating to the respiratory tract. [...] Higher concentrations result in tachypnea. [...] Many types of cardiac arrhythmias can occur and are exacerbated by epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbing systems (soda lime) to produce <b>dichloroacetylene</b> and phosgene. Cranial nerve dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO2 absorbing systems. [...] These nerve deficits could last for months. [...] Occasionally facial numbness was permanent. [...] Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor. [...] For these reasons as well as problems with hepatotoxicity, TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthestics such as halothane by the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{there is}} another method of {{producing}} <b>dichloroacetylene.</b> This method produces high-purity <b>dichloroacetylene</b> in gram amounts. This method involves the pyrolysis of dichloromaleic anhydride at a temperature of 850° Celsius. <b>Dichloroacetylene</b> produced via this method {{does not need to}} be separated from any solvents.|$|E
50|$|A {{mixture of}} <b>dichloroacetylene</b> with ether forms an {{azeotrope}}. This azeotrope has a boiling point of 32° Celsius. Additionally, when <b>dichloroacetylene</b> {{is mixed with}} ether, the likelihood of it exploding is reduced. One {{of the reasons for}} this is that the ether prevents oxygen in the atmosphere from reaching the <b>dichloroacetylene</b> and causing it to explode.|$|E
50|$|Studies on male {{rats and}} rabbits {{have shown that}} {{inhalation}} of <b>dichloroacetylene</b> can cause tubular necrosis, focal necrosis, and other nephrotoxic effects. Additionally, the rabbits that were given <b>dichloroacetylene</b> experienced hepatotoxic and neuropathological effects. Inhalation of <b>dichloroacetylene</b> also causes benign tumors of the livers and kidneys of rats. The chemical also caused increased incidences of lymphomas. It also causes weight loss in animals. 3.5% of a does of <b>dichloroacetylene</b> remains in the corpses of male Wistar rats. The LD50s of mice exposed to <b>dichloroacetylene</b> are 124 parts per million for a 1-hour exposure by inhalation and 19 parts per million for a 6-hour exposure by inhalation. The chemical is ingested primarily through glutathione-dependent systems. Glutathione also reacts with it. Hepatitic and renal glutathione S-transferases serve as catalysts to this reaction. While <b>dichloroacetylene</b> is nephrotoxic in rats, it does not show any signs of nephrotoxicity in humans.|$|E
50|$|The maximum safe {{concentration}} of <b>dichloroacetylene</b> in air is 0.1 parts per million. It is unsafe to store <b>dichloroacetylene</b> {{in close proximity to}} potassium, sodium, or aluminum powder.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the related}} {{fluorinated}} acetylenes, <b>dichloroacetylene</b> does not easily engage in thermal polymerization in either its gas phase or its condensed phase. Despite this, two patents {{have claimed that}} it is possible to polymerize <b>dichloroacetylene.</b> Using molybdenum pentachloride to polymerize <b>dichloroacetylene</b> has been investigated. It can be polymerized in certain circumstances, and its polymer is known as polydichloroacetylene. Polydichloroacetylene is white in color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> has {{mutagenic}} {{effects on}} Salmonella typhimurium.|$|E
50|$|Like trichloroethylene, <b>dichloroacetylene</b> is metabolized to DCVC in vivo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> has {{a melting}} point of -66° Celsius (-86.8° Fahrenheit). It explodes upon {{reaching}} its boiling point of 33° Celsius (91.4° Fahrenheit). The compound dissolves in ethanol, diethyl ether, and acetone. However, it is insoluble in water. <b>Dichloroacetylene</b> can explode when heated or upon contact with air. It also engages in vigorous reaction with {{materials that are}} oxidizers. It also engages in violent reactions with acids. <b>Dichloroacetylene</b> is an oil at standard temperature and pressure. The chemical has a density of 1.2 times that of water while in its liquid state and 3.3 times that of air while in its gaseous state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> is not {{produced}} commercially. However, a 1980 report claimed {{that it is}} produced as a by-product in the production process of vinylidene chloride. The compound is also possible to produce by pyrolysis of some types of chlorohydrocarbons. For instance, it can be formed from trichloroethylene. This primarily occurs {{in the presence of}} bases with pHs between 11 and 13. It is also possible to produce <b>dichloroacetylene</b> from trichloroethylene at low concentrations by running the trichloroethylene through nitrogen at 120° Celsius in the presence of dry potassium hydroxide. Despite the existing methods of production, there are no known commercial applications for <b>dichloroacetylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to the Department of Transportation, it is {{forbidden}} to ship <b>dichloroacetylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|While <b>dichloroacetylene</b> is an {{unstable}} chemical, its stability {{can be increased}} {{by the presence of}} large amounts of trichloroethylene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> {{can occur}} and be stable in air at {{concentrations}} {{of up to}} 200 parts per million if certain other compounds are also present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> can {{detonate}} {{if it is}} set on fire in {{an enclosed}} space. It can also burn {{in the presence of}} chlorine to produce phosgene.|$|E
50|$|Unsaturated {{fluorocarbons}} are {{far more}} reactive than fluoroalkanes. Although difluoroacetylene is unstable (as is typical for related alkynes, see <b>dichloroacetylene),</b> hexafluoro-2-butyne and related fluorinated alkynes are well known.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1930. It {{has been characterized}} by IR and mass spectrometry. However, there is no reported nuclear magnetic resonance data pertaining to it as of 1999.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> can be {{produced}} with 82% purity by the pyrolysis of difluoromaleic anhydride at a temperature of 950° Celsius. It is the haloacetylene produced in the highest amounts by this reaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> has a {{toxic effect}} on humans who {{are exposed to}} it. The most common effect that the {{compound}} has on humans {{is the development of}} neurological disorders. These disorders can persist for any amount of time between a number of days and a number of years. Exposure to the chemical can also cause a large range of other symptoms, including a headache, vomiting and nausea, jaw pain, cranial nerve palsy, appetite loss, and acute lung edema. Dichloroacetylene's level of carcinogenity in humans is not classifiable, although there are small amounts of evidence that suggest that the chemical is carcinogenic in animals.|$|E

40|$|Jeltes, R., Burghardt, E., and Breman, J. (1971). Brit. J. industr. Med., 28, 96 - 99. Gas chromatographic {{determination}} of phosgene and <b>dichloroacetylene</b> in air. Phosgene and <b>dichloroacetylene</b> vapours {{may be present}} in the working environment near places where chlorinated hydrocarbons are used, including exposure chambers and the like in which people or animals are deliberately exposed to chlorinated hydrocarbons to investigate the effects of these substances.

40|$|<b>Dichloroacetylene</b> (DCA) is a {{by-product}} of the synthesis of certain chlorinated, aliphatic hydrocarbons (e. g., vinylidene chloride). In a long-term cardnogenkity inhalation study, groups of 30 male and 30 female rats and mice were exposed to DCA vapour under the following conditions: mice, group I: 9 p. p. m. 6 h/day, 1 day/week for 12 months; group II: 2 p. p. m. 6 h/day, 1 day/week for 18 months; group ID: 2 p. p. m. 6 h/day, 2 days/week for 18 months; rats: 14 p. p. m. 6 h/day, 2 days/week for 18 months; controls: under identical conditions except for addition of DCA to breathing air. The most important result is a striking increase in the for-mation of kidney cystadenomas of the proximal tubuli in all DCA exposed animals. The median latency time of this tumor varied widely in both mice and rats. Renal cystic adenocarcinomas were found in statistically significant numbers in male mice. In addition to kidney tumors, the development of cystadenomas of the Harderian gland in mice and of liver cholangiomas in rats were highly significant find-ings. DCA failed to induce liver tumors in mice. Our results confirm that DCA possesses a high carcinogenic potential, pronounced organotropic properties and distinct species dif-ferences referring to the number {{and nature of the}} induced tumors. The risk associated with handling chlorinated ali-phatic hydrocarbons is essentially increased by the decom-position product DCA...|$|E
40|$|Several {{halogenated}} alkenes are nephrotoxic; {{some others}} induce renal tubular adenocarcinomas in rodents after lifelong administration. A bioactivation mechanism {{accounting for the}} organ-selective tumor induction has been elucidated: conjugation of the parent compounds with glutathione (GSH), catalyzed by hepatic GSH S-transferases, results {{in the formation of}} haloalkyl and halovinyl glutathione S-conjugates. Formation of S-conjugates (identified by NMR and mass spectrometry) could be demonstrated with trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, hexachlorobutadiene, perfluoropropene, trichlorotrifluoropropene, and <b>dichloroacetylene</b> in incubations with rat liver microsomes and in the isolated perfused rat liver. The GSH conjugates formed are eliminated from the rat liver with the bile and may be translocated to the kidney, intact or after metabolism to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates that are metabolized in the kidney by renal tubular cysteine conjugate 3 -lyase (P-lyase) to reactive intermediates, most likely thioacylchlorides and thioketenes. Interaction of these potent electrophiles with DNA [demonstrated for intermediates formed from S-(1, 2, 3, 4, 4 -pentachlorobutadienyl) -L-cysteine] causes mutagenicity in bacteria, genotoxicity in cultured renal cells, and cytotoxicity in kidney cells. As an alternative to 3 -lyase-catalyzed cleavage, the cysteine S-conjugates may be acetylated to the corresponding mercapturic acids, which have been identified in urine. The ability of the kidney to concentrate GSH and cysteine S-conjugates and the intensive metabolism of GSH S-conjugates to cysteine S-conjugates in this organ are evidently responsible for the organotropic carcinogenicity...|$|E
