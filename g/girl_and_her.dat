5|$|In March 1991, {{during a}} game in New Jersey, Barkley {{attempted}} to spit on a fan that had been heckling with racial slurs but the result was his spit hitting a little girl. Rod Thorn, the NBA's president of operations at the time, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and verbally abusing the fan. It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it. Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> family. He apologized and, among other things, provided them tickets to future games.|$|E
5|$|A Fresh Start is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film {{is the story of}} Jim, a chauffeur, who is fired from his job for drunkenness. Jim becomes a tramp, but decides to reform after a little girl orders her butler to give him food. He encounters her again at the zoo and notices that two men are following the <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> parents. Jim uncovers a plot to kidnap her and takes the place of their chauffeur. Jim then drives the kidnappers to the police station and secures a new position as the family's chauffeur. According to a trade review, the actual kidnapping scene and where Jim overpowers the villain's chauffeur is not actually depicted. The reviewer also stated the strength of the production is not in the plot, but in the staging and photography. The film was released on September 2, 1910, and it likely had a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest <b>girl,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E

25|$|The Berhane Hewan {{package of}} interventions, in rural Amhara from 2004 to 2006, {{demonstrated}} that girls' school attendance {{could be improved}} by increasing the age of marriage. Girls in school and those wanting to return were supported by being given school materials. Parents and their participating daughters had to sign a registration form. If the girl was unmarried, parents had to agree not to marry their daughter during the two-year program and, if this condition was met, the <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> family would receive a goat {{at the end of}} the program. The intervention increased school attendance and delayed marriage for girls aged 10 to 14 years compared with controls. The intervention made no difference to girls in the 15 to 19 year age group.|$|E

25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide conditional cash transfer and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as when she is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} 1930s, sun therapy became a popularly subscribed cure for almost every ailment from simple fatigue to tuberculosis. In the 1940s, {{advertisements}} started appearing in women’s magazines which encouraged sun bathing. At the same time, swimsuits' skin coverage began decreasing, with the bikini radically changing swimsuit style after {{it made its}} appearance in 1946. In the 1950s, many people used baby oil as a method to increase tanning. The first self-tanner came about in the same decade and was known as “Man-Tan,” although it often led to undesirable orange skin. Coppertone, in 1953, marketed its sunscreen with a drawing of a little blond <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> cocker spaniel tugging on her bathing suit bottoms revealing her bare bottom and tan line; this advertisement was modified {{around the turn of}} the 21st century and now shows a little girl wearing a one-piece bathing suit or shorts.

25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf <b>girl</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E

Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a <b>girl,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, {{in the hopes that}} the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, Camillo an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband.
