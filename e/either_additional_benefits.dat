40|$|AbstractThe Too-Much-of-a-Good-Thing Effect (TMGT) {{occurs when}} ordinarily {{beneficial}} antecedents/predictor variables reach inflection points after which {{their relations with}} desired outcomes/criterion variables cease to be linear and positive. It is undesirable to exceeding these inflection points because it leads <b>either</b> to no <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> or, to unwanted outcomes, like decreased organizational performance or high turnover. Recent research on demonstrating TMGT effect together with Goldilocks principle and nonlinear dynamics are putting organizational psychologists in a strange position, demonstrating that well known beneficial aspects of classical predictor variables used as a panacea in personnel management could bias organizational decisions. This article presents {{a case study of}} the curvilinear relationship between job performance and job satisfaction. This new nonlinear dynamic perspective questions previous meta-analysis findings on the monotonic relationship between job satisfaction and job performance in real work contexts. Methodological principles and inferences of actual research are discussed, together with offering suggestions for future development of nonlinear dynamics trend in organizational psychology...|$|R
5000|$|The {{objective}} of the International Joint Commission (IJC), {{with regard to the}} development of the Columbia River Basin, was to accomplish with the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) what would not have been possible through either British Columbia or the U.S. operating individually. [...] It was expected that <b>either</b> <b>additional</b> costs would have been avoided or <b>additional</b> <b>benefits</b> gained by the cooperation between BC/Canada and the US. However, many felt that such expectations were left unrealized by the effects of the actual treaty. Soon after the treaty came into effect, it became apparent that greater combined returns had not necessarily been achieved than had each country continued operating independently. [...] Others dispute that idea.|$|R

However, a recent systematic review indicates that there is modest evidence supporting the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of motor imagery compared to only conventional physiotherapy in patients with stroke. These authors concluded that motor imagery appears to be an attractive treatment opinion, easy to learn and to apply and the intervention is neither physically exhausting nor harmful. Therefore, motor imagery may generate <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> for patients.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-inferiority (NI) {{trials in}} drug {{research}} {{are used to}} demonstrate that a new treatment is not less effective than an active comparator. Since phase IV trials typically aim at informing a clinical decision, {{the value of a}} phase IV non-inferiority trial hinges also on its clinical relevance. In such trials, clinical relevance would refer to the added benefit claims of a specific drug, apart from efficacy, relative to its comparator drug in the trial. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed 41 phase IV trials and extracted information on whether the authors mentioned any <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> beyond the NI (efficacy) claim of the drug and whether the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> was proven in the trial. We checked whether the additional claim was based on descriptions only or on formal statistical analyses. RESULTS: Our results showed that 22 out of the 41 NI trials mentioned <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> of the test drug and most of these claims were related to the safety profile. Of all the post-authorization NI trials that claimed <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> 10 out of 22 NI trials used formal statistical analyses to show <b>additional</b> <b>benefit,</b> and only one included a sample size calculation for the <b>additional</b> <b>benefit</b> prior to the trial. CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is room for improvement in terms of designing phase IV NI trials with added benefit claims and in proving these additional claims...|$|R
