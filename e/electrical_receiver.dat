A 40 -Gbit/s, 300 -km, in-line transmission experiment and a dispersion-tolerant 40 -Gbit/s duobinary transmission experiment {{are described as}} 40 -Gbit/s single carrier system applications on dispersion-shifted fiber. An ultra-high-speed receiver configu-ration using a high-output-power photodiode is introduced to realize fully <b>electrical</b> <b>receiver</b> operation beyond 40 Gbit/s. The high-sensitivity operation of the optical receiver (27. 6 dBm @ BER = 10 9) is demonstrated at a data bit rate of 50 Gbit/s {{for the first time}} using a unitraveling carrier photodiode. A dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) system operating up to terabits per second can be easily realized on a zero-dispersion flattened transmission line using ultra-high-speed TDM channels of 40 Gbit/s and beyond.

At the beginning of the chapter, receiver key components (filters, delay line interferometer, optical hybrids) are discussed. Afterwards, receivers are detailed for three different detection schemes: direct detection, homodyne differential detection and homodyne synchronous detection. A complete analytical description of the optical and <b>electrical</b> <b>receiver</b> parts is thereby provided, starting with optical frontends and ending with electrical data recovery. Direct detection receivers are shown to be capable of detecting arbitrary modulation formats with differentially encoded phases such as DPSK and Star QAM formats. Subsequently, homodyne receivers with differential detection are presented and shown to be suitable for detecting the same signals as is possible with direct detection. Finally, homodyne synchronous detection which is appropriate for arbitrary high- order modulation formats is highlighted. A particular stress is laid on carrier synchronization, which was traditionally performed using an optical phase locked loop. Its current state is briefly reviewed. Digital phase estimation schemes are discussed in more detail, because digital coherent receivers gain more and more interest due to high-speed digital signal processing newly available...|$|E

Information on {{porous material}} properties {{provided by the}} type I coseismic electric field accompanying surface and body waves {{is limited to the}} vicinity of the <b>electrical</b> <b>receivers,</b> as opposed to the type II electromagnetic interface response (IR) which can help detect porous contrasts and/or fluid changes within the subsurface 'at depth'. For general field geometries, the problem is that type II disturbances exhibit lower amplitudes than type I fields and are difficult to access directly. Hence, separating both types of waves is a critical step when processing seismoelectric data. Synthetic seismograms and electrograms, generated with a full-waveform seismoelectric forward modelling code written by Garambois & Dietrich, enabled us to study the behaviour of the IR's characteristic dipolar amplitude pattern recovered through filtering. The definitive version is available at www. blackwell-synergy. com To better preserve the IR amplitudes, we have developed a new filtering strategy based on the Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform. Seismic or seismoelectric wave fronts can be optimall described using this multiscale decomposition over multidirectional anisotropic needle-shape structures. We have built a mask in the curvelet domain zeroing out seismoelectric samples corresponding to non-zero samples from the accelerogram, thus taking advantage of the relationship between seismic and seismoelectric waves for type I fields. This mask consists of a threshold function combined with a Gaussian distribution promoting horizontal (i. e. zero- slowness) directions. When applied to synthetic data, this filter enabled to successfully extract the IR although less altering its dipolar radiation pattern than the conventional dip-based techniques.
