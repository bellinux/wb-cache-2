5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid <b>double-heading</b> of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell in 1914 to provide a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability. Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types, the Nclass {{was the first step}} in the SECR's fleet standardisation programme, which also included the Kclass 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive. Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft, who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent. This arrangement allowed for a longer wheelbase with leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on tight track curves, which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR. A longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0, giving the Nclass sufficient power to avoid <b>double-heading</b> of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Class GA Garratt in proving the {{suitability}} of the Garratt design for South African conditions coupled with the economies in crew, fuel and water consumption it offered, provided an incentive for the SAR to consider a new Garratt class for use on the Natal mainline. The aim was to eliminate <b>double-heading</b> as a regular practice with such a locomotive to be equivalent to three of the Class 1E electric locomotives which were then in use, or two Class 14 steam locomotives.|$|E

25|$|By 1923, the A2 class 4-6-0 locomotives, which dated back to 1907, were {{frequently}} <b>double-heading</b> on interstate expresses to Serviceton and Albury as increasing traffic saw loads exceed the eight car maximum {{of a single}} A2 on these services. The Victorian Railways Commissioners recommended considerably more powerful locomotives to haul trains of up to eleven cars unassisted over the ruling gradients on these lines. The S class 4-6-2 Pacifics displaced the A2s from North East line express services from 1928 onwards and allowed a faster timetable to be introduced. However a Pacific-type locomotive was not particularly well suited to the Western line. The section between Melbourne and Ballarat had sharply curved, steep inclines, the most notorious {{of which was the}} , 1 in 48 (2.08&) ruling gradient of the Ingliston Bank. As early as 1923 VR locomotive designers were considering 4-8-2 Mountain-type locomotives for this purpose, along {{with the use of a}} third cylinder to allow increased power to be achieved without breaching the loading gauge.|$|E

500|$|Three factors {{dictated}} {{the type of}} locomotive that could operate on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR): the heavy passenger train loadings; the poor track quality; and the weak, lightly built bridges. On {{the lines of the}} former London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) – inherited by the SECR in 1899 – beach pebbles had been used for ballast instead of conventional ballast, which has irregular shapes that lock together to keep the track in place. These economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could operate safely over the track. The SECR was therefore unable to follow a coherent strategy {{to reduce the number of}} locomotive types inherited from the two constituent railways. Despite increased passenger and freight traffic between [...] and the Kentish coast during the first decades of the 20th century, the Operating Department had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives, which could operate within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} input-driven deterministic and nondeterministic <b>double-head</b> pushdown automata. A <b>double-head</b> pushdown automaton {{is a slight}} generalization of an ordinary pushdown automaton working with two input heads that move in opposite directions on the common input tape. In every step one head is moved and the automaton decides on acceptance if the heads meet. Demanding the automaton to work input-driven it is required that every input symbol uniquely defines the action on the pushdown store (push, pop, state change). Normally this is modeled by a partition of the input alphabet and is called a signature. Since our automaton model works with two heads either both heads respect the same signature or each head owes its own signature. This results in two variants of input-driven <b>double-head</b> pushdown automata. The induced language families on input-driven <b>double-head</b> pushdown automata are studied {{from the perspectives of}} their language describing capability, their closure properties, and decision problems.

40|$|Purpose. The study aims {{to compare}} the {{long-term}} outcome of conjunctival autograft (CAU) and mitomycin C (MMC) in <b>double-head</b> pterygium surgery. Methods. This is a follow-up study of a comparative interventional trial. Thirty-nine eyes of the 36 patients with <b>double-head</b> pterygium excision in the original study 12 years ago were recruited for clinical assessment. Seven out of the 36 patients were lost. In the original study, each eye with <b>double-head</b> pterygium was randomized to have pterygium excision with CAU on one “head” (temporal or nasal) and MMC on the other “head. ” All patients were invited for clinical assessment for conjunctival bed status {{and the presence of}} pterygium recurrence in the current study.

500|$|Three factors {{dictated}} {{the type of}} locomotive that could run on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR): increased freight and passenger train loadings, poor track quality, and weak, lightly built bridges. An increasing number of passengers used the SECR to reach the cross-Channel ferries at Dover and Folkestone between 1910 and 1913, and heavy goods trains between Tonbridge and Hither Green marshalling yard stretched the capabilities of existing locomotives and infrastructure. On {{the lines of the}} former London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), flint beach pebbles on a bed of ash had been used for ballast. Conventional track ballast has irregular shapes that [...] "lock" [...] together to keep the track in place, whereas the smooth pebbles used by the LCDR failed to prevent track movement under strain. The economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low axle loadings could run safely on the track. These restrictions meant that the SECR was unable to follow a coherent locomotive strategy that reduced costs and increased serviceability. The railway's Operating Department had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 locomotives because they could run within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} a modified technique of vertically split-conjunctival autograft (CAG) for primary <b>double-head</b> pterygium and evaluate its postoperative outcome. Methods: In this retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series, 87 eyes of 87 patients of <b>double-head</b> pterygium from June 2009 to June 2015 were included. They underwent vertical split CAG. A limbus-limbus orientation was not strictly maintained. Primary outcome measure was recurrence rate. Other outcome measures studied were graft retraction, Tenon's granuloma, dellen, and so on. Results: Mean age was 54. 54 ± 11. 51 years; M:F was 41 : 46. Mean follow-up was 17. 28 ± 10. 28 months. The only significant complication was recurrence rate of 3. 45 % (3 eyes out of 87). Other most common secondary outcome was graft edema, 42. 52 % (37 eyes out of 87) which resolved without any intervention. Other outcomes such as graft retraction (31. 03 %), dellen (1. 15 %), Tenon's granuloma (3. 45 %), and subconjunctival hemorrhage (36. 78 %) were recorded.
