In 1977, Reppert published Donahue's theory in two articles, which appeared on Sunday, May 1, and the following Sunday, with the second article accompanied by an editorial. These two men were keen to collaborate on a book on the subject, but this was cut short by Reppert's ill health and subsequent death. Donahue later also approached author John Davis in the hope that a book would still be written.

I sent them around to Profound Lore and the band members and the Japanese label... sooo??? Also since there are 3 labels involved in putting out the record (SIGE, Profound Lore, Daymare) maybe that's fucking things up? I'll ask Lore's Chris Bruni if he can straighten that out.

It was another opportunity to be creative and invoke thought. We thought the title [...] "Every Six Seconds" [...] said a lot about the world today and where our society is pretty much sitting. I <b>got</b> it from <b>a</b> <b>news</b> documentary I was watching that was talking about robbery and car theft and murder and other subjects. It finally got around to sex of course and they said that men think about sex every six seconds. I thought that was really interesting and it kind of stuck in my mind. I think it says it all for me and for the record. It's dealing with everything from the healing condition to anger and love and sex and spiritually and the disillusionment with society. I think the title is befitting.|$|R

40|$|In {{a variety}} of settings, some payoff-relevant item spreads along a network of {{connected}} individuals. In some cases, the item will benefit those who receive it (for example, a music download, <b>a</b> stock <b>tip,</b> <b>news</b> about <b>a</b> new research funding source, etc.) while in other cases the impact may be negative (for example, viruses, both biological and electronic, financial contagion, and so on). Often, good and bad items may propagate along the same networks, so individuals must weigh {{the costs and benefits}} of being more or less connected to the network. The situation becomes more complicated (and more interesting) if individuals can also put effort into security, where security can be thought of as a screening technology that allows an individual to keep getting the benefits of network connectivity while blocking out the bad items. Drawing on the network literatures in economics, epidemiology, and applied math, we formulate a model of network security that can be used to study individual incentives to expand and secure networks and characterize properties of a symmetric equilibrium. ...|$|R
