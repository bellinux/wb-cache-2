5|$|Some {{versions}} may use mayonnaise, {{other types}} of cheese, such as pepper jack cheese, brie cheese or Cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese as primary ingredients. Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), <b>heavy</b> <b>cream</b> and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan cheese is combined with the bread crumbs. Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E

25|$|Milk {{has been}} also {{recommended}} as a storage medium for avulsed teeth. Its advantage {{is the high}} availability of fresh whole milk. Only whole milk {{can be used for}} tooth preservation. Skim milk and <b>heavy</b> <b>cream</b> do not have the correct fluid pressure and will cause damage to the root cells. Milk has no observed regenerative properties for cells on knocked out teeth.|$|E
25|$|Crème fraîche is {{produced}} by adding a starter culture to <b>heavy</b> <b>cream,</b> and allowing it to stand at appropriate temperature until thick. The culture {{is made up of}} a mix of bacteria including Lactococcus species L. cremoris, L. lactis, and L. lactis biovar diacetylactis. This is what gives it the taste that distinguishes it from similar dairy products like sour cream. Procedures for cooks making crème fraîche at home may substitute cultured buttermilk with active cultures for the starter culture.|$|E
25|$|Seafood is {{the most}} {{important}} part of Khuzestani cuisine, but many other dishes are also featured. The most popular Khuzestani dish is Ghalyeh Mahi, a fish dish that is prepared with heavy spices, onions and cilantro. The fish used in the dish is locally known as mahi soboor (shad fish), a species of fish found in the Persian Gulf. Other provincial specialties include Ghalyeh Meygu ("shrimp casserole"), ashe-mohshala (a Khorramshahri breakfast stew), sær shir (a Dezfuli breakfast of <b>heavy</b> <b>cream),</b> hælim (a Shushtari breakfast of wheatmeal with shredded lamb), and kohbbeh (a deep-fried rice cake with ground beef filling and other spices of Arabic origin, a variant on Levantine kibbeh).

25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, <b>heavy</b> <b>cream,</b> cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E
2500|$|A {{combination}} bolus/multiwave bolus is {{the combination}} of a standard bolus spike with an extended bolus square wave. [...] This shape provides a large dose of insulin up front, and then also extends the tail of the insulin action. [...] The combination bolus is appropriate for high carb high fat meals such as pizza, pasta with <b>heavy</b> <b>cream</b> sauce, and chocolate cake.|$|E
2500|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the most basic element {{considered}} is [...] "weight"-the balance between {{the weight of the}} food (a heavy, red sauce pasta versus a more delicate salad) and the weight or [...] "body" [...] of the wine (a heavy Cabernet Sauvignon versus a more delicate Pinot grigio). In wine tasting, body is determined primarily by the alcohol level of the wine and can be influenced by the perceptions of tannins (from the grape skins or oak) and extract (the dissolved solids in the wine derived from winemaking processes like extended maceration and sur lie aging). An oaked Chardonnay from a warm wine region, such as Australia will be [...] "heavier" [...] in body than a stainless steel fermented Chardonnay from a cooler wine region such as Chablis. Pairing heavy wines with light dishes or vice versa, can result in one partner overwhelming the other. The [...] "weight" [...] of a food can also be described in terms of the intensity of its flavors-such as delicate and more subtle flavors versus dishes that have more robust and hearty flavors. A key to pairing upon this principle is to identify the dominant flavor of the dish. Sauces can be the dominant flavor instead of the meat or main component. While poached fish is usually light bodied and better served with a light white, if the fish is served with a <b>heavy</b> <b>cream</b> sauce it could be better balanced with a fuller bodied white wine or light red.|$|E
