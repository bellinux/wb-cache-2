5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the {{annoying}} bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be <b>excellently</b> placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave {{a boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked <b>excellently</b> before the war became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the trams were too wide.|$|E
25|$|The Englishmen {{had all the}} {{advantage}} of weight, their average being about two stones heavier than the Scotchmen and they had also {{the advantage}} in pace. The strong point of the home club was that they played <b>excellently</b> well together.|$|E
25|$|WAEC awarded seven {{students}} that performed <b>excellently</b> in their 2004 SSCE. According to the report, the award was in two categories: distinction and excellence category, and the amounts ranged from $250–$550 alongside certificates of honor. This {{aspect of the}} project is meant to bring in competitions among students, in other to improve education.|$|E
25|$|Görgey was {{satisfied}} with {{the result of the}} battle, writing after the battle: The spirit of our troops is <b>excellently</b> good. The victory enthuses and keeps alive all the defenders of the homeland, who endure and suffer all the vicissitudes and hardships of the war, and look with high spirits to the events of the future.|$|E
25|$|Graft {{was unable}} to force his {{way back into the}} Australian one day side the {{following}} summer. He had his best first class bowling returns to date against WA, taking 4–53 and 5–95. and played <b>excellently</b> in the McDonalds Cup semi final against WA, scoring 29 and taking 4–15. The majority of the rest of his performances were disappointing, however.|$|E
25|$|Essentially {{it was a}} {{match of}} two halves. England {{dominance}} for three days, exploiting helpful conditions and a poor South African bowling effort. South Africa responded <b>excellently</b> on the final two days, to ensure they only lost three wickets during two days of play. It was felt {{at the time that}} South Africa would have gained the most out of the drawn fixture.|$|E
25|$|He {{commanded}} the Gorodok column on 9–10 August 1919, with great gallantry and skill, and {{owing to the}} success of this column the forces on the right bank of the Dvina were able to capture all its objectives. During the enemy counter-attack from Selmenga on Gorodok he handled his men <b>excellently.</b> The enemy were repulsed with great loss, leaving 400 prisoners in our hands.|$|E
25|$|Australia's bowlers {{performed}} <b>excellently</b> in {{the fourth}} test, dismissing England for 152 (Hogg 2–36). When Australia scored 294 in response they had an excellent chance of winning the game. However England made 346 in response (Hogg 4–67) and Australia collapsed for 111. Hogg was then rested for a Shield game {{out of fear of}} injury. He returned to make made his one-day international debut against England, taking 1–20 in an Australian defeat.|$|E
25|$|Australia's Super 8's {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{an excellent}} start as they defeated Bangladesh comfortably in Cape Town. After winning the toss, Australian captain Ricky Ponting elected to field first. Australia bowled <b>excellently,</b> tying down the Bangladeshi batsmen, and only allowing them to score at 6 an over. Brett Lee took the first international Twenty20 hat-trick during this innings and finished with figures of 3/27. Bangladesh's innings never gained momentum and Australia restricted them to 123 off 20 overs.|$|E
25|$|Lilly was {{fortunate}} in receiving a classical {{education at the}} Grammar school of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, under John Brinsley, {{one of the finest}} teachers of his time. Brinsley was strict in discipline but advocated encouragement and praise, and by the time Lilly left the school in 1619, he was <b>excellently</b> educated and excelled at Latin. This was to serve him well in his later astrological studies, since almost all astrological textbooks were written in Latin at that time.|$|E
25|$|Science {{became aware}} of the {{existence}} of ichthyosaurs during the early nineteenth century, when the first complete skeletons were found in England. In 1834, the order Ichthyosauria was named. Later that century, many <b>excellently</b> preserved ichthyosaur fossils were discovered in Germany, including soft-tissue remains. Since the late twentieth century, there has been a revived interest in the group, leading to an increased number of named ichthyosaurs from all continents, with over fifty valid genera being now known.|$|E
25|$|Steyn went to England in 2005 to {{play for}} Essex, {{appearing}} in seven matches between May and June. He failed {{to make a big}} impact in his initial outing in County Championship cricket, taking 14 wickets at 59.85. Following his work at Essex with world expert bowling coach Ian Pont Steyn returned to domestic cricket in South Africa, where he bowled <b>excellently</b> for the Titans through the 2005/2006 season which earned him a recall to the Test squad to face New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Vainio {{succeeded in}} his {{preparation}} for his home championships <b>excellently.</b> The 10,000 metres final {{was held on}} the third day of the Championships. Despite the slow race which culminated in the last lap, Vainio finished fourth with the time 28:01.37, missing the gold medal by only 0.33 seconds and bronze by 0.11 seconds. The home audience was very impressed with his achievement, since they knew very well that he was not at his best in the slow races. The gold medal was won again by Alberto Cova.|$|E
25|$|During 1930 in Manchester, Lindrum set {{a record}} {{aggregate}} of 30,817 during the fortnight match against Willie Smith. In this match he made 10 breaks over 1,000 with a highest of 2,419. In his final match of the tour against Smith in London, Lindrum's performance set numerous records: the highest individual aggregate (36,256), the largest winning margin (21,285), a record match average (262), and {{a record number of}} four-figure breaks (11). Smith, although beaten, had played <b>excellently</b> with an average of 109 per innings for the match.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{from the}} Allegheny Mountains region began with Jamestown, Virginia. In the 1999 Interim Report, the Massawomeck offered gifts of bows and arrows, deer and bear flesh, fish, clubs, and bear skins to John Smith during his Chesapeake Bay {{exploration}} in 1608. Next, the Susquesahanock {{came down and}} presented venison, tobacco pipes, baskets, targets, bows and arrows. A large cashe of small and very well made dark flint Levanna, and small <b>excellently</b> proportioned Madison arrow points appear to be from some of these trade or gifts at the Jamestown archaeological site.|$|E
25|$|They {{finished}} the season 2–10 (2–6 in the Big 12 Conference) {{and had some}} major disappointments. Mason Crosby did not perform as well as last season (19 for 27) and the Hawkins era didn't start as many had expected with his success at Boise State. The offense appeared to struggle to learn the new system and early quarterback uncertainty did not allow the team to have consistency. The defense performed <b>excellently</b> at times and was good overall, but without the offense producing points, Colorado would lose, though many games were close.|$|E
25|$|Teams from RI {{performed}} well nationally in 2011, with {{the performing arts}} groups clinching 15 Golds (including 9 with Honours) and 5 Silvers at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging and the sports teams winning 32 championship titles as well as 24 Silvers and 11 Bronzes at the National Interschools Sports Championships. The school's Clubs and Societies have also performed <b>excellently</b> in their various national competitions, with Raffles Debaters clinching championship titles and the History and Strategic Affairs Society clinching best school delegation awards at international Model United Nations conferences.|$|E
25|$|In the West Indies tour of India in 1948–49, Modi {{performed}} <b>excellently,</b> scoring 560 in five Tests with {{a hundred}} and five fifties. The 112 he scored against the West Indies in the Brabourne Stadium was his only test century, and it came in his fifth test, {{and in the second}} match of the series. Modi was consistent throughout the whole series, scoring excess of 90 thrice in a match. His 112 in Bombay saw him forge an important partnership with Vijay Hazare, the most important of them being 139, when India chased 361 in the final Test. He was involved in four century stands with Hazare in the whole series.|$|E
25|$|The Laas Geel cave {{paintings}} {{are thought to}} be some of the most vivid rock art in Africa. Among other things, they depict cattle in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans, who are believed to have been inhabitants of the region. The necks of the cattle are embellished with a kind of plastron. Some of the cattle are also portrayed wearing decorative robes. Besides long-horned cattle, the rock art also shows an image of a domesticated dog, several paintings of canidae as well as a giraffe. The site is <b>excellently</b> preserved due to the location of the paintings which are covered by the granite overhangs.|$|E
25|$|In this, {{the seminal}} Cambrinus short story, Cambrinus is an {{apprentice}} glassblower in the Flemish village of Fresnes-sur-Escaut, {{but he believes}} that he lacks the skill and upward mobility to succeed in glassblowing. He becomes smitten with the master glassblower's daughter, Flandrine. After she rebuffs him, he apprentices himself instead to a viol master, and learns the instrument. His first public performance goes <b>excellently</b> until he catches sight of Flandrine, and flubs his performance. The crowd turns on him violently, but when the case goes to trial the judge, Jocko, is against Cambrinus. When Cambrinus is released he considers suicide, but Beelzebub intervenes {{in exchange for the}} promise of his soul. Beelzebub announces, too, that he has killed the judge.|$|E
25|$|While it was <b>excellently</b> {{adapted to}} {{swimming}} and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an earless seal, Baptorniss lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} sites for beetle fossils of the Miocene are {{situated in the}} warm temperate and to subtropical zones. Many recent genera and species already existed during the Miocene, however, their distribution differed considerably from today's. One of the {{most important}} fossil sites for insects of the Pliocene is Willershausen near Göttingen, Germany with <b>excellently</b> preserved beetle fossils of various families (longhorn beetles, weevils, ladybugs and others) as well as representatives of other orders of insects. In the Willershausen clay pit so far 35 genera from 18 beetle families have been recorded, of which six genera are extinct. The Pleistocene beetle fauna is relatively well known, who used the composition of the beetle fauna to reconstruct climate conditions in the Rocky Mountains and on Beringia, the former land bridge between Asia and North America.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton Rowan's {{reputation}} for radicalism and bluster grew {{during this time}} when he left Ireland to confront the Lord Advocate of Scotland about negative comments made in respect to his character and that {{of members of the}} Society of United Irishmen. As a prominent member of the Irish gentry, Hamilton Rowan was an important figure in the United Irishmen and became the contact for the Scottish radical societies {{as a result of his}} visit. Upon his return to Dublin, he was charged and was found guilty of seditious libel, even though he was <b>excellently</b> defended by the famous John Philpot Curran. Hamilton Rowan was sentenced to two years imprisonment, received a fine of £500, and was forced to pay two assurities for good behaviour of £1,000 each. In January 1794 Hamilton Rowan retired to his apartments in Dublin's Newgate Prison.|$|E
25|$|England {{had failed}} to {{capitalise}} on their breakthrough, and the Boon-Taylor partnership soon resumed the pace and tempo of the previous Taylor-Marsh one. They batted throughout the morning and Australia soon went past 400, with still only one wicket down. The England fielders looked tired and dejected. Mark Taylor soon brought up his personal 200, becoming the first Australian to score a double century in England since 1970. However, not long after, an exhausted looking Taylor tried to dance down the wicket once too often attempting to hit Cook down the ground, and was out <b>excellently</b> stumped by Russell for 219. His innings lasted just over 9 hours, during which he faced 461 balls and struck 23 fours. His dismissal saw Australia at 430 for 2, with the partnership of Boon and Taylor worth 101. It would remain Taylor's highest test score until he made an astonishing 334* during the 1998-99 Australia v Pakistan series.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} Jupiter Fighter was {{evaluated}} at Martlesham Heath and found wanting, being lost on 23 November 1923 when the engine seized at high altitude, {{the second was}} sent to Sweden for evaluation, where it coped <b>excellently</b> with the extreme cold of the Swedish winter, with the Jupiter, using normal fuels and winter motor oil, operating without trouble in temperatures which normally caused engine oil to freeze in hours. The second Type 76 was therefore purchased by the Swedish Air Force, who operated it from May 1924 until 1935, when it was sold to a private buyer, finally being written off in 1936. The final Type 76 {{was used as a}} testbed for a high compression version of the Jupiter intended for use at high altitudes, which was fitted with a bi-fuel system to allow use of alcohol at low altitudes, then switching to normal petrol once the aircraft had reached sufficient altitude to prevent premature detonation (Engine knocking). This system was rejected in favour of supercharging.|$|E
25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning that {{every type of}} thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, <b>excellently</b> and completely in accordance with reason.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} affairs of the abbey {{seem to have been}} largely quiet. It was generally well run over its history and maintained a good reputation for the life led by its canons. As with other Premonstratensian houses, Titchfield Abbey was visited once a year by the father-abbot from the parent house (in this case Halesowen Abbey); or instead, in certain years, by a commission of the General Chapter of Prémontré, the headquarters of the Premonstratensian Order. The abbey remained tolerably solvent for most of its existence, however, in common with many religious houses and secular lords it experienced severe financial difficulties {{in the latter half of}} the 14th century and the early 15th century due to the economic and social crisis resulting from the effects of the Black Death. The scale of the disaster can be judged by the fact that on the Titchfield estates in the plague years of 1348-1349 close to 60% of the tenants died, together with a vast number of animals, and when the plague returned in 1361-1362 the agricultural population took another massive hit. When John Poole, abbot of the mother house of Halesowen Abbey inspected Titchfield in summer 1420 he found the coffers empty, the abbey's accounts deeply in the red and the barns and storehouses nearly empty of food and fodder. Despite this, in the following years the canons managed to retrieve the situation and in the last years of its existence Titchfield was again prosperous. Inspections by senior abbots of the order from 1478 to 1502 noted that Titchfield was <b>excellently</b> managed, discipline was good and the finances were in order.|$|E
500|$|Barbour and Phillips warmly welcome Thayer's work on countershading [...] "which {{he has so}} <b>excellently</b> demonstrated"; they [...] "protest gently" [...] {{against his}} [...] "slightly patronizing" [...] {{treatment}} of the camouflage of birds like woodcock and grouse [...] "which has been known and recognized since ornithology began"; {{and go on to}} the attack on his claims for the flamingo: ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{during and}} after its {{original}} transmission on BBC Two, the serial was generally praised by the critics. Reviewing the first episode in The Observer newspaper, Ian Bell wrote: [...] "Flannery's script is faultless; funny, chilling, evocative, spare, linguistically precise. The four young friends about to share 31 hellish years {{in the life of}} modern Britain are <b>excellently</b> played." ...|$|E
500|$|Similarly, Opus Dei {{stresses}} the importance of work and professional competence. While some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from the material world, Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to [...] "find God in daily life" [...] and to perform their work <b>excellently</b> as a service to society and as a fitting offering to God. Opus Dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is [...] "a path to holiness", and its founder advised people to: [...] "Sanctify your work. Sanctify yourself in your work. Sanctify others through your work." ...|$|E
500|$|Consistently {{one of the}} {{greatest}} critiques of the novel concerns its 1970s plot-line. For example, Gorra found that the addition of a [...] parallel narrative [...] " [...] into problems"—especially concerning Elizabeth Benson, whom he [...] "stopped believing in [...] character". Unlike other reviewers, the critic Sarah Belo did not question the historical investigation plot, but the depiction of Elizabeth's experience as a 1970s woman in England. On the other hand, almost all of the reviewers describe the novel's war sections as <b>excellently</b> written; for example, the review in the Los Angeles Times called the sections [...] "so powerful as to be almost unbearable".|$|E
500|$|Gisa {{was born}} in Lorraine, {{probably}} the village of St Trond in modern Belgium, and was {{among a number of}} foreign churchmen brought to England by King Edward the Confessor. At first he held the position of king's chaplain, but in January 1060 or possibly January 1061 he was elected to become Bishop of Wells. Pope Nicholas II consecrated him on 15 April 1061 in Rome. He went to Rome for consecration because the current Archbishop of Canterbury was Stigand, whom successive popes had excommunicated for various irregularities, and traveled in company with another bishop—Walter of Lorraine, the Bishop of Hereford-elect—and Tostig Godwinson. The Vita Edwardi says that he was [...] "most suitably and <b>excellently</b> trained".|$|E
500|$|Ars Conjectandi is {{considered}} a landmark work in combinatorics and the founding work of mathematical probability. Among others, an anthology of great mathematical writings published by Elsevier and edited by historian Ivor Grattan-Guinness describes the studies {{set out in the}} work [...] " [...] mathematicians throughout 18th and 19th centuries"—an influence lasting three centuries. Statistician Anthony Edwards praised not only the book's groundbreaking content, writing that it demonstrated Bernoulli's [...] "thorough familiarity with the many facets ," [...] but its form: [...] " [...] is a very well-written book, <b>excellently</b> constructed." [...] Perhaps most recently, notable popular mathematical historian and topologist William Dunham called the paper [...] "the next milestone of probability theory [...] " [...] as well as [...] "Jakob Bernoulli's masterpiece". It greatly aided what Dunham describes as [...] "Bernoulli's long-established reputation".|$|E
500|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa late on August 20, and almost immediately developed convective banding and a broad circulation. A broad area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day while located 260mi (420km) southeast of the Cape Verde islands. Though convection decreased early on August 21, the area of low pressure remained well-organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Four late on August 21. Water temperatures remained warm enough for development, while upper level shear was minimal as the depression moved west-northwestward due to a ridge of high pressure to its north. Initial predictions by the National Hurricane Center also forecast a motion to the northwest based on consistent model predictions, though, as quoted by forecaster James Franklin, [...] "The models have also been <b>excellently</b> wrong thus far".|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} of Type-0 {{have so far}} received positive reception from video game critics in both local and import reviews. One of the reviewers for Famitsu magazine said that {{the large number of}} characters made the game [...] "a very different [...]" [...] RPG Site's Erren Van Duine was very impressed, saying that certain character interactions were [...] "handled <b>excellently</b> and you really get a sense of specific character motivations because of it." [...] He also praised the sympathetic portrayal of Cid Aulstyne, and stated that the game had [...] "so many great moments, [...] have to experience each little detail for [...] Heath Hindman, writing for PlayStation Lifestyle, called the characters [...] "pretty strong overall", although she cited some scenes where various characters' inclusion felt like a necessity rather than a useful element to be a fault.|$|E
