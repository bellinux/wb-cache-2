25|$|In September 2006 it was {{announced}} that instead of Eden Park, the Government and Auckland City Council were assessing the possibility of a new stadium on Auckland's waterfront to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

The Government had said it would assist with the funding if a new stadium was built. The Government announced in a report in November 2006 that it would favour a new stadium on the Auckland waterfront, which would have meant that the Eden Park redevelopment would not have gone ahead, and that options for its use or redevelopment would have to be developed. After the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council differed in their support for the new stadium, the Government changed to supporting the redevelopment of Eden Park, subject to suitable resolution of the design, funding and governance issues.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{developments}} in the human rights <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> concept. In doing so, it highlights the challenges of developing and applying human rights <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>processes</b> in mineral supply chains in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the broader Great Lakes region. The eastern DRC has valuable industrial minerals such as tantalite, cassiterite and tungsten, {{all of which are}} critical components in the electronics industry. Since 1996 this part of the DRC has seen violent conflict that has claimed more than 5 million lives and {{is considered one of the}} world’s worst humanitarian crises. This civil war has been variously explained as a manifestation of the resource curse or rebel greed, profiteering from the minerals trade. The demand for these ‘conflict minerals’ remains strong and the minerals trade continues to provide both an incentive and a means for belligerents to maintain their operations. In the DRC, about 90 % of minerals are mined using artisanal methods, and minerals are often traded informally. In this context, applying human rights <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> through establishing traceability has been promoted as a means to ensure responsible sourcing of raw materials and curb the trade in conflict minerals. Moreover, it has become a legal requirement through the conflict minerals provision of the 2010 US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Given the complex supply chains of these minerals and the weak governance capacity in the DRC, a number of initiatives adopt multistakeholder processes to develop and implement human rights <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> This analysis is based on a review of six such frameworks, and concludes that the narrow focus on traceability is unlikely to prevent minerals from being used to finance belligerents. The paper argues that this limitation largely stems from the reductionist approach of the resource curse theories, which could have an adverse impact on local communities. Instead, including key local stakeholders in developing and implementing human rights <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>processes</b> could lead to the sustainable management of mineral resources...|$|R
