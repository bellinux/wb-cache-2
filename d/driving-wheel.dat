500|$|The {{mechanical}} clockworks for Su Song's astronomical tower {{featured a}} great <b>driving-wheel</b> that was 11 feet in diameter, carrying 36 scoops, {{into each of}} which water poured at a uniform rate from the [...] "constant-level tank" [...] (Needham, Fig. 653). The main driving shaft of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, ended in a pinion which engaged a gear wheel {{at the lower end}} of the main vertical transmission shaft.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{would you}} like to be hot-potted there?" [...] says Experience, who has read and who is {{enthusiastic}} over She, as he points to the great furnaces whence the slag is being dragged out by hooks. [...] "Here is the old material going into the furnace in that big iron bucket. Look at the scraps of iron. There's an old D. and O. sleeper, there's a lot of clips from a cylinder, there's a lot of snipped-up rails, there's a <b>driving-wheel</b> block, there's an old hook, and a sprinkling of boiler-plates and rivets." ...|$|E
60|$|Many traces {{we found}} {{of him in}} the bog-girt island where he had hid his savage ally. A huge <b>driving-wheel</b> and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the {{position}} of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>driving-wheels</b> {{revolved}} {{at first}} with such tremendous rapidity that {{they failed to}} [...] "bite" [...] and merely slipped on the rails. Thomson was engineer enough to understand why, and at once cut off part of the steam. Next moment he {{shot out of the}} station, and, again letting on full steam, rushed along the line like an arrow! ...|$|R
6000|$|The next {{place she}} was ushered into {{was a vast}} {{apartment}} where iron in every shape, size, and form was being planed and turned and cut. The ceiling of the building, or rather the place where a ceiling ought in ordinary circumstances to have been, was alive with moving bands and whirling wheels. The first thing she was called on to contemplate was the turning of the tyre or rim {{of one of the}} <b>driving-wheels</b> of a locomotive. Often had Mrs Marrot heard her husband talk of tyres and <b>driving-wheels,</b> and many a time had she seen these wheels whirling, half-concealed, in their appropriate places, but never till that day had she seen the iron hoop, eight feet in diameter, elevated in bare simplicity on a turning-lathe, where its size impressed her so much that she declared, [...] "she never could 'ave imagined engine-wheels was so big," [...] and asked, [...] "'ow did they ever manage to get 'em lifted up to w'ere they was?" ...|$|R
50|$|Manning, Wardle & Co. of the Boyne Engine Works, Leeds {{designed}} and built a special locomotive for its operation. It had to meet military {{as well as other}} requirements. The general plan {{of the structure of the}} locomotive has been designed by J.B. Fell, but the working plans were prepared and the engine built by Manning, Wardle & Co, Leeds. The engine weighed 4½ tons, and the tender 3½ tons, with coal and water. There were three pairs of <b>driving-wheels</b> coupled, each 16 in in diameter. There were also four horizontal wheels running upon guide rails fixed on the lower edges of the beams.|$|R
6000|$|... "That seems all right," [...] I said, {{and began}} very gingerly to raise myself from my chair. I felt {{perfectly}} well, very light and comfortable, and quite confident in my mind. I was going fast all over. My heart, for example, was beating {{a thousand times}} a second, but that caused me no discomfort at all. I looked out of the window. An immovable cyclist, head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his <b>driving-wheel,</b> scorched to overtake a galloping char-a-banc that did not stir. I gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle. [...] "Gibberne," [...] I cried, [...] "how long will this confounded stuff last?" ...|$|E
60|$|What {{he looked}} he felt. He {{was in the}} {{agricultural}} world, but not of it. He served fire and smoke; these denizens of the fields served vegetation, weather, frost, and sun. He travelled with his engine from farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam threshing-machine was itinerant {{in this part of}} Wessex. He spoke in a strange northern accent; his thoughts being turned inwards upon himself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes around him, and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly necessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his Plutonic master. The long strap which ran from the <b>driving-wheel</b> of his engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie-line between agriculture and him.|$|E
6000|$|... "One short hour sufficed {{to prove}} the utter uselessness of our efforts. The storm barricaded the track with a dozen drifts while we dug one away. And worse than this, it was {{discovered}} that the last grand charge the engine had made upon the enemy had broken the fore-and-aft shaft of the <b>driving-wheel!</b> With a free track before us we should still have been helpless. We entered the car wearied with labor, and very sorrowful. We gathered about the stoves, and gravely canvassed our situation. We had no provisions whatever--in this lay our chief distress. We could not freeze, for there was a good supply of wood in the tender. This was our only comfort. The discussion ended at last in accepting the disheartening decision of the conductor, viz., that it would be death for any man to attempt to travel fifty miles on foot through snow like that. We could not send for help, and even if we could it would not come. We must submit, and await, as patiently as we might, succor or starvation! I think the stoutest heart there felt a momentary chill when those words were uttered.|$|E
5000|$|My {{invention}} {{relates to}} certain improvements in vehicles; and {{it consists of}} an engine and suitable intermediate gearing whereby the vehicle may be propelled…This invention is designed to apply a gasoline or other vapor engine to an ordinary carriage or road vehicle, with frictional mechanism for transmitting power, changing {{the speed of the}} forward movement of the vehicle and reversing the motion of the vehicle at will.The vehicle mounted upon independent driving and steering wheels, independent gears by which each of the <b>driving-wheels</b> is propelled, a divided counter-shaft having a frictional drum and a differential gear, where by the wheels may be driven independently at different speeds, in combination with an engine, an engine-shaft provided with a corresponding friction drum, and a movable frame supporting an intermediate friction-drum between the drums upon the counter-shaft; and the engine-shaft, and a lever, whereby said intermediate drum may be turned into or out of contact with the others, substantially as described.|$|R
6000|$|The {{difference}} between the first locomotive and those now in use is very great--as may be seen any day in London, by any one who chooses to visit one of our great railway stations, and go thence to the Kensington Museum, where the [...] "Rocket" [...] is now enshrined--a memorial of Stephenson's wisdom, and {{of the beginning of}} our magnificent railway system. Yet though the difference be great it is wonderful how complete the [...] "Rocket" [...] was, all things considered. The modern improvements made on locomotives consist chiefly in clothing the boiler with wood, felt, and other non-conductors to increase the life-giving heat; in heating the feed-water, coupling the <b>driving-wheels,</b> working the cylinders horizontally, economising steam by cutting off the supply at any part of the stroke that may be required, and economising fuel by using raw coal instead of coke, and consuming the smoke, besides many other minor contrivances, but all the great principles affecting the locomotive were applied by George Stephenson, and illustrated in the [...] "Rocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{locomotive}} is, next to {{a marine}} engine, the most sensitive thing man ever made; and No. [...] .007, besides being sensitive, was new. The red paint was hardly dry on his spotless bumper-bar, his headlight shone like a fireman's helmet, and his cab {{might have been a}} hard-wood-finish parlour. They had run him into the round-house after his trial--he had said good-bye to his best friend in the shops, the overhead travelling-crane--the big world was just outside; and the other locos were taking stock of him. He looked at the semicircle of bold, unwinking headlights, heard the low purr and mutter of the steam mounting in the gauges--scornful hisses of contempt as a slack valve lifted a little--and would have given a month's oil for leave to crawl through his own <b>driving-wheels</b> into the brick ash-pit beneath him. [...] .007 was an eight-wheeled [...] "American" [...] loco, slightly different from others of his type, and as he stood he was worth ten thousand dollars on the Company's books. But if you had bought him at his own valuation, after half an hour's waiting in the darkish, echoing round-house, you would have saved exactly nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-eight cents.|$|R
6000|$|The bucket is tipped {{into the}} furnace with a thunderous roar and the slag below pours forth more quickly. [...] "An engine," [...] says Experience, reflectively, [...] "can run over herself so to say. After she's broken up she is made into {{sleepers}} for the line. You'll see how she's broken up later." [...] A few paces further on, semi-nude demons are capering over strips of glowing hot iron which {{are put into}} a mill as rails and emerge as thin, shapely tie-bars. The natives wear rough sandals and some pretence of aprons, but {{the greater part of}} them is [...] "all face." [...] "As I said before," [...] says Experience, [...] "a native's cuteness when he's working on ticket is something startling. Beyond occasionally hanging on to a red-hot bar too long and so letting their pincers be drawn through the mills, these men take precious good care not to go wrong. Our machinery is fenced and guard-railed as much as possible, and these men don't get caught up by the belting. In the first place, they're careful--the father warns the son and so on--and in the second, there's nothing about 'em for the belting to catch on unless the man shoves his hand in. Oh, a native's no fool! He knows that it doesn't do to be foolish when he's dealing with a crane or a <b>driving-wheel.</b> You're looking at all those chopped rails? We make our iron as they blend baccy. We mix up all sorts to get the required quality. Those rails have just been chopped by this tobacco-cutter thing." [...] Experience bends down and sets a vicious-looking, parrot-headed beam to work. There is a quiver--a snap--and a dull smash and a heavy rail is nipped in two like a stick of barley-sugar.|$|E

Stat. 1901, p. 3174), 2, prohibiting common {{carriers}} from using any car in moving interstate commerce not equipped with automatic couplers, although locomotives were, elsewhere in the statute, in terms required to be equipped with power <b>driving-wheel</b> brakes.|$|E

60|$|If it were {{possible}} we would have the noises of that shed always about the reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment. It was {{a steady stream of}} din, from which the ear picked out first one thread and then another; there was the intermittent snorting, panting, and seething of the steam engines, the suck and thud of their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great <b>driving-wheels</b> came round, a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from the dynamos; and over all, sometimes inaudible, as the ear tired of it, and then creeping back upon the senses again, was this trombone note of the big machine. The floor never felt steady and quiet beneath one's feet, but quivered and jarred. It was a confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send anyone's thoughts jerking into odd zigzags. And for three months, while the big strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a blackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the stir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{developers}} of multi-wheeled vehicles (MWV) show {{growing interest in}} electromechanical drive in the «motor-axis» implementation. However, in designing the traction electric drive (TED) based on such approach the problems arise, primarily, {{from a lack of}} creating experience and of ready algorithmic solutions to control the traction motors. The use of methods to implement the individual TED is impossible {{because of the presence of}} cross-axle differential in the leading axle drive, which does not allow the input torque control of each wheel singly. The paper offers a law to control a traction electric drive of MWV leading axles that comprises the law to control the tractive effort torque and braking moment on the leading axles as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction control systems. An analysis of simulation modeling results shows an efficiency of the developed law that allows control of the traction electric drive of MWV leading axles. The control law includes an algorithm to control the tractive effort torque and braking moment on the <b>driving-wheels,</b> as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction systems. At stationary (constant speed rotation) and non-stationary (elk test) maneuvering there was no spin of vehicle wheels. Angular speeds of the wheels vary smoothly. Partial loss of vehicle stability when making maneuvers on ice may be reduced through development of algorithms for dynamic stabilization, which will improve the MWV road-holding and trajectory ability. Fullscale tests of MWV with traction electric drive implemented using a “motor-axis" approach are required to have a final answer on the performance and effectiveness of the developed control law. </p...|$|R
60|$|John Marrot's engine, {{of which}} we have said much, and {{of which we}} mean to say still more, {{was not only a}} stupendous, but a complex creation. Its body {{consisted}} of above 5,400 pieces, all of which were almost as delicately fashioned, and put together with as much care, as watch-work. It was a confirmed teetotaller, too. The morning draught which John had given it before starting, to enable it to run its seventy-seven miles, was 800 gallons of cold water. He also gave it a good feed to begin with, and laid in for its sustenance on the trip one ton of coals. Its power to act vigorously may be gathered from the fact that one morning, some years before, John had got the fire up with unwonted rapidity, and no sooner had the minimum of steam necessary to move it been created, than it quietly advanced and passed out of its shed through a brick wall fourteen inches thick with as much ease as it would have gone through a sheet of brown paper. This being its power when starting at what we may regard as a quiet walk, some conception may be formed of its capacity when flying down an incline at sixty-five miles an hour with a heavy train of carriages at its back. In such circumstances it would go through an ordinary house, train and all, as a rifle-bullet would go through a cheese. It was an eight-wheeled engine, and the <b>driving-wheels</b> were eight feet in diameter. The cylinder was eighteen inches, with a piston of two feet stroke, and the total weight of engine and tender was fifty-three tons. The cost of this iron horse with its tender was about 3000 pounds.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} act was entitled, An Act to Promote the Safety of Employees and Travelers upon Railroads by Compelling Common Carriers Engaged in Interstate Commerce to Equip Their Cars with Automatic Couplers and Continuous Brakes and Their Locomotives with <b>Driving-wheel</b> Brakes, and for Other Purposes. Its first section makes it unlawful, among other things, for a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce to run any train {{without having a}} sufficient number of the cars so equipped with train brakes (such as air brakes) that the engineer on the locomotive can control the speed of the train without requiring brakemen to use a hand brake for that purpose.|$|E
5000|$|The Oban {{line had}} {{numerous}} short but steep gradients along with tight curves and lightly constructed bridges, {{and was therefore}} a challenging route to operate. McIntosh therefore designed a small 4-6-0 which was essentially an elongated hybrid of his 812 Class 0-6-0 and Dunalastair series 4-4-0 types. [...] The class featured a particularly short <b>driving-wheel</b> wheelbase {{to cope with the}} curvature of the line, and short tenders to enable the locomotives to fit onto the existing small turntable at Oban shed. The subsequent 918 Class was very similar to the 55 Class, but had a larger boiler and tender for express goods services on the mainline.|$|E
5000|$|... (Su Song's) clockwork, {{driven by}} a water-wheel, and fully {{enclosed}} within the tower, rotated an observational armillary sphere on the top platform and a celestial globe in the upper story. Its time-announcing function was further fulfilled visually and audibly by the performances of numerous jacks mounted on the eight superimposed wheels of a time-keeping shaft and appearing at windows in the pagoda-like structure {{at the front of}} the tower. Within the building, some 40 ft. high, the <b>driving-wheel</b> was provided with a special form of escapement, and the water was pumped back into the tanks periodically by manual means. The time-annunciator must have included conversion gearing, since it gave 'unequal' as well as equal time signals, and the sphere probably had this. Su Song's treatise on the clock, the Hsin I Hsiang Fa Yao, constitutes a classic of horological engineering.|$|E
50|$|Zhang Sixun, {{although}} innovative, {{built upon}} {{the efforts of}} those before him. It was Han dynasty scientist and engineer Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) who invented the first hydraulic-powered (i.e. with waterwheel and clepsydra) armillary sphere. In addition, it was the Tang dynasty era Buddhist monk and engineer Yi Xing (683-727 AD) who invented the first hydraulic-powered armillary sphere that incorporated the escapement mechanism. Yet Zhang Sixun applied some innovative ideas of his own in order for his hydraulic-powered armillary sphere to function. His astronomical armillary sphere and clock was much {{like that of the}} later statesman Su Song (1020-1101 AD), incorporating the scoop-bearing <b>driving-wheel</b> and gearing, together with 19 clock jacks to report and sound the hours. His device also employed the use of liquid mercury in the closed circuit of the clepsydra and waterwheel instead of water, because water would freeze easily during winter, while mercury could assure smooth and continual function and time-keeping during the cold season. Later Ming dynasty clocks had the same concern in mind when they employed the use of falling sand grains to push the wheel drive. The later Su Song wrote that after Zhang's death, no one could replicate what he had achieved, much like with Su Song himself and his astronomical clock tower after his own death.|$|E

Model is designed universally for any measures {{three or four}} wheeled carriage. The next conditions are: back wheels are <b>driving-wheel,</b> front wheels change angle of Robot turning. Position of the front wheel gives the actual position of the robot. Position of the robot is described by coordinates x, y and by angle of the front wheel α in reference position. Main reason for model implementation is indoor navigation. We need some estimation of robot position especially after turning of the Robot. Next use is for outdoor navigation especially for precising GPS information...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} some of the sociological {{implications}} of a major cultural high-water point in the African American experience, the New Negro/Harlem Renaissance. The paper concentrates on the cultural transformations brought about through the intellectual activity of political activists, a multi-genre group of artists, cultural brokers, and businesspersons. The <b>driving-wheel</b> thrust of this era was the reclamation and the invigoration of the traditions of the culture with an emphasis on both the, African and the American aspects, which significantly impacted American and international culture then and throughout the 20 th century. This study examines the pre- 1920 s background, the forms of Black activism during the Renaissance, the modern content of the writers 2 ̆ 7 work, and the enthusiasm of whites for the African American art forms of the era.
