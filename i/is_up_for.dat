25|$|While {{his role}} as a pre-Dadaist <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> debate, Urmuz is thought by many to have been a {{considerable}} influence on a Romanian founder of Dada, Tristan Tzara.

Late in 1924, Contimporanul teamed up with Ciprian, who gave a public reading from Urmuz during the Contimporanul International Art Exhibit.|$|E
