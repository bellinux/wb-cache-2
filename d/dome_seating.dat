Much of this weight was concentrated in the glass dome, which meant new framing techniques to support the second level above the first. The result was an -long dome level which could seat 68, nearly three times that of the Vista Dome. The lounge area beneath seated 28 in booths.|$|E

Tilted domes tend to create a favoured 'sweet spot' for optimum viewing, centrally {{about a third of}} the way up the dome from the lowest point. Tilted <b>domes</b> generally have <b>seating</b> arranged 'stadium-style' in straight, tiered rows; horizontal <b>domes</b> usually have <b>seats</b> in circular rows, arranged in concentric (facing center) or epicentric (facing front) arrays.|$|R
