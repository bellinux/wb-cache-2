40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} models for making removable partial dentures. Methods: In this Study, 140 models were analysed in 05 dental prosthesis laboratories {{in the city of}} Teresina, Piauí, Brazil, registered with the Conselho Regional de Odontologia. A form containing 14 closed questions was applied, and the data collected were submitted to statistical analysis using the SPSS program. The models were analysed under natural or artificial light and photographed for record and illustration purposes. Results: The results showed that in 100 % of the cases the molding material used was alginate, and 93. 43 % of the models were poured by the dentist. Of these, 64. 47 % were poured in stone plaster and 36. 43 % in special plaster. According to criteria such as surface quality, reproduction of details, presence of bubbles and/or nodules, adequate reproduction of the edentulous area, 78. 57 % of the models were considered inadequate. The majority of the models (96. 43 %), were mounted in an articulator by the <b>Dental</b> <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Technician,</b> but only 1 dentist sent the record for mounting the models. The hinge type articulator was used in 97. 14 % of the mountings.

40|$|In {{the working}} {{environment}} we face lots of danger factors. A danger factor of local muscular load {{is still a}} big problem. At the work of <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> an enormous one-sided loading of upper extremities occurs, consequently vocational diseases may occur as well. It depends on the individual perception of load at each of us and on our working capacity. The absence of well-being resulting from the influence of danger factors on our organism leads {{to a number of}} various health problems, inadequate workload, fatique, and unpleasant feelings. Non- respecting the ergonomic requirements may also have negative impact on the health of workers. It may prove e. g. by an increasing number of work injuries, by problems with disorders of muscular and skeletal system, by overloading of muscular groups as a logical consequence of one-sided, long-term and excessive muscular load. In its theoretical part my bachelor´s work supported by literature available summarizes basic information on the problems of local muscular load. It focuses first of all on the characteristics of individual danger factors, on the basic pieces of knowledge of anatomy of upper limb, it describes physical load, some vocational diseases and also basic ergonomic requirements. The practical part is aimed at setting up a hypothesis concerning health danger resulting from local muscular load of upper extremities at <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians,</b> evaluation of health danger of this factor of working conditions for classifying the work. For meeting the target of research three hypotheses were determined. The method of qualitative research was chosen { [...] } especially the secondary analysis od data.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dental {{technicians}} {{are potentially}} exposed to various occupational dusts and chemicals. Not surprisingly, occupational related lung diseases {{have been documented}} in this population. METHODS: We describe {{the case of a}} <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> presenting progressive exertional dyspnea and cough. We used lung function tests, computed tomography, histological examination, mineralogical and immunological studies to characterize his condition. RESULTS: Lung function studies disclosed a restrictive pattern with a low diffusion capacity. A high-resolution CT scan revealed the presence of micronodules in both lungs corresponding to non-caseating foreign body granulomas at histological examination. Mineralogic studies showed the presence of silica, silicates, and aluminum. The lymphocytic transformation test was positive with the bronchoalveolar lavage for beryllium. CONCLUSIONS: This dental technician developed pulmonary granulomatosis. Combined histological, mineralogical, and immunological studies led us to consider the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis most likely related to occupational exposure to beryllium and aluminum...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{record of}} path of {{insertion}} on the dental cast {{is part of}} the dentist′s work authorization to the <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician.</b> The path of insertion record enables the dental technician to replace the cast on a surveyor in the same position that the dentist selected. Analysis of factors that influence the path of insertion should determine a path of insertion that will reduce the potential for dislodgement and promote stability of removable partial denture (RPD). Materials and Methods: The recording of the relation of a cast to a dental surveyor and the transfer of this relationship to the dental laboratory may be done by tripodization, by scoring the base of the cast, or by cementing a reference pin on the cast. Conclusion: Recording the established path of insertion can be difficult when the procedure uses a cemented pin and the casts are mounted in an articulator. This article describes a procedure for innovative dowel pin and sleeve device to record the path of insertion of RPDs, which serves the same purpose as the cemented pin but can be easily removed and replaced...|$|E
40|$|After {{a case of}} {{advanced}} pneumoconiosis occurred in a <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician,</b> 31 other dental technicians and 30 control subjects controlled for smoking habits, sex, and age were investigated. More technicians (55 %) than controls (30 %) had at least grade 1 dyspnoea (p greater than 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis showed that 13 technicians who had produced dental prostheses for at least 15 years had consistently lower lung function (FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC, MEF 50, and DCO single breath), although the differences were not statistically significant. All mean lung function values for technicians and controls were within normal limits. Increases in MEF 50 after breathing 80 % helium and 20 % O 2 failed to show small airways dysfunction among the technicians. Of the six with radiological pneumoconiosis (5 simple, 1 advanced) four had symptoms. All three biopsy specimens showed varying degrees of pulmonary fibrosis.

40|$|During dental procedures, dentists {{and their}} assistants, dental {{laboratory}} technicians and their assistants may {{be exposed to}} a wide variety of microorganisms in the blood, saliva, and oral cavity of the patients. These microorganisms may cause various air-borne and blood borne infections. The efficient infection control procedures in the dental office and the dental laboratory are not sufficiently used, mainly because these procedures cause inconveniences in dental practice. If pathogenic microorgan-isms on dental impressions and interim prostheses making devices are not decontaminated, direct trans-mission of infection can occur from patient to dentist, <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> or vice versa.

40|$|Objective: This {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} to assess dentist's opinion regarding the occurrence and pattern of food impaction {{in relation to}} fixed partial denture (FPD) prostheses, its commonly observed consequences, factors contributing to it, and its management. Methods: A descriptive survey was conducted on a sample size of 150 dental practitioners. The pro forma consisted of informed consent, demographic information, and questionnaire. The results were tallied and quantitative analysis was performed to obtain the descriptive statistics for the data using SPSS version 20. Results and Interpretation: All the study respondents had come across patients who complained of food impaction in relation to FPD. The most common consequences of food impaction were proximal caries of the adjacent teeth and interdental bone loss. Majority of the dentists considered faulty FPD design with improper contact relation, improper crown contour, poor margin adaptation, and faulty pontic design as the most likely reason for food impaction. Repeating the FPD with emphasis on prescribing and reinforcing the use of proper interdental aids was considered as the ideal treatment option. It was also observed {{that about half of}} the dentists always communicated inadequate information of the FPD prostheses that needed replacement to the <b>dental</b> <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> for the successive bridge. Most of the times, prosthodontists were consulted to rectify the problem of food impaction resulting from faulty FPD prostheses. However, it is obvious that it is easier and more prudent to prevent rather than treat food impaction. This study gives an overview of some of the common errors in designing the FPD prostheses which often lead to food impaction and measures to be taken to overcome them. Conclusion: It may be concluded as all the dentists participating in the survey agreed that food impaction is one of the common complaint among FPD Patients. Proximal caries and interdental bone loss were the prevalent outcomes of food impaction. Faulty FPD design was allegedly attributed as the reason for food impaction. Prosthodontists were routinely consulted to resolve the dilemma of food impaction. However, it is rational to prevent food impaction rather than to tackle the sequel later...|$|E

Standardized digital images of randomly selected dental casts were obtained and the image calibration and registration were attended to enable comparison of shape of the dental arches. A collective teeth positions from the digital images were proposed as a novel shape feature of the dental arch. Each tooth position is established from origin defined from stable anatomical landmarks. The mean shape category obtained from clustering method and the probability distribution of each shape category was further investigated to provide better statistical inference for the shape models of the dental arch. A modified COVRATIO statistics which incorporates the problem of small sample size and minimal model assumptions was then proposed as a discrimination method of shape and compared to the linear discrimination method. The proposed shape discrimination method was then used to determine suitable arch shape and indicate natural teeth positions. The {{results from this study}} show that multivariate normal and multivariate complex normal shape models together {{with the use of the}} proposed discrimination method can be used to discriminate shape of the dental arch. Consequently guides to determining suitable impression trays and predicting teeth positions for the edentulous patients (patients with all teeth missing) are provided.

In this study, respiration complaints, pneumoconiosis frequencies and working conditions of the dental technicians in Denizli were investigated. METHODS: All of the registered DLTs working in Denizli {{were included in the}} study. A 30 -item questionnaire was used to gather data about the participants and their working environments. Then, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were carried out and standard chest X-rays were taken in order to detect how much the respiratory systems of the workers were affected. Standard chest X-rays were evaluated according to International Labour Organizations classification. Depending on the screening results, technicians who were found to have had pathologies and suspected cases were examined. "High-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) " was taken from those who were found to have pathology in their chest X-rays and they were evaluated according to the classification of Hering et al. RESULTS: There are a total of 166 DLTs working in Denizli Province participated in the study. One hundred and forty-three (86. 1 %) of the participants were male, and 23 of them were female. The mean age of the participants is 33. 5 ± 8. 1. Average working time of the workers is 16 years. Total exposure time was calculated 36, 177 h. Approximately, 56 % of workers were smokers. When the working conditions were considered, it was found that 98. 8 % of laboratories had a ventilation system. Technicians′ use of personal protective equipment is low. Participants′ often or continuous use of masks, gloves, goggles, and vacuum device was found 69 %, 36 %, 47 %, and 63 % respectively while working. About 21. 2 % of the technicians have respiratory symptoms while 15. 2 % of them have eye complaints. At the analysis of PFT results, 27. 7 % restrictive type pulmonary disorder was determined. At the analysis of chest X-rays; 1 / 0 profusion sub-category was 25. 5 %, and the large opacity rate was 16. 9 %. Ten pneumoconiosis cases (6 %) were diagnosed after the analysis of the HRCT results. The ratio of pneumoconiosis was found much higher among male technicians, particularly those who have been working {{for a long time in}} the profession and those working at the town hospitals and Department of metal leveling. DISCUSSION: Technicians′ use of personal protective tools is not enough and ratio of smoking is rather high. Pneumoconiosis cases clearly show this exposure. It is necessary to adopt comprehensive work health and safety precautions considering the determined risk factors...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A common {{procedure}} in esthetic dentistry is fabrication of metal-ceramic veneer crowns that have proper color match with the patient’s teeth. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare color reproduction of the selected color by dental practitioners in <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> by <b>technicians</b> with and without academic education. Materials and methods: In this in vitro study a maxillary incisor from a dental model was prepared for a metal-ceramic veneer crown. After impression taking and making a standard framework, 36 impressions were taken for 36 laboratories and two standard metal frameworks were fabricated on each die. Two frameworks were sent to each laboratory. A 3 porcelain was requested to be placed on the standard frameworks and glazed. Each specimen was tested with Shadepilot equipment. a*, b* and L* color indexes and DE were determined at incisal, middle and cervical areas of each crown. T-test and linear regression were used for data analysis (α= 0. 05). Results: Means and standard deviations of DE of samples in the group without academic education at incisal, middle, and cervical areas were 3. 56 ± 1. 93, 2. 54 ± 2. 40, and in 3. 0 ± 1. 16, respectively; corresponding values in the group with academic education were 5. 6 ± 3. 19, 2. 11 ± 1. 02, and 21. 18 ± 0. 72, respectively. T-test showed significant differences in DE of incisal areas between the two groups (P= 0. 003), with no significant differences in other areas. Conclusion: In this study, there was a significant relationship between job experience and color match accuracy in the incisal region, indicating that technicians with more job, but with no academic education, exhibit more accuracy in reconstructing incisal edge color of metal-ceramic veneer crowns.

40|$|Abstract: In {{polishing}} {{process of}} dental prostheses using contaminated Pumice may resulted a harmful cycle of cross-contamination involving dentists, <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians,</b> patients and auxiliary personnel. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the presence and level of microbial contaminants in pumice powder and pumice slurry used in <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Yazd, Iran. Ten samples of pumice powder and slurry were randomly collected from 10 randomly selected <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> of Yazd, cultured on selective fungal and bacterial media in order to quantitatively analyze the total colony-forming units (CFU) and also determine the genus or species of the agents in the samples. Fungi were recovered both from the pumice powder (mean = 1050 cfu gG) and 1 pumice slurry (mean = 6350 CFU gG) and a wide range of bacteria was present in the pumice powder 1 (mean = 450 cfu gG) and pumice slurry (mean = 18700 CFU gG). Statistical paired samples t-test showed a 1 1 statistically significant difference between bacterial contamination of pumice slurry and pumice powder (p = 0. 015), but the difference in the fungal contamination was not significant (p = 0. 315). Pumice, especially in the form of slurry, which is used for polishing of dental prostheses is a potential source of bacterial and fungal contamination in <b>dental</b> <b>laboratories</b> and therefore improved techniques are required for disinfecting and controlling possible microbial infections...|$|R
