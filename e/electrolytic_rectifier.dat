His M.Sc. thesis was entitled Electrical characteristics and theory of operation of a dry <b>electrolytic</b> <b>rectifier</b> (1926). In his doctoral studies he worked on analog computers with Vannevar Bush, developing the Differential Analyzer. His Sc.D., advised by Bush, was entitled The Extension and Application of Differential Analyzer Technique in the Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (1933). He then joined {{the faculty of the}} electrical engineering department. During World War II he was on the National Defense Research Committee.After the war, he led the MIT Center of Analysis, where he reluctantly gave way to digital computing by initiating the Rockefeller Electronic Computer (RED) and supporting the Project Whirlwind. [...] The centre closed around 1950, after which Caldwell continued as a faculty member, being the advisor to both David A. Huffman (1953) and Edward J. McCluskey (1956).|$|E
