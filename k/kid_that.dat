25|$|In 1940, Russell {{was signed}} to a seven-year {{contract}} by film mogul Howard Hughes, {{and made her}} motion-picture debut in The Outlaw (1943), a story about Billy the <b>Kid</b> <b>that</b> {{went to great lengths}} to showcase her voluptuous figure. The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed. When the movie was finally passed, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, she was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of The Outlaw, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Jane's 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E

He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London).

500|$|A {{parody of}} the song {{performed}} by Bieber caused controversy after a video of it was released by the entertainment news website TMZ on June 4, 2014.

[...] One amusing moment (...) materialized on April 24 while playing the Dodgers in Los Angeles and Martínez starting. [...] With one out in the third inning, Walker caught a Mike Piazza fly ball and innocently handed it to a young fan, six year-old Sebastian Napier, thinking it was the third out of the inning. [...] He then quickly noticed that José Offerman, already on base, was running at full speed. [...] Walker managed to retrieve the ball from Napier and held Offerman to third base. [...] Embarrassed, Walker admitted that he “told the little <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> maybe next time I’ll give him a ball when there are three outs instead of two. Everybody around him was laughing.” [...] Where Offerman was stationed made little difference as Tim Wallach homered on the next pitch from Martínez for two runs.

Ryan slowly finds himself a place within his new materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university. Casting director Patrick Rush found the role of Ryan Atwood particularly hard to cast and only invited Benjamin McKenzie to an audition after Fox had made them aware of the young actor after his unsuccessful audition for a UPN sitcom. Rush said, [...] "When Benjamin [...] came in, he wasn't physically what Josh had envisioned, but he inhabited the character unlike anyone we had seen. I think that the character of Ryan is a <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> always seems a little lost and has a sense of mystery and danger; Benjamin has all those qualities."

2500|$|By 1918, Lloyd and Roach {{had begun}} to develop his {{character}} beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his [...] "Glass" [...] character (often named [...] "Harold" [...] in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The [...] "Glass" [...] character {{is said to have}} been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque [...] "Lonesome Luke". [...] "When I adopted the glasses," [...] he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, [...] "it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable." [...] Unlike most silent comedy personae, [...] "Harold" [...] was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the character's debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidd's Kids.|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 1879, after {{previous}} {{efforts to}} restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings. One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty, Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as Billy the Kid. On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with the Kid, who had witnessed {{the murder of a}} Lincoln County lawyer named Chapman. Wallace wanted the Kid to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but the Kid had killed others and wanted Wallace's protection from the outlaw gang and amnesty for his crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for the Kid to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the <b>Kid</b> <b>that</b> he would be [...] "scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds." [...] On March 20, the Kid agreed to testify against others involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for the Kid's arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety. After the Kid testified in court on April 14, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free. The Kid escaped from jail and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. The Kid was shot and killed on July 14, 1881 by Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.|$|E
