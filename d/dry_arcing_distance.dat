The electrical performance of RTV silicone rubber insulator coatings under accelerated aging in a salt-fog chamber for artificial testing has been investigated. Experimental and theoretical {{studies were carried out}} on RTV silicone rubber coatings to study the loss and recovery of hydrophobicity. The effect of the experimental conditions and the contaminants deposited during <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing</b> was studied with respect to the performance of RTV coatings. Five cleaning methods to remove the contaminants from the coated surface were examined using leakage current and contact angle measurements as indicators of their comparative effectiveness. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) was used to determine the composition of the elements of the scale near the surface and in the bulk of the RTV coating. The ability of RTV coatings to suppress leakage current in the presence of contamination thereby preventing power outages was extensively studied. The temporary loss of hydrophobicity and its recovery was studied in depth. The gradual loss of hydrophobicity as determined from the leakage current and the contact angle measurements is shown {{to be related to the}} physical and chemical changes to the coating brought about by <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing.</b> The suppression of leakage current by RTV silicone rubber coatings on porcelain suspension and post insulators was studied in a salt-fog chamber. To investigate the phenomenon of the loss and the recovery of hydrophobicity, the surface was subjected to various wetting conditions. Measurements of the contact and the sliding angles were used to determine the state of the surface. The surface free energies due to London dispersion (γ SD) and hydrogen bonding (γ SH) forces on the surface of RTV coatings were calculated from the contact angle measurements using both water and methylene iodide. Good agreement was obtained with the literature values for a virgin RTV surface. In order to study the chemical changes due to <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing</b> on the surface of RTV coatings, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) was employed. A study of the diffusion of silicone fluid using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is carried out. The results of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and ESCA measurements are discussed from which a suppression mechanism of leakage current is suggested. The chemical derivative analysis is also carried out to elucidate the chemical changes on the surface of RTV coating. Several mechanisms are suggested with regard to the formation of water film, the suppression of leakage current on RTV coatings, development of <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing,</b> the temporary loss and recovery of hydrophobicity, heat transfer in the presence of <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing,</b> and chemical reactions and changes at the surface due to <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing.</b> A theoretical model to elucidate the mechanisms is presented.

40|$|Insulator becomes wet {{partially}} or completely, and {{the pollution}} layer on it becomes conductive, when collecting pollutants {{for an extended}} period during dew, light rain, mist, fog or snow melting. Heavy rain is a complicated factor that it may wash away the pollution layer without initiating other stages of breakdown or it may bridge the gaps between sheds to promote flashover. The insulator with a conducting pollution layer being energized, can cause a surface leakage current to flow (also temperature-rise). As the surface conductivity is non-uniform, the conducting pollution layer becomes broken by dry bands (at spots of high current density), interrupting the flow of leakage current.

40|$|Abstract: Silicone rubber when {{contaminated}} by dust {{has the ability}} to transfer the hydrophobicity through pollutants. Water on the polluted silicone rubber forms separate droplets. It is a unique advantage of this material. However, the pollution layer on silicone rubber absorbs moisture at high air humidity similar to the pollutants on the glass surface. Under high humidity conditions the surface conductivity on heavy polluted (ESDD and DDD in the range of 0, 1 mg/cm 2) silicone insulators increases to the value in the range of a few mS. This leads to <b>dry</b> band formation, <b>arcing</b> and possible surface erosion. The surface conductivity on the silicone rubber contaminated a week earlier by NaCl without bentonite is very small, in the range of 0, 1 mS.

40|$|Located {{near the}} equator, Malaysia {{is a country}} {{with one of the}} highest {{lightning}} densities in the world. Lightning contributes to 70 % of the power outages in Malaysia and affects power equipment, automated network systems, causes data losses and monetary losses in the nation. Therefore, consideration of insulator evaluation under lightning impulses can be crucial to evaluate and attempt to overcome this issue. This paper presents a new approach to increase the electrical performance of polymer insulators using a Room Temperature Vulcanisation (RTV) coating. The evaluation involves three different settings of polymer insulator, namely uncoated, RTV type 1, and RTV type 2 upper surface coatings. All the insulators were tested under three different conditions as dry, clean wet and salty under different impulse polarities using the even-rising test method. The voltage breakdown for each test was recorded. From the experiment, {{it was found that the}} effectiveness of the RTV coating application became apparent when tested under salty or polluted conditions. It increased the voltage withstand capabilities of the polymer insulator up to 50 % from the basic uncoated insulator. Under dry and clean conditions, the RTV coating provided just a slight increase of the breakdown voltage. The increase in voltage breakdown capability decreased the probability of surface discharge and <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing</b> that could cause degradation of the polymeric material housing. The RTV type 1 coating was found to be more effective when performing under a lightning impulse. The findings might help the utility companies improve the performance of their insulators in order to increase power system reliability...|$|R
40|$|Silicone rubber (SiR) outdoor {{insulators}} {{are increasingly}} being deployed in new AC and DC high voltage transmission systems thanks to their superior performance in wet-polluted conditions compared to traditional porcelain and glass insulators. However, in severely polluted environments, sustained discharge activities and <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing</b> due to surface contamination cause tracking, erosion, {{and the loss of}} hydrophobicity on the SiR insulator surface. This degradation can accelerate damage to the insulator surfaces, increasing the probability of a flashover and enduring insulator failure. This thesis presents an experimental study on the electric performance of polluted and aged outdoor SiR polymeric insulators using AC and DC voltages. The research involved an extensive review of the published literature and an investigation of the performance of SiR insulators subjected to different ambient conditions and identifies the modes where most failure and degradation occurred on SiR surfaces. Experimental investigations were carried out to compare the aging performance of two 11 kV SiR insulator designs using a rotating wheel dip test under AC and positive DC excitations. A standard polymeric insulator design was used and compared with insulators that had a textured surface. Both insulator designs were fabricated in-house using a vacuum casting machine. Several electrical parameters were measured during the test to characterise the performance of each insulator. <b>Dry</b> band <b>arcing</b> activities were mainly observed on the trunk surface of the conventional profile. A decrease in hydrophobicity was measured on the tested surfaces, and tracking and erosion defects were also observed on both insulator designs. Leakage current measurements showed that drying and discharge activity was greater for a conventional insulator compared with the textured insulator, and more severe degradation appeared under positive DC tests than under AC. These studies showed that insulators with a textured design can improve the performance of SiR insulators against tracking and erosion under AC and positive DC excitations. The electric field and potential distributions along the leakage surface of the 11 kV SiR insulators under dry clean and wet polluted conditions were studied using finite element method COMSOL Multiphysics. The critical of high field regions on SiR surfaces were identified and the power dissipated in the pollution layer along insulator surface was calculated. This study showed useful information about surface heating, which could be used to predict of the formation of dry bands. An investigation of the pollution layer characterisation on conventional and textured pattern designs is described. Several tests were conducted to evaluate the behaviour of the insulator surfaces under different conditions. ESDD and NSDD parameters were measured for different materials, and evaluations for each design were also performed. Leakage conductance measurements on surface designs were determined, and the distribution trends of surface conductance were also characterised. Different rectangular SiR samples were assessed, and an improvement for reducing the pollutant deposition on textured surfaces was observed. In 4 -shed insulators, the textured design showed comparable ESDD value with conventional profile. Textured designs also showed slower growth of the leakage current than the conventional design. Clean fog tests (based on a high voltage ramp test) were carried out to investigate the flashover performance of conventional and textured insulator designs. For different ranges of wetting and pollution severity conditions, the textured design showed an improvement in the flashover performance that could reach 16...|$|R
40|$|The arc {{behavior}} in the current zero region is critical {{in the case of}} very steep rising TRV, such as after clearing a short-line fault. Therefore, intensive and abundant short-line fault tests (L 90) of a 245 kV SF 6 circuit breaker were performed at the KEMA High Power Laboratory. For the purpose of a comparative analysis three different sets of data were obtained during the tests: 1) High-resolution measurements of near current-zero arc current and voltage were carried out. The current zero measurement system (CZM) works as a standalone system in addition to the standard laboratory data acquisition system. The arc conductance shortly before current zero and the arc voltage extinction peak give a clear indication of the interrupting capability of the breaker under test. 2) From the measured traces of every individual test, arc parameters (3 time constants and 3 cooling-power constants) were extracted for the composite black box arc model, which has been developed by KEMA High Power Laboratory and is based on more than 1000 high-resolution measurements during tests of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. Its aim is to simulate interruption phenomenon in SF 6 gas, evaluate performance of HV SF 6 circuit breakers in testing and enable the prediction of the performance under conditions other than those tested. 3) After each test, using specially developed computer software, based on a simplified physical enthalpy flow arc model, the values of the <b>arcing</b> contact <b>distance,</b> gas mass flow through the nozzle throat and pressure inside the compression cylinder were calculated. The values of these characteristic quantities at the current zero are relevant indicators for successful interruption. In the comparative analysis, mathematical relations and statistical correlations between the evaluated parameters of the composite black box arc model and the characteristic output quantities are established and discussed. The link has been verified by MatLAB simulation of every indi- - vidual test. This approach enables acceptable prediction of interruption success in a similar circuit and with a similar interrupter without SLF tests and CZM...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Limited {{research}} results {{are available on}} the aging impacts of surface discharges for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) excitation on practical insulators using the Tracking Wheel Tester (TWT) methodology. This thesis gives details of an experimental investigation to compare the aging performance of insulator samples using the TWT for High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) and positive and negative polarity HVDC excitation. Two series of tests were performed. The first series of tests evaluated the aging of six insulator rods, namely three Room Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (RTV SR) coated glass samples and three uncoated glass samples. Three creepage distances were used for each of the test materials, namely 277 mm, 346 mm and 433 mm. The tests were conducted with HVAC excitation and the test methodology described in the IEC 61302 standard. The second series of tests involved the testing of actual insulator samples. The test voltage and conductivity of the salt water solution were also adapted. Six insulators from different manufacturers, representing different materials and specific creepage distances, were tested with HVAC and positive and negative polarity HVDC excitation. The test samples consisted of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), High Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (HTV SR), porcelain and SR coated porcelain insulators. The aging performance of the different test samples for the three types of excitation are compared in terms of peak leakage current, visual observations of surface degradation and hydrophobicity properties. The leakage current data for HVAC excitation shows that the insulators from the different manufacturers perform differently, even for the same type of material. The results also indicate differences in the way the surfaces degrade, as well as the rate of degradation. For insulators representing the same specific creepage distance, but different materials, {{it has been shown that}} the material does influence the aging performance. Comparison of the leakage current data for the HTV SR insulators from the same manufacturer, but with different specific creepage distances, shows that the specific creepage distance affect the aging performance significantly. In general, the test insulators showed higher peak leakage currents with HVDC excitation compared to HVAC excitation. The results for positive polarity HVDC excitation show that the <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing,</b> as well as the discharges, has the same form for all six insulators. The colour of the dry band discharges ranged from a blue-ish orange to a dark yellow, depending on the intensity of the leakage currents. The hydrophobic insulators, namely the HTV SR, EPDM and RTV SR coated porcelain insulators, had lost hydrophobicity within the first week of testing. The results for negative polarity HVDC excitation show severe surface degradation compared to the results for HVAC excitation. The effect of positive polarity HVDC excitation, however, seems to be more severe in terms of leakage currents and aging compared to negative polarity HVDC excitation...|$|R
40|$|Polymeric {{insulators}} are now {{a common}} replacement for conventional porcelain and glass string insulators on overhead distribution and transmission lines. The use of this mature technology represents many advantages to the utilities; however, in polluted environments and those with high moisture levels in the environment, electrical discharges will develop {{on the surface of}} the insulation. In the long term, electrical discharges cause degradation of the polymer insulation in the form of electrical tracking and material erosion, and both are detrimental to the life of the insulation. Inorganic fillers are added to polymer materials to make the insulation more resistant to discharges, and at the same time, to lower the cost of the insulation. However, there is a limit to the amount of filler that can be added as the processability of the polymer compound becomes extremely difficult and expensive. Microfillers are extensively used to modify the physical properties of the polymeric matrix, and the properties of these composites are well known. On the other hand, nanofillers are being used in some insulating composites for reinforcement of mechanical properties; their electrical characteristics have shown inconsistency in the literature, and this is attributable to the non-uniformity of the filler dispersion. Most researchers agree that particle dispersion is critical in the development of nanocomposites for electrical insulation applications. If the nanoparticles are well dispersed, the electrical properties of these materials will be significantly improved. The main problem in using nanofillers is that the nanoparticles agglomerate easily because of their high surface energy, such that conventional mixing techniques are unable to break apart the nanoparticle aggregates. A secondary problem is the incompatibility of the hydrophobic polymer with the hydrophilic nanoparticles which results in poor interfacial interactions. In this thesis, the reinforcement of a silicone rubber matrix is successfully accomplished with the combination of microfiller, nanofiller, and a commercial surfactant. To improve particle dispersion, several techniques are available apart from mixing. This includes surface modification of the nanoparticles by chemical and physical methods by using surfactants. While surfactants are commonly applied to liquids, their use to disperse nanoparticles in compositions forming solid dielectric materials has not yet been reported. The findings in this thesis have shown that Triton X- 100, a common surfactant, significantly aids in the dispersion of nanosilica and nanoalumina in silicone rubber. The main advantage of the surfactant is that it lowers the surface energy and the interfacial tension of the nanoparticles. This reduces agglomeration and facilitates the separation of the particles during mixing, thereby allowing improved dispersion of the nanofillers, as observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). However, also shown in the thesis is that Triton X- 100 cannot interact efficiently with all types of nanofillers. A high concentration of surfactant can also compromise the adsorption of the matrix polymer chains on the filler particles, so it is necessary to establish a balance between matrix adsorption and the dispersion of the particles. Mechanical properties such as the tensile strength, elongation at break, and hardness may also suffer from the use of excess surfactant. In addition, excess surfactant can lead to surface wetting properties different from composites containing none. Better wetting due to the migration of excess surfactant to the surface of the silicone may favour arcing in a wet environment. The current investigation shows that for a specific filler and concentration, an optimal concentration of surfactant provides good erosion resistance without adversely affecting the mechanical characteristics of the nanocomposite. Stress–strain and hardness measurements are done to investigate the surfactant’s effect on the mechanical properties of the composites. The effect of the surfactant {{on the surface of the}} composites is analyzed with static contact angle measurements. The heat resistance of nanofilled silicone rubber is explored using an infrared laser simulating the heat developed by dry-band arcing. Also, several industry standard test methods such as salt fog and inclined plane tests are used to evaluate the erosion resistance of the filled composites. The results of all three tests confirm that the combination of microfiller and nanofiller with surfactant results in composites with improved erosion resistance to <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing,</b> with the exception of the case where calcinated filler is used in the formulation. In this thesis, the thermal conductivity is measured using a standard ASTM method and calculated using several theoretical, semi-theoretical, and empirical models. A thermal model developed in COMSOL Multiphysics and solved using a finite element method (FEM) shows a temperature distribution in the modelled nanocomposites which is comparable to the temperature distribution measured with an infrared camera under laser heating. In addition, this investigation aims to define the mechanism by which the nanofillers improve the heat and erosion resistance of the silicone composites. In order to understand this mechanism, nano fumed silica, nano natural silica, and nano alumina are used in a silicone rubber (SiR) matrix in order to study the thermally decomposed silicone and the residual char that is formed during laser ablation tests. The white residue remaining after laser ablation on the surface of composites with fumed silica, natural silica, and alumina is analyzed in a number of ways. Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques are used to analyze the thermally decomposed silicone residue after laser heating indicating that the protective mechanism of the three analyzed nanofillers – fumed silica, natural silica, and alumina – appears to be the same. The formation of a continuous layer on the surface behaves as a thermal insulator protecting the material underneath from further decomposition...|$|R
40|$|Outdoor {{insulators}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important parts of a power system. The reliability of a power system depends also on the reliability of the insulators. The main functions of an insulator used for outdoor applications are to give the necessary insulation, provide the necessary mechanical support to the transmission line conductor and also to resist the various environmental stresses like pollution, ultra violet rays etc. Traditionally porcelain and glass insulators have been used for outdoor insulator applications. They are good insulators under normal conditions and the cap and pin arrangement allows them to take up the mechanical load of the line. But owing to their large weight and brittle nature they are susceptible to vandalism and also they have increased cost of installation and commissioning. But the main problem of porcelain and glass insulators is its performance under polluted environmental condition. Under wet and polluted conditions, the porcelain insulators allow the formation of a conducting layer on the surface which results in setting up of leakage current, <b>dry</b> band <b>arcing</b> and power loss. This problem is further augmented under dc voltages where the stress is unidirectional and the contaminant deposition is higher as compared to ac. Polymeric insulators are a good alternative for porcelain and ceramic insulators for use especially under dc voltages because of their good pollution performance. The property of surface hydrophobicity resists the setting up of leakage currents and hence polymeric insulators help in reducing power loss. They are also light in weight and vandalism resistant and hence easier to install. But being polymeric, they form conductive tracks and erode when exposed to high temperatures which occur at the surface during dry band arcs and when exposed to corona discharges. The surface hydrophobicity is also temporarily lost when exposed to different electrical stresses. Silicone rubber is the most popular among the various choices of polymers for outdoor insulator applications. They have good surface hydrophobicity and tracking performance. But polymers in their pure form cannot be used as insulators because of their poor mechanical strength. Adding inorganic fillers into the polymer matrix not only improves its mechanical properties but also its erosion resistance. Micron sized Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) is used traditionally to improve the tracking and erosion resistance of polymeric insulators. A very high loading (up to 60 %) is used. Adding such a high filler loading to the base polymer hampers its flexibility and the material processing. With the advent of nanotechnology, nano fillers have come into vogue. Studies conducted on nano filled polymers showed exciting results. A small amount of nano fillers in the polymer matrix showed significant improvement in the mechanical strength without hampering its flexibility. The electrical properties like tracking and erosion also improved with filler loading. Hence the use of nano filled silicone rubber is a good alternative for use as a high voltage insulator especially under dc voltages. Reports suggest that adding nano fillers into the silicone rubber matrix improves the tracking and erosion resistance and the corona degradation as compared to the unfilled samples under ac voltages. The literature on the dc performance of silicone rubber nano composites is scarce. So the present study aims to evaluate the performance of silicone rubber nano composites for tracking and erosion resistance and corona degradation under dc voltages. The tracking and erosion resistance under dc voltages was measured using the Inclined Plane Tracking and Erosion Resistance set up as per ASTM D 2303 which was modified for dc voltage studies. The performance of nano Alumina and nano Silica fillers were evaluated under negative dc and the performance was compared with micron sized Alumina Trihydrate filled samples. The effect of filler loading was also studied. It was seen that the performance of the silicone rubber improved with filler loading. A small loading percentage of nano fillers were enough to give performance similar to silicone rubber filled with micron sized ATH filler. The silicone rubber performed better under negative dc as compared to ac and positive dc. The positive dc tests showed a migration of ions from the electrodes onto the sample surface. The increased surface conductivity resulted in very heavy erosion in the case of positive dc tested samples. The corona aging studies were also conducted on silicone rubber nano composites. Nano silica was used as filler in this case. Different filler loadings were employed to understand the effect of filler loading. The corona was generated using a needle plane electrode and samples were exposed to both positive and negative dc corona. The samples were exposed to corona for different time intervals – 25 and 50 hours to study the effect of exposure time. The hydrophobicity, crack width and surface roughness were measured after the tests. Adding nano fillers into the polymer matrix improved the corona performance. With filler loading, the performance improved. The samples exposed to positive dc corona performed better than those under negative dc corona. The loss of hydrophobicity, surface cracks and the surface roughness was less in the case of positive dc corona tested samples. With exposure time, the performance of silicone rubber became poorer for positive dc corona tested samples. For the negative dc corona tested samples, the performance seemed to improve with exposure time. The tracking and erosion resistance and the corona aging studies conducted showed that the performance of silicone rubber is improved by adding nano fillers into the polymer matrix. A small amount of nano filler loading was enough to perform similar to a heavily loaded micron filled sample. Hence nano fillers can be used as a good functional material to improve the performance of silicone rubber insulators especially under wet and polluted conditions...|$|R
