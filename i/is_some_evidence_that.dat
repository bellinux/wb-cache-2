5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{circumcision}} {{is associated}} with lower risk of prostate cancer. A 2015 meta-analysis found a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with circumcision in black men. A 2016 meta-analysis found that men with prostate cancer {{were less likely to}} be circumcised.|$|E
5|$|In psychophysiological {{research}} on attachment, {{the two main}} areas studied have been autonomic responses, such as heart rate or respiration, and {{the activity of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament {{and the extent to which}} attachment acts as a moderator. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.|$|E

5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before the troops were withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Pope Alexander III {{had a hand in}} Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
30|$|The laboratory-based X-ray phase {{contrast}} system used here {{was able to}} detect the iron inks {{and the structure of}} the papyrus. Moreover, there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the carbon inks could be seen due to the change in refractive index. However, more assessment is needed to optimise the approach.|$|R

5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was {{fully aware of the}} talents he possessed as a player; there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he sought to influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E

5|$|Many predators feed on {{the milk}} shark, {{including}} larger sharks such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), and possibly also marine mammals. Off KwaZulu-Natal, the decimation of large sharks {{by the use of}} gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers. A known parasite of this species is the copepod Pseudopandarus australis. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> male and female milk sharks segregate from each other.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} mosquitoes preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely originated in Africa and coevolved with its hosts, mosquitoes and non-human primates. Malaria protozoa are diversified into primate, rodent, bird, and reptile host lineages. Humans may have originally caught Plasmodium falciparum from gorillas. P. vivax, another malarial Plasmodium species among the six that infect humans, also likely originated in African gorillas and chimpanzees. Another malarial species recently discovered to be transmissible to humans, P. knowlesi, originated in Asian macaque monkeys. While P. malariae is highly host specific to humans, there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> low level non-symptomatic infection persists among wild chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} 1.8 million hospital charts, {{and found that}} the mortality in control hospitals fell more than mortality in the pay-for-performance hospitals. Short-term improvements were not maintained. There <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> mortality <b>was</b> declining in the three conditions covered by the program, {{at the expense of other}} conditions not covered in the program.|$|R
40|$|International audienceExtra-thoracic solitary fibrous tumours (ESFT) have {{traditionally}} been regarded as indolent neoplasms similar to their intra-thoracic counterparts.

5000|$|There may <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the US {{government}} had an early relationship {{with at least}} one PMU that was close to Suleimani, an organization that was cultivated and propped-up by his adjunct Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. That PMU is Jund al-Imam. The Wall Street Journal once described it (during the Second Battle of Tikrit) as [...] "US-backed".|$|R
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> gender {{differences}} in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless {{they are in a}} very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{the effect}} has {{implications}} for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately {{large number of people}} donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} have the desired effect, the {{question}} must imply something uncommon enough not to <b>be</b> asked without <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> to the fact. For example, the question [...] "Does Mr. Jones have a brother?" [...] would not cause the listener to think there must <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> he does, since this form of general question is frequently asked with no foreknowledge of the answer.|$|R
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{the effect}} has {{implications}} for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price {{did not lead to}} the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the {{youngest}} galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, {{occurred in the}} late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along {{the plane of the}} galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear. Infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although there <b>is</b> <b>some</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E
