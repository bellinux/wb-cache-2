Sometimes, this suppression in immune response {{is responsible for}} deterioration in clinical status of the patient {{in spite of all}} specific and supportive therapy. Certain drugs like steroids are used for rescue therapy in conditions like sepsis. We present a novel use of filgrastim as a rescue therapy in a patient with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, and febrile neutropenia and not responding to standard management...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} serum chemistry and <b>haematological</b> <b>pictures</b> in cross-bred calves (Friesian, kenana) of both sex naturally infected with theileriosis. Their ages ranged between 1 - 3 month. Thirty one naturally infected calves with theileriosis were selected, and the causative agent of the disease was determined, by blood smears from the ear vein and lymph node biopsy smears. The clinical signs of the disease were also observed. Faecal samples were taken from infected calves and control calves to exclude the presence of internal parasites. Comparison between the results of haemology and serum of the infected calves and the results of haemology and serum of the healthy calves was made. The samples of the healthy calves were brought from the farm of the Arabic Corporation For Investment And Agricultural Development in Al bagair. The infected calves which did not reveal theilerial schizonts in their lymph node biopsy smears were not included in the study. Field samples of the infected calves were collected from the farm of University of Khartoum in Shambat, farms in Alhalfia, Alsamrab and Judge service administration farm in Alhag yousif. The haematological results of the infected calves showed low levels of Packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration and glucose concentration compared to healthy calves. Serum chemistry of the infected calves showed low levels of total protein and albumin compared to healthy calves. Serum urea and triglycerides of the infected calves showed high levels compared to 13 healthy calves. Serum Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) were increased in the infected calves compared to healthy calves. Serum sodium and potassium showed slightly decrease in the first and no changes in the latter in the infected calves compared to healthy calves. Serum ceruloplasmin concentration gave low levels in the infected calves compared to healthy calves.

40|$|Introduction: Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disease due to mutations in the SBDS and DNAJC 21 genes, both involved in ribosome biogenesis. Patients affected by SDS show widely variable clinical features and have an increased risk to develop myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Areas covered: Clinical features from diagnosis to surveillance and treatment of SDS patients are presented. It is mainly addressed the necessity to monitor the <b>haematological</b> and cytogenetic <b>picture</b> of the bone marrow in order to early identify any possible dysplastic/neoplastic sign to quickly treat the condition. Since, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only therapy for hematological complications, the useful preparative regimens is extensively discussed. In addition, recent molecular and cytogenetic studies are reported. Expert opinion: In our opinion, due to high variability of pathological phenotype presented by SDS patients, a prompt molecular diagnosis may help {{the management of the}} disease and may aim the cytological monitoring at bone marrow level, which could improve the surveillance of patients and, if necessary, carry to a prompt hematopoietic stem cell transplant...|$|R
40|$|Early {{studies in}} a rural {{community}} in The Gambia led to reports of anaemia in certain sections of the population. More recent investigations concerned with identifying micronutrient deficiencies have elaborated these earlier findings. The major determinant of anaemia is an iron deficiency, leading to a microcytic hypochromic <b>haematological</b> <b>picture.</b> However, riboflavin deficiency, which is very widespread, and which leads to clinical signs in some subjects, appears to impose some limitations on absorption and utilization of iron. A subclinical deficiency of ascorbic acid is also observed and this may further compromise iron status. In addition very poor folate status leads to a macrocytosis in some individuals and may limit the haematological response to iron supplementation...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{systemic}} mastocytosis (SM) presenting as ascites and portal hypertension. The <b>haematological</b> <b>picture</b> at presentation was suggestive of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Initial difficulties in making a diagnosis of SM were encountered as the cutaneous signs were atypical. The correct diagnosis was established only after tissue sections were appropriately stained for mast cells. The liver biopsy showed portal and sinusoidal mast cell infiltration, portal fibrosis and evidence of hepatic venous outflow obstruction. The disease progressed rapidly and recurrent massive ascites was a dominant problem. This case illustrates again the problems of making a diagnosis of SM especially when the clinical picture is atypical. Ascites as a presenting manifestation of SM has been reported previously in only six patients. Published cases of SM with portal hypertension or ascites or both are reviewed...|$|E

Vet. arhiv 76, 507 - 519, 2006. Due to its quality and relatively low price {{as a result of}} a simple and short production cycle, poultry meat occupies a very high position in the consumption of foodstuffs of animal origin. It is just because of such simple and rapid production that, under the circumstances of larger-scale radioactive contamination, poultry meat might become the main source of protein of animal origin. This fact, as well as the fact that no investigation into the effects of radioactive phosphorus (32 P) on fattening chickens has been conducted so far, induced us to investigate the impact of a lethal quantity of this isotope on chickens at slaughter age. The investigation was performed on chickens, hybrids of the Jata heavy breeds of both sexes, aged 50 days and with a mass ranging from 1500 to 2000 g. The experiment was based on the application of radioactive phosphorus 32 P at 333 MBq/kg of body mass. Test animals were clinically examined, blood samples were taken for haematological analysis and, immediately after death, dissection and pathohistological examination were performed. Based on the obtained results it was concluded that radioactive phosphorus 32 P, when applied to 50 -day-old chickens of the Jata heavy breed at 33...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of Theileria lestoquardi on the reproductive performance of Sudanese desert ewes. Thirty sudanese desert ewes were divided into three groups of 10 each. Group A (GA) was infected with Theileria lestoquardi before mating; group B (GB) was infected with Theileria lestoquardi 2 - 3 months after conception and group C (GC) remained as the uninfected control. GA was subjected to estrus synchronization and hand mating. Conception rate {{was found to be}} 11. 1 % in the first mating, and increased to 33. 3 % and 44. 4 % {{in the second and third}} mating. On the other hand, GC conception rate reached 90 %. In GB, three ewes aborted 20 days post infection. The gestation period was two weaks shorter in GA. The effectof infection onbody weight of the newly born lambs was shown by 30 % reduction in GA and by 50 % mortality rate which was statistically significant at p < 0. 05. The study revealed thatthere was a statistically significance delay (p< 0. 05) in the first progesterone rise after delivery. The study was also concerned with the effect of Theileria lestoquardion the time of reaching puberty on the lambs. Fifteen sudanese desert lamb ewes (4 - 5 months) were divided into two groups; group 1 (G 1) consisted of 7 lamb ewes infected with Theileria lestoquardi,and group 2 (G 2) remained as uninfected control. Puberty was reached 12 - 15 and 8 - 9 months in G 1 and G 2 respectively The study also revealed the effect of Theileria. lestoquardion ص the <b>haematological</b> and biochemical <b>picture</b> in GA compared to GC. There was a significant decrease in haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume and white blood cells counts (p< 0. 05). There was also a significant decrease in serum total protein (p< 0. 05) but no significant difference in serum albumin concentration. Serum globulin values were also decreased significantly (P< 0. 05). There was a statistically significance (p< 0. 05) increase in serum urea concentration and serum creatinine concentration. The study also reflected the changes in the heamatological and the biochemical parameters with the progress of pregnancy. The results showed that there was a decrease in the haemoglobin concentration and packed cell volume in GA and GC. White blood cells count in GA only showed a significant decrease with the progress of pregnancy.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of homozygous alpha thalassaemia 2 with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease {{results in a}} generally milder <b>haematological</b> <b>picture</b> with less intravascular sickling, less haemolysis, and higher haemoglobin levels. Clinically, patients are generally more mildly affected, though not all vaso-occlusive complications are reduced. Thus {{there is a possibility}} that the advantages gained by inhibition of sickling have been offset by the rheological disadvantages of the higher haemoglobin level. The capillary bed in the perimacular region of the posterior pole has been used to examine the degree of vaso-occlusion in age and sex matched controls with SS disease with and without homozygous alpha thalassaemia 2. The results demonstrated significantly less capillary abnormalities in the perimacular region of patients with alpha thalassaemia, though the size of the foveal avascular zone and the grading of perimacular capillary drop-out did not differ between the 2 genotypes. These results are compatible with a mild inhibitory effect of alpha thalassaemia on vaso-occlusion of the macular vasculature in SS disease...|$|E

Methods: The co-inheritance of a-thalassaemia in 322 P-thalassaemia carriers in Malaysia was studied. Results: The frequency of (alpha-thalassaemia in the beta-thalassaemia carriers was 12. 7 (41 / 322), with a carrier frequency of 7. 8 for the SEA deletion, 3. 7 for the -alpha(3. 7) deletion, 0. 9 for Hb Constant Spring and 0. 3 for the -alpha(4. 2) deletion.

40|$|The severe {{nutritional}} anaemia found in tropical countries is usually {{due to a}} deficiency {{of one or more}} of the haematinics, iron, folic acid or vitamin BI~. The other common type of anaemia, due to a protein deficiency, is rarely as severe as that encountered, when one of these haematinics i deficient. The <b>haematological</b> <b>picture</b> of an iron deficiency anaemia is quite different from that due to a folic acid deficiency and in its pure form either deficiency can easily be recognized from the blood picture. TROWELL (1942) points out that many of the haematological features of these two deficiencies are diametrically opposed. Thus a patient with a pure iron de-ficiency anaemia has a normoblastic bone marrow in which the normoblasts are small and have well-developed nuclei which readily become pyknotic. The cytoplasm of the normo-blasts is poorly filled with haemoglobin. In contrast, a folic acid deficiency results in a megaloblastic bone marrow in which the cells are larger than normal and have nuclei that are poorly matured and retain their characteristic open chromatin etwork. The cytoplasm is well filled with haemoglobin. These differences in the development of the nucleated red cells are reflected in the mature red cells found in the peripheral blood and results in th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the route of {{inoculation}} of Dugbe virus (a Nigerian tick-borne virus) in baby mice was investigated. Striking differences were observed in the onset of morbidity, organ virus titres at the terminal stages of the infection, the pathology of the various organs and the <b>haematological</b> <b>picture,</b> depending upon whether the animals were infected intracerebrally (i. c.) or intraperitoneally (i. p.). Mice infected i. c. became moribund 2 - 3 days earlier than those infected i. p. Furthermore, the virus titres of the various organs were generally higher by 1 - 2 log in the former group of mice. The most distinguishing feature of the brain pathology of i. p. inoculated mice was the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies in the neurons of the hippocampus. In contrast, there were no inclusions after i. c. inoculation. There was depletion of mature lymphocytes from germinal centres of the spleen in i. c. inoculated mice, whereas in the i. p. inoculated mice there was lymphoid hyperplasia. At the terminal stages of i. c. infection {{there was a tremendous}} increase in neutrophils, while in i. p. inoculated mice there was an increase in plasmacytoid lymphocytes.

40|$|The myelodysplastic syndromes {{represent}} a preleukaemic {{state in which}} a clonal abnormality of haemopoietic stem cell is characterised {{by a variety of}} phenotypic manifestations with varying degrees of ineffective haemopoiesis. This state probably develops as a sequence of events in which the earliest stages may be difficult to detect by conventional pathological techniques. The process is characterised by genetic changes leading to abnormal control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Expansion of an abnormal clone may be related to independence from normal growth factors, insensitivity to normal inhibitory factors, suppression of normal clonal growth, or changes in the immunological or nutritional condition of the host. The <b>haematological</b> <b>picture</b> is of peripheral blood cytopenias: a cellular bone marrow, and functional abnormalities of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic cells. In most cases marrow cells have an abnormal DNA content, often with disturbances of the cell cycle: an abnormal karyotype is common in premalignant clones. Growth abnormalities of erythroid or granulocyte-macrophage progenitors are common in marrow cultures, and lineage specific surface membrane markers indicate aberrations of differentiation. Progression of the disorder may occur through clonal expansion or through clonal evolution with a greater degree of malignancy. Current attempts to influence abnormal growth and differentiation have had only limited success. Clinical recognition of the syndrome depends on an acute awareness of the signs combined with the identification of clonal and functional abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Severe anaemia is an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in African children, but the causes, particularly falciparum malaria, are difficult to determine. We assessed the contribution of falciparum malaria to anaemia in Kenyan children by clinical examination and measurement of parasitaemia and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in 559 children in the community and in 2412 children admitted to Kilifi district hospital during a 2 -year period. We also attempted to characterize severe malarial anaemia by examining the causes and pathophysiology of anaemia in 101 children admitted with Hb concentration < or = 50 g/l during a 1 -year period. Plasmodium falciparum infection was associated with reduced Hb concentration in children in the community and in those admitted to hospital irrespective of diagnosis. Falciparum malaria was the primary cause in 46 cases (46 %) of severe anaemia admitted to hospital. There was no difference in the frequency of haemolysis or dyserythropoiesis in the children with malarial anaemia and those with anaemia from other causes, such as iron deficiency or sickle cell disease. The mortality rate in the children with severe malarial anaemia was 8. 6 % compared with 3. 6 % in children with severe anaemia due to other causes.

40|$|Background & objectives: Lymphadenopathy and {{haematological}} alterations are {{the earliest}} manifestations with other associated opportunistic infections and malignancies. Hence, {{there is a}} need for simple investigations like fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for evaluation of HIV lymphadenopathy and a haemogram to interpret the haematological alterations. This study was undertaken to analyze the cytological patterns of lymph node lesions in HIV/AIDS patients, to compare with available clinico-pathological and haematological parameters to segregate lymphadenopathy cases for further evaluation. Methods: In the present study, 129 HIV seropositive patients were included. Lymph node aspirates were stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen (Z-N) stains. Special stains and cultures were done in selected patients. Peripheral smears were taken from all the patients and CD 4 counts were recorded. Tuberculous lymphadenitis was further categorized. Acid fast bacilli (AFB) grading was done on Z-N positive smears. Each lesion was compared with CD 4 counts, WHO clinical staging and <b>haematological</b> <b>picture.</b> Results: Cytological diagnosis in 129 patients included tuberculous (n= 54, 41. 9 %), reactive lymphadenopathy (n= 46, 35. 6 %), suppurative (n= 16, 12. 4 %) lymphadenitis, non-Hodgkin′s lymphoma (n= 4, 3. 1 %), and Hodgkin′s lymphoma, secondary deposits, other granulomatous lesions, and cryptoccocal lymphadenitis in one patient each. The predominant cytomorphological pattern in tuberculous lymphadenitis was caseous necrosis + epithelioid granuloma formation (51. 85 %). Grade 2 + Z-N grading was noted in 62. 96 per cent of AFB positive smears. CD 4 counts showed a descending pattern with progression of WHO clinical staging.
