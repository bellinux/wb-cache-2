That incident makes it interesting, and it had a history before it came into Luigi's hands which adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi by a great Indian prince, the Gaikowar of Baroda, and it had been in his family two or three centuries. It killed a good many disagreeable people who troubled the hearthstone at one time or another. It isn't much too look at, except it isn't shaped like other knives, or dirks, or whatever it may be called--here, I'll draw it for you." [...] He took a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch. [...] "There it is--a broad and murderous blade, with edges like a razor for sharpness. The devices engraved on it are the ciphers or names of its long line of possessors--I had Luigi's name added <b>in</b> <b>Roman</b> <b>letters</b> myself with our coat of arms, as you see. You notice what a curious handle the thing has. It is solid ivory, polished like a mirror, and is four or five inches long--round, and as thick as a large man's wrist, with the end squared off flat, for your thumb to rest on; for you grasp it, with your thumb resting on the blunt end--so--and lift it along and strike downward. The Gaikowar showed us how the thing was done when he gave it to Luigi, and before that night was ended, Luigi had used the knife, and the Gaikowar was a man short by reason of it. The sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value. You will find a sheath more worth looking at than the knife itself, of course." ...|$|E

Formulaic expressions {{in the body of}} the letters [...] Conclusion. The significance of formulaic expressions <b>in</b> the <b>Roman</b> <b>letters.</b> Official <b>Roman</b> Republican <b>letters</b> inscribed <b>in</b> Greek have been neglected in recent scholarship on Ancient Greek and Roman epistolography, and the language of these letters in particular has not yet received satisfactory treatment. The letters have been assessed against texts which differ from them temporally, geographically, and in terms of media and text type. This has resulted in criticism of their language and their authors’ capabilities. These letters are important for understanding Greek and Roman history, epistolography, languages, and bilingualism, and their language is in need of a reassessment which applies relevant comparanda and is sensitive to the Koine Greek of documentary evidence. One important feature of the language of the <b>Roman</b> <b>letters</b> inscribed <b>in</b> Greek is the formulaic expressions. Since they require a knowledge of the language as well as familiarity with the text type, they are revealing of the authors’ understanding of official epistolography in Koine Greek. This dissertation analyses the form and function of formulaic language <b>in</b> these <b>Roman</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> Greek. It demonstrates the attention which the authors paid to formulaic language and the proficiency with which they applied the Greek language in their official letters.
