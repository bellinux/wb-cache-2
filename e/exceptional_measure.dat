2500|$|Series two was {{broadcast}} on Thursday nights at 9:30pm, beginning on 6 October 1966 with the episode, “The Machine Stops”. The new series was promoted in listings magazine Radio Times with a front cover of “The Machine Stops”’ star Yvonne Mitchell and an article previewing the upcoming episodes, written by Michael Imison. The two most notable productions {{of the series}} were “The Machine Stops” and “Level Seven”. “The Machine Stops”, directed by Philip Saville, was a particularly challenging production – later described by Shubik as “the most complex and technically demanding script I have {{ever had in my}} hands ” – requiring large and complex sets (including construction of one with a working monorail). [...] However the effort paid off as the adaptation was met with good reviews (“A haunting film – and a deeply disturbing one” - The Times) and was awarded first prize at the Fifth Festival Internazionale del Film di Fantascienza (International Science Fiction Film Festival) in Trieste on 17 July 1967. [...] “Level Seven” was adapted by J. B. Priestley and directed by Rudolph Cartier. Priestley’s script had begun life as a potential screenplay for a feature film and condensing it down to Out of the Unknown’s standard running time of fifty minutes proved impossible. In the end, Shubik convinced the management of the BBC to allow “Level Seven” to run to sixty minutes as a one-off <b>exceptional</b> <b>measure.</b> Reviewing “Level Seven” in The Listener, J.C. Trewin said, “the tension was inescapable, the excitement incontestable, more so, undoubtedly, than other thrusts into the future”. [...] The robot costumes created for “The Prophet” were later reused in the Doctor Who serial “The Mind Robber”.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} dynamic by which once <b>exceptional</b> <b>measures</b> become {{normalised}} and then extended to new extremes. Abstract Since September 11, Australia’s federal Parliament has enacted {{a range of}} <b>exceptional</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at preventing terrorism. These measures include control orders, which were not designed or intended for use outside of the terrorism context. What has followed, however, has been the migration of this measure to new contexts in the states and territories, especially in regard to what some have termed the ‘war on bikies’. This has occurred {{to the point that}} this measure, once considered extreme, has become accepted as a normal aspect of the criminal justice system, and has in turn given rise to even more stringent legal measures. This article explores the dynamic by which once <b>exceptional</b> <b>measures</b> become normalised and then extended to new extremes. It explores these issues {{in the context of the}} role that constitutional values have played in this process...|$|R

However, an exploration of the evolution of the security concept challenges the premises of this exceptionality and brings attention to its contextual elements. The Copenhagen school has greatly contributed to this exploration and it has focused on securitization, that is the process through which security threats are identified and <b>exceptional</b> <b>measures</b> in response are legitimized.

50|$|Furthermore, {{understanding}} <b>exceptional</b> <b>measures</b> as extremely politicised responses and/or measures outside {{politics is}} problematic, as it implies different frames of action within {{a large scale}} of possible. What constitutes “normal politics”? Are these measures outside or within {{the frame of the}} law? Do they apply to everyone or only to a specific group? Do they hold policy implication? These questions are particularly relevant to appreciate the types of security measures a securitization through societal security could bring, i.e. what could a community do by securitising identities? Hence, this vagueness could indicate a decision not to engage with debates around <b>exceptional</b> <b>measures</b> or the limits of conceptualising the modus operandi of security measures outside of the state.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{wage and}} price {{controls}} {{are regarded as}} a temporary and <b>exceptional</b> <b>measure,</b> only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce {{the underlying causes of}} inflation during the wage and price control regime, for example, winning the war being fought. They often have perverse effects, due to the distorted signals they send to the market. Artificially low prices often cause rationing and shortages and discourage future investment, resulting in yet further shortages. The usual economic analysis is that any product or service that is under-priced is overconsumed. For example, if the official price of bread is too low, there will be too little bread at official prices, and too little investment in bread making by the market to satisfy future needs, thereby exacerbating the problem in the long term.|$|E

50|$|Although the Singapore {{government}} championed {{public policies}} {{and a political}} discourse of racial integration and national identity, it came to recognise that important differences in the socio-economic profiles of the three main races continued to endure in the post-colonial period. Initially, it had set up Mendaki, a quasi-autonomous Malay community self-help group to promote educational advancement within that community to address underperformance by Malay students. In the 1980s, this approach - which was initially seen as an <b>exceptional</b> <b>measure</b> taken {{in the case of}} the Malay community - became entwined with the rhetoric of Asian values, which saw the promotion of a greater consciousness and pride in each citizen's own ethnic heritage, as a bulwark against the supposedly negative influence of Western culture. Consequently, the government established the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) in 1991 to address the educational and social problems of the Indian community. Shortly after, a similar body was set up for the majority Chinese community.|$|E
