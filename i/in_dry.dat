40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{analysed}} chemical and physical parameters of dried salted pork ham and neck. Dry-cured meat is a traditional dry-cured product obtained after 12 - 24 months of ripening under controlled environmental conditions.   Ham and neck was salted by nitrite salt mixture during 1 week. Salted meat products were dried at 4 °C and relative humidity 85 % 1 week after salting. The quality of dry-cured meat is influenced by the processing technology, for example length of drying and ripening period.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{analysed}} and evaluated chemical and physical parameters of dried salted pork neck and ham. Dried salted meat is one of the main meat products typically produced with a variety of flavors and textures. Neck (14  samples) and ham (14 samples) was salted by nitrite salt mixture during 1 week. The nitrite salt mixture for salting process (dry salting) was used. This salt mixture contains: salt, dextrose, maltodextrin, flavourings, stabilizer E 316, taste enhancer E 621, nitrite mixture. The meat samples were dried at 4 °C and relative humudity 85 % after 1 week salting. The weight of each sample was approximately 1 kg. After salting were vacuum-packed and analysed after 1 week. The traditional dry-cured meat such as dry-cured ham and neck obtained after 12 - 24 months of ripening under controlled conditions.

40|$|The precise quantitation {{of smoking}} during {{pregnancy}} is difficult in retrospective studies. Routinely collected blood specimens from newborns, stored as dried blood spots, {{may provide a}} low-cost method to objectively measure maternal smoking close {{to the time of}} delivery. This article compares cotinine levels <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots to those in umbilical cord blood to assess cotinine <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots as a biomarker of maternal smoking close to the time of delivery. The California Genetic Disease Screening Program provided dried blood spots from 428 newborns delivered in 2001 - 2003 with known umbilical cord blood cotinine levels. Cotinine <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots was measured in 6. 35 -mm punches by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (quantitation limit, 3. 1 ng/mL). Repeated measures of cotinine <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots were highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 99, P < 0. 001) among 100 dried blood spots with cotinine quantitated in 2 separate punches. Linear regression revealed that cotinine levels <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots were slightly lower than those in umbilical cord blood and predicted umbilical cord blood cotinine levels well (β = 0. 95, R 2 = 0. 80, and P < 0. 001 for both cotinine levels in log 10 scale). When defining active smoking as a cotinine level of 10 ng/mL or more and using umbilical cord blood cotinine as the criterion standard, we found that measurements of cotinine <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots had high sensitivity (92. 3 %) and specificity (99. 7 %) in the prediction of maternal active smoking. Cotinine levels <b>in</b> <b>dried</b> blood spots are an accurate biomarker of maternal smoking close to the time of delivery. © 2013 The Author.
