25|$|If {{a company}} {{has gone into}} an {{insolvency}} procedure, administrators or liquidators should aim to realise the greatest amount in assets to distribute to creditors. The effect is to alter orthodox private law rules regarding consideration, creation of security and limited liability. The freedom to contract for any consideration, adequate or not, is curtailed when transactions are made for an undervalue, or whenever it comes after the presentation of a winding up petition. The freedom to contract for any security interest is also restricted, as a company's attempt to give an undue preference to one creditor over another, particularly a floating charge for no new money, or any charge that is not registered, can be unwound. Since the Cork Report's emphasis on increasing director accountability, practitioners may sue directors by summary procedure for breach of duties, especially negligence or conflicts of interest. Moreover, and encroaching on limited liability and separate personality, a specific, insolvency related claim was created in 1986 named wrongful trading, so if a director failed to put a company into an insolvency procedure, and ran up extra debts, when a reasonable director would have, he can be made liable {{to contribute to the}} company's assets. <b>Intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> and fraud is dealt with strictly, but proof of a mens rea is unnecessary in the interest of preventing unjust enrichment of some creditors at others' expense, and to deter wrongdoing.|$|E
2500|$|Vicarious {{liability}} in English {{law is a}} doctrine of English tort law that imposes strict liability on employers for the wrongdoings of their employees. Generally, an employer will {{be held liable for}} any tort committed while an employee is conducting their duties. This liability has expanded in recent years following the decision in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd to better cover intentional torts, such as sexual assault and deceit. Historically, it was held that most <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoings</b> were not in the course of ordinary employment, but recent case law suggests that where an action is closely connected with an employee's duties, an employer can be found vicariously liable.

Social control necessitates stronger weighting of consequences than causes; fairness entails the opposite. The authors hypothesized that the developmental shift from overweighting consequence to overweighting intent when determining levels of punishment illustrates a shift from a default defender of the normative order to a motivated crusader of fairness to the wrongdoer. Thus, punishment should increase slightly for <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoings</b> but decrease substantially for accidental wrongdoings as people age.

50|$|Although many {{companies}} {{have been identified as}} having problems with backdating, the severity of the problem, and the consequences, fall along a broad spectrum. At one extreme, where it is clear that top management was guilty of conscious wrongdoing in backdating, attempted to conceal the backdating by falsifying documents, and where the backdating resulted in a substantial overstatement of the company's profitability, SEC enforcement actions and even criminal charges have resulted. Toward the other extreme, where the backdating was a result of overly informal internal procedures or even just delays in finalizing the paperwork documenting options grants, not <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> there is likely to be no formal sanction—although the company may have to restate its financial statements to bring its accounting into compliance with applicable accounting rules.|$|E

Likewise, any congressmen who resigns after having been formally indicted in Colombia for any of these crimes or who is temporarily absent after an arrest warrant has been issued for any of these crimes is not replaced.

50|$|Ahalya, {{the wife}} of Rishi Gautam, was a {{beautiful}} woman. Indra, king of the gods, was tempted and decided to seduce her with trickery.

While the Rishi was bathing at the river, Indra assumed Gautam's form and visited Ahalya, fooling her into thinking he was her husband. When Gautam returned, he encountered Indra, emerging from his hut in his (Gautam's) form. Spiritually powerful, Gautam employed his divine vision to see the whole episode. Enraged, he cursed Indra with impotence. Losing his potency, Indra lost heaven to demons and sat prayerfully in a lotus flower for thousands of years in order to repent. Rishi Gautam, in a blind rage, also cursed his wife, Ahalya, to turn into a boulder. Innocent of any <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing,</b> Ahalya begged for forgiveness.

Accordingly, in 1998, the Appeals Court rescinded its extradition order. In subsequent actions, based on the determination of the Appeals Court, Demjanjuk's deportation order was nullified and his U.S. citizenship restored. Further, the Court ruled that, because the civil actions regarding denaturalization and deportation were based upon allegations of criminal activity {{on the part of a}} defendant, henceforth OSI would have to use the more exacting rules of disclosure required by criminal proceedings.

50|$|Next to honor, {{human life}} is the most sacred thing upon this earth. He who {{intentionally}} takes this life must {{be held responsible for}} his act, and can only be justified upon the ground of necessity, and this necessity must not be the result of his own <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> or willful carelessness. While he is justifiable in acting upon reasonable appearances of danger, yet he must take care and see that he acts upon such reasonable appearances, and not as the result of his own unlawful and wicked passions. The sooner that desperate and lawless men learn that human life has ceased to be the cheapest thing in Oklahoma, the better it will be for them. They must control their passions or suffer the just penalties of violated law. In order that this improved condition may be made permanent, juries must be careful, firm, and fearless in the discharge of their duties, and courts must uphold their verdicts when it appears from the record that they were rendered upon sufficient evidence and were fairly obtained, and that the defendant was not deprived of any of his substantial rights.

[...] These accusations prompted six investigations looking for evidence of prosecutorial or ethical misconduct. They were conducted by three separate bodies between 1987 and 1993. First, the Appeals Court appointed a Special Master, Federal District Court Judge Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr., who conducted a six-month inquiry resulting in a 210-page unpublished report. Second, the local Bar reviewed the conduct of both Ryan and the attorney assigned to the case. Third, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) conducted four internal inquiries. One was at the request of OSI itself and another at the request of Demjanjuk's defense team. Another was at the request of Chief Justice Gilbert S. Merritt, Jr., who had presided during the Demjanjuk denaturalization hearing and questioned Ryan's conduct, speculating that [...] "Jewish special interest groups" [...] had [...] "obviously influenced Ryan and the OSI."

50|$|As is {{recorded}} in John Stow's Survey of London, a crisis arose when coins minted under Lonyson's direction {{were found to}} be consistently underweight and of less fineness than was prescribed. Lonyson responded that the variances were within the tolerances specified in his indenture and therefore allowable. The purity of the Elizabethan coinage was a matter of great pride to the government after the debased coinages and consequent inflation of the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, and the matter was taken up {{at the highest levels of}} the government. The Warden, Richard Martin, raised charges against Lonyson for intentionally reducing both weight and fineness by the maximum amounts allowed under the indenture, against prior custom and for personal profit. The matter was finally weighed in 1578 by a commission of Privy Council members including Nicholas Bacon (the Lord Keeper), William Cecil, Lord Burghley (the Lord Treasurer), Sir Christopher Hatton, the Earls of Leicester and Sussex, Sir Francis Walsingham, and Sir Walter Mildmay. The wording of Lonyson's indenture was imprecise, and he avoided conviction. Ultimately the Council required Lonyson to coin only on short-term commissions that quite specifically established the Master's portion of precious metals at a level higher than the intention of the original indenture but lower than Lonyson's practice of 1572-76. Lonyson accepted the new oversight and was cleared of <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> in his prior practice. He continued to serve in the Royal Mint until his death.|$|E
40|$|In Washington State, tortfeasors get a {{break when}} they commit {{intentional}} torts. Instead of receiving more punishment for their planned bad act, intentional tortfeasors are punished as if they committed a mere accident. The trend does not stop in Washington State—nationwide, punitive damage legislation inadequately deters intentional wrongdoers through caps and outright bans on punitive damages. Despite Washington State’s one hundred and twenty-five year ban on punitive damages, {{it is in a}} unique and powerful position to change the way courts across the country deal with intentional tortfeasors. Since Washington has never had a comprehensive punitive damages framework, and has largely avoided the sway of the nationwide tort reform movement, it is a blank slate for demonstrating how punitive damages should be used to deter <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> in a fair and appropriate way. While law and economics theorists have debated how to reach complete deterrence, this Note’s argument takes reality into consideration in the form of binding Supreme Court precedent on punitive damages to provide a punitive damages framework that results in more deterrence than current punitive damages provide, and still passes constitutional scrutiny. This Note argues for a punitive damages framework based on graduated levels of culpability and correlated compensatory to punitive damage-award ratios to allow for as much deterrence of <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> as possible, while conforming to Supreme Court precedent...|$|E
40|$|Intentional {{misconduct}} frequently has extraterritorial consequences. Terrorist attacks, toxic pollution, {{civil rights}} violations, and other intentional torts can cause harm within a state despite originating outside the state. Those harms raise a vexing constitutional question: when do the local effects of <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> authorize personal jurisdiction over a defendant whose conduct occurred outside the forum? The answer has several significant implications. Granting or denying jurisdiction can support or undermine regulatory interests by allocating power between states, imposes burdens on the parties that can impede access to justice, and alters risk assessments that shape both socially desirable and socially destructive behavior...|$|E
40|$|This Note {{specifically}} {{addresses the}} jurisdictional {{split on the}} mental state requirement necessary to hold a defendant liable under the ATA. This Note explores the current judicial interpretations of the statute and concludes that, as the statute stands, the Second Circuit best interprets the mental state requirement for § 2333 (a) claims predicated on a violation of material support laws. This Note proposes, however, that Congress should amend the ATA to clarify the state-of-mind requirement and should only allow for a cause of action where a bank manifests heightened culpability through <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> {{in the provision of}} financial services to foreign terrorist organizations...|$|E
40|$|The Article {{presents}} a comprehensive proposal for assigning {{liability in tort}} cases according to the parties’ respective degrees of fault. The authors criticize the Court of Appeals of Maryland’s recent decision in Coleman v. Soccer Association of Columbia declining to abrogate contributory negligence, particularly the court’s notion {{that it should not}} act because of the legislature’s repeated failure to do so. The Article provides a comprehensive analysis of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} comparative fault, including its effect on administrative costs, claims frequency, claims severity, insurance premiums, and economic performance. The authors propose the legislative enactment of comparative fault and debate the respective advantages of its pure and modified forms. The Article then provides a comprehensive roadmap for the implementation of a comparative fault system and addresses the handling of multiple and absent tortfeasors and how the implementation of comparative fault should affect the law governing last clear chance, assumption of risk, and <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> Because the authors’ approach is one of apportioning liability according to fault, they then recommend abrogating other Maryland doctrines that refuse to apportion liability, including joint and several liability and the state’s statute that declares evidence of seat belt nonuse inadmissible...|$|E
40|$|The {{imputation}} {{doctrine in}} the common law of agency provides that knowledge of an agent acquired {{in the course of}} the agency relationship is imputed to the principal. An important exception to the imputation doctrine, known as the adverse interest exception, provides that knowledge is not imputed if it is acquired by the agent in a course of conduct that is entirely adverse to the principal. These doctrines play an important role in sorting out liability when senior management of a corporation engages in a financial fraud that harms the company. Typically, new management is brought in and it sues the company 2 ̆ 7 s outside service providers (auditors, attorneys, and investment bankers), alleging that their negligence (or, in some cases, <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing)</b> was a proximate cause of the fraud 2 ̆ 7 s success. The defense invokes the imputation doctrine [...] senior management 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of the fraud should be imputed to the company [...] and in pari delicto. The plaintiff responds that the adverse interest exception makes imputation inappropriate and, therefore, in pari delicto is inapplicable. At this point, the issue is joined and, historically, the outside service providers have prevailed. This settled law may have been altered by the recently adopted Restatement (Third) of Agency. This article explores the history of imputation and the adverse interest exception, the evolution and stance of the Restatement (Third) of Agency as it relates to these issues, and how various policy considerations should inform the legal doctrines at issue...|$|E
40|$|Examination of {{the rules}} and {{principles}} of Anglo-American criminal law reveals that there is often more to criminal liability than the presence of criminal wrongdoing per se, understood as certain instances of harm risking or harm causing behaviour. The frequent requirement for mental states such as intention, recklessness and belief make a conviction on certain occasions not only dependent on wrongdoing, but also {{the presence of a}} morally culpable state of mind; when available, the defences of loss of control/provocation and duress, with their reference to the conditions and emotional states under which <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> occurs, accept that, though wrongdoing is in place, exculpation in some form is nevertheless appropriate; the focus on mental health exhibited by the defences of insanity and diminished responsibility, and on age by the defence of infancy, reflects a concern not with the wrong committed, but with the defendant’s mental faculties and development at the time of wrongdoing. All of these elements of Anglo-American criminal law exhibit a common feature: a concern not so much with what the accused has done, but with whether, how and why he should be held to account for having done it. In seeking theoretical understanding of such elements, the theorist is not engaged in understanding the grounds upon which certain behaviour is or should be criminalised, involving matters such as the role of the harm principle or the legitimate reach of inchoate liability; his concern is with the grounds of liability once criminal wrongdoing is in place, and it is those grounds that constitute the notion of criminal responsibility. This article explores how Anglo-American criminal law theory has explored this question...|$|E
40|$|This Note argues that, for {{the most}} part, open-file {{discovery}} proponents fail to recognize the added burden that defense counsel would face under a regime in which all items of the prosecution’s evidence are available for investigation by the defense. This is particularly true in the eighty to ninety percent of criminal cases where the defendant is indigent, and the court appointed defense counsel is operating under strict resource constraints. This Note also argues that advocates of open-file discovery fail to recognize that {{in the majority of}} cases involving prosecutorial misconduct, the prosecutor’s <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> will be sufficient to overshadow any reasonable amount of diligence performed by defense counsel. This Note will contend that instituting an open-file discovery policy would only compound the problem of providing adequate representation to defendants. In {{light of the fact that}} the overwhelming majority of defendants are represented by publicly funded counsel, this Note will focus on the effects of open-file discovery to indigent defendants. Specifically, it will argue that any attendant benefits received by a single defendant under an open-file discovery regime would be largely outweighed by the costs to defendants as a whole and to the judicial system. This Note will demonstrate that the economic consequences of open-file discovery would be disastrous in the current judicial environment and would serve as nothing more than a shifting of burdens from the prosecution to the defense. The effect of this burden shifting would lead to more overworked public defenders and lower quality representation for indigent defendants. This Note will also demonstrate that in the cases often cited as the hallmark evidence showing a need for open-file discovery— those in which innocent defendants are convicted because the prosecution affirmatively fails to disclose exculpatory evidence—open-file discovery would serve no actual purpose in eliminating the prosecutorial misconduct. This Note will show that open-file discovery would cause more harm than good by creating a situation in which prosecutors could overwhelm defense counsel with evidence, either intentionally or unintentionally, and frustrate defense counsel’s ability to locate and synthesize critical evidence...|$|E
40|$|Intentional {{misconduct}} frequently has extraterritorial consequences. Terrorist attacks, toxic pollution, {{civil rights}} violations, and other intentional torts can cause harm within a state despite originating outside the state. Those harms raise a vexing constitutional question: when do the local effects of <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> authorize personal jurisdiction over a defendant whose conduct occurred outside the forum? The answer has several significant implications. Granting or denying jurisdiction allocates power between {{states in a}} way that can support or undermine regulatory interests, imposes burdens on the parties that can impede access to justice, and alters risk assessments that shape both socially desirable and socially destructive behavior. The jurisdictional dilemma posed by the in-state effects of out-of-state conduct is timeless and timely. It is timeless because it has arisen in thousands of cases and is an unavoidable feature of a federal system that allocates judicial power between fifty coequal states. It is timely because the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Walden v. Fiore directly addressed effects jurisdiction {{for the first time since}} 1984. This Article critiques Walden and proposes a new approach to the broader constitutional question by focusing on five conclusions. First, it illustrates how Walden relies on a distinction between a defendant’s contacts with the forum state and a defendant’s contacts with the forum’s residents. Second, it critiques the forum/resident distinction as imprecise, misleading, and a revival of the formality that plagued nineteenth-century personal jurisdiction jurisprudence. It also offers a new account of Chief Justice Stone’s reasoning in International Shoe, a case about enforcing taxes, by comparing Shoe to Stone’s strikingly similar opinion in a case about imposing taxes. The comparison highlights Shoe’s hostility toward the sort of formality that animates Walden. Third, it contends that lower courts might salvage the Court’s emphasis on forum contacts by focusing on the defendant’s contacts with the forum’s law, in effect merging constitutional limits on the state’s legislative and judicial power. Fourth, it suggests that state regulatory interests are more important than commonly recognized when local effects are severe, such as an Ebola quarantine. Fifth, it proposes a new approach to analyzing jurisdiction by considering whether actors who commit intentional torts without a geographic focal point assume the risk of being sued wherever harm occurs. These conclusions suggest that Walden’s reasoning would be misleading if read literally and a contextually. The opinion leaves more room for exercising jurisdiction in effects cases than its dismissive veneer implies...|$|E
40|$|With {{the number}} of {{criminal}} defendants exonerated by DNA evidence nearing the two hundred mark, and with multiple states flirting with death penalty moratoriums in part to avoid killing the innocent, we appear to stand at a milestone in our treatment of claims by criminal defendants {{that they have been}} wrongly convicted. Some have declared the dawn of a new movement to support claims of innocence. Others have gone so far to call the movement a revolution. Regardless of what we call this burgeoning movement-slash-revolution, it is increasingly attempting to fold in the prosecutors who have traditionally been depicted as part of the wrongful conviction problem, rather than its solution. Traditionally, prosecutorial decision making has been studied through a lens of fault, blame, and <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing.</b> Consistent with this lens, those who have studied the downsides of broad prosecutorial discretion have blamed bad prosecutorial decisions on overzealousness, flawed cultural and individual values, and a lack of moral courage. The collective impact of this fault-based narrative is the depiction of prosecutors as dogmatic adversaries of innocence, wholly abandoning their ethical obligations as neutral advocates of justice. In contrast, much of the narrative recently emerging from the growing innocence movement appears focused on persuading prosecutors of their importance in this new movement, not as adversaries, but as equal partners in the prevention of wrongful convictions. My goal in this Essay is to suggest that reforms framed around a cognitive understanding of prosecutorial decision making present an opportunity for prosecutors themselves to counter the traditional fault-based narrative and to become partners in the emerging movement to prevent wrongful convictions. That goal turns out to be both modest and audacious. My goal is modest because, while some reform proposals are sweeping, controversial, and either impractical or cumbersome to initiate, the focus of this Essay will be on more moderate proposals that should be relatively uncontroversial and whose implementation rests entirely within the province of prosecutors, either as individual practices or as institutional policies. However, by focusing on modest, prosecutor-initiated reforms, the Essay flirts with the bold by throwing down a challenge to prosecutors actually to pursue these strategies. If prosecutors hold the key to moderate but meaningful reform and yet do nothing, I suggest, the innocence movement will inevitably - and justifiably - retreat from a model of cooperation and return entirely to fault-based explanations for wrongful convictions and their accompanying reforms.

The first trend is toward raising the standards of probity and veridicality in contractual relations toward greater accountability and liability on market actors operating outside traditional bounds.

This trend promises to avert injury, achieve efficiency, and seems to accord with society 2 ̆ 7 s evolving notions of fairness. The second trend, exemplified in Teers, counters the first. Because humans are innately self-interested, entrepreneurs (and rascals) have devised techniques to avoid these new levels and kinds of exposure to potential liability for non-disclosure and to non-parties. They have employed market and contract strategies that purport to shift to the other party the onus of uncovering the truth [...] which might be buried under layers of misrepresentations and that limit non-parties 2 ̆ 7 right to rely on contract promises. The effect is to enable a market actor to contract away liability for <b>intentional</b> <b>wrongdoing</b> by the simple expedients of “as is” and “disclaimer-of-reliance” clauses [...] the result in Teers. This is troubling {{in a number of}} respects. First, the clauses undercut the fundamental character of enforceable contracts being the product of free will. Indeed, the first requirement of contract formation is a meeting of minds. Fraud, ostensibly camouflaged by disclaimers, negates the unknowing party 2 ̆ 7 s free will. Second, such liability-avoidance techniques, although ostensibly consistent with the contracting parties 2 ̆ 7 free will, disturb the markets because of the externalities. Absent the truth about the quality or condition of the property, buyers enter into transactions, or pay too much for property unsuitable, or useless, for its intended purpose. Undisclosed defects present the potential for injury to third parties. A buyer 2 ̆ 7 s costs of inspection and discovery are greater than a seller 2 ̆ 7 s costs of disclosure. Lastly, the exploitative use of these clauses disturbs our sensibilities, offends the law 2 ̆ 7 s conscience, and debases not just the parties, but society at large. Courts 2 ̆ 7 responses to these opportunistic maneuvers have been disparate. Some courts enforce the clauses without much hesitation, focusing on the venerable values of freedom and certainty of contract, chastising buyers for their gullibility. Others categorically outlaw the clauses, expressing consternation at conduct that seems abjectly fraudulent and exploitative. Yet others appear to be inclined to uphold agreements that are freely entered into, although these courts take a case-by-case approach, making fine distinctions based on subtleties in the clause 2 ̆ 7 s language, which might allow an injured party relief. These trends must be examined in context, historical and contemporary, to determine whether they reveal a rational response to the self-interested choices of contract participants and whether these responses must be bolstered to ensure that responsibility for unrealized expectations or harm is fairly allocated among the parties. In the end, this Article proposes that disclaimer-of-reliance clauses should be presumptively unenforceable, as they offend current market morality and public policy. Part II will trace the evolution of thought on market transactions and contracting. Part III discusses the shift in thinking about contract. Part IV reviews limits on contracting imposed by law and policy. Part V discusses the imperative of the law 2 ̆ 7 s conscience, outlining a framework for evaluating disclaimer-of-reliance clauses. This Article ends with conclusions and comments on how legal relations have, and must, change in the interests of fairness and efficiency in real estate markets...|$|E
