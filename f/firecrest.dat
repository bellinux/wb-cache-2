5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan <b>firecrest</b> (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of <b>firecrest,</b> but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the <b>firecrest.</b> The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E
5|$|The typical contact {{call of the}} {{goldcrest}} is a thin, high-pitched zee {{given at}} intervals of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough {{than that of the}} <b>firecrest.</b> The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee. The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common <b>firecrest,</b> but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common <b>firecrest</b> are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's Firebrand strike fighter {{to be far}} from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's trailing edge, looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The <b>Firecrest</b> had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} gas turbine engines, and while Blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the <b>Firecrest,</b> (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E
50|$|Pulborough Brooks {{is known}} for its birds. <b>Firecrests,</b> chiffchaffs, little ringed plovers are all notable species.|$|R
50|$|This site {{is mainly}} {{semi-natural}} vegetation, with has extensive areas of woodland, grass and scrub. There are {{many species of}} breeding birds, including some which are rare nationally, such as <b>firecrests.</b> Other species which are locally rare are redstart, nightingale and wood warbler. There {{are a number of}} small ponds which support populations of amphibians and invertebrates.|$|R
25|$|A Spanish study {{suggests}} that forest fragmentation adversely affects the numbers of short-toed treecreepers present, as {{is also the case}} with the common treecreeper. Species that depend on relatively scarce resources, such as tree trunks, only occupy the larger forests, whereas those such as tits and common <b>firecrests</b> that exploit abundant, ubiquitous resources are distributed uniformly through woodlands of all sizes.|$|R
5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the <b>Firecrest</b> was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better view from the cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the <b>Firecrest</b> was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
5|$|This kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has {{two white}} wingbars. It has a plain face {{contrasting}} black irises and a bright head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is displayed during breeding. It superficially resembles the <b>firecrest,</b> which largely shares its European range, but the latter's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the Canary Islands are now separated into two subspecies of the goldcrest, but were formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the common <b>firecrest</b> or a separate species, Regulus teneriffae.|$|E
5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{goldcrest}} taxa are {{found on the}} Atlantic islands of Macaronesia. Birds on the Canary Islands are ancient colonists, whereas those on The Azores are of more recent origin. There are no goldcrests on Madeira, where the Madeira <b>firecrest</b> is the only Regulus species.|$|E
5000|$|Coombe Hill has 3 {{different}} types of land including acid heathland, chalk grassland and deciduous woodland. It is home to much interesting wildlife [...] - [...] including red kites, yellowhammers and <b>firecrests.</b> It also holds the habitat to many rare plants such as heather, orchids and the Chiltern gentian. Due to its rarity the acid moorland is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).|$|R
50|$|Young common <b>firecrests</b> are fed almost {{exclusively}} with springtails; larger food items are not accepted, and spiders are occasionally regurgitated. From {{the fifth day}} onwards, the nestling diet includes aphids and a high amount of snail shells, the latter being needed for bone growth. After the second week, the food includes larger moths and caterpillars, as well as various arthropods typically avoided by adults, such as harvestmen, earwigs, and centipedes.|$|R
50|$|The Madeira <b>firecrest's</b> range {{consists}} of a single island, on which {{it appears to be}} fairly common to very common, although its population has not been evaluated. It is therefore classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. It may be declining because of fragmentation and loss of native forest habitat, but its ability to occupy plantations of some of the non-native tree species has ameliorated this factor to some extent.|$|R
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the <b>firecrest</b> to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some <b>firecrest</b> phrases in his song.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} <b>firecrest</b> or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common <b>firecrest</b> has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male <b>firecrest,</b> the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5000|$|Morris was classically {{trained on}} piano. He formed {{a rock and}} roll group called the <b>Firecrests</b> while a student at Birkenhead School, and served as lead vocalist; they {{recorded}} the songs [...] "That'll Be the Day", [...] "I Knew From the Start", and [...] "Party", but were strictly a local attraction. After leaving University early, Morris was discovered by impresario Larry Parnes while working and singing at the 2i's Coffee Bar in London. Parnes gave him the stage name Lance Fortune, a name he had previously considered for another artist he signed in 1959, Georgie Fame. The newly christened Fortune signed to Pye Records as a solo artist, and released four singles, two of which became hits in the UK Singles Chart in 1960. [...] "Be Mine" [...] reached No. 4, whilst the follow-up, [...] "This Love I Have For You" [...] was a Top 30 hit.|$|R
60|$|What I {{have just}} said, that the {{peculiar}} instinct and deceptive action {{we have been}} considering is made and kept bright by being bathed in blood, applies to all instinctive acts that tend {{to the preservation of}} life, both of the individual and species. Necessarily so, seeing that, for one thing, instincts can only arise and grow to perfection in order to meet cases which commonly occur {{in the life of a}} species. The instinct is not prophetic and does not meet rare or extraordinary situations. Unless intelligence or some higher faculty comes in to supplement or to take the place of instinctive action then the creature must perish on account of the limitation of instinct. Again, the higher and more complete the instinct the more perilous it is, seeing that its efficiency depends on the absolutely perfect health and balance of all the faculties and the entire organism. Thus, the higher instinctive faculty and action of birds for the preservation of the species, that of migration, is undoubtedly the most dangerous of all. It is so perfect that by means of this faculty millions and myriads of birds of an immense variety of species from cranes, swans, and geese down to minute goldcrests and <b>firecrests</b> and the smallest feeble-winged-leaf warblers, are able to inhabit and to distribute themselves evenly over all the temperate and cold regions of the earth, and even nearer the pole: and in all these regions they rear their young and spend several months each year, where they would inevitably perish from cold and lack of food if they stayed on to meet the winter. We can best realize the perfection of this instinct when we consider that all these migrants, including the young which have never hitherto strayed beyond the small area of their home where every tree and bush and spring and rock is familiar to them, rush suddenly away as if blown by a wind to unknown lands and continents beyond the seas to a distance of from a thousand to six or seven thousand miles; that after long months spent in those distant places, which in turn have grown familiar to them, they return again to their natal place, not in a direct but ofttimes by a devious route, now north, now north-east, now east or west, keeping to the least perilous lines and crossing the seas where they are narrowest. Thus, when the returning multitude recrosses the Channel into England, coming by way of France and Spain from north or south or mid-Africa and from Asia, they at once proceed to disperse over the entire country from Land's End to Thurso and the northernmost islands of Scotland, until every wood and hill and moor and thicket and stream and every village and field and hedgerow and farmhouse has its own feathered people back in their old places. But they do not return in their old force. They had increased to twice or three times their original numbers when they left us, and as a result of that great adventure a half or two-thirds of the vast army has perished.|$|R
5|$|There {{are a few}} Pleistocene (2.6million to 12,000years BP) {{records from}} Europe of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct Regulus is a left ulna from 2.6–1.95mya in Bulgaria, which was {{identified}} as belonging to an extinct species, Regulus bulgaricus. The goldcrest lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common <b>firecrest</b> in the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and <b>firecrest</b> are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and <b>firecrest</b> are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} has a {{huge range}} in Eurasia, breeding from Macaronesia to Japan. It is common in middle and northern temperate and boreal latitudes of Europe, between the [...] July isotherms, and thus predominantly in cooler climates than the <b>firecrest.</b> Further east it occurs discontinuously through southern Siberia to Sakhalin and Japan, in the Tian Shan mountains, northern Iran, and from the Himalayas east to central China.|$|E
500|$|Birds {{from the}} Canary Islands are {{particularly}} distinctive having a black forehead, pink-buff underparts and a darker closed wing, {{and have been}} sometimes treated either as a subspecies of the common <b>firecrest</b> or as a different Regulus species altogether. They were sometimes called the Tenerife goldcrest, no matter which of the islands they lived on; however, a 2006 study of the vocalisations of these birds indicate that they actually comprise two subspecies of the goldcrest that are separable on voice; R. r. teneriffae occurring on Tenerife and the newly described subspecies, R. r. ellenthalerae, the western Canary Islands goldcrest, occurring on the smaller islands of La Palma and El Hierro.|$|E
500|$|The goldcrest's nest is a well-insulated {{cup-shaped}} structure {{built in}} three layers. The nest's outer layer {{is made from}} moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the cobwebs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, which is lined by an inner layer of feathers and hair. The nest is larger, shallower and less compact {{than that of the}} <b>firecrest,</b> with an internal diameter of about , and is constructed by both sexes, although the female does most of the work. It is often suspended from a hanging branch, usually at no great height, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from [...] One pair built their nest just [...] above that of a sparrowhawk.|$|E
500|$|The Blackburn B-48 <b>Firecrest,</b> {{given the}} SBAC {{designation}} YA.1, was a single-engine naval strike fighter built by Blackburn Aircraft for service with the British Fleet Air Arm during World War II. It was a {{development of the}} troubled Firebrand, designed to Air Ministry Specification S.28/43, for an improved aircraft more suited to carrier operations. Three prototypes were ordered with the company designation of B-48 and the informal name of [...] "Firecrest", but only two of them actually flew. The development of the aircraft was prolonged by significant design changes and slow deliveries of components, but the determination by the Ministry of Supply in 1946 that the airframe {{did not meet the}} requirements for a strike fighter doomed the aircraft. Construction of two of the prototypes was continued to gain flight-test data and the third was allocated to strength testing. The two flying aircraft were sold back to Blackburn in 1950 for disposal and the other aircraft survived until 1952.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) and Pliny (23–79 AD) both {{wrote about}} the legend of a contest among the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded {{to the one that}} could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird that had hidden under the eagle's tail {{feathers}} emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title. Following from this legend, in much European folklore the wren has been described as the [...] "king of the birds" [...] or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the Regulus species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and <b>firecrest</b> making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles, and, because of the legend's reference to the [...] "smallest of birds" [...] becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren. The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren ( [...] , [...] "king") and the crests ( [...] , [...] "kinglet"). In English, the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet's old name of [...] "gold-crested wren".|$|E
500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the <b>Firecrest</b> was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of anhedral and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|E
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides {{of branches}} and leaves. This {{is in contrast}} to the common <b>firecrest,</b> which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of common firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep furrows in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother surface. The goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the common chiffchaff, and {{there is some evidence that}} high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5million breeding pairs of goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4million breeding pairs of chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other Phylloscopus warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the chiffchaff is found within [...] of the forest edge, with the goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the chiffchaff subspecies Phylloscopus collybita abietinus in parts of Finland is due to competition with the willow warbler and goldcrest.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{specialization}} {{within a}} habitat {{is associated with}} behaviors and morphological adaptations (physical traits of size and shape). Tiny birds are lightweight enough to hang onto the ends of twigs and pluck small prey; the goldcrest of Europe and its counterpart the golden-crowned kinglet of North America exhibit this feeding style. The related common <b>firecrest</b> is very similar in size and shape, but slightly bulkier, and has less of a tendency to glean along twigs {{and more of a}} habit of flying from perch to perch. Having a very small bill seems to be good for taking tiny prey from the surfaces of leaves, and small-billed birds such as the blue tit forage in broad-leafed woodlands. The long-billed gnatwren and speckled spinetail of Central and South America, and the ashy tailorbird and striped tit-babbler of South Asia, show a preference for gleaning in tangles of vines. [...] The ash-browed spinetail of South America specializes in gleaning among epiphytes on moss-covered tree branches. Many hummingbirds take small insects from flowers while probing for nectar, and some species glean actively among bark and leaves. The Puerto Rican emerald is one such hummingbird. Found only on the island of Puerto Rico, the female subsists on insects and spiders, while the male has a typical hummingbird diet of nectar. [...] Hummingbirds and other gleaners are also sometimes attracted to the sap wells created by sapsuckers. [...] Sapsuckers, which are in the woodpecker family, drill small holes in living tree branches to get the sap flowing. The sap and the insects it attracts are then consumed, and rufous hummingbirds have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source. Clusters of dead leaves also often harbor invertebrate prey, and the Bewick's wren and worm-eating warbler of North America have long bills well-suited for probing them, as do certain Asian babblers, such as the rusty-cheeked scimitar-babbler. In Central and South America, foliage-gleaners such as the red-faced spinetail and buff-throated foliage-gleaner are also examples of birds that glean clusters of dead leaves.|$|E

50|$|The {{song of the}} Mediterranean {{subspecies}} {{of common}} <b>firecrest,</b> R. i. balearicus, {{is very similar to}} that of the nominate form, but one factor in separating the Madeiran <b>firecrest</b> from common <b>firecrest</b> is that the island bird's song is divided into three phrases, two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls. Its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more harmonics than those of the continental subspecies. Male goldcrests and Madeiran firecrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common <b>firecrest,</b> but the reverse is apparently not true, because the songs of the common <b>firecrest</b> are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Firecrest</b> {{technology}} was developed from Zipp’s earlier “toroidal” rim shapes. These were designed with a bulge {{in the rim}} cross-section to reduce turbulence behind the tire {{at the leading edge}} of the wheel. <b>Firecrest</b> essentially inverts this shape, placing {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil along the interior of the rim (towards the hub). As a result, Zipp claims that <b>Firecrest</b> rims show improved aerodynamic performance at all points around the wheel, combined with improved stability in crosswinds. A product review on the Cyclingnews website reported, “the <b>Firecrest</b> aero profile is noticeably fast at cruising speed” and that a <b>Firecrest</b> wheelset “offers handling stability in crosswinds unmatched by other aero wheels we've used.” ...|$|E
50|$|Several forms {{have only}} {{recently}} had their status clarified. The Madeira <b>firecrest</b> was formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies, R. i. madeirensis, of the common <b>firecrest</b> R. ignicapillus. A phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b gene showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level from the <b>firecrest</b> nominate subspecies R. i. ignicapillus. Cytochrome b gene divergence between the Madeira <b>firecrest</b> and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised Regulus species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the golden-crowned kinglet. The split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003, but some authorities, like Clements, have not yet recognised the new species. The golden-crowned kinglet is similar in appearance to the common <b>firecrest</b> and has been considered to be its New World equivalent, but it is actually closer to the goldcrest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Firecrest</b> was {{transferred}} to Japan, 15 March 1955 as Etajima (MSC-656). She was returned to U. S. custody in 1967 and struck from the Naval Register, 31 March 1967. <b>Firecrest</b> was disposed of as a target in August 1969.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan <b>firecrest</b> (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much debate.
