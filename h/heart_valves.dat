5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|When {{initiating}} warfarin therapy ("warfarinization"), {{the doctor}} will decide how strong the anticoagulant therapy needs to be. The target INR {{level varies from}} case to case depending on the clinical indicators, but tends to be 2–3 in most conditions. In particular, target INR may be 2.5–3.5 (or even 3.0–4.5) in patients {{with one or more}} mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E
40|$|A <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{replacement}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} technically difficult cardiac surgeries. For the patient, it means a mental and physical health intervention. <b>Heart</b> <b>valve</b> surgery is currently the second most common cardiac surgery - accounting for up to 20 % of the total number of cardiac surgeries. The goals and objectives of a <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement are to improve patients' quality of life and their medical prognosis. The <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement is carried out only in cases when we cannot perform the <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> plastic surgery and thereby replace the entire <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> with an artificial one. <b>Heart</b> <b>valve</b> prosthetics can be mechanical - patients with this kind of prosthetics are then warfarinized for life or they can also be made of biological material (bioprosthetics). Patients with bioprostehtics require only a three month long anticoagulant therapy. Temporary postoperative complications may occur such as dyspnoea, gastric and intestinal atony or aggravation of pulmonary functions. Among the rarer complications are rhythm disorders, thrombosis of prosthetic <b>heart</b> <b>valve,</b> and last but not least infective endocarditis. The patients, after the <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, are at a greater risk of complications, therefore they are obliged to always have their patient at risk of infection endocarditis card with them (see appendix 4). After the operation the patients are informed about the lifestyle changes they are to follow within their daily routine, the information is delivered by doctors and nurses. The task of the nurses is to inform the patient about the lifestyle changes together with doctors. Good understanding and observance of these lifestyle changes help to improve patients' life after the <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. This bachelor thesis is divided into an empirical and theoretical part. The theoretical part focussing on the problems connected with the <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, valvular imperfections, perioperative nursing, patients' lifestyle changes and their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Bioengineering {{of living}} <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{substitute}} suitable for implantation into pediatric patients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> diseases is an unsolved challenge in cardiovascular tissue engineering. In {{order to identify}} desirable material properties of such construct, the biomechanical, histological, histochemical and biochemical properties of fetal, perinatal and adult porcine <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets have been systematically investigated. It have been shown that increasing in <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> stiffness during ontogenesis correlates with accumulation of collagen type 1 and increasing level of collagen cross-linking. Tissue spheroids biofabricated from human fat tissue derived stem cells have been employed to engineer leaflet-like construct on compliant electrospun scaffold using self-assembly or tissue fusion approach. Incubation of tissue engineered <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet construct with TGFß as well as periostin transfection significantly increased stiffness of tissue engineered <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet. These data demonstrated that the <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> can be biofabricated by tissue fusion or self-assembly of closely placed tissue spheroids and that chemically and genetically induced accelerated tissue maturation and collagen deposition can enhance mechanical properties of tissue engineered leaflet. Further optimization of accelerated tissue maturation technologies could eventually lead to development of living autologous human <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> tissue engineered construct with natural- like biomechanical properties suitable for pediatric cardiac patients...|$|R
40|$|Problems of clients` knowledgeability of {{postoperative}} {{and follow-up}} {{care in the}} case of <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute. <b>Heart</b> <b>valve</b> defects are unpredictable diseases that can exist without any symptoms for a long time. <b>Heart</b> <b>valve</b> operations comprise the most frequent group second to by-pass operations and nearly a half of all heart-surgical interventions with adult clients. The aim of the thesis was to find out about clients` knowledgeability of postoperative and follow-up care {{in the case of}} <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute, and what kind of information is needed to achieve by the clients from nurses; what educational materials are used to inform the clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute and also to find out who are the clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute informed by. Two hypotheses were predefined: 1 [...] Clients are satisfied with the provided information about postoperative and follow-up care in the case of <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute; 2 [...] Clients are informed about postoperative and follow-up care in the case of <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute. Three research inquiries were formed: 1 [...] Which is the most frequent information needed by clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute from nurses? 2 [...] What kind of education is used for clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute? 3 [...] Who are the clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute informed by? Collecting data was performed using the combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative ones were performed as questioning using the technique of a questionnaire, while the qualitative methods used the technique of a semi-standard dialogue. The research sample were the clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute hospitalised in the cardiosurgical departments of the teaching hospitals in Motol, in Plzeň, in the Hospital České Budějovice, a joint-stock company, and nurses working in those departments. 80 questionnaires for clients were distributed, 74 of them were filled in and returned. Ten nurses were addressed. The above-mentioned four aims were fulfilled. Hypotheses H 1 and H 2 were confirmed. The nurses answered the research inquiries 1, 2 and 3; the answers were analysed and the analyses were used for forming the hypotheses: 1. The most frequent information needed by clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute from nurses are about moving activity, pain, physiotherapy, connection to instruments, possible complications, about housework, possible staying in spa, return to the occupation, principle of taking Warfarin, about regullary cardiology control. 2. The clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute are educated by discussion and by the informational brochure. 3. The clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute are educated by the doctor and the nurse. The results of this thesis will be submitted to the managements of the above mentioned hospitals as material to consider amending the informational brochure for the clients so that they would get the missing information about postoperative and follow-up care in the case of <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute. I suppose that educations efficiency and forknowledge of the clients with <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> substitute could be improved in this way...|$|R

He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> He was 93. Ford died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{skeleton}} is made {{of dense}} connective tissue and this gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{replacement}} {{represents the}} most common surgical therapy for end-stage valvular heart diseases. A major drawback all contemporary <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacements {{have in common is}} the lack of growth, repair, and remodeling capabilities. To overcome these limitations, the emerging field of tissue engineering is focusing on the in vitro generation of functional, living <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacements. The basic approach uses starter matrices of either decellularized xenogeneic or biopolymeric materials configured {{in the shape of the}} <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> and subsequent cell seeding. Moreover, in vitro strategies using mechanical loading in bioreactor systems have been developed to improve tissue maturation. This chapter gives a short overview of the current concepts and provides detailed methods for in vitro <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> tissue engineering...|$|R

5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{normally}} allows {{blood to}} flow {{in only one}} direction through the <b>heart.</b> The four <b>valves</b> commonly represented in a mammalian heart determine the pathway of blood flow through the <b>heart.</b> A <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> opens or closes incumbent on differential blood pressure on each side.|$|R
50|$|First Artificial <b>Heart</b> <b>Valve</b> and Implant Surgery {{was created}} by Charles Hufnagel MD, {{professor}} of experimental surgery. In 1960, Hufnagel introduced the first artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> and successfully performed the implantation surgery the following year.|$|R
40|$|Aortic <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{disease is}} a growing health problem and a tissue-engineered aortic <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> could be a {{promising}} therapy. In this paper, clecellularized porcine aortic <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets are used as scaffolds and loaded with growth factor and heparin via layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition (LbL technique) with the final purpose to stimulate and control cellular processes. Binding and subsequent release of heparin and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) from aortic valve leaflets were assessed qualitatively by immunohistochemistry and quantitatively by radioactive labeling methods. It was observed that the amount of heparin and bFGF bound to aortic <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets was directly proportional to the concentration of heparin and bFGF in the incubation medium. Release of heparin and bFGF from the decellularized <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets at physiological conditions was sustained over 4 days while preserving the biological activity of the released growth factor...|$|R
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to <b>heart</b> <b>valves,</b> which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valves,</b> deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Heart is {{a complex}} {{structure}} unit which pumps the blood throughout the body at a relevant high fluid velocity and pressure. The <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet ensures the unidirectional flow of blood during a complete cardiac cycle. Many researches study on the structure and working principle of heart using both experimental and numerical principles and result a strong and value findings. Undeniable, experimental modeling of <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet gives a better understanding toward heart function and thus enhances the development in biomechanics as well as artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valve.</b> This paper provided the detail review about the development in modeling of heart structure and <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet experiments with respect to its method, material used and limitations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract.

The analysis results show that suture density has a significant effect to the stress state of valve, which may lead not only to different stress peak values, but also to different stress distributions. High or low density suture isn’t appropriate for long-term durability of the bioprosthetic <b>heart</b> <b>valve.</b> Suture density tests are needed to perform on the valves to find satisfactory suture density for better mechanical properties of the bioprosthetic <b>heart</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{emotional}} distractions, {{during the summer of}} 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40°C (104°F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to which sufferers from defective <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> were particularly prone, and for which the survival rate in pre-antibiotic days was almost zero. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he died on 18 May.|$|E

25|$|Valves are {{integral}} to the normal physiological functioning of the human heart.
