2500|$|McCay {{experimented with}} {{the form of}} the comics page, its timing and pacing, {{the size and shape of}} its panels, perspective, and {{architectural}} and other detail. [...] From the second installment, McCay had the panel sizes and layouts conform to the action in the strip: as a forest of mushrooms grew, so did the panels, and the panels shrank as the mushrooms collapsed on Nemo. [...] In an early Thanksgiving episode, the focal action of a <b>giant</b> <b>turkey</b> gobbling Nemo's house receives an enormous circular panel in the center of the page. [...] McCay also accommodated a sense of proportion with panel size and shape, showing elephants and dragons at a scale the reader could feel in proportion to the regular characters. [...] Narrative pacing McCay controlled through variation or repetition, as with equally-sized panels whose repeated layouts and minute differences in movement conveyed a feeling of buildup to some climactic action.|$|E

Herschell agrees to participate in a test by eating some of the turkey meat; to convince him to agree, the scientists bribe him with more marijuana. After eating the whole turkey, he passes out on the farm. He suffers a seizure, and the two scientists later find him, and, worried about being investigated about the possible death of Herschell, they dump his body in the woodlands. But Herschell is not deadâ€”he wakes up to find he has a <b>giant</b> <b>turkey's</b> head in place of his own head. He is also still addicted to drugs, but, instead of smoking marijuana, he now craves the blood of other addicts.|$|R

5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, fossil {{footprints}} are this park's main attraction. They were formed during the Early Jurassic period (approximately 200 million years ago) when {{what is now}} the Connecticut River Valley was a subtropical region filled with lakes and swamps. Bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs up to 20 ft long left footprints on the ancient mudflats. The area was acclaimed by 19th century paleontologists for its abundance of fossil specimens, dinosaur tracks in particular, and the reservation is popular with the ichnologists who study them. This area was first studied by Edward Hitchcock, the Amherst College professor who advanced the revolutionary notion that rather than being cold-blooded reptiles, dinosaurs were more like a sort of [...] "reptilian bird." [...] In the 1930s, a Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper poked fun at this notion by referring to the animals that left the fossilized footprints as [...] "the <b>Giant</b> <b>Turkeys</b> of Prof. Hitchcock." ...|$|R

Here I present predictions of stellar models computed with the code STAREVOL including thermohaline mixing together with rotational mixing.

500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the engine, knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as <b>giant</b> <b>turkeys,</b> who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed. Suddenly, they hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown.|$|R
