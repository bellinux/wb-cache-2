Argon, Copper and Krypton ions of 50 and 100 keV were implanted to nominal doses of 10 11 ions cm - 2 both {{at room temperature}} and at liquid helium temperature. The damage induced at low temperature was observed in-situ and after subsequent warming to room temperature. The collapse of collision cascades to vacancy dislocation loops was observed to occur with moderately high probability under all irradiation conditions at low temperature, with no subsequent {{increase in the number}} of loops on warming. Comparison of the collapsed fraction of cascades at low temperature with that produced by room temperature irradiation revealed that the collapse process is more efficient in the latter case. An increase in collapse probability with ion mass was also observed, although no dependence on ion energy was found over the range investigated. Quantitative analysis of the disordered zones which result in ordered Cu 3 Au at individual cascade sites revealed that cascades which had collapsed to loops generally produced larger disordered zones. Additionally, increases in <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> size with ion mass, ion energy and irradiation temperature were identified. The observation that <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> sizes exceed the theoretically predicted cascade dimensions for the case of the highest energy density in this study (50 keV Kr) is interpreted as evidence for leakage of energy from the cascade region to the surrounding lattice. A model is proposed which attributes the observed cascade collapse behaviour to vacancy migration during the cooling of the cascade region being systematically directed toward its centre, and accounts for the observed disordered zones in terms of extensive atomic rearrangement during the cooling. The major factors identified as controlling this vacancy and atomic motion are the initial spatial distribution of energy and vacancies within the region, and the rate at which the region cools. </p...|$|E
40|$|Managing {{risks and}} {{uncertainty}} are {{terms that are}} used interchangeably by project teams. Research on project procurement shows unexpected events in project delivery are often distinguished by these terms. This raises questions concerning how collaboration and coping ability help deal with inherent uncertainty and ambiguity. Using Weick&# 039;s sense-making process of reflection and re-analysis a novel methodological approach was developed. A project database and contemporary literature was mined using the perspective of Snowden&# 039;s Cynefin ambiguity framework. Two industry sourced examples provided support to the arguments made. The findings suggest that collaboration may lead to reduced people and process ambiguities and where ambiguity is revealed in projects it is often unrecognised, residing in a <b>disordered</b> <b>zone.</b> Observing ambiguity in this way provides {{a better understanding of}} ambiguity and advanced coping strategies. Having these perspectives is useful for identifying ambiguity where it may otherwise be missed or subsumed into risk and uncertainty...|$|E

The normalised number density (yield) of <b>disordered</b> <b>zones</b> for 300 keV Ni+ irradiation showed a sharp fall between T-irr = 373 K and 573 K. For 50 keV Ni+ irradiation there was a similar fall between 573 K and 673 K. The mean diameters of the <b>disordered</b> <b>zones</b> produced by 300 keV Ni+ ions decreased by about 2 nm between room temperature and 573 K, and there was a tendency for larger zones to become more regular in shape. For 50 keV Ta+ ions, a similar trend was observed between 573 K and 873 K. An annealing experiment confirmed that <b>disordered</b> <b>zones</b> produced at lower temperatures were stable up to a temperature of about 673 K, showing that these trends cannot be due to thermal annealing of <b>disordered</b> <b>zones.</b> The experimental results are consistent with an increased tendency for reordering at the peripheries of <b>disordered</b> <b>zones,</b> due to the increased lifetimes of thermal spikes at higher irradiation temperatures...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we perform {{simulation}} and modeling {{studies of the}} formation of patterning of order in ordered alloys under ion irradiation. Dense displacement cascades produced by irradiation with energetic particles lead to the formation of <b>disordered</b> <b>zones</b> in chemically ordered alloys. Under sustained irradiation, the competition between irradiation-introduced disordering and thermal ordering may drive the system into various steady states of order. Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are employed to identify these steady states in model alloys that form L 12 or L 10 ordered phases at equilibrium. Besides the expected long-range order (LRO) and disordered steady states, a new state, comprised of well ordered domains of finite size, is observed. We refer to this new steady state as a state of patterning of order. This steady-state is identified by direct visualizations of the configurations, and by rescaling the intensities of the structure factor. The patterning state becomes stable only when the <b>disordered</b> <b>zones</b> exceed a threshold size. Above this threshold size, reordering of cascade-induced <b>disordered</b> <b>zones</b> proceeds in two stages: new antiphase domains form first, and then shrink to the benefit of the matrix. This two-stage reordering is at the origin of the dynamical stabilization of patterns of order...|$|R
40|$|The main {{parameters}} {{influencing the}} mechanical performance of glass - ceramic materials are {{the shape and}} mean size of the ceramic phase, i. e. the crystalline inclusions. The aim of the present work is twofold: first, to study {{the effect of the}} above parameters on the modes of fracture in two kinds of glass ceramic materials by the use of the static microindentation technique; second, to interpret the experimental results by the application of a simple physical model. It was found that reduction in the size of granularly shaped crystallite inclusions or reduction of the width of needle- like crystalline inclusions results in an increase of the extent of crack propagation, while the fracture mode shifts from intergranular to transgranular. These observations were successfully interpreted in terms of energetic arguments related {{to the size of the}} crystalline inclusions with respect to the width of a <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> acting as an interface between them and the amorphous matrix...|$|E
40|$|Spatially {{isolated}} disordered zones {{have been}} produced in silicon by irradiating with Xe+ ions in situ in a transmission electron microscope to fluences {{in the range of}} 1011 to 1012 ions cm− 2. At these levels of fluence, the zones are clearly visible with minimal overlap with typical effective radii of the order of 1 nm. Studies of the isochronal recrystallization of zones with similar starting radii have shown that although most zones behave as expected and immediately begin to reduce their effective radius, in a small number of cases, some of the zones increase in size following an isochronal recrystallization step. Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations have indicated that this behaviour may result when a high density of point defects surrounds an amorphous core. Upon recrystallization, the system relaxes to a configuration which can give rise to an increase in volume of the <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> of up to 50 %. The kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations have shown that the defect most likely to be responsible for this anomalous growth is the interstitial-vacancy (IV) pair and the configuration of the IV pairs around an amorphous zone has a strong influence on the maximum re-growth of the zon...|$|E
40|$|Nickel-aluminium {{intermetallics}} constitute interesting {{systems for}} the study of irradiation-induced phase transformations (order → disorder, amorphization) and production of defects. Irradiation of ordered intermetallics may induce disorder or amorphization depending on the projectile characteristics, irradiation conditions and chemical and physical properties of the target. The behavior of the various intermetallic compounds of the nickel-aluminium system with respect to electron and ion irradiation has been extensively studied in the recent past. In more recent years, however, significant interest has driven the motivation for modelling these processes using molecular dynamics computer simulations. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of simulating cascade damage in pure metals and intermetallics and led to the partial corroboration of phenomenological data which has been compiled from a set of experiments. In this frame, and in spite of the numerous efforts previously done, little information has been collected in order to perform a comparative study on the behavior of NiAl and Ni 3 Al under heavy-ion irradiation in a consistent approach. The present study reports on: the synthesis of stoichiometric and ordered intermetallic thin films as proper irradiation media, which has evolved into a subject of substantial complexity. It is remarkable, nevertheless, that very few systems have been studied regarding the microstructure and growth modes of intermetallics on metallic substrates. In this context, the granular-heteroepitaxial inverse Nishiyama-Wassermann (211) [211]B 2 &# 8741; (110) [110]fccand the heteroepitaxial (110) [110]L 12 &# 8741; (110) [110]fcc relationships have been lately demonstrated for NiAl and Ni 3 Al grown onto nickel single-crystals at high temperature, respectively. Inherent to the deposition technique, and at the low substrate temperature regime, is the formation of defect structures and polycrystalline materials which are not the most convenient for post-irradiation microstructure assessment. Therefore, special attention has been given to bulk single-crystals which have been irradiated and prepared in cross-section for transmission electron microscopy observations; the numerical link between previous molecular dynamics results and current transmission electron microscopy image simulation, in order to establish under cascade damage conditions which type of defects are created and how do NiAl and Ni 3 Al intermetallics compare regarding the effect of primary ion energy and damage accumulation. The former has been seen to undergo an amorphous transformation upon a 15 keV-nickel recoil, which has not been registered for the latter. These results have been valuable in order to understand structural differences under cascade damage production and to validate molecular dynamics computer simulations from a microscopic point of view; the microstructure investigation using transmission electron microscopy of heavy-ion irradiated NiAl and Ni 3 Al samples, thus establishing a set of physical parameters (defect visibility, <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> and defect densities, and respective mean sizes) to be directly compared in a self-consistent approach to the results obtained through image simulation of damaged intermetallics. A direct crystalline-to-amorphous transformation has been seen not to occur either at liquid nitrogen or room temperature for the former intermetallic, as predicted from molecular dynamics results. Instead, a defect accumulation driven mechanism should be active. Microstructural evolution under heavy-ion irradiation must be thought {{on the basis of the}} <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> to defect cluster densities ratio, ρ d /ρ c, in order to compare both intermetallics in a self-consistent approach due to different fluences (or doses), and primary ion energies. Being ρ d /ρ c an estimator of irradiation-induced disordering efficiency, it is now arguable that at the high energy regime this ratio decreases with increasing primary ion energy. Aronin's exponential law S = S 0 exp(–εΦ), which is characterized by the initial long-range order value S 0, the dose in dpa Φ, and the disordering efficiency ε, does not explicit any knowledge on the nature of ε. This parameter has been measured for 6 MeV-nickel primary ions in Ni 3 Al, yielding a value in the range of 10. 0 ± 0. 7 /dpa. Further research must be undertaken in order to establish an experimental value for equivalent irradiation conditions in NiAl. The disordering efficiency ε is certainly a function of the <b>disordered</b> <b>zone</b> to defect cluster densities ratio, ε = f (ρ d /ρ c). Further validation of such a relation would be of paramount importance in order to understand irradiation-induced disordering at high primary ion energies and to establish the fact that a less effective disordering process takes place in a regime of dominant subcascade formation...|$|E

The presence of DVs in a dense a-Si:H network results in an anisotropy in the silicon bond-length distribution of the disordered silicon matrix. This anisotropy induces zones of volumetric compressed disordered silicon (larger fraction of shorter than longer bonds in reference to the crystalline lattice) with typical sizes of ~ 0. 8 up to ~ 2 nm.

In the theory of liquid metal melts there still remains a lot of subjects under discussions now.

According to others, the destruction of clusters occurs only close to the boiling temperature of the melt. Besides it is not clear whether a cluster is a ball or convex polyhedron? As a result of high-temperature X-ray studies of liquid metals we have found that the genetic structure of a liquid metal depends on the crystal system of solid metal crystals.

We evaluated the diagnostic ability of isotropic computed tomography (CT) arthrography with radial reformation technique for detection of acetabular labral and articular cartilage disorders, and evaluate those interactions in hip dysplasia. MethodsForty-one hips in 29 patients with hip dysplasia received CT arthrography with isotropic spatial resolution of 0. 5 mm. After processing of multiplanar radial reformation over the whole acetabular circumference, frequencies of labral tear and acetabular cartilage disorder were evaluated at six divided zones of the weight-bearing areas. Of the 41 hips, 20 hips underwent arthroscopic examinations, and sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting labral tear and acetabular cartilage disorder by CT arthrography were calculated using the arthroscopic findings as the standard of reference. ResultsThe sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CT arthrography were 97 %/ 87 %/ 92 % for labral tear and 88 %/ 82 %/ 85 % for acetabular cartilage disorder, respectively, using arthroscopic findings as the reference.

Although the {{mechanisms}} responsible for acute liver failure (ALF) {{have not yet}} been fully elucidated, studies have indicated that intrahepatic macrophage activation {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of ALF through intrahe-patic microcirculatory disorder and consequent parenchymal cell death. Intrahepatic microcirculatory disorder has been demonstrated in animal models using intravital microscopy; however, the limitations of this method include simultane-ously evaluating blood flow and the surrounding pathological changes. Therefore, in this study, we devised a novel method involving tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) -dextran administration for the pathological assessment of hepatic microcirculation. In addition, we aimed to elucidate {{the mechanisms}} through which intrahepatic microcirculatory disorder progresses with relation to activated macrophages. ALF was induced in Wistar rats by exposure to lipopolysaccha-ride and D-galactosamine. Intrahepatic microcirculation and microcirculatory <b>disorder</b> in <b>zone</b> 3 (pericentral zone) of the livers of rats with ALF was observed. Immunohistochemical examinations in conjunction with TRITC-dextran images revealed that the macrophages were mainly distributed in zone 2 (intermediate zone), while cleaved caspase- 3 -positive hepatocytes, pimonidazole and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -α were abundant in zone 3. We also found that 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) 4 -positive cells were predominantly located in the zone 3 parenchyma. The majority of apoptotic hepa-tocytes in zone 3 were co-localized with NOX 4. Our results revealed that the apoptotic cells in zone 3 were a result of hypoxic conditions induced by intrahepatic microcirculatory disorder, and were not induced by activated macrophages.

Melatonin exerts its chronophysiological action in part by acting through specific receptors (MT 1, MT 2) which {{have been identified in}} the plasma membrane of SCN as well as in several neural and non-neural tissues. Both receptors have been cloned and share general features with other G protein linked receptors. Melatonin also exerts direct effects on intracellular proteins such as calmodulin or tubu-lin and has strong free radical scavenger properties which are non-receptor mediated. Within the SCN, melatonin reduces neuronal activity in a time-dependent manner. SCN MT 1 and MT 2 receptors appear to be insensitive during the day, but sensitive at dusk and dawn (MT 2; causes phase shifts) or during early night period (MT 1; decreases neuronal firing rate). Melatonin secreted during nighttime provides enough inertia to resist minor perturbations of the circadian timing system.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics database on Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and urban-rural classifications for 6505 data zones across Scotland. Multiple regression was used to test the association between prescriptions for psychotropic medication for anxiety, depression and psychosis, and type of living environment according to urban-rural classification, controlling for a range of socio-economic factors.

CRSDs include delayed or advanced sleep phase syndromes, non 24 hr sleep/wake rhythm <b>disorder,</b> time <b>zone</b> change syndrome (“jet lag”) and shift work sleep disorder. Disturbances in the circadian phase position of plasma melatonin levels have been found in all these disorders. In addition, co-morbility of severe circadian alterations with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer´disease (AD) has been documented. Although further research involving larger number of patients suffering CRSDs is required, currently there is sufficient evidence to implicate endogenous melatonin as an important mediator in CRSD pathophysiology. Melatonin and its analogs can constitute useful therapeutic tools to treat disturbed sleep-wake rhythms in CRSDs. Melatonin secretion decreases in AD patients and its administration improves sleep efficiency, sundowning and cognitive function. This effect can be particularly important in mild cognitive impairment, an etiologically heterogeneous syndrome characterized by cognitive impairment preceding dementia...|$|R
40|$|Bismuth {{silicate}} micro-crystals with grain {{line structure}} were prepared by sintering method under atmosphere pressure. The samples were characterized for structural and surface morphological properties by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Environmental {{scanning electron microscopy}} (ESEM). The result shows that Bi 4 Si 3 O 12 grains are always distributed in pairs {{on both sides of}} a complete grain line. There is highly positive correlation between grain deviation angles on both sides of a stable complete line. Although the grains distribute in pairs, there is zero correlation between grain angles on both sides of an unstable complete line. By the reduction of grain angle on one side, grain sizes on the side gradually decrease. After adjustment, grain angles have highly positive correlation and the line turns stable. If there is disordered structure on one side of a line and ordered structure on the other side, the disordered structure may turn to highly ordered structure. The partial ordering transformation on the disordered side has no effect on the structure on the other side. While the growth directions of the grains on one side of a line face to a <b>disordered</b> grain distribution <b>zone,</b> the line loses the characteristic of grain growth in pairs...|$|R
