We headed towards it but as it was very late to approach the coast spent the night off the cape. The island had a pleasant aspect: there were woods, one might even say it was totally wooded. To {{the east of the}} island was a rock on which there were a large number of birds the size of small ducks. Our crew hunted them as our ship passed by and killed as many as we needed for food: they were quite tasty but spoiled by the <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{benefits of}} fish oils are generally attributed to their content of long chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Diets rich in these fatty acids {{are known to}} reduce the risk of coronary thrombosis, and are recommended to those who are susceptible to atherosclerosis. In addition, some of these long chain PUFAs play an important role in early infant nutrition, in the development of vital human organs such as the neural tube. However, practical difficulties arise in achieving an adequate daily intake of fish oils to obtain these physiological benefits. Per capita fish consumption is low in many countries, especially of oily fish with high levels of omega- 3 PUFAs. Fish oil, while available as a dietary supplement, is not universally appealing in that form. Attempts to incorporate fish oil into food formulations have had limited success mainly because of <b>fishy</b> <b>flavours</b> coming through in the consumer products. Fish oil is particularly susceptible to oxidation, which results in fishy, painty and metallic flavours. Hence the main aim of this study was the development of a dried ingredient in which the formulation and related processing conditions were optimised to protect the fish oil from oxidation. Protection of any sensitive oil may be achieved by means of microencapsulation, whereby oil is dispersed as very fine droplets in emulsions. During subsequent spray drying the droplets are effectively sealed inside a protective coating of protein surrounded by carbohydrate. The objective was, therefore, to evaluate microencapsulation as a means of extending the shelf-life of fish oil in powder form thus increasing its versatility as a nutritional ingredient in food formulations.

40|$|Draft to be {{reviewed}} by SeaFoodPlus experts (without English correction) Volatile amines are the characteristic molecules responsible for the <b>fishy</b> odour and <b>flavour</b> present in fish several days after the catch and they are commonly used as criteria for assessing the fish quality. The nature {{and the formation of}} the volatile amines are discussed. Ammonia is present in freshly caught fish, during chilled storage it is formed by endogenous and bacterial enzymes, it is a poor indicator of fish freshness and cannot be considered as an effective marker of fish spoilage. DMA is present at very low concentration in freshly caught, about 0. 2 mg/ 100 g, it is formed from TMAO, under TMAO-ase action, an endogenous enzyme which is mainly present in gadoids; DMA-N can be considered as an effective marker of fish freshness of many white fish and {{it can be used to}} monitor the quality of frozen-stored gadoid fish. In a very fresh fish the amount of TMA-N is low, ≤ 2 mg/ 100 g, it arises from the bacterial reduction of TMAO. TMA-N is an excellent indicator for the spoilage of gadoid fish, it is useful as a rapid means of objectively measuring the eating quality of many demersal fish specially on the medium-later phases of spoilage but it cannot be use...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} replacement of fish oil (FO) with DRA-Gold (DRA-G) -supplemented plant oils (PO) in rainbow trout fed plant-protein-based diets. Five diets (450 mg g- 1 digestible protein and 150 mg g-I crude lipid) were fed to rainbow trout (initial weight 37 ± 0. 5 g) for 12 weeks in a 15 °C recirculating water system. The lipid inclusion types and levels were FO, PO and PO with DRAG supplemented at 30 mg g- 1, 60 mg g- 1 or 90 mg g- 1 of the diet replacement for corn oil. Fish fed 90 mg g-I DRA-G were significantly larger and consumed more feed than fishfed PO or FO (218 g and 2. 6 % bwd- 1 versus 181 g and 2. 4 % and 190 g and 2. 3 %, respectively). Feed conversion ratio was significantly increased in fish fed 90 mg g- 1 DHAG (0. 99) as compared to fish-fed FO (0. 90) and 30 mg g- 1 DHA-G (0. 91). Panellists found trout fillets from fish fed the 90 mg g- 1 DHA-G diet to have significantly <b>fishier</b> aroma and <b>flavour</b> than fish fed the FO diet. Fatty acid analysis demonstrated that 60 mg g- 1 or 90 mg g- 1 DHA-G supplementation increased PO fed fish fillet DHA to fatty acid levels equivalent or higher than those fish fed a FO diet...|$|R

40|$|A yogurt mix (2 g fat and 17 g solids/ 100 g) was {{supplemented}} with an algae oil emulsion to provide 500 mg v - 3 fatty acids per 272 g serving of yogurt white mass. The emulsion {{was added to the}} yogurt mix either before or after the homogenization step and prior to pasteurization. It was then flavoured with a strawberry fruit base and fermented and stored for up to three weeks. The oxidative deterioration of the products was determined by hydroperoxide measurements and by trained and consumer sensory evaluations. The hydroperoxide content of the supple- mented yogurts increased over the storage treatment and was unaffected by the stage of addition. The trained panel could distinguish a stronger <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour</b> in both of the supplemented yogurts after 22 days storage, but the consumer panel rated both control and supplemented samples similarly, as ‘ moderately liked ’...|$|E
40|$|Macroporous Adsorption Resin (MAR) DA 201 -C {{was used}} to desalt {{different}} Fish Skin Protein Hydrolysates (FSPHs). The FSPHs were obtained by hydrolysis of fish skin using Alcalase in a batch reactor a 60 °C and pH 8. 25. The ash was removed by adsorbing FSPHs onto MAR. Desorption was achieved by washing with alcohol at different concentrations. Ash content of the FSPHs was reduced from 4. 69 - 5. 57 to 1. 07 - 2. 48 % range. The protein content was enriched from 89. 07 - 90. 82 to 94. 89 - 96. 38 % range. MAR has good hydrolysate recoveries. The use of MAR showed promising results in decolourization and <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour</b> reduction. Nile tilapia and Nile perch skin protein hydrolysates were moderately bitter compared to Grass carp skin protein hydrolysates. The bitter taste in FSPHs was reduced to slightly detectable levels by our sensor panel. The hydrolysates had relatively low molecular weight. The process of applying MAR to desalt and debitter FSPHs is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Properties {{and storage}} {{stability}} {{of two different}} jumbo squid myofibrillar protein-based films were investigated. Myofibrillar proteins were extracted by isoelectric precipitation after acidic and alkaline solubilization, obtaining the same extraction yield. During extraction the edible fraction, which was discarded during mantle skinning, was recovered, and the <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour</b> produced by nitrogen and other undesirable compounds was removed, although some sarcoplasmic proteins were lost simultaneously. In alkaline-Concentrate (C), myosin unfolding led to water resistant films, less water vapour permeable and more mechanically resistant than acidic-Films (F); whereas acidic-C protein hydrolysis resulted in more transparent and soluble films, with higher protein release (~ 80 g/L). During 4 months of storage some structure reorganization occurred, and both films incremented their yellowish tendency, especially the acidic-F, being this attributed to a Maillard reaction with plasticizers. After storage time, water solubility increased in C-films. While acidic-F aggregation led to a protein release reduction and tensile strength improvement, alkali-F became weak and brittle, loosing transparency. C-films offered different filmogenic properties, proving to be promising biodegradable packaging materials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Dange is a {{traditional}} food made from delicate wet sago starch and further roasted in forna. Dange has rectangle form, flat with approximately 0, 5 cm thickness. In addition, dange is also well known for its light, tasteless, hardness and relatively not hygroscopy. To increase the quality of dange and improve its flavour, a research was performed to study the quality of dange substituted with mackerel fish meat. The treatment was arranged in two classifications factorial completely randomized design. The classifications were variation of mackerel fish meat (0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 8 %) and time of grill (1 minute, 2 minutes and 3 minutes). Furthermore, the dange product quality was tested chemical and sensory analysis. The chemical analysis consisted of moisture, protein, fat, ash and starch content. Whereas the different of dange product quality was tested sensory analysis using scoring test method and the consumers acceptance was tested by hedonic scale test method. It {{was found that the}} most liked dange was made from 5 % substitute of mackerel fish meat at 1 minute grill. This dange had slightly brittle texture, yellow-white colour, fishy taste and relatively strong <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour</b> with 27. 84 % moisture, 3. 98 % protein, 0. 50 %fat, 2. 48 % ash and 57, 78 % starch content. </p...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{preferences}} on 7 product {{products of}} {{salmon and trout}} were evaluated using blind tests in 2 (two) different product categories: Smoked and Sashimi. This preference test was conducted as a Central Location Test in Tokyo and Osaka. 240 married women were recruited as participants evenly distributed in age groups between 30 to 60 years of age. Product testing was also done by a Japanese expert sensory panel. In the product category of smoked, Japanese consumers ranked the Norwegian trout as the best! Smoked products based on frozen Norwegian trout were ranked on top, followed by smoked from fresh Norwegian trout. Frozen Atlantic salmon, both of Norwegian and Chilean origin, together with frozen Chilean trout were evaluated as the second best group. The poorest ranking in the smoked category was given to products made from fresh Tasmanian salmon and fresh Atlantic salmon. The Norwegian trout scored high on good (natural) red colour, firm texture of the flesh, distinct <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour,</b> a high fat content, including good (fat) marbling, i. e. white stripes in the meat. Rather surprisingly, Norwegian trout for use as sashimi also achieved a good score with the consumers. From what we could expect, fresh Norwegian salmon and fresh Tasmanian salmon were also evaluated well by the consumers. Tasmanian salmon in particular scored much better for use as sashimi than as a smoked product. Conversely, we see that frozen Chilean salmon came out significantly poorer than the six remaining products tested. Preference Mapping indicates that a high fat content, “oily” aftertaste, “sweetness”, “melting texture”/elastic texture, and distinct/visible white stripes (marbling) “can explain” why some products were evaluated more attractive than others...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{experimental}} diets were formulated for {{rainbow trout}} using agricultural byproducts as major ingredients. Each experimental diet contained varying amounts of corn grain, corn gluten meal, corn gluten feed {{and one of}} the following: 200 g kg− 1 peanut meal, 200 or 400 g kg− 1 soybean meal (SBM), 390 g kg− 1 low-allergen soy flour, 310 g kg− 1 soy protein concentrate, 300 g kg− 1 low-allergen soy protein concentrate or 200 g kg− 1 SBM + 110 g kg− 1 blood meal. One diet contained 200 g kg− 1 SBM and canola oil as the main lipid source. The remaining diets contained 95 g kg− 1 menhaden oil. Fish fed a commercial trout diet exhibited significantly greater weight gain (322 %), and a lower feed conversion ratio (0. 89) but significantly lower protein efficiency ratio (2. 18) than fish fed the experimental diets. Within the experimental diets, fish fed the 400 g kg− 1 soy flour diet and the 400 g kg− 1 soybean meal diet had significantly higher weight gains (276 % and 268 %) and protein efficiency ratios (2. 58 and 2. 52), and lower feed conversion ratios (1. 02 and 1. 03) than fish fed other experimental diets. Fillet flavour varied between treatments. Most notable was the lower <b>fishy</b> <b>flavour</b> and higher chicken flavour of fish fed the diet that contained canola oil rather than menhaden oil. Microscopic evaluation of the liver and five sections of the gastrointestinal tract failed to demonstrate any differences between treatment groups. The ingredient costs of several experimental diets were lower than the estimated cost of a standard commercial trout diet. However, the superior feed conversion ratios of fish fed the control diet resulted in lower feed costs per unit of fish produced...|$|E
