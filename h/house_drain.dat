25|$|Although Nodder {{refused to}} divulge the {{whereabouts}} of Mona's body, police were certain the child was dead. Following {{the completion of the}} search of Peacehaven and the vicinity of the premises, police—assisted by hundreds of volunteers and several search dogs—expanded the search for Mona's body to the surrounding countryside. After three weeks, the Chief Constable of Newark, Harry Barnes, decided to seek the assistance of Scotland Yard. A decision was made to extensively search every <b>house,</b> <b>drain,</b> ditch and pond within three miles of Peacehaven. This search was at the time one of the most extensive in British police history, although it would ultimately prove fruitless. Before the Scotland Yard officers left Hayton, they informed their counterparts of their conviction Mona's body had been thrown into the River Idle, and of their fears the child's body had been swept into the North Sea.|$|E

The White <b>House</b> <b>drain,</b> which supplied it, had become steadily deeper as the land surface had sunk, and the soil through which it ran was unstable, requiring regular maintenance to prevent slippage. The pumping station was effectively {{on top of a}} hill, rather than being at the lowest part of the Fen, and so a decision was taken to construct a new pumping station at Whitehall on the River Great Ouse, which required the construction of [...] of main pumping drain, to connect it to the existing drains.

2500|$|As police {{questioned}} Nodder, {{other officers}} began interviewing his neighbours. One of these neighbours claimed to police {{she had seen}} a young girl matching Mona's description at Nodder's premises earlier that day; another neighbour was able to confirm to police that at midday on 6 January, a young brunette girl wearing a blue dress had been standing in the back doorway of his house, watching Nodder digging in his garden. This combination of eyewitness testimony was enough to detain Nodder, and at 11 p.m. that evening, he was arrested on a bastardy warrant (police having learned from Edith Grimes Nodder had {{been the subject of}} an affiliation order), and both his home (known as [...] "Peacehaven") and garden extensively searched. Every <b>house,</b> <b>drain,</b> ditch and cesspit within a three mile radius of his property was also searched, and a five-mile stretch of the Chesterfield Canal was drained. Although the search outside the grounds of Peacehaven proved fruitless insofar as discovering Mona either alive or dead, the search of his property revealed a handkerchief later determined to belong to Mona near a water tank {{at the rear of the}} premises. Also discovered inside the house were scraps of paper depicting a child's drawings and writings, and fingerprints upon crockery in the kitchen were quickly matched to those taken from materials Mona was known to have handled at her home. Ominously, an opened packet of sweets and a tin of Vaseline were discovered beneath a pillow in the front bedroom of these premises, indicating a likely sexual motive for Mona's abduction.|$|E
50|$|While he was recovering, London's {{short-lived}} Metropolitan Commission of Sewers {{ordered that}} all cesspits should be closed and that <b>house</b> <b>drains</b> should connect to sewers and empty into the Thames. As a result, a cholera epidemic (1848-49) killed 14,137 Londoners.|$|R
50|$|In July, 1849, {{the first}} {{outbreaks}} in what became a cholera epidemic arose on Union Street which connected Plymouth to Devonport, and were initially attributed to blockage of several <b>house</b> <b>drains</b> during {{construction of a}} new Millbay railway station.

60|$|In digging his {{rows and}} shaping his patches he {{neglected}} the guiding string and trusted to his eye altogether too much, {{and the consequent}} obliquity and the various wind-breaks and scare-crows he erected, and particularly an irrigation contrivance he began and never finished by which everything was to be watered at once by means of pieces of gutter from the roof and outhouses of Number 2, and a large and particularly obstinate clump of elder-bushes in the abolished hedge that {{he had failed to}} destroy entirely either by axe or by fire, combined to give the gardens under intensive culture a singularly desolate and disorderly appearance. He took steps towards the diversion of our <b>house</b> <b>drain</b> {{under the influence of the}} Sewage Utilisation Society; but happily he stopped in time. He hardly completed any of the operations he began; something else became more urgent or simply he tired; a considerable area of the Number 2 territory was never even dug up.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that, while low-flush toilets {{are estimated}} to have saved the city of San Francisco 20 {{million gallons of water}} per year, the reduction in water volume caused waste sludge to back up in the city sewer pipes, designed expecting a higher ratio of water to solids. The city was attempting to solve this by adding chlorine bleach to the pipes, a proposal that raised environmental objections.In <b>house</b> <b>drain</b> system design, smaller-diameter drain pipes are being used to improve flow by forcing waste to run higher in the pipe and therefore have less tendency to settle along the pipe.|$|E
50|$|The design {{included}} stoves {{and three}} stone fireplaces, {{a supply of}} water to the <b>house,</b> <b>drains</b> to remove waste water and other luxuries.The building was given a rustic character with masonry exterior walls. The building is austere, functional and solid. The property was inherited by Francisco Gómez de Sandoval, Duke of Lerma, {{and he may have}} initiated some changes to the original building. Lerma was a favorite of Philip III of Spain, and the two men would have used the privacy of the house to relax and also to deal with state affairs uninterrupted.|$|R

50|$|Nearer {{the mouth}} of the river, the Brandon Engine was the main outlet for the {{drainage}} of the northern half of Burnt Fen from 1830 until 1958. The original steam engine was replaced in 1892, by a new engine that could pump 75 tons per minute. That engine was replaced by a 250 horse power oil engine in late 1925, supplied by Blackstone and Company, which drove a 42 in Gwynne rotary pump. The pump could discharge 150 tons per minute against a head of 18 ft, and lasted for 30 years. When a replacement was considered in the 1950s, the Commissioners of the Burnt Fen were faced with the problem that the White <b>House</b> <b>Drain</b> which supplied it had become bigger and more unstable as the ground surface had shrunk, and the engine sat {{at the top of a}} hill, rather than at the lowest point on the northern Fen. Consequently, a new electric pumping station was constructed at Whitehall on the River Great Ouse, the flow in the drain reversed, and the pumping station decommissioned.|$|E

50|$|La Hacienda de San José Cocoyoc was {{basically}} {{dedicated to the}} cultivation and processing of sugar cane, to get the grain of sugar would be sold both domestically and internationally.The processing of sugar cane was achieved through a complex process as beginning at the mill, where freshly cut reeds arrived, they were introducias by an operator at the mill. The canes were crushed {{by the action of}} two wheels found, yielding cane juice, which in turn was driven by wooden troughs to the boiler room. Furthermore, the rods or rod fragments that remained after this process were pressed in a press of large dimensions, to obtain the juice that had not been achieved by the action of the mill.In the boiler room, the juice was poured into 5 or 6 boilers, color receiving large ovens - for 3-4 mts. height - called burners, bringing the cane juice is heated and concentrated. In the last of these boilers, called trash, you gave the point to Roan. Boiler, the juice obtained was taken to the <b>house</b> <b>drain</b> and mud poured into forms that had a hole in the bottom, covered with banana leaf. In these earthen vessels, crystallized sugar, giving, by runoff, a honey that was again poured over sugar loaves thereby achieving whitening purging or sugar.Finally, the crystallized sugar pieces were placed in a solarium, which concluded the drying process, being ready for consumption.It {{is important to note that}} in the sugar plantations of the New Spain, in the 17th century preferably use water mill water wheel, in combination with the press, while in the 18th century, it was common to use the mill animal traction.|$|E
50|$|In 'Salem's Lot (2004), Straker's name is {{once again}} changed, this time into Richard Thomas Straker. He was portrayed by Donald Sutherland.

He is also never actually seen in any of the same scenes with Barlow. In this version, he is killed as in the novel and left hanging upside down from the rafters of the Marsten <b>house,</b> <b>drained</b> of his blood.

5000|$|For {{years there}} are plans for the {{construction}} of the tourist complex, which would become the „Ada Ciganlija“ of Rakovica. The complex would include beaches, sports terrains and restaurants. Before that, the lake needs to be cleaned again as the waste waters from the closest <b>houses</b> <b>drain</b> into the lake, even though the chemical analysis conducted in 2012 showed that the water can be used for swimming, though the quality is not great. Shores of the lake were cleaned in March 2016. Another problem is the ownership of the land around the lake. Municipality owns the land up to 20 m from the shore, and much wider area is needed for the complex. Plans also include bicycle paths which would connect Pariguz to the other tourist attractions of Belgrade: Košutnjak, Pionirski Grad, Avala, Topčider.|$|R
50|$|Household {{reverse osmosis}} units {{use a lot}} of water because they have low back pressure. As a result, they recover only 5 to 15% of the water {{entering}} the system. The remainder is discharged as waste water. Because waste water carries with it the rejected contaminants, methods to recover this water are not practical for household systems. Wastewater is typically connected to the <b>house</b> <b>drains</b> and will add to the load on the household septic system. A reverse osmosis unit delivering five gallons (19 L) of treated water per day may discharge between 20 and 90 gallons (75-340 L) of waste water per day. This is having disastrous consequence for mega cities like Delhi where large-scale use of household R.O. devices has increased the total water demand of the already water parched National Capital Territory of India.|$|R
