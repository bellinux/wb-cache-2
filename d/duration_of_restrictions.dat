40|$|Proceedings of the 1995 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11 and 12, 1995, Athens, Georgia. Water {{consumption}} in the Flint River Basin depends upon seasonal irrigation of the major row crops — corn, peanut, cotton, and soybean. Knowledge of each crop's water use pattern, water retention by major soil types, and probable weather patterns is essential for comprehensive water management in the basin. Crop model prediction of yield and water use under weather patterns of the past 58 years showed that irrigation water withdrawals can exceed 1200 million gal/day during peak use periods in drought years. If emergency irrigation restrictions that eliminated irrigation for 30 - to 60 -day periods were imposed to curtail irrigation water consumption, water savings could amount to 6 to 60 billion gallons annually in the Flint River Basin. However, in-season curtailment of irrigation for 30 - to 60 -days would cause direct economic losses to growers of $ 4 to $ 148 million, depending on timing and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Alternative water management strategies should be developed for reducing irrigation demands in drought years.

Brains were immunohistochemically double-labeled for GnIH and the protein product of the immediate early gene, c-fos, a marker of cellular activation. Food hoarding, the number of double-labeled cells, and the percent of GnIH-Ir cells labeled with Fos-Ir were significantly increased at 8 and 12 days after the start <b>of</b> food <b>restriction.</b> Vaginal scent marking and GnIH-Ir cell number significantly decreased after the same <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction.</b> Food hoarding, but not food intake, was significantly positively correlated with cellular activation in GnIH-Ir cells.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, a lack {{of agreement}} in measurements of plasma corticosterone concentrations and heterophil:lymphocyte (H/L) ratio as physiological indices of stress, caused by hunger and frustration in restricted-fed broiler breeders, was observed. It could be suggested that the differences between previous studies were caused by differences in <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> and time <b>of</b> {{the day of the}} measurements. Therefore, in the present study the plasma corticosterone concentration and the H/L ratio were again determined in restricted- and ad libitum-fed growing broiler breeders, taking possible causes of disagreement between previous studies into account. In addition, we measured the daily rhythm in body temperature and heart rate, and the corticosterone responses to an acute stressor as physiological indices of stress. 2. Female broiler breeders (64 per treatment, housed in groups of 4 birds) were used in the experiment. Behaviour, baseline plasma corticosterone concentrations and H/L ratio were determined at 21 d of age (immediately after the start <b>of</b> food <b>restriction),</b> and at 42 and 63 d of age. Body temperature, heart rate and activity were measured by radiotelemetry for 36 h at 49 and 70 d of age. In addition, the plasma corticosterone response to acute stress (5 min manual restraint) was measured at 77 or 78 d of age. 3. Restricted broiler breeders had higher plasma corticosterone concentrations at 42 and 63 d of age, but no differences in H/L ratio were found between restricted birds and unrestricted control birds. Restricted broiler breeders had a higher corticosterone response to 5 min manual restraint than unrestricted birds. Restricted birds displayed a clear day-night rhythm in body temperature, heart rate and activity whereas such a rhythm was blunted in ad libitum-fed birds. 4. It is discussed that some physiological differences (plasma corticosterone concentrations, body temperature and heart rate) between ad libitum-fed and restricted broiler breeders may have been caused by differences in metabolic rate as well as by differences in the level of stress. ...|$|R

40|$|Five {{trials were}} {{conducted}} with cattle and sheep to evaluate the effects of previous rate of growth on subsequent growth performance, alterations in body composition and changes in mass and in vitro metabolism of visceral tissues. Growth <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> varying severity and duration were imposed by limiting intake of metabolizable protein or energy. In Trial 1, lambs with restricted energy intake deposited lean tissue {{at the expense of}} body fat, while lambs restricted in metabolizable protein intake maintained body composition similar to that of unrestricted lambs. Liver weights were reduced with either protein or energy restriction. In Trial 2, reductions in mass of liver and intestines that occurred during the restriction period persisted after 2 wk realimentation, but no compensatory growth was evident during this time. Compensatory growth, relative to unrestricted controls, was expressed during the period between 2 wk realimentation and attainment of 50 kg live weight, and was not different for protein and energy restricted lambs. Composition of gain during the realimentation period was similar for previously restricted and unrestricted lambs. Lambs in Trial 3 did not express compensatory growth as a consequence of previous metabolizable protein or energy <b>restrictions.</b> Compensatory growth <b>of</b> cattle in Trial 4 was influenced by severity and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> to a greater extent when energy, as opposed to metabolizable protein, was the first-limiting nutrient. Compensation was greater for energy restricted cattle as a consequence of longer and more severe growth restrictions. In Trial 5, cattle that experienced severe metabolizable protein deficiencies made greater compensatory growth if provided supplemental escape protein during the realimentation period. Compensatory growth was made primarily during the grazing period that followed the winter restriction. Differences in finishing performance were not related to differences in rate of gain during the preceding spring-summer grazing or wintering periods. Finishing performance was associated in a positive manner with gain during the preweaning period, which may be the consequence of genetic or early post-natal developmental effects. ...|$|R

Understanding changing patterns of post-insult consumption, relative rehabilitation timing, can {{provide insight into}} the mechanisms driving those differences. We hypothesize that higher catch-up growth rates will be correlated with increased protein consumption, while calorie consumption could remain stable. As catch-up growth rates decrease with age/malnutrition duration, we predict a dose effect in protein consumption with rehabilitation timing. We measured total and protein consumption, body mass, and long bone length, following an increase of dietary protein at 40, 60 and 90 days, with two control groups (chronic reduced protein or standard protein) for 150 + days. Immediately following rehabilitation, rats’ food consumption decreased significantly, implying that elevated protein intake is sufficient to fuel catch-up growth rates that eventually result in body weights and long bone lengths greater or equal to final measures of chronically fed standard (CT) animals. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>restriction</b> affected consumption: rats rehabilitated at younger ages had more drastic alterations in consumption of both calories and protein. While rehabilitated animals did compensate with greater protein consumption, variable responses in different ages and sex highlight the plasticity of growth and how nutrition affects body form...|$|R

The present study, aimed {{to determine the extent to}} which fetal adiposity and expression of the key thermogenic protein, uncoupling protein (UCP) 1, are altered by <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> maternal nutrient intake imposed during four different periods, starting from before conception. Maternal nutrient intake was restricted from 60 days before until 8 days after mating (periconceptional nutrient restriction; R-C), from 60 days before mating and throughout gestation (R-R), from 8 days gestation until term (C-R), or from 115 days gestation until term. Fetal perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) was sampled near to term at approximately 143 days. UCP 1 mRNA, but not protein, abundance in PAT was increased in fetuses in the R-R group (C-C 63 +/- 18; R-C 83 +/- 43; C-R 103 +/- 38; R-R 167 +/- 50 arbitrary units (P < 0. 05)). In contrast, the abundance of UCP 1 mRNA, but not protein, in fetal PAT was decreased when maternal nutrition was restricted from 115 days gestation. The major effect <b>of</b> maternal nutrient <b>restriction</b> on adipose tissue deposition occurred in the C-R group, in which the proportion of fetal fat was doubled, whereas maternal nutrient restriction from 115 days gestation reduced fetal fat deposition.

40|$|The interrelationship between {{financial}} {{constraints and}} firm activity is a hotly debated issue. The way firms cope with financial constraints {{is fundamental to}} the analysis of monetary transmission, of financial stability and of economic growth and development. The CBI Industrial Trends Survey contains detailed information on the financial constraints faced by a large sample of UK manufacturers. This paper uses the quarterly CBI Industrial Trends Survey firm-level data between January 1989 and October 1999. The cleaned sample contains 49, 244 quarterly observations on 5, 196 firms. The data set is presented and a new method of checking the informational content of the data is developed. The relationship between investment activity and financial constraints is ambivalent because both can affect each other and they are affected by the same kind of economic developments, so it is not clear which is driving the other. But the link between financial constraints faced by the firm and the prevalence and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> capacity <b>restrictions</b> should be unambiguously positive. Looking at that relationship, two important results emerge. First, financially constrained firms take longer to close capacity gaps. This indicates that financial constraints do indeed play a part in the investment process. Second, small firms close their capacity gaps faster than large firms do, but financial constraints seem to be of higher relevance to their adjustment. ...|$|R

From 34 th to 37 th week of age, all the groups were reverted, on treatment basis, to ad libitum feeding (post-restriction period). Each treatment was replicated into three with six pullets per replicate. During the data collection period (30 th – 37 th week of age) one egg per replicate was collected three times per week for egg quality indices. Birds that were under feed restriction laid heavier first eggs but had lower (P< 0. 05) hen day production (HDP) than their ad libitum counterparts. Ad libitum fed birds transferred to 20 % restricted feeding had the best economic indices. Birds subjected to restriction feeding had higher feed intake, poorer kg feed/dozen eggs, higher cost for dozen eggs (N) and lower gross margin (N) during post-restriction time (P< 0. 05) than when they were under restriction. On egg quality, birds had higher (P< 0. 05) haugh unit and albumen height but lower yolk index during restriction time than during post-restriction time. There {{were no significant differences}} in all the other quality indice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new computational approach for solving optimal control problems governed by impulsive switched systems. Such systems consist of multiple subsystems operating in succession, with possible instantaneous state jumps occurring {{when the system}} switches from one subsystem to another. The control variables are the subsystem durations {{and a set of}} system parameters influencing the state jumps. In contrast with most other papers on the control of impulsive switched systems, we do not require every potential subsystem to be active during the time horizon (it may be optimal to delete certain subsystems, especially when the optimal number of switches is unknown). However, any active subsystem must be active for a minimum non-negligible <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> time. This <b>restriction</b> leads to a disjoint feasible region for the subsystem <b>durations.</b> The problem <b>of</b> choosing the subsystem durations and the system parameters to minimize a given cost function is a non-standard optimal control problem that cannot be solved using conventional techniques. By combining a time-scaling transformation and an exact penalty method, we develop a computational algorithm for solving this problem. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by considering a numerical example on the optimization of shrimp harvesting operations...|$|R

40|$|Football {{injuries}} {{account for}} more concussions than any other sport in North America. A 1977 survey of high school foot-ball players in Minnesota found that 19 % of players reported at least one concussion (characterized by loss of awareness) during a season. These results have not been confirmed in subsequent studies. This study sought to estimate the incidence of concussion among high school football players in our region, establish {{the frequency of the}} most common symptoms, and determine the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> subsequent <b>restriction</b> from participation in the sport. The athletic boards of area high schools distributed a three-page survey to 450 high school football players. Of the 450 surveys distributed, 234 (52 %) were returned, only 1 of which was excluded because of contradictory information. The incidence of concussion in football players was 47. 2 % (110 / 233, P <. 001 versus a previously determined rate of 19 %). Eighty-one of 233 players (34. 9 %) had multiple concussions. A total of 376 concussions were reported. The distribution of severity of the 376 reported concus-sive events was grade I, 87. 8 %; grade II, 9. 9 %; and grade III, 2. 4 %. Only 12 athletes were required to stop play for one or more games. The incidence of high school football players sustaining a concussion is much higher than previously estab-lished. The majority of these are mild (grade I) concussions. Further research is needed since multiple low-grade concussions may incur cumulative neuropsychologic impairments. (J Child Neurol 2001; 16 : 83 - 85). Concussions are a frequent occurrence, representing greate...|$|R
40|$|The Sydney Catchment Authority (SCA) uses Wathnet, {{a generic}} water balance model for {{strategic}} and operational planning of the Greater Sydney water supply system. The model is run {{for a series of}} synthetic replicates containing stochastic climate and streamflow data similar to historic data. The SCA's water supply system yield is the maximum annual average demand that can be supplied by the system whilst conforming to the design criteria. Sydney's raw water supply system is designed to meet service standards to ensure supply continuity and to minimise the frequency and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> water <b>restrictions.</b> The supply system's performance is assessed against a series of criteria such as reliability, robustness and security. The WATHNET model was used to develop Greater Sydney's Metropolitan Water Plan in 2004, 2006 and 2010 and recently for the Warragamba Dam environmental flow assessment. After the Metropolitan Water Plan scenario modelling, all of the scenarios were costed for further assessment. This was done outside the Wathnet system model. The SCA saw benefits in being able to perform the economic assessment of the system's performance for each of the synthetic inflow replicates through the system model and has progressed work in this area The new version of Wathnet modeling software incorporated an economic functionality along with the water supply system simulation capabilities. A new model was built to represent SCA's water supply system and validated against the previous model. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the new Wathnet model's economic modelling functionality and its application in asset and system planning...|$|R
40|$|Spleen is {{the most}} frequently-injured solid organ in blunt abdominaltrauma. Considering its {{important}} role in providingimmunity and preventing infection {{by a variety of}} mechanisms,every attempt should be made to salvage the traumatizedspleen at any age particularly in children. After primaryresuscitation, mandatory requirements for non-operative managementinclude absence of homodynamic instability, lack ofassociated major organ injury, and admission in the intensivecare unit for high-grade splenic injury and in the ward formilder types with close monitoring. About two-thirds of thepatients would respond to non-operative management. In mostpatients, the failure of non-operative measures usually occurswithin 12 hours of management. Determinant role of abdominalsonography or computed tomography, and in selectedcases, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, for appropriate decisioncannot be overemphasized. However, the high status of clinicaljudgment would not be replaced by any paraclinical investigations. When operation is unavoidable, if possible, spleensaving procedures such as splenorrhaphy or partial splenectomyshould be tried. In cases of total splenectomy, autotransplantation,preferably in the omental pouch, may lead tothe return of immunity, at least partially, to prevent or reducethe chance of subsequent infection. Although total splenectomywith autograft is immunologically superior to total splenectomy-only procedure, the patients should also be protectedby vaccination and daily antibiotic for certain period of time. The essential steps for the prevention of overwhelming infectionafter total splenectomy are not only immunization and administrationof daily antibiotic for up to 5 years of age or oneyear in older children, but also include education and informationabout this dangerous complication. When non-operativemanagement is successful, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> activity <b>restriction</b> inweeks is almost equal to the grade of splenic injury plus 2...|$|R

We used interviews to investigate the ethnomedicinal use of the local species to determine the mode of use, frequency <b>of</b> administration, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> treatment and <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> use. In traditional medicine, the use of S. rotundifolium {{is associated with the}} treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases. The part of the plant most used was the stem bark (86. 11 %), the predominant mode of preparation was immersion in water (52. 83 %), and oral administration was the most cited (48. 43 %). For inflammatory and infectious diseases, the treatment lasted 3 - 10 days and the frequency of administration was 2 - 3 times/day. For gastroprotective effects, treatment lasted up to 30 days, and the herb was administered 1 - 3 times/day. For pain complaints, the therapy varied from 2 - 3 days to continuous administration. The informants (46. 87 %) did not mention <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> use, except for pregnant women, with a rate of 25 %. A comparison of these results with the ethnopharmacological information from other studies showed that some of the traditional indications are scientifically supported by the literature or clinical studies. Nevertheless, the results showed that pharmacologists have not fully investigated all the possible bioactivities that healers credit to this plant...|$|R
40|$|Toeplitz {{operators}} are fundamental and ubiquitous in signal processing and information theory {{as models for}} linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems. Due {{to the fact that}} any practical system can access only signals <b>of</b> finite <b>duration,</b> time-limited <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> Toeplitz {{operators are}} naturally of interest. To provide a unifying treatment of such systems working on different signal domains, we consider time-limited Toeplitz operators on locally compact abelian groups with the aid of the Fourier transform on these groups. In particular, we survey existing results concerning the relationship between the spectrum of a time-limited Toeplitz operator and the spectrum of the corresponding non-time-limited Toeplitz operator. We also develop new results specifically concerning the eigenvalues of time-frequency limiting operators on locally compact abelian groups. Applications of our unifying treatment are discussed in relation to channel capacity and in relation to representation and approximation of signals...|$|R
