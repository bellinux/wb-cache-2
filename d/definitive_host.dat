5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the <b>definitive</b> <b>host,</b> for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the <b>definitive</b> <b>host)</b> transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour {{in such a way}} that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its <b>definitive</b> <b>host,</b> a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
40|$|Alloglossidium {{comprises}} 9 {{species of}} North American plagiorchiiform digeneans using ictalurid catfish, freshwater crustacea, and hirudinid leeches as <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts.</b> Two hypotheses about {{the evolution of}} this array of <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> were examined using phylogenetic systematic analysis. Two most parsimonious trees, based on 15 homologous series derived from morphological data, each indicated the two species utilizing ictalurid catfish <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> are basal members of the group, whereas the two species using freshwater crayfish <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> and the five utilizing leech <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> each comprise relatively derived monophyletic sister groups. The results suggest that species using crustaceans as <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> are derived by life cycle truncation, whereas those using leeches as <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> appear to be derived through a switch from crustaceans to leeches...|$|R

25|$|The {{life-cycle}} of {{a typical}} member of this genus involves two host species, a <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> and an intermediate host. Often the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> is a predator and the intermediate host is its prey. The parasite reproduces sexually in the gut of the <b>definitive</b> <b>host,</b> is passed with the feces and ingested by the intermediate host. There it eventually enters muscle tissue. When the intermediate host is eaten by the <b>definitive</b> <b>host,</b> the cycle is completed. The <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> usually does not show any symptoms of infection, but the intermediate host does.|$|E
25|$|Oocysts {{are passed}} in the feces of an {{infected}} <b>definitive</b> <b>host.</b> The oocyst undergoes sporogony creating two sporocysts. Once this is complete the oocyst itself undergoes lysis releasing the sporocysts into the environment. Sporocysts typically contain 4 sporozoites and measure 15-19 by 8-10 micrometres.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium is a genus of {{parasitic}} alveolates, many {{of which}} cause malaria in their hosts. The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle: a Dipteran insect host and a vertebrate host. Sexual reproduction always occurs in the insect, making it the <b>definitive</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> include {{fish-eating}} {{birds and}} mammals. The most common <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> are the domestic dog, cat, and red fox. [...] Humans are also <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> for N. salmincola. A {{long list of}} experimental <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> include the hamster and wood rat. Interestingly, an experimental study failed to infect two white rats and two white mice. Trematodes exist along the whole length of the small intestine in smaller animals like hamsters, while they exist only in {{the upper end of}} the small intestine in larger animals like dogs.|$|R
30|$|We {{divide the}} <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> {{population}} (mainly the dogs) into three subclasses: the susceptible population, the exposed population, and the infected population, denoted by S_ 1 (t), E_ 1 (t), and I_ 1 (t), respectively, and N_ 1 (t)=S_ 1 (t)+E_ 1 (t)+I_ 1 (t) {{is the total}} number of <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts.</b> The <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> are infected by means of eating infected, cyst-containing organs.|$|R
50|$|Adult worms {{of these}} species develop in the small intesine of the <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> (dogs, foxes, and other canids), causing a disease from the group of taeniasis. Humans cannot be <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> for these species of tapeworms.|$|R
25|$|In outline gametogony and sporogony {{occur in}} the {{intestine}} of the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> while both schizogony which occurs in various tissues {{and the formation of}} sarcocysts (containing bradyzoites and metrocytes) occurs principally in the muscles of the intermediate host. In some cases a single species may act as both the definitive and intermediate host.|$|E
25|$|The only {{indigenous}} primary <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> of F. magna is white-tailed deer. This {{species has}} been parasitized by the fluke {{for the longest}} time in historical context. Wapiti and caribou are of Eurasian origin and entered North America during the Pleistocene epoch, and overlapped with white-tailed deer in some parts of North America. They might have encountered F. magna in these shared biotopes.|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish {{function}} as hosts {{for a wide}} variety of organisms. Endoparasitic helminths are transmitted from intermediate host jellyfish to <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> fish via predation. Some digenean trematodes, especially species of the family Lepocreadiidae, are known to use jellyfish as their second intermediate hosts and/or paratenic hosts. Medusivorous fish become infected by trematodes through predation of infected jellyfish and act as definitive hosts.|$|E
30|$|Adult flukes {{live in the}} biliary {{tract of}} its <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> (herbivorous mammals such as cattle, sheep, and goats) and need an {{intermediate}} host to complete its life cycle (some species of freshwater snails). Humans can be <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. solium is indirect. It passes through pigs, as {{intermediate}} hosts, into humans, as <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts.</b> From humans, the eggs are released in the environment where they await ingestion by another host. Humans as the <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> are directly infected from contaminated meat.|$|R
25|$|Once the {{intermediate}} host is eaten by the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> {{such as a}} dog or human, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction within the gut to create macrogamonts and microgamonts. Most definitive hosts do not show any clinical sign or symptoms. Fusion of a macrogamont and a microgamont creates a zygote which develops into an oocyst. The oocyst is passed through the faeces completing the life cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifecycle}} of T. gondii can be broadly summarized {{into two}} components: a sexual component that occurs only within cats (felids, wild or domestic), and an asexual component {{that can occur}} within virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, cats, and birds. Because T. gondii can sexually reproduce only within cats, cats are therefore the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> of T. gondii. All other hosts – in which only asexual reproduction can occur – are intermediate hosts.|$|E
25|$|Merozoites {{entering}} muscle cells {{round up}} to form metrocytes and initiate sarcocyst formation. Sarcocysts begin as unicellular bodies containing a single metrocyte and through asexual multiplication numerous metrocytes accumulate and the sarcocyst increases in size. As the sarcocyst matures, the small, rounded, noninfectious metrocytes give rise to crescent-shaped bodies called bradyzoites that are infections for the <b>definitive</b> <b>host.</b> Time required for maturation varies with the species and may take 2 months or more.|$|E
50|$|While acanthocephalans rarely infect humans, {{there have}} been several cases {{reported}} of M. moniliformis causing acanthocephaliasis in humans as their <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts.</b> Usually, the <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> for M. moniliformis are rodents, cats, dogs and red foxes (in Poland). The intermediate hosts are usually beetles and cockroaches.|$|R

25|$|Trophically {{transmitted}} parasites have a {{life cycle}} involving two or more hosts. In their juvenile stage, they infect and often encyst in an animal; this is the intermediate host. When this animal is eaten by a predator, the parasite survives the digestion process and matures into an adult. This predator thus become the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> for the parasite. Some parasites are capable of modifying the behavior of their intermediate hosts {{in order to increase}} the chances of being eaten by a predator.|$|E
25|$|Echinostoma {{species have}} low {{specificity}} for their definitive hosts, and can infect {{a variety of}} different species of animal, including amphibians, aquatic birds, mammals and humans. A <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> which is infected with Echinostoma will shed unembryonated Echinostoma eggs in their faeces. When the eggs are in contact with fresh water they may become embryonated, and will then hatch and release miracidia. The miracidia stage of Echinostoma is free-swimming, and actively penetrates the first intermediate snail host, which then becomes infected.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{intermediate}} host, the miracidium undergoes asexual reproduction for several weeks, which includes sporocyst formation, {{a few generations}} of rediae {{and the production of}} cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail host into water and are also free-swimming. The cercariae penetrate a second intermediate host, or they remain in the first intermediate host, where they form metacercariae. Definitive hosts become infected by eating secondary hosts which are infected with metacercariae. Once the metacercariae have been eaten, they excyst in the intestine of the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> where the parasite then develops into an adult.|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum {{are closely}} related apicomplexan parasites that may cause {{clinical}} diseases in domestic and wild animals (Dubey and Beattie, 1988; Dubey, 2003). Both pro-tozoa have an indirect life cycle, with carnivores as <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts.</b> Cats and other Felids are <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> of T. gondii; dogs and coyotes (Canis latrans) are <b>definitive</b> <b>hosts</b> of N. caninum. Canine and feline toxoplasmosis is a multi-sys-temic disease; however a latent form of the disease usually develops (Dubey and Beattie, 1988; Dubey, 2003). In Europe, the antibodies to T. gondii were found in cats and dogs from Sweden (Uggla et al. ...|$|R

25|$|Cercariae use a tail-like {{appendage}} (often forked in genera causing swimmer’s itch) to swim to {{the surface}} of the water; and use various physical and chemical cue in order to locate the next and final (<b>definitive)</b> <b>host</b> in the life cycle, a bird. These larvae can accidentally come into contact with the skin of a swimmer. The cercaria penetrates the skin and dies in the skin immediately. The cercariae cannot infect humans, but they cause an inflammatory immune reaction. This reaction causes initially mildly itchy spots on the skin. Within hours, these spots become raised papules which are intensely itchy. Each papule corresponds to the penetration site of a single parasite.|$|E
25|$|L. donovani was {{independently}} {{discovered by}} two British medical officers William Boog Leishman in Netley, England, and Charles Donovan in Madras, India, in 1903. However, the correct taxonomy {{was provided by}} Ronald Ross. The parasite requires two different hosts for a complete life cycle, humans as the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> and sandflies as the intermediate host. In {{some parts of the}} world other mammals, especially canines, act as reservoir hosts. In human cell they exist as small, spherical and unflagellated amastigote form; while they are elongated with flagellum as promastigote form in sandflies. Unlike other parasitic protists they are unable to directly penetrate the host cell, and are dependent upon phagocytosis. The whole genome sequence of L. donovani obtained from southeastern Nepal was published in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Fascioloides magna, {{also known}} as giant liver fluke, large American liver fluke or deer fluke, is {{trematode}} parasite that occurs in wild and domestic ruminants in North America and Europe. Adult flukes occur in the liver of the <b>definitive</b> <b>host</b> and feed on blood. Mature flukes measure 4 to 10cm in length × 2 to 3.5cm in width, and have an oval dorso-ventrally flattened body with oral and ventral sucker. The flukes are reddish-brown in colour and are covered by tegument. As with other digenean trematodes, the life cycle includes intramolluscan phase in snails. The parasite is currently distributed in wild ruminants in North America and Europe, including Austria, Canada, Czechia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, and USA.|$|E
