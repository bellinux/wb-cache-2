5|$|Ewell {{interpreted}} {{his orders}} as calling {{only for a}} cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect.</b> Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on {{the overall}} course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most {{of the blame for}} the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

5|$|The Disney bomb saw {{limited use}} by the United States Army Air Forces in Europe from February to April 1945.

5|$|The Warrington and Stockport Railway was {{constructed}} through Dunham during 1853/54. Dunham Massey railway station served {{the area between}} 1854 and its closure in 1962. Dunham grew as a result, the population increasing by 57.5% between 1851 and 1881. Otherwise, the industrial revolution <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on Dunham Massey, and it remained a predominantly agricultural area.|$|E
5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved {{insufficient to}} meet German industrial needs and <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> economically. Politically, however, {{it led to}} widespread condemnation in Belgium and internationally, helping {{the rise of the}} resistance. In late 1917, under pressure from neutral powers, most of the Belgian deported workers were returned.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure to}} capture the ridge <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was so {{overwhelming}} that the Germans diverted significant resources, including two Panzer divisions, from the ridge {{in their attempt to}} keep Bradley's forces boxed in. With its defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assault by}} the heavily armed sloop HMS Dart proved successful, the fireships {{achieved}} little {{and various other}} British craft involved in the operation <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on the eventual outcome. The French response was disorganised and ineffectual, losing one frigate captured. Three others were almost destroyed, only escaping by cutting their anchor cables and fleeing into the coastal shoals where they ran aground. Although all three frigates were refloated and returned to service, the operation had cost the French heavy casualties. The British force suffered minimal losses, although the exact totals are uncertain. Many of the British officers involved were highly praised and rewarded with promotions and prize money.|$|E

5|$|Cook {{attributed}} the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered {{that it be}} purified with lime juice, but this <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect.</b> Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship's carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed Endeavour to resume her voyage. The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.|$|E
5|$|Fausto {{steadily}} weakened {{throughout the}} following two days as it moved over progressively cooler waters. By July21, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm and a tropical depression the next day. Early on July23, the depression lacked deep convection and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The low persisted for another day before dissipating over open waters. Hurricane Fausto <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on land, despite passing close to the islands of Clarion and Socorro where high winds, reaching hurricane-force on Socorro, were recorded. Moderate rainfall from the outer bands of the storm amounted to 1.9in (50mm) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes {{for a total of}} 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee. He left {{near the end of the}} game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked {{towards the}} {{northeast}} {{in response to}} an area of low pressure within the westerlies. By October11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) after bypassing the Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on land.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, but was given less {{responsibility}} {{with the ball}} and had little success. She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34.00. She also <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> with the bat, scoring 63 runs at 11.50 with a best score of 18. South Australia won five of their matches, narrowly missing the finals. Up to this point her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8.37.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the genus Collybia, C.cookei grows on the well-rotted, {{blackened}} remains of mushrooms, such as species of Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Inonotus hispidus. Fruit bodies occasionally grow on well-decayed wood or rich humus. The fruit bodies grow scattered, clustered, or in groups. A field study conducted near a Brass mill in Sweden revealed that heavy metal contamination <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on the appearance of the mushroom, possibly because its substrate of partially decomposed fruit bodies has a lower metal concentration that the underlying topsoil.|$|E

5|$|Princess Charlotte was a {{difficult}} child and indifferent student, with a nervous disposition. Her relationship with her demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>effect</b> on her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, {{in the care of}} family members. Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had {{a difficult}} relationship.|$|E
5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science.

The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E

On 27 July, the frigates were spotted by HMS Mars, a ship of the line of the British blockade squadron, and chased with the frigate Rhin rapidly falling behind. Declining to support the straggler, La Meillerie ran on towards France while Mars took possession of Rhin, and the surviving ships found safe ports along the Biscay coast.|$|E
