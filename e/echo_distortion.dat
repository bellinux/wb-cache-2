It has several features akin to Guitar Heros controller, as it features five colored fret buttons on {{the neck of the}} guitar (which correspond to on-screen notes), a strum bar, and a whammy bar.

[...] These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without the need to strum. The whammy bar can be used to distort the sound of held notes. A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (ranging from wah-wah, flange, chorus, <b>echo,</b> <b>distortion,</b> doubler, slap back echo, medium echo, and long echo), however, this switch was removed from the Rock Band 3 edition of the guitar.

40|$|A power MOSFET linearizer is {{proposed}} for a high-voltage power amplifier (HVPA) used in high-frequency pulse-echo instrumentation. The power MOSFET linearizer {{is composed of}} a DC bias-controlled series power MOSFET shunt with parallel inductors and capacitors. The proposed scheme is designed to improve the gain deviation characteristics of the HVPA at higher input powers. By controlling the MOSFET bias voltage in the linearizer, the gain reduction into the HVPA was compensated, thereby reducing the <b>echo</b> harmonic <b>distortion</b> components generated by the ultrasonic transducers. In order to verify the performance improvement of the HVPA implementing the power MOSFET linearizer, we measured {{and found that the}} gain deviation of the power MOSFET linearizer integrated with HVPA under 10 V DC bias voltage was reduced (− 1. 8 and − 0. 96 dB, respectively) compared to that of the HVPA without the power MOSFET linearizer (− 2. 95 and − 3. 0 dB, respectively) when 70 and 80 MHz, three-cycle, and 26 dBm input pulse waveforms are applied, respectively. The input 1 -dB compression point (an index of linearity) of the HVPA with power MOSFET linearizer (24. 17 and 26. 19 dBm at 70 and 80 MHz, respectively) at 10 V DC bias voltage was increased compared to that of HVPA without the power MOSFET linearizer (22. 03 and 22. 13 dBm at 70 and 80 MHz, respectively). To further verify the reduction of the <b>echo</b> harmonic <b>distortion</b> components generated by the ultrasonic transducers, the pulse-echo responses in the pulse-echo instrumentation were compared when using HVPA with and without the power MOSFET linearizer. When three-cycle 26 dBm input power was applied, the second, third, fourth, and fifth harmonic distortion components of a 75 MHz transducer driven by the HVPA with power MOSFET linearizer (− 48. 34, − 44. 21, − 48. 34, and − 46. 56 dB, respectively) were lower than that of the HVPA without the power MOSFET linearizer (− 45. 61, − 41. 57, − 45. 01, and − 45. 51 dB, respectively). When five-cycle 20 dBm input power was applied, the second, third, fourth, and fifth harmonic distortions of the HVPA with the power MOSFET linearizer (− 41. 54, − 41. 80, − 48. 86, and − 46. 27 dB, respectively) were also lower than that of the HVPA without the power MOSFET linearizer (− 25. 85, − 43. 56, − 49. 04, and − 49. 24 dB, respectively). Therefore, we conclude that the power MOSFET linearizer could reduce gain deviation of the HVPA, thus reducing the <b>echo</b> signal harmonic <b>distortions</b> generated by the high-frequency ultrasonic transducers in pulse-echo instrumentation...|$|R

40|$|Most current {{multi-gigabit}} {{per second}} digital fiber optic systems use simple modulation and detection {{techniques such as}} on-off keying with matched-filter receiver techniques. However, more complex techniques such as equalization, error control coding, and/or multilevel signaling, {{can be used in}} lightwave systems to significantly increase the data rate and/or reduce the effect of transmission impairments and improve performance, and, in many cases can be easily implemented. There are numerous sources of transmission impairments in lightwave systems. These include chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in the fiber, laser and fiber nonlinearities, nonideal receiver response, <b>echo,</b> and <b>distortion</b> caused by semiconductor optical amplifiers. Fortunately, there are also numerous techniques to reduce these impairments, including error control coding, equalization, and modulation techniques with multilevel signaling. These techniques can be used for upgrading existing systems (e. g., reducing chromatic dispersion and PMD in systems with previously installed fiber) or {{as an alternative to the}} use of more costly transmitters and receivers (e. g., using coding to permit less stringent laser specifications). The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of equalization techniques, which become increasingly important as device technology matures, in which case substantial increases in performance (especially for already installed systems) may only be achieved through these techniques. We will examine the prospects for the application of digital equalization techniques to overcome the above impairments, where the improvement is large and the implementation is relatively simple...|$|R

Low-quality speakers and poorly-designed enclosures that produce vibrations often generate harmonic distortion, and this nonlinear effect degrades the performance of linear AEC algorithms considerably.

In addition to suppressing the residual echo in the primary subband, the proposed model also suppresses the residual echo in a window of bands surrounding the higher order harmonics.

40|$|This paper proposes the use {{of field}} {{programmable}} analog arrays (FPAAs) as adaptive conditioning blocks for ultrasonic sensors. The uncertainty achievable through this technique, in fact, results very sensitive to the measurement conditions, due to the attenuation affecting the echo during its propagation. Indeed, FPAAs emulate analog circuits whose characteristics have to be dynamically tuned according to different operating conditions. Actually, the signal provided by the ultrasonic sensor is properly processed {{in order to improve}} the overall measurement accuracy. In this paper, the prototype of a distance meter based on time-of-flight (TOF) measurement is presented in order to evidence the advantages gained by FPAA features in processing the sensor output to compensate <b>echo</b> attenuation and <b>distortion</b> versus target distance. The prototype working is supervised by a digital signal controller (DSC) whose tasks are: 1) driving the ultrasonic transducer; 2) performing the echo acquisition; 3) tuning on the fly the FPAA features; 4) evaluating the TOF; 5) measuring the target distance; and 6) delivering the final result to the end user.

40|$|OFDM {{is a form}} of {{multicarrier}} {{modulation technique}} with high spectral efficiency, robustness to channel fading, immunity to impulse interference, uniform average spectral density capacity of handling very strong <b>echoes</b> and non-linear <b>distortion.</b> Despite of its many advantages, one major disadvantage of OFDM is that the time domain OFDM signal which is a sum of several sinusoids leads to high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The peak to average power ratio of the time domain envelope is an important parameter at the physical layer of the communication system using OFDM signaling. The signals must maintain a specified average energy level in the channel to obtain the desired Bit-error-rate. Pulse shaping techniques are very effective and mitigate problems associated with PAPR. In this paper conventional pulse shapes like Raised Cosine (RC), and sinc Power (SP) pulses are modified as Modified Raised Cosine Pulse (MRC) and Improved sinc Power pulse (ISP) introducing design parameter ‘d’ and amplitude parameter ‘a’ etc. The proposed method has fast decaying rate by decreasing the lobes of sinc function and its implementation complexity is also less. In this paper OFDM system performance measures like Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) are analyzed through MATLAB simulation which proves the efficacy of the proposed pulse shaping scheme. It was observed from the performance curves using ISP pulse shaping filter at the OFDM transmitter’s end outperforms others...|$|R
