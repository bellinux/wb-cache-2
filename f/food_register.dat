40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if some stimulated whole saliva parameters {{are influenced by}} an increase of Body Mass Index. METHODS: Controlled cross-sectional study involving 90 school children of both genders between 7 and 10 years of age, from Bragança Paulista - SP. Three groups were formed: overweight, obese and control. Body Mass Index and diet intake by the <b>Food</b> <b>Register</b> method were evaluated. The salivary pH, flow rate, buffer capacity, protein, phosphate, calcium, fluoride, total and free sialic acid, and peroxidase activity were determined. RESULTS: The overweight and obese groups showed greater energy and lipid intake (P< 0. 001) than the control group. There {{was no difference in}} the saliva flow rate between groups, however only the control group showed a mean value considered normal. In the overweight and obese groups a decrease in both the concentration of phosphate (P< 0. 001) and peroxidase activity (P< 0. 001) was observed. In the obese group an increase in the concentrations of free sialic acid (P= 0. 004) and protein (P= 0. 003) occurred. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obese children show alterations in the concentrations of phosphate, free sialic acid and proteins, and in the peroxidase activity that are favorable conditions for dental caries...|$|E

Objective- To evaluate the dietary habits, nutritional status and the prevalence of constipation in patients with classical Rett syndrome. Methods- Twenty seven female patients {{between the ages of}} 2. 6 and 21. 8 years were studied. The following parameters were evaluated: <b>food</b> <b>register,</b> weight, height and intestinal movement characteristics. Weight and height were compared with the National Center for Health Statistics standards. Results- The inability to ingest solid foods was observed in 80. 8 % of the patients. A height-to-age deficit was observed in 13 (48. 1 %) of the girls, being more intense in patients at stage IV. Weight-for-height deficit was found in 10 (37. 0 %) patients, 15 (55. 6 %) showed normal weight and 2 (7. 4 %) were overweight for their height. The median ingestion of energy, according to weight-for-height, was equal to 106. 6 %. Insufficient iron ingestion was observed in 63. 0 % and insufficient calcium in 55. 6 % of the patients. Constipation was verified in 74. 1 % of the patients and did not show a relationship with the quantity of fiber in the diet. Conclusion- Various nutritional problems, as well as, intestinal constipation were observed in these patients with Rett syndrome, and they must be considered in the multidisciplinary therapeutic planning of these individuals.

40|$|The Norwegian National Reporting System and Register of Severe Allergic Reactions to Food, or the <b>Food</b> Allergy <b>Register,</b> is a nation-wide, {{government-funded}} permanent {{reporting and}} registration system for severe allergic reactions to food. The <b>Food</b> Allergy <b>Register</b> collects information {{based on a}} one-page reporting form, serum samples for specific IgE analysis, and food samples for food allergen analysis. Reporting physicians receive in return an extensive commentary on the reported case and the relevant allergies, and results of the specific IgE analysis and food allergen analysis. The <b>Food</b> Allergy <b>Register</b> has, after being active {{for a little more}} than four years, given valuable information about several important aspects of food allergy in Norway. The <b>Food</b> Allergy <b>Register</b> has revealed <b>food</b> safety problems in relation to allergy that probably could be discovered only {{with the help of a}} systematic, nation-wide registration of cases. The reactions of peanut allergic individuals to lupine flour in bakery products is an example of how the <b>Food</b> Allergy <b>Register</b> is able to reveal potentially serious problems that would otherwise probably have gone unnoticed and certainly unexplained. The amount and the value of the information from the <b>Food</b> Allergy <b>Register</b> are increasing as new reports of more cases are added. The typical Norwegian patient with a severe allergic reaction to food appears to be a young adult, female rather than male. The offending meal is consumed at a restaurant or fast-food stand or in a private party away from home, and peanuts, nuts and shellfish are among the most common offending foods, while fish allergy appears to be rather rare. </span...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the copper and zinc intake and serum levels {{in patients with}} juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), considering the pauci and polyarticular types, the disease activity and duration, the number of inflamed joints {{and the use of}} corticosteroids therapy. Design: Cross-sectional study with control group. Setting: Outpatients of the pediatric rheumatology public health clinic, of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina, Brazil. Subjects: Forty-one patients with JRA were evaluated and 23 patients' brothers, as a control group. Interventions: Copper and zinc intake evaluation by <b>Food</b> <b>Register</b> method. Copper and zinc serum levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: the disease activity did not determine difference in copper (P = 0. 624) and zinc (P = 0. 705) intake, being predominantly below the Recommended Dietary Allowances. the serum copper in relation to control was statistically greater (P = 0. 018), showing that the number of inflamed joints is statistically significantly related with its variation (P = 0. 001). the serum zinc was not different either in relation to control (P = 0. 940) or to the disease characteristics. Conclusions: the evaluation of copper intake seems to be of fundamental importance. It may influence the efficiency of the organic serum response.

40|$|International audienceThe {{renewal of}} the {{relations}} between {{urban and rural areas}} has been marked, in recent years, by the emergence of many initiatives for the solidarity of urban spaces or their reconnection with agricultural environments, via the <b>food</b> <b>register</b> (as found with local markets or agricultural shows for example). However, while agriculture has never been so widely talked about – urban and peri-urban agriculture in particular (Poulot, 2014, 2015) – a gap persists between some disadvantaged areas and agricultural spaces, even when these are close (Alkon and Agyeman, 2011; see also Beisher and Corbett in this issue). As a result, we wanted to focus on a notion which is rather well-established in Anglophone research but only emerging in Francophone research, that of food justice, as well as its links with agriculture. Consequently, this issue of JSSJ seeks firstly to increase our understanding of the notion of food justice, by placing relations with agriculture at the centre of its definition, and secondly to think about processes linked to agriculture and contributing to food justice. Is it because of its links with agriculture, and the potentially special place granted by it, that food justice differs from other endeavours to implement a more equitable food system? Considering the different approaches to food justice, we intend first of all to review the definition of food justice and its issues. The various articles will then identify which role gives the food justice movement to agriculture and on which spaces the notion focuses. Finally, suggesting that a more agri-food and spatial justice should be defended brings us to think about educational, empowerment and governance plans and their practical role in the construction of more equitable food systems...|$|E

40|$|Background: Zinc is an {{important}} cause of morbidity, particularly among young children. The dietary, functional, and biochemical indicators {{should be used to}} assess zinc status and to indicate the need for zinc interventions. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the zinc status and reference intervals for serum zinc concentration considering dietary, functional, and biochemical indicators in apparently healthy children in the Northeast Region of Brazil. Design: The cross-sectional study included 131 healthy children: 72 girls and 59 boys, aged between 6 and 9 years. Anthropometric assessment was made by body mass index (BMI) and age; dietary assessment by prospective 3 -day <b>food</b> <b>register,</b> and an evaluation of total proteins was performed. Zinc in the serum samples was analyzed in triplicate in the same assay flame, using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: With respect to dietary assessment, only the intake of fiber and calcium was below the recommendations by age and gender. All subjects were eutrophic according to BMI and age classification. Zinc intake correlated with energy (p= 0. 0019), protein (p= 0. 0054), fat (p< 0. 0001), carbohydrate (p= 0. 0305), fiber (p= 0. 0465), calcium (p= 0. 0006), and iron (p= 0. 0003) intakes. Serum zinc correlated with protein intake (p= 0. 0145) and serum albumin (p= 0. 0141), globulin (p= 0. 0041), and albumin/globulin ratio (p= 0. 0043). Biochemical parameters were all within the normal reference range. Reference intervals for basal serum zinc concentration were 0. 70 – 1. 14 µg/mL in boys, 0. 73 – 1. 17 µg/mL in girls, and 0. 72 – 1. 15 µg/mL in the total population. Conclusions: This study presents pediatric reference intervals for serum zinc concentration, considering dietary, functional, and biochemical indicators, which are useful to establish the zinc status in specific groups.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES [...] To recruit a {{representative}} sample of farmworkers, accurately quantify the range and extent of their animal exposures, and measure the associated risks of illness. DESIGN [...] Inception cohort. SETTING [...] The study was undertaken among farmworkers living in five local authority areas in the catchment of Hereford and Preston Public Health Laboratories, England. PARTICIPANTS [...] A quota sample of 404 people on 255 agricultural holdings took part. The holdings were selected at random from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and <b>Food</b> <b>register.</b> Altogether 58 % of eligible subjects approached agreed to participate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] The sample had the same sex distribution as the 1991 census for those giving their occupation as agriculture. The mean age was significantly (p < 0. 01) higher (44. 6 years v 42. 2 years) than that of those giving their occupation as agriculture, forestry or fishing in the census, although the modal range (45 - 59 years) was the same. At enrollment interviews, subjects individually reported contact with up to nine animal species (mode 4) out of 26 reported in all. Based on the numbers contacted and the frequency and intimacy of contact, scores on a ranked ordinal scale from 0 - 5 were constructed for each species and frequencies for each score were plotted. Subjects also reported past operations and serious illness. A history of pneumonia was significantly (p < 0. 05) associated with a pigeon loft on the farm (relative risk (RR) 7. 3) and attending farrowing pigs (RR 6. 6), and one of leptospirosis with a rat problem on the farm (RR 28. 1). Cattle contact was associated with a significantly lower likelihood (protective) of glandular fever (RR 0. 19) and rheumatic or scarlet fever (RR 0. 12). These effects were significantly related to rankings of the extent of exposure. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is possible to recruit {{a representative}} sample of farmworkers and measure their animal exposures in great detail. Among these exposures, associations with plausible risk factors for pneumonia and leptospirosis and apparently protective factors for glandular fever, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever have been demonstrated, which further show a relationship between the extent of exposure and response. These findings can be tested further by examining the relationship of exposures to serological evidence of illness or by further prospective follow up of this and similarly well characterised cohorts, or both...|$|E

25|$|In plants, algae, {{and other}} {{photosynthetic}} organisms, lycopene {{is an important}} intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, {{which is responsible for}} yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, i.e. an unsubstituted alkene. Structurally, lycopene is a tetraterpene and assembled from eight isoprene units that are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. It is insoluble in water. Lycopene's eleven conjugated double bonds give its deep red color and its antioxidant activity in vitro. Owing to the strong color, lycopene is a useful <b>food</b> coloring (<b>registered</b> as E160d) and is approved for usage in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the EU.|$|R

50|$|Yet {{the overall}} <b>food</b> {{sufficiency}} <b>registered</b> by Chad {{in these years}} served to underscore the problem of regional imbalances in cereal production. The sahelian zone experienced a chronic shortfall in cereal production, whereas the soudanian zone traditionally had a cereal surplus. The soudanian zone was also the biggest producer of all subsistence food crops and of cash crops. It was estimated that the soudanian zone produced between 53 and 77% of Chad's total cereal production from 1976 to 1985, with the average falling in the 60- to 70-% range. But because the populations of the two regions were approximately equal, {{the lack of a}} good transport system and marketing mechanisms to allow the rapid transfer of the southern surplus to the northern zones was a constant problem. This danger was especially threatening during times of drought affecting the sahelian zone.|$|R
