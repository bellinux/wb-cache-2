5|$|The smalltail shark is a slender-bodied {{species with}} a fairly long, pointed snout. The leading margin of each nostril is {{enlarged}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow,</b> pointed lobe. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes, and behind them {{are a series of}} prominent pores. The mouth bears short furrows at the corners and contains 13–15 tooth rows on either side of both jaws (usually 14 upper and 13 lower). The upper teeth are tall and triangular with strong serrations, becoming increasing oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are comparatively narrower and more upright, with finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified in leaving his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E

25|$|Optical SETI {{supporters}} have conducted paper {{studies of the}} effectiveness of using contemporary high-energy lasers and a ten-meter diameter mirror as an interstellar beacon.

The Cyclops study proved incorrect in suggesting a laser beam would be inherently hard to see.|$|E

Due to its status as the area’s last operating neoclassical “tenement synagogue” — named for the fact that it fits miraculously <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> mid-block 22-foot wide lot — GVSHP in 2008 asked the LPC to designate it as {{an individual}} landmark.

25|$|Hancock's assault {{started at}} 4:35a.m. on May 12 and easily crashed through the Confederate works. Despite the initial success at obliterating {{much of the}} Mule Shoe salient, there was a flaw in the Union plan—no one had {{considered}} how {{to capitalize on the}} breakthrough. The 15,000 infantrymen of Hancock's II Corps had crowded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> front about a half mile wide and soon lost all unit cohesion, becoming little more than an armed mob. Following the initial shock, the Confederate leadership at all levels began to react well to the Union onslaught and reinforcements were rushed in to stem the tide.|$|E

25|$|While {{the hazards}} of x-rays are now well-controlled in most medical contexts, MRI still {{may be seen as}} {{superior}} to CT in this regard. MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging of disease and follow-up without exposing the body to ionizing radiation. MRI often may yield different diagnostic information compared with CT. There may be risks and discomfort associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT, MRI scans typically take greater time, are louder, and usually require that the subject go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow,</b> confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely.|$|E

Tom rows to land to find supplies, but while he is on land, a Soviet helicopter bombs Sandy Hook, killing Lars and Sverre. Tom has to walk across Spitsbergen to reach Longyearbyen.

Past the Thruway, the route curves to the northwest, briefly following the outlet of Canandaigua Lake across rolling farmland.

The main tributaries of the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of {{the eastern side of the}} valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its bed falls from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12km, the last 8km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m. Kuntipuzha is one of the less torrential rivers of the Western Ghats, with a pesticide-free catchment area.|$|E
