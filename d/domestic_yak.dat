40|$|Aim We {{aimed to}} examine the phylogeographical {{structure}} and demographic history of <b>domestic</b> and wild <b>yaks</b> (Bos grunniens) based {{on a wide range}} of samples and complete mitochondrial genomic sequences. Location The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) of western China. Methods All available D-loop sequences for 405 domesticated yaks and 47 wild yaks were examined, including new sequences from 96 domestic and 34 wild yaks. We further sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 48 domesticated and 21 wild yaks. Phylogeographical analyses were performed using the mitochondrial D-loop and the total genome datasets. Results We recovered a total of 123 haplotypes based on the D-loop sequences in wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks.</b> Phylogenetic analyses of this dataset and the mitochondrial genome data suggested three well-supported and divergent lineages. Two lineages with six D-loop haplogroups were recovered for all morphological breeds of <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks</b> across their distributions in the QTP, while one more lineage and more endemic haplogroups or haplotypes were found for wild yaks. Based on the mitochondrial genome data, the divergences of the three lineages were estimated to have occurred around 420, 000 and 580, 000 years ago, consistent with the geological records of two large glaciation events experienced in the QTP. Main conclusions There are distinct phylogeographical differences between wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks.</b> However, there is no apparent geographical correlation between identified haplogroups and distributions of <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks.</b> Three differentiated lineages of yaks probably evolved allopatrically in different regions during the Pleistocene glaciation events, then reunited into a single gene pool during post-glacial population expansion and migrations before the start of the domestication of yaks in the Holocene.

Yak domestication represents an important episode in the early human occupation of the high-altitude Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The precise timing of domestication is debated and {{little is known about the}} underlying genetic changes that occurred during the process. Here we investigate genome variation of wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks.</b> We detect signals of selection in 209 genes of <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks,</b> several of which relate to behaviour and tameness. We date yak domestication to 7, 300 years before present (yr BP), most likely by nomadic people, and an estimated sixfold increase in yak population size by 3, 600 yr BP. These dates coincide with two early human population expansions on the QTP during the early-Neolithic age and the late-Holocene, respectively. Our findings add to an understanding of yak domestication and its importance in the early human occupation of the QTP. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The {{wild yak}} is under {{pressure}} from several sources. Poaching, including commercial poaching, has remained the most serious threat; males are particularly impacted because of their more solitary habits. Disturbance by and interbreeding with livestock herds is also common. This may include the transmission of cattle diseases, although no direct evidence of this has yet been found. Conflicts with herders themselves, as in preventative and retaliatory killings for abduction of <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks</b> by wild herds, also occur but appear to be relatively rare. Recent protection from poaching particular appears to have stabilized or even increased population sizes in several areas, leading to the IUCN downlisting in 2008.

40|$|Alpine {{plants of}} the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (Sichuan, China) are {{developed}} under long-lasting grazing by wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks.</b> Among morphological features of plants, life forms may reflect their adaptation to grazing.

The following morphological traits were studied: (1) life form according to Raunkiaer, (2) life form according to Serebryakov, (3) canopy structure, and (4) rate of lateral spreading. We derived life-form spectra based on (1) {{the number of species}} per life form and (2) the cumulative abundance of species which have the same life form. One-way ANOVA and nonparametric ANOVA were run to test for significance of differences between spectra. The studied communities differed significantly by the proportion of different life forms.

Therophytes made up 10 - 11 % of the communities except in Rhododendron thickets, where such were absent. These life forms can indicate grazing in the study area...|$|R

Yaks are the largest animals on the Tibetan Plateau. Wild yaks are larger than <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks</b> and slightly smaller than the gaur. They can tolerate extremely cold climate, climb steep slopes, and ford fierce rapids. Yaks are the imost important animal for Tibetan herders, who eat yak meat and milk for food, burn yak dung as fuel, spin yak hair into fabric, make yak hide leather and use yaks to transport and plow fields. Bactrian camels have two humps and can go a month or longer without drinking water. A thirsty Bactrian camel can drink 135 liters (30 gallons) in only 13 minutes.

50|$|Like all vultures, the {{cinereous vulture}} eats mostly carrion. The cinereous vulture feeds on carrion {{of almost any}} type, from the largest mammals {{available}} to fish and reptiles. In Tibet, commonly eaten carcasses can include both wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>yaks</b> (Bos grunniens), Bharal, Tibetan gazelles (Pseudois nayaur), kiangs (Equus kiang), woolly hares (Lepus oiostolus), Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and even humans, mainly those at their celestial burial grounds. Reportedly in Mongolia, Tarbagan marmots (Marmota sibirica) comprised the largest part of the diet, although that species is now endangered as it is preferred in the diet of local people, wild prey ranging from corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) to Argali (Ovis ammon) may be eaten additionally in Mongolia. Historically, cinereous vultures in the Iberian Peninsula fed mostly on European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) carcasses, but since viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) devastated the once abundant rabbit population there, the vultures now rely on the carrion of domestic sheep, supplemented by pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and deer. In Turkey, the dietary preferences were argali (Ovis ammon) (92 carrion items), wild boar (Sus scrofa) (53 items), chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) (27 items), gray wolf (13 items) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (13 items). Unusually, {{a large amount of}} plant material was found in pellets from Turkey, especially pine cones. Among the vultures in its range, the cinereous is best equipped to tear open tough carcass skins thanks to its powerful bill. It can even break apart bones, such as ribs, to access the flesh of large animals. It is dominant over other scavengers in its range, even over other large vultures such as Gyps vultures, bearded vulture or fierce ground predators such as foxes. While noisy Gyps vultures squawk and fly around, the often silent cinereous will keep them well at bay until they are satisfied and have had their own fill. A series of photos taken recently show a cinereous vulture attacking a Himalayan griffon in flight for unknown reasons, although the griffon was not seriously injured. Cinereous vultures frequently bully and dominate steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) when the two species are attracted to the same prey and carrion while wintering in Asia. A rare successful act of kleptoparasitism on a cinereous vulture was filmed in Korea when a Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) stole from a vulture.|$|R
40|$|Studies of domesticated {{animals have}} led to the {{suggestion}} that domestication could have significant effects on patterns of molecular evolution. In particular, analyses of mitochondrial genome sequences from <b>domestic</b> dogs and <b>yaks</b> have yielded higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions in the domesticated lineages than in their wild relatives. These results are important because they imply that changes to selection or population size operating over a short timescale can cause significant changes to the patterns of mitochondrial molecular evolution. In this study, our aim is to test whether the impact on mitochondrial genome evolution is a general feature of domestication or whether it is specific to particular examples. We test whether domesticated mammals and birds have consistently different patterns of molecular evolution than their wild relatives for 16 phylogenetically independent comparisons of mitochondrial genome sequences. We find no consistent difference in branch lengths or dN/dS between domesticated and wild lineages. We also find no evidence that our failure to detect a consistent pattern is due to the short timescales involved or low genetic distance between domesticated lineages and their wild relatives. However, removing comparisons where the wild relative may also have undergone a bottleneck does reveal a pattern consistent with reduced effective population size in domesticated lineages. Our results suggest that, although some domesticated lineages may have undergone changes to selective regime or effective population size that could have affected mitochondrial evolution, {{it is not possible to}} generalize these patterns over all domesticated mammals and birds. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The yak are the {{mainstay}} of livelihood for the nomads on the vast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of western China and adjacent regions. Yak withstand the extreme condition of a harsh, cold climate at high elevations. Numbers of yak in China are around 13 million. There {{are a number of}} recognized breeds, and microsatellite DNA markers have started to show some genetic distances between them. To improve productivity, yak can be hybridized with local or exotic cattle for use at lower elevation. The males of these hybrids are sterile. Crosses of <b>domestic</b> with wild <b>yak</b> show improved size and vigor. Traditionally, yak are managed in a transhumance system dictated by the seasons, but since the 1990 s this system has been breaking down as herders are given ownership of animals and rights to parcels of rangeland. One calf every two years is the norm, and most usually not before three years of age. Body weight of adult females varies somewhat among breeds and situations but is around 220 kg (bulls reaching twice that). Yak females may lose 25 % of their body weight over winter into early spring due to both low temperature and shortage of feed. For pregnant cows over that period, this can have unfavorable consequences for calf survival. Milk production is seasonal and averages among breeds from 150 to 500 kg with a fat content from 5. 4 % to 7. 5 %. Feces of yak are collected and dried for use as fuel. Fiber yields are variable (from 0. 5 to 2. 9 kg depending on breed and location), but the most valuable component is the down, representing about 60 % of the total fleece in calves but substantially less in adults...|$|R

40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{is a highly}} {{infectious}} and contagious viral disease affecting bovidae (cattle, zebus, <b>domestic</b> buffaloes, <b>yaks),</b> sheep, goats, swine, all wild ruminants and suidae. Camelidae (camels, dromedaries, llamas, vicunas) have low susceptibility. Foot and mouth disease {{is caused by a}} RNS virus of the family Picornaviridae, genus Aphthovirus. There are seven immunologically distinct serotypes: A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, Asia 1. Foot and mouth disease causes significant economic loss both to countries who manage it as an endemic disease (with or without vaccination), as well as those FMD free countries which may become infected. The mortality rate is low in adult animals, but often higher in young due to myocarditis. Foot and mouth disease is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America (sporadic outbreaks in free areas). The Office of International Epizootics (OIE), also referred to the World Organization for Animal Health maintains an official list of free countries and zones. 1 The OIE Terrestrial Code (Chapter 2. 2. 10) provides detailed information on the categories of freedom that can be allocated to a country as well as guidelines for the surveillance for foot and mouth disease (Appendix 3. 8. 7). In short, countries may be completely free of FMD, free with vaccination or infected with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). Source of FMDV include incubating and clinically affected animals with virus present in breath, saliva, faeces, urine, milk and semen. In experimental settings virus has been detected in milk several days before the onset of clinical signs 2. Additional sources of virus are meat and by-products in which pH has remained above 6. 0 as well as persistently infected carrier animals. Carrier animals may include cattle and water buffalo; convalescent animals and exposed vaccinates (virus persists in the oropharynx for up to 30 months in cattle or longer in buffalo, 9 months in sheep). Pigs do not become carriers. It has been shown that the African Cape buffalo are the major maintenance host of SAT serotypes. FMDV transmission can occur by either direct or indirect contact. Indirect transmission can occur via contaminated animate vectors (humans, etc.), inanimate vectors (vehicles, implements) or airborne transmission. Indirect disease transmission via animate or inanimate vectors can {{play a major role in}} disease transmission. Good biosecurity can significantly reduce this type of transmission. Airborne transmission is often debated and is known to be serotype and species specific as well as require specific environmental conditions to occur. Airborne transmission is favored in temperate zones and has been postulated to occur over distances of up to 60 km overland and 300 km by sea. Foot and mouth disease virus is an unenveloped virus which is preserved by refrigeration and freezing and progressively inactivated by temperatures above 50 C. FMDV is highly sensitive to pH change and is inactivated by pH 9. 0. There are many disinfectants which are effective against FMDV including sodium hydroxide (2 %), sodium carbonate (4 %), and citric acid (0. 2 %). FMDV is resistant to iodophores, quaternary ammonium compounds, hypochlorite and phenol, especially in the presence of organic matter. The virus can survive in lymph nodes and bone marrow at neutral pH, but is destroyed in muscle when is pH < 6. 0 i. e. after rigor mortis. FMDV can persist in contaminated feed/commodities and the environment for over to 1 month, depending on the temperature and pH conditions. The incubation period for FMD is 2 - 14 days. Animals transition through latent (infected but not infectious), subclinically infected (infectious but lacking clinical signs) clinically infected and recovered disease states. In cattle clinical signs include pyrexia, reluctance to eat, bruxism, drooling, lameness, treading or stamping of the feet and decreased milk production. Most clinical signs are related to the development and subsequent rupturing of vesicles at the coronary band and in the oral cavity. Vesicles and ulcerations can also occur on the mammary gland. Recovery in adult animals usually occurs in 8 - 15 days. Clinical signs for most serotypes are less dramatic in sheep and goats. Swine can develop very severe coronary band lesions and high mortality in piglets has been observed. One of the challenges of diagnosing FMD is that it may be clinically similar to several other vesicular or ulcerative diseases. FMD is clinically indistinguishable from Vesicular stomatitis, Swine vesicular disease and Vesicular exanthema of swine. It may also resemble Bovine viral diarrhea, Mucosal disease, Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Bluetongue, Bovine papular stomatitis, Bovine mammillitis and Rinderpest...|$|R
50|$|Although {{they are}} locally {{sympatric}} with Siberian ibex, {{the two species}} have differing habitat and pasture preferences, reducing likely competition. In Tibet, the argali must regularly compete with other grazing species for pasture, including Tibetan antelope, bharal, Thorold's deer and wild yaks. Competition is most serious with livestock, especially <b>domestic</b> <b>yak</b> and domestic sheep, with which argali are frequently forced to intermingle and from which they often catch diseases and parasites. The main predator of argali are gray wolves, which often exploit harsh winter conditions (such as deep snow) to capture the wild sheep, though they can and do take specimens of any age or condition year around. Where not locally extirpated, snow leopards and leopards are also predators of argali of any age. Eurasian lynx and wolverines may seldom kill argali to at least the size of winter-weakened ewes. Red foxes and domestic dogs (largely those kept by sheep-herders) will prey on lambs. Cinereous vultures, lammergeiers and golden eagles have been observed circling herds of ewes with lambs in a possibly predatory manner and remains of argali lambs have been observed in golden eagle nests. Smaller predators, such as raptorial birds and smaller mammalian carnivores, are attacked by mother ewes, but {{in the presence of}} larger predators, the ewes quickly run away with the lambs following them.|$|E
50|$|The Himalayan vulture perches on crags, {{favourite}} sites showing white {{marks from}} regular defecation. They tend to not range below {{an elevation of}} 1215 m. Himalayan vultures often bask in the sun on rocks. They soar in thermals and are not capable of sustained flapping flight. Flocks may follow grazers up the mountains {{in their search for}} dead animals. This vulture makes a rattling sound when descending on a carcass and can grunt or hiss at roosts or when feeding on carrion. They have been recorded eating carrion exclusively, some which is fed on even when putrid. On the Tibetan Plateau 64% of their diet is obtained from dead <b>domestic</b> <b>yak</b> (Bos grunniens). They feed on old carcasses sometimes waiting a couple of days near a dead animal. They disdain offal, which is readily eaten by other vultures, and instead typically eat only fleshy parts. Historically, Himalayan vultures regularly fed on human corpses left out on Celestial burial grounds. This species is fairly contentious around other scavengers and typically dominates other meat-eaters at carrion, though is subservient to Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and cinereous vultures at carcasses. In a large party, these vultures can reportedly strip a human or sheep carcass of all meat in 30 minutes and do the same to a yak carcass in roughly 120 minutes. Himalayan vultures have been observed feeding on pine (Pinus roxburghii) needles, an unexplained behaviour that cannot be for obtaining nutrition.|$|E
