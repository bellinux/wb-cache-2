Immature oocytes were recovered by laparoscopic ovum pick-up and matured for 24 h prior to enucleation and NT. Reconstructed embryos were transferred as cleaved embryos into synchronized recipients. A total of 27 em-bryos derived from transgenic cells and 70 embryos derived from nontransgenic cells were transferred into 13 recipients.

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{potential of}} adult caprine somatic cells after nuclear transfer (NT) was evaluated. Cumulus-granulosa were isolated from cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COC) and from follicular aspirants following laparoscopic oocyte pick-up (LOPU) from a dwarf breed of goat (BELE: Breed Early Lactate Early). One cumulus cell line (CC) was established from cumulus cells stripped from COCs. Two cumulus-granulosa lines (CG 1, CG 2) were established from two separate sets of follicular aspirants (6 donors in each set). These aspirants contained both mural granulosa and cumulus-granulosa cells. The CC and CG 2 cells had a normal chromosome number, while 30 % {{of the cells}} in CG 1 had a translocation. Donor cells at passage 1 (CG 1, CG 2) and passage 4 (CC) were cultured in DMEM plus 0. 5 % FCS for 4 days prior to use in NT. Immature oocytes were aspirated by LOPU from goats primed with FSH and eCG. After 24 hr of maturation, oocytes were enucleated and donor cells were transferred beneath the zona pellucida. The couplets were fused with an electric pulse (17 sec, 2. 44 KV/cm). Two to four hrs after fusion the NT embryos were activated with 5 M ionomycin and 2 mM 6 -dimethylaminopurine. Embryos were cultured in G 1. 2 for 18 to 42 hr until transfer. A total of 96 NT embryos were transferred into 9 recipients. Four recipients (44 %) were confirmed pregnant at day 35 and 60 by ultrasound. Pregnancies rates for the three lines were CC: 0 %(0 / 1), CG 1 : 25 % (1 / 4), and CG 2 : 75 % (3 / 4).

In comparison to <b>female</b> <b>kids,</b> male kids had significantly higher average birth weight (3. 3 kg : 3. 7 kg) and significantly higher average daily gain (163 g : 203 g).

Feeding was adjusted weekly so that the animals would gain ~ 50 g per day. Oestrus was checked daily using young vasectomised bucks fitted with a marking harness. The ovulation rate was determined by transrectal ultrasonography 10 days after the identification of oestrus. Plasma samples were obtained weekly for progesterone determination. Changes in BW and BCS were also recorded weekly. The BCS had a clear effect on the date of first ovarian activity and first detected oestrus. The HH kids experienced the earliest onset of puberty (31 August ± 2. 4 days) although no significant difference was seen compared with the LH group (19 September ± 8. 7 days).

At weaning, from each group, one half of kids was separated randomly and allocated to LQD or HQD. Consequently, in post weaning period, there were four treatment groups including: LQD pre and post-weaning (L-L), control group and LQD pre-weaning and HQD post-weaning (L-H); HQD pre-weaning and LQD post weaning (H-L), HQD pre- and post-weanin (H-H). From 30 to 180 d of age, body weight and DM intake were determined every 2 wk. Results: Results showed that the HQD treatment enhanced body weight and DM intake during pre-weaning period, in comparison with the LQD treatment (P< 0. 01). During post-weaning, kids of H H treatment had higher DM intake compared with other kid’s treatments.

This farm will produce 2250 Hlmilk per year (mechanical milking), 150 reproduction <b>female</b> <b>kids</b> for selling at 8 - 9 months of age, 500 fattening kids, and 120 culled goats sold for meat. The annuallyestimated gross income will be 34000 EUR...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Dilla University with the objectives of to evaluate pre-weaning growth performance of boar-Arsi bale goats. Three bucks with 87. 5 % blood level of boer breed were purchased from Almata Agro Industry and 30 yearling female Arsi-Bale goats were purchased from a local market for cross breeding. Following natural controlled breeding, Doe’s were mated with Boar buck to produce 44 % boer and 50 % local blood level kids. Does were mated in single sire groups of at least 30 does for one buck. Birth weight, weaning weight, weekly weight were recorded in the morning before grazing and watering. The experiment kids consider only kidding November, 2014 to February 2015 totally 25 kids were born and one only died until weaning. Out of all born F 1 kids 17, 7 kids were males and females respectively. From thirty pregnant Doe’s 6. 67 % of them having dystocia. From the total 96 % of kids survive up to weaning. Kid mortality rate was 4. 2 %. The birth weight of boer-arsi bale cross kids were 3. 02 for male kids and 2. 41 for <b>female</b> <b>kids.</b> The overall mean of weaning weight of boar arsi bale kids were varies by sex which is 22. 48 ± 3. 47 for male kids and 18. 60 ± 2. 20 for <b>female</b> <b>kids</b> and Pre-weaning weight obtained (175. 83 ± 6). From the trial it is possible to conclude that boer-arsi bale kids have better growth performances than most of the goat breeds in Ethiopia. integrated efforts combining the feed, breeding and nutritional aspects of production are very important {{to make use of the}} breed...|$|R

The main index of reproduction accomplished by the youth female situated at he level of the values characteristic to the sheep and goats breeds or populations belonging to Carpatina breed, registering lower values. By the early usage of sheep and goats male youth the following were noticed: Palas Merino male lambs, capable for reproduction 80 %; the male lambs from Palas prolific population, capable for reproduction 88, 8; out of the he-goats lots of Carpatina breed, {{at the age of}} 7 - 10 months, 83. 33 % the males manifested a normal sexual behaviour; the males which did not have sexual reflexes at the age of 7 - 10 months and at the age of 19 - 22 months they were not capable for reproduction, and the ones that had the seminal material of low quality continued to be so...|$|R
