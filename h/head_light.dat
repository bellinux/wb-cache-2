25|$|In 1878 tenders {{were called}} for a {{permanent}} lighthouse, one of five lighthouses of similar design designed by James Barnet in 1878-80, the other four being Fingal <b>Head</b> <b>Light,</b> Crowdy <b>Head</b> <b>Light,</b> Tacking Point Lighthouse and Richmond River Light. It was built by W. Kinnear {{at a cost of}} £1,097, and construction was completed in 1880.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the issues strictly {{connected with the}} scientific discipline of Transport, concerning the exploitation of lighting devices, reflectors and projectors being the fundamental devices for tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lighting.</b> The factor influencing {{the safety of a}} moving track vehicle is the quality and state of tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lighting.</b> Appropriate light distribution within the area of tram’s foreground plays a decisive role in the perception of luminous sensations by the tram driver. A properly shaped light beam conditions appropriate visibility from the tram driver’s seat and facilitates correct assessment of traffic situations connected with the behaviour of other road traffic participants. The history of development of <b>lighting</b> devices for <b>head</b> <b>lights</b> used for trams has been discussed. The article proposes and discusses application of AFS system in trams particularly accounting for proposals of new lighting requirements for tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lighting</b> devices. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} photometric requirements for projectors and reflectors of tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lights,</b> presenting proposals for these requirements. After conducting a lighting analysis of currently exploited light beams it has been established that justification exists for using symmetrical light beams in the case of head, main and low beam lights.

25|$|In 1864 the Queensland Government {{appointed}} a select committee {{to investigate the}} state of harbours and rivers in the colony. A direct outcome of this inquiry was {{the construction of the}} Bustard <b>Head</b> <b>Light</b> south-east of Gladstone in 1867/68 and a lighthouse at Sandy Cape in 1870 - the first lighthouses built by the Queensland colonial government. These were prefabricated iron-framed structures with bolted or riveted cast-iron plate cladding and internal iron staircases, the whole imported from England.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} {{lighthouse}} {{built by the}} Queensland colonial government (Lady Elliot Island Light erected on Lady Elliott's Island in 1872/73), Colonial Architect FDG Stanley designed a structure which utilised readily available local timber, specifying a hardwood frame clad with plated iron sheeting. This reduced the cost of construction, and despite problems of termite infestation and rusting, this type of construction, or its derivative, a wooden frame with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting, became the standard for subsequent nineteenth century Queensland lighthouses. Between 1873 and 1901, 14 lighthouses were constructed in Queensland using hardwood framing and plated iron sheeting, and another 7 were constructed with hardwood frames and corrugated iron cladding. The latter were associated mostly with harbour entrances and included: Little Sea Hill Light (1876 – relocated); Grassy Hill Light (1886 – active); Goods Island Light (1886 – active); Bay Rock Light (1886 – inactive – relocated); Caloundra <b>Head</b> <b>Light</b> (1896 – inactive); North Point Hummock Light (1899 – demolished); Gatcombe <b>Head</b> <b>Light</b> (1900 – demolished). An eighth lighthouse of this type, Bulwer Island Light, was constructed at Bulwer Island in the Brisbane River in 1912, but is now inactive has been relocated.|$|E
25|$|Warden <b>Head</b> <b>Light,</b> {{also known}} as Ulladulla Lighthouse, is an active {{lighthouse}} on Warden Head, a headland south of Ulladulla, New South Wales, Australia, guarding {{the entrance to the}} Port of Ulladulla. It is one of only two wrought iron lighthouses in New South Wales, the other being its sibling, Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse. It is also notable for two relocations: the tower was constructed in 1873 on the Ulladulla Breakwater, and relocated in 1889 to its current location. Its keeper's house was relocated to a different location in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|After Oregon {{attained}} statehood in 1859 and {{the completion}} of railroads throughout the Coast Range, development of land quickly began along many of the Coasts bays and rivers. Logging and commercial fishing soon became the primary industries in the area, and several ports were built to facilitate both industries. In 1870, the first lighthouse at Cape Blanco was built and was soon followed by both the Yaquina Bay Light and Yaquina <b>Head</b> <b>Light</b> in 1871 and 1873, respectively. The last Coast Guard operated light, Cape Arago Light, was built in 1934.|$|E

Other minor changes included new interior colors, trim, and lighting design for the dash and center display. Several items that were options on the 2008 and 2009 models became standard on the 2010 G37s.|$|E
25|$|From its beginning, the {{lighthouse}} was {{closely related to}} the Cape Cleveland Light. The construction of both lighthouses was recommended by Commander George Poynter Heath, the Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board, in February 1878. The lighthouses were formally approved in April 1878 and tenders for the construction of both stations, each including a lighthouse and two keepers' cottages, were called in May 1878 and closed in June 1878. The tenders were awarded to W. P. Clark, who also constructed Bustard <b>Head</b> <b>Light</b> (1868), Low Isles Light (1877), Double Island Point Light (1884) and Pine Islet Light (1885). However, following personal difficulties, the contracts were transferred to John Clark and James Wiseman who completed the construction of both stations in December 1879.|$|E

25|$|A {{lighthouse}} at Pine Islet {{was first}} proposed {{in a report}} to the Queensland Parliament on 26 July 1881, by Commander George Poynter Heath, the first Portmaster of Queensland. A second proposal was made by Heath in a report on 18 August 1882. Tenders were called at the end of June 1883 tenders were called, for the construction of lighthouse and lighthouse keeper cottages, for both Pine Islet Light and Double Island Point Light. The contract for both lightstations, for the cost of £6900, was awarded to W. P. Clark, who already constructed Queensland's first lighthouse since Queensland's formation, Bustard <b>Head</b> <b>Light</b> (in 1868), and who was also awarded the contract for Low Isles Light in 1877 and for Cape Cleveland Light and Dent Island Light in 1878.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} a {{lighthouse}} at Cape Cleveland arose with proclamation of Cleveland Bay as a port of entry in 1865, {{and the development of}} Townsville into a major port. From its beginning, the lighthouse was closely related to the Dent Island Light. The construction of both lighthouses was recommended by Commander George Poynter Heath, the Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board, in February 1878. The lighthouses were formally approved in April 1878 and tenders for the construction of both stations, each including a lighthouse and two keepers' cottages, were called in May 1878 and closed in June 1878.

25|$|In 1881 or 1882 Heath made {{a report}} to the Parliament stating the need for the lighthouse. In 1883 he made a visit to the island and {{realised}} that the original planned location, halfway up the point, would result in a light that would not be visible to the north. He advised that the lighthouse will be constructed at the summit of the point, with a 3rd Order light, a more powerful light than originally planned, and advise which was accepted. Plans were made by the Queensland Colonial Architect's Office, {{and at the end of}} June 1883 tenders were called, for the construction of the lighthouse and lighthouse keeper cottages, for both Double Island Point Light and c. The contract for both lightstations, for the cost of £6900, was awarded to W. P.
