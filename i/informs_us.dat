25|$|In {{spite of}} his stature as a historian, modern historians know {{relatively}} little about Thucydides's life. The most reliable information comes from his own History of the Peloponnesian War, which expounds his nationality, paternity and native locality. Thucydides <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> that he fought in the war, contracted the plague and was exiled by the democracy. He may have also been involved in quelling the Samian Revolt.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, Carr <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> that Mommsen's multivolume work Römische Geschichte (Leipzig 1854–1856) {{may tell}} the {{perceptive}} modern historian much about mid-19th-century Germany, {{while it is}} presenting an account of ancient Rome. A major recent event in Germany was {{the failure of the}} 1848–1849 Revolution, while in Mommsen's Roman History his narration of the Republic draws to a close with the revolutionary emergence of a strong state executive in the figure of Julius Caesar. Carr conjectures as follows.|$|E
25|$|However, Haufniensis {{mentions}} that anxiety {{is a way}} for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E

25|$|Herodotus {{wrote his}} Histories in the Ionian dialect, {{yet he was}} born in Halicarnassus, which was a Dorian settlement. According to the Suda, Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and {{grandson}} of Artemisia. The Suda also <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so {{there is no need to}} assume (like the Suda) that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere. Further, the Suda is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely {{for the fun of}} watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{believe that}} a state statute would be {{consistent}} with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E

25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics {{and in the way}} that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing fast and loose with dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E
25|$|Sedgwick's first {{publication}} was The New England Tale. The author <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> in the preface, {{that the story}} was commenced as a religious tract, and that it gradually grew in her hands, beyond the proper limits of such a work. Finding {{this to be the}} case, she abandoned all design of publication but finished the tale for her own amusement. Once finished, however, £he opinions and solicitations of her friends prevailed over her own earnest wishes, and the volume was published in 1822. The original intention of this book led the author to give special prominence to topics of a questionable character for a professed novel, and the unfavourable portraiture which she gives of New England Puritanism, brought some censure upon her. The limited plan of the story did not give the opportunity for the display of that extent and variety of power which appear in some of her later productions. Still, it contains passages of stirring eloquence, as well as of deep tenderness, that compares favourably with her other writings. Perhaps the chief value of The New England Tale was its effect upon the author herself. Its publication broke the ice of diffidence and indifference, and launched her career.|$|E

He further suggests a site, 'Dunnichen Moss' (...) , to the east of the village, which he <b>informs</b> <b>us</b> had recently been drained but can be seen in old maps as a small lake. Earlier local tradition, related by Headrick in the Second Statistical Account, claimed that the site was the location of the Battle of Camlann, where King Arthur fought Mordred.|$|E
