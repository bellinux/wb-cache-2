Rhodesian sailors in the Royal, South African and Merchant Navies crewed ships <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, including the Indian Ocean, the Arctic and the Pacific. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron operated in Iran and Iraq in 1942–43, guarding oil wells and pipelines and supporting the British Tenth Army.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the process}} to distill {{kerosene}} from petroleum was invented by Abraham Gesner. The demand for the petroleum as a fuel for lighting around the world quickly grew. Petroleum exploration developed <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world with the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, taking the lead in production {{by the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Native grasses thrive <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{monument}} despite {{competition from}} medusahead rye, Dalmatian toadflax, cheatgrass, and other invasive species. Bunchgrasses {{in the park}} include basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, among others. Native grasses that form sod {{in parts of the}} monument include Sandberg's bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E

5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Another commercial source, far {{less important than}} barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to {{a significant reduction in}} work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E

5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management {{practices such as}} cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time {{with the use of}} draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, but with {{the realization of the}} important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E

However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely because of persecution by farmers.

5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} {{has been}} done <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, by both Western and Eastern empires.

While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One {{of the most striking}} examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E

5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this.

5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E
