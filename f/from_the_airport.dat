5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to the city center, and 10 minutes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed {{as part of the}} light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E
