25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. <b>Forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E

2500|$|Contrast this to {{when the}} die block {{is at the bottom}} of the {{expansion}} link (7), giving maximum steam injection and exhaust. This is the most powerful forward setting and is used in accelerating forward from rest. Conversely when the die block is at the top of the expansion link (7), maximal power in reverse is obtained. (On some engines the die block was in the top of the link in <b>forward</b> <b>gear.</b> This type was generally used on tank engines, which worked in forward and reverse equally.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Simpson gearset is {{now more}} or less obsolete. Other gearsets can make 4 <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> with just two planetaries. Most modern {{gearboxes}} employ the Ravigneaux planetary gearset design, which produces 4 <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> from a single set, or a Lepelletier gearset which provides 6 or more <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> by adding another standard planetary to the Ravigneaux gearset.|$|R

It's based on the Ukrainian T-55AGM and is almost identical {{with the exception of}} the engine, the main armament, Fire Control System with 1G46M gunner sight, PKN-5 Commander sight, and both integrated with the Buran - Catherine Thermal sight, air conditioned system, Deflek Ceramic special alloy steel armor, and Nosh explosive reactive armor. The tank is powered by the new 5TDFMA two-stroke liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons developing 1,050hp and has maximum speed of over 75km/h on the road in <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> and over 35km/h in the reverse gear. The main armament is the 125mm KBM-1M 48 caliber smoothbore gun capable of firing conventional ammunition with enhanced performance which can destroy modern tanks from a range of up to 3,500 m (APFSDS and HEAT-TANDEM) and barrel-launched [...] which have a penetration of 800mm RHAe after ERA and are capable of destroying modern tanks from a distance up to 5,000 m. The gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds. The gun has a normal recoil length of 26–30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. Is not being considered as an option for upgrade by the Peruvian Army.|$|E
2500|$|First run in 1937, the R-2800 was the United States's first 18-cylinder {{radial engine}} design. The Double Wasp was more {{powerful}} than the world's only other modern eighteen, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442in³ (56.4L). (The American Wright Duplex-Cyclone radial of 3,347in³ (54.86L) was also under development at the time, and promised to be {{more powerful than}} either the P or Gnome-Rhone radials.) The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head {{in such a way that}} the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins. [...] The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> reduction housing and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the [...] "outboard" [...] sides of the distributor casings.|$|E

50|$|An {{automatic}} transmission, {{also called}} auto, self-shifting transmission, n-speed automatic (where n is its number of <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios), or AT, {{is a type}} of motor vehicle transmission that can automatically change gear ratios as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a range of speed and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The number of <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual).|$|E
50|$|A {{reverse gear}} {{implemented}} this way makes a loud whining sound, {{which is not}} normally heard in the <b>forward</b> <b>gears.</b> The teeth on the <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> of most consumer automobiles are helically cut. When helical gears rotate, there is constant contact between gears, which results in quiet operation. In spite of all <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> being always meshed, they do not make a sound {{that can be easily}} heard above the engine noise. By contrast, most reverse gears are spur gears, meaning that they have straight teeth, in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.|$|R
50|$|The Simpson {{planetary}} gearset {{consists of two}} {{planetary gearset}}s, both having the same gears and gear ratios. It was employed in automatic transmissions. It {{was one of the}} several designs invented by American engineer Howard Simpson. A Simpson gearset delivers three <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> and one reverse, plus neutral. Actually there are four <b>forward</b> <b>gears,</b> but two of them have exactly the same ratio, so there are three distinct gears. Third gear is always direct drive (1:1).|$|R

50|$|The turn is {{achieved}} by transferring {{the momentum of the}} car by reversing quickly in a straight line then turning the wheel sharply while using the foot brake to lock the front wheels. The driver changes into a <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> as the nose comes about.|$|E
50|$|The 5R55E, though {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the 4-speed 4R55E, was {{a new breed of}} electronically controlled automatic transmission with an additional <b>forward</b> <b>gear.</b> It was the first 5-speed automatic transmission to be employed by an American automaker. The 5R55E featured more precise computer controls (necessary to accommodate the additional <b>forward</b> <b>gear)</b> and introduced with a sophisticated friction-to-friction shift ability. Like the 4R44E relative to the 4R55E, a version of the 5R55E was made for lighter duty applications: the 5R44E. An example of these transmissions used in a single vehicle line would be in recent versions of the Ford Ranger pickup where the lighter-duty 5R44E is mated to a 3.0L Vulcan OHV V6 while the heavier duty 5R55E is mated to the more powerful 4.0 L Cologne SOHC V6.|$|E
50|$|The {{shift from}} third to fourth gear locked the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> assembly, {{producing}} 1.00:1 transmission. The fluid coupling now only handled about 25 {{percent of the}} engine torque, reducing slippage to a negligible amount. The result was a remarkably efficient level of power transfer at highway speeds, something that torque converter equipped automatics could not achieve {{without the benefit of}} a converter clutch.|$|E
5000|$|A typical manual {{transmission}} vehicle, with (for example) five <b>forward</b> <b>gears,</b> will thus have seven possible positions: the five <b>forwards</b> <b>gears,</b> reverse gear, and a central [...] "neutral" [...] position. Some vehicles {{have a special}} button to prevent accidental engagement of reverse. Others require that the lever be lifted, pressed down, or moved with extra force to engage reverse. In transmissions with reverse directly below fifth, {{there may be a}} mechanical lock-out preventing selection of reverse other than from neutral, thus preventing a driver used to a six-speed transmission from engaging reverse while trying to select sixth.|$|R

5000|$|In 1988, the Shadow {{introduced}} an 800 powered model. Dubbed the [...] "VT800C", this bike remained largely unchanged {{except for the}} amount of <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> moved down to four.|$|R
50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} often {{feature a}} driver-operated clutch and a movable gear stick. Most automobile manual transmissions allow {{the driver to}} select any <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratio ("gear") at any time, but some, such as those commonly mounted on motorcycles and some types of racing cars, only allow the driver to select the next-higher or next-lower gear. This type of transmission is sometimes called a sequential manual transmission.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{transmission}} upshifted to second gear, the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> assembly locked and the input torus now ran at engine speed. This had the desirable effect of [...] "tightening" [...] the coupling and reducing slippage, but unfortunately also produced a somewhat abrupt shift. It wasn't at all uncommon for {{the vehicle to}} lurch forward during the 1-2 shift, especially when the throttle was wide open.|$|E
50|$|A {{right-handed}} propeller (which rotates clockwise {{viewed from}} the stern when in <b>forward</b> <b>gear)</b> will tend to push {{the stern of the}} boat to starboard, thereby pushing the bow to port and turning the boat counter-clockwise unless the rotation is corrected for.When in reverse gear, the effect will be much greater and opposite. A right-handed propeller run in reverse will push the aft of the boat to port.|$|E
5000|$|On {{introduction}} of the Fastrac this style of gearbox had 18 <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> (6x3) and 6 reverse (6x1). This were organised as 6 manual gears in each of 3 ranges (Low, Medium and High). The range box also selected reverse giving 6 reverse gears with speeds similar to medium in <b>forwards.</b> All <b>gear</b> changes were made {{with the use of}} a dry clutch.|$|R

5000|$|This gearbox {{then had}} a 2 speed {{powershift}} section added after the dry clutch and before the 6 speed gearbox. This resulted in 36 <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> (2x6x3) and 12 reverse (2x6x1).|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} 5-speed {{manual transmission}} {{is often the}} standard equipment in a base-model car, while more expensive manual vehicles are usually equipped with a 6-speed transmission instead; other options include automatic transmissions such as a traditional automatic (hydraulic planetary) transmission (often a manumatic), a semi-automatic transmission, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The number of <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios is often expressed for automatic transmissions as well (e.g., 9-speed automatic).|$|E
50|$|A {{multiple}} tandem layout {{was used}} on some military jet aircraft during the 1950s, pioneered by the Martin XB-51, and later used on such aircraft as the U-2, Myasishchev M-4, Yakovlev Yak-25, Yak-28 and the B-47 Stratojet {{because it allows}} room for a large internal bay between the main wheels. A variation of the multi tandem layout is also used on the B-52 Stratofortress which has four main wheel bogies (two forward and two aft) underneath the fuselage and a small outrigger wheel supporting each wing-tip. The B-52's landing gear is also unique in that all four pairs of main wheels can be steered. This allows the landing gear to line up with the runway and thus makes crosswind landings easier (using a technique called crab landing). Since tandem aircraft cannot rotate for takeoff, the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> must be long enough to give the wings the correct angle of attack during takeoff. During landing, the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> must not touch the runway first, otherwise the rear gear will slam down and cause the aircraft to bounce off the runway.|$|E
50|$|All {{configurations}} of the Rhino use a constantly variable transmission (CVT) design with a subtransmission assembly providing two <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> selections (high and low range), a reverse gear, and a neutral position. Yamaha's unique CVT design differed from most other CVT designs {{at the time}} in that the Ultramatic separated the clutch and drive functions from each other. This design allows the Rhino (and all Yamaha Ultramatic ATVs) to eliminate the problem of belt failure due to excessive slipping.|$|E
50|$|The BA-64 {{consisted}} of the chassis of a GAZ-64 or GAZ-67 jeep modified to accept an armoured hull. The jeep chassis required some alterations to accept the hull; for example, the cooling, fuel, and electrical systems had to be relocated while the rear suspension was braced to accommodate the additional weight. Suspension consists of semi-elliptical springs front and rear, and steering is restricted to the front wheels. A BA-64's gearbox initially had one reverse and three <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> on a two-speed transfer case, although a few models appear to have one reverse and four <b>forward</b> <b>gears</b> and no transfer case.|$|R
