50|$|The timebase is an {{electronic}} circuit that generates a ramp voltage. This is a voltage that changes continuously and linearly with time. When it reaches a predefined value the ramp is reset and settles to its starting value. When a trigger event is recognized, provided the reset process (<b>holdoff)</b> is complete, the ramp starts again. The timebase voltage usually drives the horizontal amplifier. Its {{effect is to}} sweep the screen end of the electron beam at a constant speed {{from left to right}} across the screen, then blank the beam and return its deflection voltages to the left, so to speak, in time to begin the next sweep. Typical sweep circuits can take significant time to reset; in some CROs, fast sweeps required more time to retrace than to sweep.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The IEEE 802. 16 {{mesh network}} is a {{promising}} next-generation wireless backbone network. In such a network, set-ting the <b>holdoff</b> time for nodes {{is essential to}} achieving good performances of medium-access-control-layer scheduling. In this paper, we propose a two-phase <b>holdoff</b> time setting scheme to improve network utilization. Both static and dynamic approaches of this scheme are proposed, and their performances are compared against those of the original schemes. Our simulation results show that both approaches significantly increase the utilization of the control-plane bandwidth and decrease {{the time required to}} estab-lish data schedules. In addition, both approaches provide efficient and fair scheduling for IEEE 802. 16 mesh networks and generate good application performances.

40|$|There are two {{different}} horn systems under construction at Fermilab for neutrino beamlines. The NuMI project requires a power supply that operates at 970 V, 205 kA, 2. 6 ms, and 0. 53 pps. The MiniBooNE project requires a power supply that operates at 5. 5 kV, 170 kA, 140 {micro}s and 5 pps. Both require long low inductance connections between the power supply and horn; 60 feet for MiniBooNE and 230 feet for NuMI. This paper discusses several electrical and mechanical design requirements that have been overcome. These include low impedance, radiation hardness, voltage <b>holdoff,</b> clamping for electrical and mechanical connections and humidity and dust control.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{synchronization}} message oscillations (SMO) {{has been observed}} in certain specific SONET ring architectures involving network elements (NE) timed by external BITS clocks. Some solutions suggested {{in the past have}} been the use of source traceability by way of extended messaging schemes on the ESF link, the use of <b>holdoff</b> timers (including the Delay on the DUS), the use of a persistence detection scheme, to name a few. In this contribution, simulation studies are done to evaluate the use of the <b>holdoff</b> timer for the DUS message. The results of these simulations indicate that the use of delay on the DUS does not remove the oscillations. Consequently, it is proposed that the rule for delaying the DUS be studied more carefully and be made an option instead of a requirement in the living list on SSMs. ************************************************************************************************ NOTICE This document has been prepared to assist the Standard Committee T 1 Telecommu [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a methodological study is {{presented}} for the optimal {{design of a}} vacuum feedthrough {{to be used in}} HV direct current, with high electrical performances in terms of <b>holdoff</b> voltage. From general guidelines, widely described in the literature and relevant to simpler geometric configurations, summarized in few basic rules useful to design vacuum insulators, the authors have sketched an optimal insulator profile for a cylindrical axisymmetrical arrangement. The adopted assumptions have been validated by means of numerical tools based on Charge Simulation Method and Finite Difference Method. A prototype feedthrough has been realised matching the constraints about the field distribution achieved theoretically with the technological ones due to the manufacturing process.

This technique uses jets of a liquid conductor to replace the solid metal fuses in exploding-fuse opening-switch designs. High-power switching characteristics such as interrupt current, <b>holdoff</b> voltage, and resistance change are presented, along with information on how these characteristics change as jet length and circuit parameters are varied. A simulated load is used to demonstrate that exploding liquid-metal jets are feasible replacements for solid-fuse conductors in realistic applications. Likewise, the switching facility has been rep-rated in a two-pulse scenario to show its primary advantage over solid-fuse switches.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reduce the media access delay in a WiMAX mesh network. We observe that as the number of {{subscriber}} stations (SS) in a neighborhood increases, the processes of transmission opportunity (TO) competition and 3 - way handshake are easy to fail. This may degrade transmission efficiency and increase packet transmission delay. Besides, the minislot allocation defined in the WiMAX mesh mode may cause many lower priority services reserve earlier minislots than that of higher priority services like rtPS. This may cause great negative impact on delay-sensitive traffic. In this paper, we design a QoS classifier to enqueue packets according to different QoS service classes, present a dynamic <b>holdoff</b> exponent mechanism to reduce control subframe delay, and propose a Neighborhood-Based Minislot Allocation (NBMA) mechanism to reduce data subframe delay. Simulations show that the proposed methodology outperforms that of IEEE 802. 16 and Baye's DynExp in delay, jitter and throughput...|$|E
40|$|Quality of Service {{provisioning}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} design goals of IEEE 802. 16 mesh networks. In order to provide quality delivery of delay sensitive services such as voice, video etc., it is required to route such traffic over a minimum delay path. In this paper we propose a routing metric for delay sensitive services in IEEE 802. 16 mesh networks. We design a new cross layer routing metric, namely Expected Scheduler Delay (ESD), based on <b>HoldOff</b> exponent and the current load at each node of the network. This proposed metric takes into account the expected theoretical end-to-end delay of routing paths as well as network congestion to find the best suited path. We propose an efficient distributed scheme to calculate ESD and route the packets using source routing mechanism based on ESD. The simulation results demonstrate that our metric achieves reduced delay compared to a standard scheme used in IEEE 802. 16 mesh, that takes hop count to find the path.

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high energy density}} of inductive energy storage systems make them quite attractive for many pulsed power applications. For these systems, an opening switch is necessary to transfer the stored energy to the load. Exploding wire opening switches are often employed in these applications. However, one serious limitation to exploding wire switches is their selfdestructive nature. Because the conductor is destroyed when the switch opens, the repetition rate of the switch is limited by how quickly the conductor can be replaced, typically by some mechanical means. However, if the conductor were a liquid metal extruded {{from one of the}} electrodes, the repetition rate would be primarily limited by the velocity of the metal jet, the electrode spacing, and the time required for the plasma to clear the channel. In this research, we are investigating the potential of liquid mercury jets as the switching medium in exploding wire switches. This paper will describe the experimental setup as well as present the results of preliminary experiments. The DC characteristics and jet stability of single jets as a function of length, diameter, and velocity for simple nozzle/electrode designs will be presented. Switching characteristics such as interrupt current, <b>holdoff</b> voltage, and rep-rate potential will also be presented.
