50|$|The Court {{rejected}} the argument by the Board. The Court {{noted that the}} rating criteria under <b>diagnostic</b> <b>code</b> 7800 was entirely cosmetic in nature, while the rating criteria under 7804 dealt only with the pain associated with the scarring itself. Additionally, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>code</b> 5325 only dealt with facial muscle damage resulting in difficulty with mastication. Therefore, his symptomatology was distinct and separate, thereby not in violation of 38. C.F.R. §4.14. For these reasons, the Court held that the Veteran was entitled to separate evaluations under all three diagnostic codes, as none of the symptomatology for {{any one of the}} three conditions were duplicative or overlapping of the other two conditions.|$|E

25|$|The first 4.0 {{engines in}} 1987 had a RENIX (Renault/Bendix) engine {{management}} system considered quite advanced for their time. A knock sensor allowed the ECU to control spark advance in response to fuel octane and engine load. Unfortunately, there are few scan tools capable of interfacing with the system to pull <b>diagnostics</b> <b>codes.</b> RENIX systems also have no permanent memory for <b>diagnostics</b> <b>codes</b> thus making the diagnosis of intermittent problems more difficult.|$|R

50|$|Finally, by today's standards, {{the system}} would be {{considered}} very slow, due partly to the limited hardware of the time, and partly to a poorly implemented file system; saving a large file could take minutes.

In the multicenter cohort, we retrieved <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes</b> and medication data from four university health systems across Chicago. In the single center cohort, we prospectively screened for depressive symptoms (NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, PROMIS, T Score[*]≥[*] 60), at one, three and twelve months after ICH onset.

50|$|The Court {{noted that}} the very effects of the veteran’s PTSD {{symptoms}} that he asserted as having kept him from receiving a promotion, such as impaired judgment and inability to maintain effective working relationship, are criteria described as occupational impairments that are used for evaluating mental disorders under <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Code</b> 9411, and not earmarks of an exceptional or unusual disability picture with marked interference with employment.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1960s, [...] "childhood schizophrenia" [...] {{became known}} as a [...] "heterogeneous mixture" [...] of {{different}} disorders, such as autism, symbiotic psychosis, and dementia infantilis. Childhood schizophrenia was not directly added to the DSM until 1968, when it {{was added to the}} DSM-II, which set forth diagnostic criteria similar to that of adult schizophrenia. “Schizophrenia, childhood type” was a DSM-II diagnosis with <b>diagnostic</b> <b>code</b> 295.8*.

As an alternative, the diagnosis personality disorder not otherwise specified, remains {{in use in}} for the DSM-5. A classification proposed for future versions is the personality disorder-trait specified (PD-TS). Some researchers and theorists continue to use the DSM-III-R criteria.

The criteria were changed in the DSM-5. In the DSM-IV nosology, polysubstance dependence (<b>diagnostic</b> <b>code</b> 304.80) indicated that the use of any one of the substances did not meet the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence while the combined use of the drugs did meet substance dependence diagnostic criteria.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{estimates}} of depression recognition {{in primary care}} are low and inconsistent. This {{may be due to}} registration artifacts and limited extraction efforts. This study investigated a) whether GPs' medical records demonstrate an accurate recognition of depression and b) which combinations of indications within the record most accurately reflect a diagnosis of depression. Methods: GPs' registrations were compared with a reference standard, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), according to DSM-IV criteria. Six definitions of GPs' recognition of depression were tested using <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes,</b> medication data, referral data and free text in the medical records. The Youden-index was used to select the optimal definition of recognition. Data were derived from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. 816 primary care patients from 33 general practitioners were included in the vicinities of Amsterdam and Leiden, The Netherlands. Results: Registration of antidepressant prescriptions was the best single indicator of GPs' recognition of CIDI depression with a recognition rate of 0. 43. The best combination of indicators increased the recognition rate to 0. 69. All indications except the specific <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes</b> for ‘depressive disorder’ and ‘depressive feelings’ were included in this definition. Limitations: Potential bias due to the selection of participating GPs might have influenced our recognition rates. Conclusion: GPs are aware of mental health problems in most depressed patients, but labeling with specific <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes</b> is weak. Researchers should consider that <b>diagnostic</b> <b>coding</b> alone is not an accurate measure of the diagnostic ability of depression and strongly underestimates the accuracy of the GP...|$|R
50|$|Hallucinogen {{persisting}} perception disorder (HPPD) is {{a disorder}} {{characterized by a}} continual presence of sensory disturbances, most commonly visual, that are reminiscent of those generated {{by the use of}} hallucinogenic substances. Many of the characteristics of this disorder can be mistaken for anxiety or panic related disorders by physicians. Previous use of hallucinogens by the person is necessary, but not sufficient, for diagnosis of HPPD. For an individual to be diagnosed with HPPD, the symptoms cannot be due to another medical condition. HPPD is distinct from flashbacks by reason of its relative permanence; while flashbacks are transient, HPPD is persistent. HPPD is a DSM-5 diagnosis with <b>diagnostic</b> <b>code</b> 292.89 (F16.983).|$|E
5000|$|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) classifies klismaphilia {{under the}} {{diagnosis}} of [...] "Paraphilias, Not Otherwise Specified". The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>code</b> is 302.9. Proactive treatment for klismaphilics is not generally recommended, {{due to the lack}} of any significant desire to be [...] "cured". Health treatment for klismaphilia thus is typically only focused on ensuring the techniques employed and chemicals used are not harmful to the practitioner. Caution should always be maintained on the part of the practitioners experimenting with new techniques and concoctions; in certain cases cramps produced by the chemicals used have led to hospitalizations, in other circumstances the effects can even be life-threatening.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the accuracy of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>coding</b> in general surgery in a district general hospital, the North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust (NSHT), Stoke-on-Trent. An assessment was carried out by comparison between codes ascribed by hospital coders and expert external coders. Patients who had a finished consultant episode (FCE) in the specialty of general surgery at NSHT were included in the study. The sampling frame was general surgery FCEs at NSHT purchased by North Staffordshire Health Authority (NSHA) with an episode end date between 1 May 1995 and 31 December 1995. Every 15 th record was sampled. Of 455 records sampled, 157 (35 %) were in active use and were excluded but not replaced; therefore, 298 (65 %) records were studied in detail. Outcome was measured by the accuracy of primary <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes</b> ranked 1, 2, 3, 4, from highest to lowest levels of inaccuracy; a description of where errors occurred in the data cycle was recorded. Errors were found in 87 / 298 (29 %) records; 25 / 298 (8 %) records had an error at the highest level (i. e. wrong ICD- 10 chapter), and 44 / 298 (15 %) at the third level. Of the errors, 68 / 87 (78 %) occurred between the medical record and the admission form. A substantial percentage (29 %) of records had inaccurate <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes.</b> It is concluded that coding should be carried out from the medical record rather than from the admission form (KMR 1). The proportion of records with errors suggests that a routine data coding audit would be useful to improve the accuracy of routine <b>diagnostic</b> <b>codes...</b>|$|R
