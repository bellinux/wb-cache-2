50|$|Children who are prelingually {{deaf and}} cannot hear noise beneath 60 decibels—about the {{intensity}} {{level of a}} vacuum cleaner—don't develop oral language comparable to their peers. Children born with profound hearing impairment, 90 decibels and above (about {{the level of a}} food blender), are classified as functionally deaf. These children do not develop speech and language skills without help from a speech pathologist. Such children acquire language comprehension difficulties, even when other modes of language (such as writing and signing) are up to their age level standard. Generally, prelingual deaf individuals have reading levels that do not exceed the level of a fourth grader's. Children who lose their hearing after they have acquired some amount of language, even if it is <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while,</b> demonstrate <b>a</b> much higher level of linguistic achievement than those who have not had any language exposure.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} part, Collins said: [...] "I got offered the guest role in Casualty very soon after {{finishing}} Corrie. I {{jumped at the}} chance of playing a character so different so quickly - it was exciting to be stepping into something new. Playing Stella was great fun but it was thrilling to have a challenge of an entirely different role. Londoner Samantha is nothing like Stella - I dyed my hair to leave Stella behind which fitted in well with the role. I'm pleased to be involved in another hit drama TV show so soon, even if it's <b>just</b> for <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while.</b> Since leaving Corrie it's been great to get my teeth into different characters and I'm looking forward to new opportunities which have been coming my way." [...] Casualty's executive producer Oliver Kent added: [...] "We can't wait for everyone to meet Samantha and see where her story goes over the two months she's on screen. Michelle has been absolutely brilliant and her arrival is set to have a huge impact on one of the show's most loved characters." ...|$|R

5000|$|... 1985 - As the {{previous}} method of lighting the Y was long considered hazardous (due {{to the potential}} wildland fire risk) {{and because of the}} brief amount of time the Y would actually remain lit, it was discontinued after the lighting in the spring of 1985. A generator and strands of lights were purchased for exclusive use on the Y, with up to 14 strands of the 25-watt lights bulbs being needed to outline the Y. These lights (first used for homecoming in the fall of 1985) provide several hours of much brighter light and allow the Y to be lit for several consecutive nights in celebration of each event rather than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> on a single evening. Initially, the lights and generator were dropped off and picked up by helicopter before and after each event, but after several years an old military ammunition bunker was installed on the mountainside near the Y to securely store the equipment when not in use.|$|E

50|$|In 1800, {{as part of}} {{the secret}} Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain, who had been {{defeated}} in the Napoleonic Wars, was forced to return Louisiana to France. France regained Louisiana in 1802, two years later. This treaty did not establish the borders of Louisiana, which would lead to issues <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> later. In early 1803, diplomat James Monroe was sent to France to negotiate purchasing Louisiana from France. Louisiana was bought from France later that year. This was known as the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. The northeastern part of Texas was thought {{to be included in the}} purchase. There was no official border between Louisiana and Texas, which caused disputes between Spain and the United States. In 1806, United States General James Wilkinson and Spanish Lieutenant Colonel Simón de Herrera attempted to negotiate establishing a border between the two nations. On November 5, 1806, an agreement was made to establish a Neutral territory between the two countries. The neutral territory did not have official borders, and the Caddo Lake area was likely located within the territory. Because the territory was not possessed by either nation, neither of them could enforce laws in the territory, so it became popular with outlaws and escaped slaves. In both 1810 and 1812, the two nations sent joint military expeditions into the Neutral Territory to expel the outlaws inhabiting it.|$|E
5000|$|Kvarven {{surrendered}} at ca. 07.00 am {{after a short}} infantry {{battle between}} the German landing forces and Krag-Jørgensen rifle armed gun crews from the fort.Defence by use of torpedoes was also possible, as Kvarven held {{one of only two}} land-based torpedo batteries in Norway at the time, and, after the alarm from detection of German attack at Oslo had gone out, a torpedo boat was maneuvering into position nearby. The other land-based torpedo battery, at Oscarsborg Fortress, defended Oslo against the simultaneous German invasion there and featured underwater release of its torpedoes. It was unknown to German military intelligence. Two obsolete torpedoes from the Oscarsborg Fortress fired at 4:34 am finished off gun-damaged German heavy cruiser Blücher, which finally sank at 07:30 am, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>while</b> after the Karven fort surrendered. The Karven torpedo battery, on the other hand, was designed to launch its torpedoes by torpedo tube from above ground, and presumably the Germans could have known about it and planned countermeasures in some way, and in fact their landings on both sides of Korven were likely part of that. But according to a Norwegian military history website, no torpedoes in the battery could be fired, because all were missing their fuses and gyroscopes. Another nearby line of the torpedo defense was just then available: torpedo boat Brand, with fully functioning torpedoes, had moved into an excellent position in the Gravdalsviken inlet partly defined by Kvarven's peninsula, just past, where it would have a 700-1000 meter firing shot opportunity on passing German ships, and it could likely have sunk one or more German ships. But the boat's commander inexplicably chose not to fire any torpedoes and to abandon the boat, instead. [...] The Brand was used with success by the Germans, with some immunity from air attacks because of confusion on its identity, during the next few days, and also was useful for the duration of their occupation of Norway.|$|E
