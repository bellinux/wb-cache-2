As the underlying gas-sensing mechanism is still a matter of question, thermogravimetric analysis was performed on high-density (>= 99 %) SrTi 0. 6 Fe 0. 4 O(3 -delta) ceramic specimens in order to investigate whether bulk properties are affected by the catalytic oxidation of propane at the material surface. At temperatures 250 - 400 degrees C, bulk oxygen content was found to significantly decrease upon exposure to traces of propane (0 - 3000 ppm) in a background of 20 % O- 2 / 80 % Ar. Lattice oxygen is sufficiently mobile in this compound so that reducing surface reactions are followed by a bulk redox reaction even at low or moderate temperatures. Concomitant changes in the electrical resistance of dense ceramics are consistent with this picture. The hydrocarbon sensitivity of SrTi 0. 6 Fe 0. 40 O(3 -delta) artifacts seems thus to a large extent to be correlated to modifications in the bulk defect chemistry of the material.

They even can affect to the human beings, when they consume products that have been in contact with the hydrocarbons. After a hydrocarbon spillage, the fishing activity, the tourism, the safety and the wildlife are endangered. The fast detection is very important in order to start as soon as possible the cleaning tasks. It can be done using sensor networks. The first step in order to create a water quality monitoring system is to obtain a good <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>sensor.</b> The sensor must be robust and cheap.

The main focus {{was to bring}} together 29 workshop participants-representing workshop managers, scientists, and technology developers - together to discuss current and future hydrocarbon in-situ, laboratory, and remote sensors as they apply to oil spill prevention and response. [PDF contains 28 pages] Hydrocarbons and their derivatives still remain {{one of the most}} important energy sources in the world. To effectively manage these energy sources, proper protocol must be implemented to ensure prevention and responses to oil spills, as there are significant economic and environmental costs when oil spills occur. Hydrocarbon sensors provide the means to detect and monitor oil spills before, during, and after they occur. Capitalizing on the properties of oil, developers have designed in-situ, laboratory, and remote sensors that absorb or reflect the electromagnetic energy at different spectral bands. Workshop participants identified current hydrocarbon sensors (in-situ, laboratory, and remote sensors) and their overall performance. To achieve the most comprehensive understanding of oil spills, multiple sensors will be needed to gather oil spill extent, location, movement, thickness, condition, and classification. No single <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>sensor</b> has the capability to collect all this information. Participants, therefore, suggested the development of means to combine sensor equipment to effectively and rapidly establish a spill response. As the exploration of oil continues at polar latitudes, sensor equipment must be developed to withstand harsh arctic climates, be able to detect oil under ice, and reduce the need for ground teams because ice extent is far too large of an area to cover. Participants also recognized the need for ground teams because ice extent is far too large of an area to cover. Participants also recognized the need for the U. S. to adopt a multi-agency cooperation for oil spill response, as the majority of issues surounding oil spill response focuses not on the hydrocarbon sensors but on an effective contingency plan adopted by all agencies. It is recommended that the U. S. could model contingency planning based on other nations such as Germany and Norway. Workshop participants were asked to make recommendations at the conclusion of the workshop and are summarized below without prioritization: *Outreach materials must be delivered to funding sources and Congressional delegates regarding the importance of oil spill prevention and response and the development of proper sensors to achieve effective response. *Develop protocols for training resource managers as new sensors become available. *Develop or adopt standard instrument specifications and testing protocols to assist manufacturers in further developing new sensor technology. *As oil exploration continues at polar latitudes, more research and development should be allocated to develop a suite of instruments that are applicable to oil detection under ice. ...|$|E

The signals produced by this nose could be analyzed to determine the constituents of the emission stream. Although commercial electronic noses for near-room temperature applications exist, they often depend significantly on lower temperature materials or only one sensor type. A separate development effort necessary for a high-temperature electronic nose is being undertaken by the NASA Glenn Research Center, Case Western Reserve University, Ohio State University, and Makel Engineering, Inc. The sensors are specially designed for hightemperature environments. A first-generation high-temperature electronic nose has been demonstrated on a modified automotive engine. This nose sensor array was composed of sensors designed for hightemperature environments fabricated using microelectromechanical-systems- (MEMS-) based technology. The array included a tin-oxide-based sensor doped for nitrogen oxide (NOx) sensitivity, a SiC-based <b>hydrocarbon</b> (CxHy) <b>sensor,</b> and an oxygen sensor (O 2). These sensors operate on different principles [...] resistor, diode, and electrochemical cell, respectively [...] and each sensor has very different responses to the individual gases in the environment. A picture showing the sensor head for the array is shown in the photograph on the left and the sensors installed in the engine are shown in the photograph on the right. Electronics are interfaced with the sensors for temperature control and signal conditioning, and packaging designed for high temperatures is necessary for the array to survive the engine environment...|$|R
40|$|Permanent {{reservoir}} monitoring (PRM) is {{an emerging}} market with significant {{potential in the}} oil and gas industrials, where data from several thousand pressure and acceleration sensors are used to monitor the condition of an underground <b>hydrocarbon</b> reservoir. Fibre-optic <b>sensor</b> arrays offer significant potential benefits, and highly efficient multiplexing and telemetry architectures can combine the several thousand sensors onto just a few fibres, the fewer the better. This study presents a novel, high performance interferometric fibre-optic sensor array using a distributed erbium doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) within a hybrid time and wavelength division multiplexed (TDM/DWDM) architecture, to reduce the multiplexing loss and {{to increase the number of}} sensors per fibre pair. The performance of the new heavily multiplexed sensor array is characterised, both theoretically and experimentally, which demonstrates its significant advantages in multiplexing level, insertion loss and interconnecting fibre count compared with the previous state of the art. The amplification behaviour of a single stage EDFA is first modelled. The key properties of the doped fibre are validated by experimental comparison with simulations. This allows definition of general design guidelines for interferometric multiplexed sensor systems incorporating a distributed EDFA. The author also presents an analytical approach to accurately model the phase sensitivity in such systems. The model incorporates the various key noise contributions and also defines a novel term ‘Demod phase sensitivity’ to take into account the effects of noise aliasing in TDM based architectures. Furthermore, the author configures and characterizes sensor networks of increasing scale: 1) a 4 -wavelength sensor network, 2) 16 -wavelength sensor networks with 4 active, and 12 idle channels, 3) a 16 -wavelength sensor network with real TDM groups, 4) 16 TDMx 16 WDM and 64 TDMx 16 WDM sensor networks, and finally a study of crosstalk effects is presented. Both the simulation and experimental results show that, the network can address up to 64 × 16 sensors, along one single fibre pair, and can support up to 256 x 16 within an acceptable phase sensitivity for many applications. This work provides a novel, efficient and low-cost sensor array design to meet the significant demands of the current commercial PRM market.
