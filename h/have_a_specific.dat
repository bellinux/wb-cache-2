5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E

25|$|High <b>specific</b> {{gravity is}} <b>a</b> {{diagnostic}} property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to <b>a</b> change in <b>specific</b> gravity. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>specific</b> gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre {{tend to have}} higher specific gravities than those <b>having</b> <b>a</b> non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe2O3, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> gravity of 5.26 while galena, PbS, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> gravity of 7.2–7.6, which {{is a result of}} their high iron and lead content, respectively. <b>A</b> very high <b>specific</b> gravity becomes very pronounced in native metals; kamacite, an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> gravity of 7.9, and gold <b>has</b> <b>an</b> observed <b>specific</b> gravity between 15 and 19.3.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|Many animals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> {{temperature}} range {{where they are}} active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E

5|$|The inter{{membrane}} {{space is}} {{the space between}} the outer membrane and the inner membrane. It is also known as perimitochondrial space. Because the outer membrane is freely permeable to small molecules, the concentrations of small molecules, such as ions and sugars, in the intermembrane space is the same as in the cytosol. However, large proteins must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> signaling sequence to be transported across the outer membrane, so the protein composition of this space is different from the protein composition of the cytosol.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E

5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> groom {{cut that}} is {{standard}} among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut {{usually reserved for}} family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
