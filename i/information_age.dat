5|$|World {{leaders and}} their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid {{expansion}} and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark {{the opening of the}} London Science Museum's <b>Information</b> <b>Age</b> exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world {{leaders and their}} foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.|$|E

40|$|Online social {{networks}} {{provide access to}} the user’s information {{for long periods of}} time after the information’s initial publication. In this paper, we investigate the relation between <b>information</b> <b>aging</b> and its sharing preferences on Facebook. Our findings are based on a survey of 193 Facebook users, in which we asked users to specify their sharing preferences and intentions towards posts that were published in different periods of time (from the time of the survey and up to 24 months prior to the time of the survey.) Our results show that willingness to share significantly drops with the time passed since publishing the post. The occurrence of life changes, such as graduating from college or moving to a new town, is correlated with a further decrease in the willingness to share. We discuss our findings by relating it to <b>information</b> <b>aging</b> theories and privacy theories. Finally, we use our results to reflect on privacy mechanisms for long-term usage of online {{social networks}}, such as expiry date for content and historical information reviewing processes...|$|R

25|$|The reduced size of {{the share}} of {{aggregate}} share of income, {{both before and after}} tax, of the middle class has been attributed to the reduced bargaining power of wage earning employees, caused by the decline of unions; a lessening of government redistribution; and technological changes which have created opportunities for certain people to accumulate far greater relative wealth very quickly (including larger markets due to globalization and <b>Information</b> <b>Age</b> technologies allowing faster and wider distribution of work product).|$|E

The development of Eastern powers was of note, with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the European Union and Russian Federation were two forces recently developed.

He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media.

25|$|With {{the advent}} of the <b>Information</b> <b>Age</b> {{at the end of the}} 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become {{increasingly}} globalized and interconnected.

Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of science, art, discussion, and technology, it has also led to culture clashes and the development and use of weapons of mass destruction. Human civilization has led to environmental destruction and pollution significantly contributing to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life called the Holocene extinction event,* which may be further accelerated by global warming in the future.|$|E
