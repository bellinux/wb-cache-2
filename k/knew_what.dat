5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem {{should continue to be}} sung in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English because that was the language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They <b>Knew</b> <b>What</b> They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence. Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within communities {{that led to}} violence, and radical challenge to all forms of faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried {{to hide from the}} King. Once Henry <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was afoot, he acted. Thus at the end of 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of the Sacrament and forbidding clerical marriage, on pain of death.|$|E

Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was right.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to do to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was {{going to happen in the}} story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E

He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he was doing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she was doing sleeping with an older man, {{and yet there is}} something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> had {{happened}} {{and that the only}} way to save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition both physically and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the {{creation}} of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert– who had designed the Enterprise-D– was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, but he left {{at the end of the}} season and his absence meant that no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the drawing was intended to be.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|Gloria confides in Lewis {{that she}} is dying and he {{provides}} her with support. When she asks him to run away with her, he turns her down and tells her he loves Audrey. Lewis then learns that Gloria is not ill and she and Gail were testing his loyalty to Audrey. Lewis is outraged when he realises Audrey <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{was going on and}} breaks up with her. He then gets revenge on Gloria by revealing that she has cheated in the local pub of the year competition. Lewis gets his job back at The Bistro and he moves into a flat on Victoria Street. Lewis begins to formulate a plan to get back at Gail for ruining his relationship with Audrey. He decides to use her guilt against her. One night at the Bistro, he pretends to slip and hurt his back. Gail takes pity on Lewis and allows him to stay with her, while she cares for him. During his time with Gail, Lewis offers her his support and advice about her problems. Lewis is not happy when he sees Audrey on a date with another man.|$|E
5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E
