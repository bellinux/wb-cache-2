50|$|The emperor {{also had}} the {{authority}} to carry out a range of duties that, under the republic, had been performed by the Roman Censors. Such duties included the authority <b>to</b> <b>farm</b> <b>out</b> <b>tax</b> collection, <b>to</b> grant public contracts, to regulate public morality (Censorship), and to conduct a census. As part of the census, the emperor had the power to grant citizenship to any individual, and to assign individuals to a new social class (the three imperial classes were the senators, the knights, and the plebeians), which, therefore, gave the emperor unchallenged control over senate membership. The emperor {{also had the}} power to interpret laws and to set precedents, which he did by issuing either an edicta, decreta, or a rescripta. Edicta usually addressed matters associated with the army, treasury, or food supply. The decreta were judicial decisions. The rescripta were issued in response to important questions asked by private citizens. Under the republic, the aerarium Saturni held the state treasury, but only the senate had control over this treasury. While the imperial senate retained control over the aerarium Saturni, this control declined over time. The emperor Augustus established two new treasuries, which future emperors would always control, called the fiscus Caesaris and the aerarium militare. The fiscus Caesaris replaced the aerarium Saturni, and thus became the principal treasury in Rome. The aerarium militare was of minor importance, and its only significant function was to hold funds that were to be used to pay soldiers. In addition, the emperor controlled the religious institutions, since, as emperor, he was always Pontifex Maximus and a member of each of the four major priesthoods.|$|R

The NDP failed to galvanize support, as it remained low in support in polling results throughout most of the election campaign.

50|$|Early in statehood, Federalists {{fell out}} of favor. Consequently, Cutler {{had to wait until}} passions cooled to be elected to {{represent}} Washington County in the Ohio House of Representatives in the Eighteenth General Assembly (1819-1820) and in the Ohio Senate in the Twenty-second and Twenty-third General Assembly (1823-1825) The two topics where he had greatest effect in the legislature was establishment of a common school system to replace the strictly local efforts up to that time, and for reform of land taxes from a direct system to an ad valorem system. Under the direct system, land was levied by acre, without reference to value. Thus small, but wealthy Hamilton County paid less land <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> the state than large, but mostly rural Washington County. This was politically tolerable until <b>taxes</b> would have <b>to</b> rise significantly to pay for canals between Lake Erie and the Ohio River. At that point, Cutler's arguments finally won <b>out,</b> and <b>taxes</b> began <b>to</b> be assessed on value, rather than acreage. Cutler also lobbied vigorously for the interests of Ohio University, where he was a Trustee from 1820 to 1849.|$|R

50|$|In 2011, audit {{letters were}} sent to five donors to a now-defunct {{conservative}} 501(c)(4) group, Freedom's Watch, which {{were involved in the}} 2008 election cycle. The goal of the audit was to assess whether or not gift <b>taxes</b> needed <b>to</b> be paid on these donors' donations to Freedom's Watch. The Congressional Research Service said that the audit was legally well-founded, as tax law exempts only 501(c)(3) and 527 groups from gift taxes. However, Ari Fleischer, {{a board member of the}} group, alleged that the group was being singled <b>out.</b> According <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> experts, the IRS had not been enforcing that law, but tax lawyers had advised their clients that they might owe the <b>tax,</b> leading <b>to</b> a situation where some paid and some did not. The audit appeared to indicate a new emphasis on enforcing the law, but political opposition from Republicans in Congress led to the IRS dropping the audit and publicly announcing that it would not levy gift <b>taxes</b> on contributions <b>to</b> 501(c)(4) groups. Inspector General J. Russell George's report recommended that the IRS create clearer rules and conduct more training for employees on 501(c)(4) issues, including gift tax exemptions.|$|R

Yet few studies have investigated fuel tax incidence in a developing country context.

We find that the effect of a 10 % fuel price hike through direct spending on gasoline would be progressive, its effect through spending on diesel [...] both directly and via bus transportation [...] would be regressive (mainly because poorer households rely heavily on buses), and its effect through spending on goods other than fuel and bus transportation would be relatively small, albeit regressive. Finally, we find that the overall effect of a 10 % fuel price hike through all types of direct and indirect spending would be neutral and the magnitude of this combined effect would be modest. We conclude that distributional concerns need not rule <b>out</b> using fuel <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> address pressing public health and safety problems, particularly if gasoline and diesel taxes can be differentiated.

In this essay my intention was to explain the way that Hollywood is used by United States {{in order to}} establish the order, ease and comfort of their citizens. Moreover, how Hollywood is used as an advertiser of America in such a way that is beneficial to it? I did this simply by answering the research question: How does Hollywood reinforce positive stereotypes about America? Starting from the early development of motion pictures, the movie medium of media is always considered highly important by United States government. The government always tried to support Hollywood and it’s productions by giving <b>out</b> <b>tax</b> breaks <b>to</b> the companies that control Hollywood and in advance “Hollywood” repaid the government by supporting the stereotypes of America and advertising it throughout the world and also by helping the government to control the public opinion and public mood of America.
