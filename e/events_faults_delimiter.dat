30|$|Some of {{the common}} {{transient}} events that occur in a power system are voltage drop because of overloading and generator outage. The condition checks involving negative sequence components and their threshold values help {{to distinguish between the}} faulted condition and transient events. Only the negative sequence components exist when there is an unbalance amongst the three phases of the system. When there is a generator outage, though the overall voltage of the system might drop, the effect is uniform in all the three phases. Hence, during this transient event, negative sequence component of bus voltages will not exist. So, generator outage will not be identified as a fault in the transmission system. Similarly, voltage drops caused by overloading is uniform in all the three phases. Even if it is not uniform in all the three phases, the unbalance in the system is much less compared to a <b>fault</b> <b>event.</b> Hence, the negative sequence voltage component will be very less or none in this case. During an unbalanced <b>fault</b> <b>event,</b> the <b>fault</b> current in the faulted phase of the line is enormous (ranging from 2 p.u to more than 40 p.u) which is caused by corresponding unbalance in the voltage level as well. Hence, the negative sequence components arising from a <b>faulted</b> <b>event</b> is large and very significant compared to unbalanced loaded conditions. Hence, the threshold setting (which would be obtained based on experimental studies of the system) based on the negative sequence components helps distinguish transient <b>events</b> from <b>faulted</b> <b>events.</b>|$|R

In such a situation, we require real-time, high-accuracy processing. We propose an algorithm to resolve the issue. Key ideas in it include: 1) transforming the time-series for each feature into a sequence of anomaly scores, in order to map heterogeneous features to homogeneous features (an anomaly score indicates the degree of anomaly relative to an ordinal sequence) and then representing the pattern of a <b>fault</b> <b>event</b> in terms of anomaly score vectors; 2) selecting features specifying a <b>fault</b> <b>event</b> by means of iterative optimization using both normal and fault anomaly score vectors. We then monitor the degree of abnormal with regard to test anomaly score vectors by matching with the abnormal patterns.

40|$|This work investigates {{testability}} of asynchronous circuits and {{its relation}} with signal transition graphs (STGs), using a state based approach on non-scan asynchronous circuits. In addition to the testability characteristics studied, this work suggests some test generation techniques for asynchronous circuits designed from STGS. An <b>event</b> <b>fault,</b> interpreted as either a stimulating fault or an inhibiting fault of a transition, is used to cover the stuck-at-fault (SAF) behavior of an asynchronous circuit. An advantage of such analysis is that test vectors for an inhibiting fault {{can be obtained from}} operations on a signal transition graph (STG) or a state graph (SG) rather than simulation at the circuit level. A test vector for a test state is represented in an STG by a test marking for each <b>event</b> <b>fault.</b> The lock relation of signals is a property proposed for hazard-free asynchronous circuit's synthesis. However, it is found that there is a special case of the lock relation that can prohibit the testing of some faults, the introduction of which cannot be avoided by the circuit level mapping. Some independent undetectable faults due to uncontrollable test states however can be detected if the reset state is the test state. Using a minimized two-level sum-of-products representation, each literal in a cube of the sum-of-products form is found to have its own function corresponding to the STG. Consequently, four types of literals are defined and their relations with the SAF behavior over the stimulating/inhibiting fault are analyzed. Although factorization of a logic equation binded to a C-element or a set-reset (SR) flip-flop is not always possible, a correct implementation on a set-dominant SR flip-flop is guaranteed.
