5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E

The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often leaving out more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip.

A [...] "growing body of work" [...] suggests that income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid {{up the price of}} real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their debt fall from 80 cents for every dollar of income to 65 cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents for every dollar of income to $1.40. Economist Krugman has found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in the United States over the last hundred years.|$|E

2500|$|A {{campaign}} was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In {{the words of}} Erwan Le Corre: [...] "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or {{the benefits of a}} few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, {{it will be hard to}} seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore." [...] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, [...] "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'" [...] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors of this one-sided {{renunciation}} of the pact spread and were confirmed by Muhammad's emissaries, Sa'd ibn Mua'dh and Sa'd ibn Ubadah, leading {{men of the}} Aws and Khazraj respectively. Sa'd ibn Mua'dh reportedly issued threats against the Qurayza but was restrained by his colleague. As this would have allowed the besiegers to access the city and thus meant {{the collapse of the}} defenders' strategy, Muhammad [...] "became anxious about their conduct and sent some of the leading Muslims to talk to them; the result was disquieting." [...] According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad sent Nuaym ibn Masud, a well-respected elder of the Ghatafan who had secretly converted to Islam, to go to Muhammad's enemies and sow discord among them. Nuaym went to the Qurayza and advised them to join the hostilities against Muhammad only if the besiegers provide hostages from among their chiefs. He then hurried to the invaders and warned them that if the Qurayza asked for hostages, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> intended to turn them over to the Medinan defenders. When the representatives of the Quraysh and the Ghatafan came to the Qurayza, asking for support in the planned decisive battle with Muhammad, the Qurayza indeed demanded hostages. The representatives of the besiegers refused, breaking down negotiations and resulting in the Banu Qurayza becoming extremely distrustful of the besieging army. The Qurayza did not take any actions to support them until the besieging forces retreated. Thus the threat of a second front against the defenders never materialised.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{as well as}} {{attacking the}} {{theories}} of empiricism, Blake also engages {{with the concept of}} natural religion. Northrop Frye argues that [...] "Theology distinguishes between [...] "natural" [...] and [...] "revealed" [...] religion, the former being the vision of God which man develops with his fallen reason, and the later the vision communicated to him by inspired prophets. To Blake, there is no natural religion. The only reason people believe in <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are unwilling to believe in the identity of God and Man." [...] For Harold Bloom, because Blake is able to see the identity of God and man, the rejection of Locke and the tenets of deism makes way for a system in which [...] "to see the infinite in all things is to see God because it is to see as God sees, which Blake believes {{is the only way to}} see God. But to see as God sees, man must himself be infinite, a state to be attained only by the individual utterly possessed by the Poetic character." [...] Similarly, [...] "there is no natural religion, according to Blake, because no man reasoning from fallen nature can come to see that [...] "the real man, the imagination" [...] and God are the same. Religion must be [...] "revealed" [...] in the sense that Revelation means the consuming of natural appearance by a more imaginative vision." [...] Along these same lines, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi argue that, for Blake, natural religion is a [...] "contradiction in terms antithetical to religious belief. Natural religion is derived from experience provided by the fallen senses, not from the Poetic Genius. Thus it is not a religion and cannot be included in the 'all' of All Religions are One." ...|$|E
