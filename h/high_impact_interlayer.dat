40|$|Impact damage {{tolerance}} and damage resistance {{is a critical}} metric for application of polymer matrix composites where failure caused by impact damage could compromise structural performance and safety. As a result, several materials and/or design approaches to improve impact {{damage tolerance}} have been investigated {{over the past several}} decades. Many composite toughening methodologies impart a trade-off between increased fracture toughness and compromised in-plane strength and modulus. In large part, mechanical tests to evaluate composite damage tolerance include static methods such as Mode I, Mode II, and mixed mode failures. However, ballistic impact damage resistance does not always correlate with static properties. The intent {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the influence of a thermoplastic polyurethane veil interleave on the static and dynamic performance of composite test articles. Static coupon tests included tension, compression, double cantilever beam, and end notch flexure. Measurement of the resistance to ballistic impact damage were made to evaluate the composites response to <b>high</b> speed <b>impact.</b> The <b>interlayer</b> material showed a decrease of in-plane performance with only a moderate improvement to Mode I and Mode II fracture toughness. However, significant benefit to impact damage tolerance was observed through ballistic tests...|$|R

The <b>High</b> <b>IMPACT</b> and Solid IMPACT boards provides the same performance for non-textured tasks, while the Maximum IMPACT provides double the performance.

40|$|In practice, some bugs {{have more}} impact than others and thus deserve more {{immediate}} attention. Due to tight schedule and limited human resource, developers {{may not have}} enough time to inspect all bugs. Thus, they often concentrate on bugs that are highly impactful. In the literature, <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs are used to refer to the bugs which appear in unexpected time or locations and bring more unexpected effects, or break pre-existing functionalities and destroy the user experience. Unfortunately, identifying <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs from the thousands of bug reports in a bug tracking system is not an easy feat. Thus, an automated technique that can identify high-impact bug reports can help developers to be aware of them early, rectify them quickly, and minimize the damages they cause. Considering that only a small proportion of bugs are <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs, the identification of <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bug reports is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bug reports by leveraging imbalanced learning strategies. We investigate the effectiveness of various imbalanced learning strategies built upon a number of well-known classification algorithms. In particular, we choose four widely used strategies for dealing with imbalanced data and use naive Bayes multinominal as the classification algorithm to conduct experiments on four datasets from four different open source projects. We perform an empirical study on a specific type of <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs, i. e., surprise bugs, which were first studied by Shihab et al. The results show that under-sampling is the best imbalanced learning strategy with naive Bayes multinominal for <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bug identification...|$|R

Be it normal banter or a discussion on <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> events like Boston marathon blasts, February 2014 US Icestorm, etc., people use Twitter to get updates. Twitter bots have today become very common and acceptable. People are using them to get updates about emergencies like natural disasters, terrorist strikes, etc. Twitter bots provide these users a means to perform certain tasks on Twitter that are both simple and structurally repetitive. During <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> events these Twitter bots tend to provide time critical and comprehensive information. We present how bots participate in discussions and augment them during <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> events. We identify bots in <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> events for 2013 : Boston blasts, February 2014 US Icestorm, Washington Navy Yard Shooting, Oklahoma tornado, and Cyclone Phailin. We identify bots among top tweeters by getting all such accounts manually annotated. We then study their activity and present many important insights. We determine the impact bots have on information diffusion during these events and how they tend to aggregate and broker information from various sources to different users. We also analyzed their tweets, list down important differentiating features between bots and non bots (normal or human accounts) during <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> events. We also show how bots are slowly moving away from traditional API based posts towards web automation platforms like IFTTT, dlvr. it, etc. Using standard machine learning, we proposed a methodology to identify bots/non bots in real time during <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> events.
