500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E

The 1987 Oliver Stone film Wall Street created the iconic figure of Gordon Gekko {{who used the}} phrase [...] "greed is good", which caught on in the {{cultural}} parlance. Stone commented in 2009 how the movie had had an unexpected cultural influence, not causing them {{to turn away from}} corporate greed, but causing many young people to choose Wall Street careers because of that movie. A reporter repeated other lines from the film: [...] "I'm talking about liquid. Rich enough to <b>have</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> jet. Rich enough not to waste time.

2500|$|Fifty {{to sixty}} actresses auditioned {{for the role}} of Anna. Baccarin was {{initially}} rejected following her audition, as Peters did not believe she had the right look for the role. He reconsidered, however, and believes that Baccarin brings a seriousness and [...] "commanding presence" [...] to the part. Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the face of what people want to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what everybody wants to see, {{and at the same time}} you <b>have</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> agenda." [...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting. She explained: [...] "My direction is to play her as honestly as possible, so I'm playing her as a human with a secret. I'm playing a young 17-year-old who is possibly in love." ...|$|E

[...] Lu Xun replied, [...] "He {{has the support of}} his men, his base is well defended, and he has sufficient supplies. There's nothing to worry about. When my plans are set in motion, even if we don't go to his aid, the siege on him will automatically be lifted."

[...] Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, [...] "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." [...] Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, [...] "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." [...] Fellow young-adult authors, Rainbow Rowell and Maggie Stiefvater came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You can <b>have</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, {{but the fact remains that}} he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I had to say something. Not because of the nature of the posts, although they were distasteful and borderline libel. But because the grotesquerie was being force-fed to the author." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 222, {{at the age}} of 24, Sun Huan was {{commissioned}} as General of the Household Who Pacifies the East (安東中郎將) and ordered to join Sun Quan's general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei, who launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province. During the preliminary stages of the battle, Sun Huan led a separate force to attack Liu Bei's vanguard force at Yidao (夷道) but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. When the other officers urged Lu Xun to help Sun Huan, Lu declined, saying that Sun Huan was capable of holding his ground and that the siege would automatically be lifted later. Sun Quan's forces eventually inflicted a devastating defeat on Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting. As Lu Xun predicted, the siege on Yidao was lifted, after which Sun Huan led troops to block Liu Bei's retreat route, but Liu managed to escape by travelling across the mountainous areas. Liu Bei later remarked, [...] "(Sun) Huan was still a child when I visited Jing, but now he is forcing me to this extent!" [...] After the battle, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and he told the latter, [...] "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me.
