Main results of this analysis are: categories expressed by FBRB were already identified by Ranganathan in its bibliographic system; Colon classification book number allows a higher degree of arrangement of bibliographic resources, i. e. compliant to FRBR entities; also for this reason, Colon classification book number is better than Cutter-Sanborn system; in Classified Catalogue ideated by Ranganathan both the aspects of cataloguing (semantic and semiotic) are integrated; <b>facet</b> <b>formula</b> for book number is a special device that allows to switch from classification to identification of bibliographic resources, inasmuch book number is an identifying device included in a classification system...|$|E

In this book an international group of philosophers explore the many <b>facets</b> of Hegel’s <b>formula</b> which expresses the recognitive and social structures of human life. The book offers a guiding thread for the reconstruction of crucial motifs of contemporary thought such as the socio-ontological paradigm; the action-theoretical model in moral and social philosophy; the question of naturalism; and the reassessment of the relevance of work and power for our understanding of human life. This collection addresses the shortcomings of Kantian and constructivist normative approaches to social practices and practical rationality it involves. It sheds new light on Hegel’s take on metaphysics and puts into question some presuppositions of the post-metaphysical interpretative paradig...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we recast {{a special}} case of Mahler’c {{conjecture}} by the maximum value of box splines. This {{is the case of}} polytopes with at most 2 n + 2 <b>facets.</b> An asymptotic <b>formula</b> for univariate box splines is given. Based on the formula, Mahler’s conjecture is proved in this case provided n is big enough. 1. introduction Let K be a symmetric convex body in R n, and let K ∗ be its polar {x: | 〈y, x 〉 | ≤ 1 for all y ∈ K}. An old conjecture of Mahler is (1) vol(K) · vol(K ∗) ≥ 4 n n!. We note that an n-dimensional parallelepiped, which has 2 n facets, gives equality in (1). So, the first non-trivial case of Mahler’s conjecture is the symmetric convex body K with 2 n + 2 facets. Such K can be realized, up to affine invariance, as a one-codimensional section of an (n + 1) -dimensional cube. This case has been raised as a separate problem by Ball [1]. Ball also shows an interesting relation between the special case of Mahler’s conjecture and solutions of a scaling equation. For each r ∈ R, we set (2) ϕA(r) : = vol ((H + rA) ∩ Qn...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{experimentally}} well-known that a crack loaded in mode I+III propagates through {{formation of}} discrete fracture facets inclined {{at a certain}} tilt angle on the original crack plane, depending on {{the ratio of the}} mode III to mode I initial stress intensity factors. Pollard et al. (1982) have proposed to calculate this angle by considering the tractions on all possible future infinitesimal facets and assuming shear tractions to be zero on that which will actually develop. In this paper we consider the opposite case of well-developed facets; the stress field near the lateral fronts of such facets becomes independent of the initial crack and essentially 2 D in a plane perpendicular to the main direction of crack propagation. To determine this stress field, we solve the model 2 D problem of an infinite plate containing an infinite periodic array of cracks inclined at some angle on a straight line, and loaded through uniform stresses at infinity. This is done first analytically, for small values of this angle, by combining Muskhelishvili (1953) 's formalism and a first-order perturbation procedure. The formulae found for the 2 D stress intensity factors are then extended in an approximate way to larger angles by using another reference solution, and finally assessed through comparison with some finite element results. To finally illustrate the possible future application of these formulae to the prediction of the stationary tilt angle, we introduce the tentative assumption that the 2 D mode II stress intensity factor is zero on the lateral fronts of the <b>facets.</b> An approximate <b>formula</b> providing the tilt angle {{as a function of the}} ratio of the mode III to mode I stress intensity factors of the initial crack is deduced from there. This formula, which slightly depends on the type of loading imposed, predicts somewhat smaller angles than that of Pollard et al. (1982) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 1 : We study polytopes {{associated}} to factorisations of prime powers. These polytopes have explicit descriptions either {{in terms of}} their vertices or as intersections of closed halfspaces {{associated to}} their <b>facets.</b> We give <b>formulae</b> for their f−vectors. 1 Main results Polytopes have two dual descriptions: They can be given either as convex hulls of finite sets or as compact sets of the form ∩f∈Ff − 1 (R+) where F is a finite set of affine functions and where f − 1 (R+) denotes the closed half-space on which the affine function f is non-negative. It is difficult to construct families of polytopes where both descriptions are explicit. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study a new family of such examples. These polytopes are associated to vector-factorisations of primepowers where a d−dimensional vector-factorisation of a prime-power p e is an integral vector (v 1,v 2, [...] .,vd) ∈ N d such that p e = v 1 · v 2 · · · vd. Given a prime power p e ∈ N and a natural integer d ≥ 1, we denote by P(p e,d) the convex hull of all d−dimensional vector-factorisations (v 1,v 2, [...] .,vd) ∈ N d of p e. The case e = 0 yields the unique vector-factorisation (1, 1, [...] ., 1) and is without interest. For d = 2 and e ≥ 2 the polytope P(p e, 2) is a 2 −dimensional polygon with vertices (1,p e),(p,p e− 1), [...] .,(p e− 1,p),(1,p e). For e = 1, the polytope P(p,d) is a (d − 1) −dimensional simplex with vertices (p, 1, [...] ., 1),(1,p, 1, [...] ., 1), [...] .,(1, [...] ., 1,p). The observation that the combinatorial properties of P(p e,d) are independent of the prime p in these examples is a general fact: The combinatorial properties of the polytope P(p e,d) are independent always independent of the prime number p. It is in fact possible to replace every occurence of p by an arbitrary real constant which is strictly greater than 1. (The choice of a strictly positive real number which is strictly smaller than 1 leads to...|$|R
