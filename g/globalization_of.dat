5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the notion}} <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> {{is widely used}} in {{contemporary}} life, yet we lack its distinct and precise concept; there are still problems in terminology and in the overall consolidated theory <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> itself. One <b>of</b> the reasons why there is no tightly focused full-length assessment of the main social processes creating the essence <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> is the difference in social paradigms that scientists approach the issue <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> with. The present paper analyses and compares different approaches of scientists representing different schools of economic mind; it provides the definition and description of globa- lization and compares it {{with the notion of}} internationalization and integration. Comparative analysis of the main theoretical concepts <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> is done on the basis of individualistic and holistic paradigms and on the interpretation <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> presented by the three main schools - globalism, skepticism, and transformationalism. The present article analyses and compares the concepts <b>of</b> <b>globalization,</b> principle statements, and thoughts about the essence <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> developed by the above mentioned schools and their representatives, as well as their approach to the reasons and factors that have determined different stages <b>of</b> <b>globalization.</b> The main emphasis is laid on those aspects <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> where their opinions and the evaluation of the processes <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> are most significantly diverse.

25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{is the increasing}} economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital. Whereas the <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic {{globalization is}} the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market. Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: <b>Globalization</b> <b>of</b> production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.Likewise, it also comprises of <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.|$|E

The theoretical base <b>of</b> <b>globalization</b> reveals that structural variables do not constrain actors but also provide them with some opportunities.

25|$|Unions {{have made}} some {{attempts}} to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing {{is not a new}} phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change. Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> production need not be met by a <b>globalization</b> <b>of</b> union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a transnational corporation.|$|E
