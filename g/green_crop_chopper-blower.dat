40|$|We {{examined}} the rationale of introduction and continuation of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> in large-scale upland farming. First, {{the decision on}} the introduction of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> depends {{on the scale of}} farming in terms of farming area and, if introduced, the acreage of such crops represents around 5 % of the total acreage. Second, although the introduction of fallow green manure, which is a non-cash crop, causes decline in direct profitability, overall costs are reduced. Therefore, few differences in income per unit area were found among the cases of continuous, non-continuous, and non-introduction of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping.</b> In other words, there are few grounds for concern over a decline in profitability, for the halting or non continuation of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> because of the availability of crop subsidies. Third, imbalanced crop compositions are observed in the cases of non continuation fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping,</b> indicating the difficulty in establishing a crop rotation. These problems are not found in the cases of continuous fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> despite low productivity and profitability...|$|R

40|$|In Hokkaido, the {{large-scale}} upland farming {{crop rotation system}} is in disorder, so its effect on land productivity is cause for concern. Therefore,the usefulness of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> is pointed out. But, {{from the fact that}} it is a non commodity crop, positioning in regard to crop selection farmers is low. So, bidding which is directed to its fixation is necessary. In this paper, we will explore the elucidation of introduction fixation conditions of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> in large-scale upland farming. The focus of this paper, Sarabetsu village in the Tokachi region, is a typical example of largescale upland farming. First, frequency and continuity of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> of upland farming were rearranged. As a result, we can see that similar types such as "continuation" "discontinuance" "non continuation", clearly showing the differences in cropping conduct. Second, based on field investigations, the primary factors of introduction fixation of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> are made clear; 1) The recognition of improvements for the crop rotation system, 2) The necessity of guaranteeing a yearly gross income, and, 3) Present scale and existence of scale enlargement conditions. Third, the crop selection of large-scale upland farming, making use of linear programming, was modeled and appraised. When obedience of the crop rotation system is designated as a purpose, fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> selection occurred according to the area. It was selected in the 5 - 10 % of the total area when it was present. Fourth, comparison of the profitability with fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> was conducted. Although it caused profit decreases, the cost decreased to a greater degree. Furthermore, per area income showed the fact that there is little overall difference. From the results above, 3 points were given as a fallow green manure introduction fixation conditions. First, introduction makes farm working adjustments possible, making the obedience of crop rotation possible. Under present conditions, recognition of the management for wheat repeated cultivation has influenced fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> introduction. Because of that, recognition improvement of the problems which occur with repeated cultivation is necessary. Second, it is important to consider,as clearly shown by analysis, that fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> does not always reduce profits, but that its overall impact is negligible. Third, it is large-scale farming with which fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> introduction has rationality, and the introduction ratio is 5 - 10 % of the cropping acreage. It is also necessary for such bidding to be done. When constructing the crop rotation system of large-scale upland farming, in the point where construction of a stable 4 year crop rotation system is made possible, the importance of fallow <b>green</b> manure <b>cropping</b> is great...|$|R

Four red-pepper production systems were compared: 1) bare ground (conventional system); 2) hairy vetch monoculture; 3) rye monoculture; and 4) hairy vetch-rye mixture. Soil inorganic N reached the peak at 30 DAI and hairy vetch monoculture was the highest (192 mg kg- 1) and soil total carbon was fluctuated sporadically during the experiment. Carbohydrate and phenolic compounds in soil kept significantly higher in <b>green</b> manure <b>crops</b> systems from 10 DBI to 30 DAI, however the level was the maximum at 10 DBI (carbohydrate) and 30 DAI (phenolic comounds). Incorporation of <b>green</b> manure <b>crops</b> residue enhanced soil microbial biomass C and N throughout the growing season except that MBN in rye was reduced after incorporation. <b>Green</b> manure <b>crops</b> systems suppressed weed occurrence and, in particular, it was prominent in rye monoculture.

40|$|In field {{experiments}} in 1982 - 89 at 2 {{sites in the}} Netherlands, potatoes cv. Bintje and sugarbeet cv. Monohil or Ovatio in a wheat/potatoes/wheat/sugarbeet rotation were preceded during winter by fallow or a <b>green</b> manure <b>crop</b> of Lolium multiflorum cv. Tetila with 0 (G 0), 100 (G 100) or 200 kg N/ha (G 200) or Trifolium pratense cv. Rotra with no N (RC). <b>Green</b> manure <b>crops</b> were undersown to winter wheat cv. Durin and ploughed in {{in the first half}} of November. On average, G 0, G 100, G 200 and RC had then accumulated 22, 93, 125 and 57 kg N/ha, respectively, in the above-ground plant parts. G 0 crops tended to immobilize soil mineral N in spring and generally had non-significant effects on the yields of potatoes and sugarbeet, whereas G 100, G 200 and RC increased the N yields and marketable yields significantly. Effects were mainly attributable to the release of N by the green manures. The fertilizer value of the green manures was evaluated by their effect on economic optimum N rates, the marketable yield and the N yield when no mineral fertilizer N was supplied. The last two methods appeared to be most appropriate for the present experiments. Fertilizer values ranged from - 21 to 108 kg N/ha, depending on the type of <b>green</b> manure <b>crop</b> and the calculation method. About half of the N accumulated in above-ground parts of the <b>green</b> manure <b>crop</b> was available to potatoes and sugarbeet from G 100 when evaluated by its effect on N yields. From G 200 this was even greater, although this may partly have resulted from the transfer of fertilizer N that had not been taken up by the <b>green</b> manure <b>crop.</b> Due to a high content of N in roots and stubble, RC provided, on average, almost double the amount of N accumulated in the above-ground plant parts. <b>Green</b> manure <b>crops</b> also had a minor positive effect on grain yields of winter wheat following potatoes and sugarbeet.

40|$|The common vole, {{considered}} a rodent pest when overabundant in agricultural areas, was traditionally {{absent from the}} agricultural plains of Castilla-y-León, NW Spain. However, it rapidly invaded ca. 50. 000 km 2 of agricultural land, where regular outbreaks have caused crop damages and conflict with farmers. To better understand the factors that triggered this massive invasion of previously unoccupied habitats, we studied the associations between the common vole range expansion and changes in climate and land uses in the region since the 1970 s. We found long-term trends in climate, with some changes that could have helped the range expansion (increased fall precipitation and winter temperature) and other changes that may have impaired it (reduced summer precipitation and increased summer temperatures). Dramatic changes in land use also took place prior to and during the invasion period (marked increases in irrigated and <b>green</b> herbaceous <b>crops</b> such as alfalfa, which are preferred habitats for voles). We found strong associations between changes in vole distribution {{and the extent of}} <b>green</b> <b>crops</b> (irrigated crops and alfalfa) at regional level. The colonization probability of a given agrarian county increased with the extent of <b>green</b> <b>crops,</b> particularly so when vole presence in neighbouring counties was lower, and tended to decrease with increasing livestock abundance. Land use changes, especially increases in irrigated crops and alfalfa, appear to be amongst the main drivers behind the vole range expansion.
