The families of the youths allege that police rammed the motorcycle and left the two teenagers for dead. The police deny this, saying that the motorcycle was stolen and was an unregistered vehicle not valid for street use, travelling at high speed, and that the youths were not wearing any protective headgear - an account, according to French newspaper reports, confirmed by two eyewitnesses. A police investigation indicated that the motorcycle was <b>in</b> <b>third</b> (top) <b>gear</b> and that the police car was not going over 40 km/h (25 mph).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: At present, the {{domestic}} {{development of the}} gear flow-meter is far behind the developed countries, especially in the micro gear flow-meter. This paper proposes a typical structure named the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter. The structural characteristics and working principle of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter was introduced in detail, the prototype of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter was designed and processed, and the calibration tests and pressure experiments of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter prototype was made at last. We can draw that the three gear flow-meter {{can be used in}} hydraulic system pressure range is less than 25 Mpa, the flow rate was 0. 15 ~ 0. 2 m 3 /h can meet the high requirements of the stability of measurement, and the measurement accuracy in the whole flow range is 0. 2 class. This article provides a reliable experimental data for the design of the micro gear flow-meter...|$|R

50|$|Third (3): This mode {{limits the}} {{transmission}} {{to the first}} three gear ratios, or sometimes locks the transmission <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> This {{can be used to}} climb or going down hill. Some vehicles will automatically shift up out of third gear in this mode if a certain revolutions per minute (RPM) range is reached in order to prevent engine damage. This gear is also recommended while towing a trailer.|$|E

50|$|The <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> {{the picture}} has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> is thus 42/21, or 2:1, {{and hence the}} final gear ratio is 1.62x2≈3.23. For every 3.23 {{revolutions}} of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).|$|R
5000|$|Pre-qualifying saw both AGSs {{eliminated}} without {{setting a}} time, Yannick Dalmas withdrawing {{due to a}} wrist injury suffered in testing and Gabriele Tarquini losing fuel pressure on his first lap, while Giacomelli set a lap time of 7:16.2, an average of just over 22 mph, after the Life became stuck <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> In practice, Benetton's Alessandro Nannini and Minardi's Pierluigi Martini both crashed heavily, Martini cracking his heel and withdrawing from the race as a result.|$|E
50|$|Electrically engaged {{overdrive}} gearboxes were an available {{option on}} all MGBs. The overdrive unit was operational in {{third and fourth}} gears (until 1977, when overdrive was only operational in fourth) but the overall ratio <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> overdrive was roughly the same as fourth gear direct. The overdrive unit was engaged by a toggle switch located on the dashboard. The switch {{was moved to the}} top of the gearshift knob in 1977. Overdrives were fitted to less than 20% of all MGBs.|$|E
50|$|Häkkinen and Coulthard started 1-2 {{again in}} Brazil, and Schumacher was outqualified by the Stewart of home hero Rubens Barrichello. Coulthard faltered at the start, {{and he had}} to be pushed into the pitlane, rejoining three laps down. Häkkinen looked dominant, but then got stuck <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> temporarily, and was passed by Barrichello and Schumacher. Barrichello was on a two-stopper, and pitted early, leaving Schumacher leading only to be jumped by Häkkinen during the stops. Häkkinen won, ahead of Schumacher, and Frentzen took third after Barrichello's engine blew up.|$|E

50|$|In two laps, the gap {{was down}} to seven seconds, then two seconds, {{and at the end}} of Lap 37, Watson was two seconds up, as Rosberg had lost <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> Overall, however, on {{combined}} time, Rosberg was still eighteen seconds ahead, so he attempted merely to stay close to the McLaren. Meanwhile, Lauda, inspired perhaps by his teammate, had passed both Cheever and Pironi, and now also approached Rosberg. Likely knowing the Williams was in trouble, he unwisely made a late dive down the inside of Turn One. He locked his wheels, hit the wall and broke his suspension, leaving Cheever <b>in</b> <b>third</b> place.|$|R
50|$|Carlos Pace had {{handling}} {{problems and}} dropped down the order {{when he lost}} <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> By lap 49, Ronnie Peterson crashed into the catch fencing, whilst Brambilla surrendered third place to change a blistered tyre, resuming but retiring with brake problems.|$|R
50|$|In the 1961 German Rally the DKW team {{started a}} rumour {{that he was}} using an illicit four-speed gearbox in his Saab 96 (the {{standard}} car only had three gears). They disassambled the gearbox, but found no fourth gear. It turned out that Carlsson had fooled them by dipping the clutch <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> {{to make it sound}} like a four speed. In 2010, Carlsson was among the first four inductees into the Rally Hall of Fame, along with Rauno Aaltonen, Paddy Hopkirk and Timo Mäkinen. Carlsson died on 27 May 2015.|$|E
50|$|The 48-valve V12 engine first {{appeared}} in the RA273 at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix, driven by Richie Ginther. In spite of weighing 740 kg (dry), it was capable of spinning the rear tyres at 100 mph <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> With cylinder dimensions of 78.0 x 52.2 mm and a displacement of 2,993.17 cc, a target of 400-440 bhp at 12,000 rpm was quoted. The engine used by Surtees at Monza in 1967 was quoted by Motoring News as developing only 396 bhp, but with improved torque and response. The vehicle weight excess over the 500 kg minimum had been approximately halved.|$|E
5000|$|The Controlled Coupling HydraMatic {{incorporated}} a secondary fluid coupling {{and a pair}} of sprag clutches in place of the former friction clutch and brake bands, shifting in part by alternately draining and filling the secondary coupling. It was a later version of GM's [...] "dual range Hydra-Matic", first introduced in some 1952 models. The dual range feature allowed the driver to hold the transmission <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> until the maximum allowable upshift points, for improved performance in traffic or in mountain driving. The new, dual coupling transmission also {{incorporated a}} separate park position, falling in line with other automatic transmissions of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} {{had three}} speeds with no neutral position; a mechanism held the clutch open when the motorcycle was at idle in first gear. First gear was positioned {{in the middle}} of the shift pattern, with second <b>gear</b> below and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> above.|$|R
5000|$|The {{previous}} sluggish {{engine performance}} has been improved {{by a new}} [...] "patented turbo combustion" [...] cylinder head and special connecting rods. The troublesome crankshaft is now harmonically balanced. The gearbox has been fitted with a silent <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> or Traffic top.|$|R
5000|$|Takra's output corresponded Fordson Major. During Vakola tests {{it could}} easily pull with a <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> a spade roller harrow with 25 rollers. When {{equipped}} with wheel chains, Takra could pull a two-furrow plough with 14" [...] wings through medium hard soil.|$|R
50|$|The Curve di Lesmo are two corners {{that are}} not {{as fast as they}} used to be, but are still {{challenging}} corners. The first is blind, entered at 264 km/h in fifth gear, dropping to fourth gear at 193 km/h, and has a slight banking. The second is a fifth gear entry at 260 km/h, apexing <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> at 178 km/h, and {{it is very important that}} all the kerb is used. A mistake at one of these corners will result either in a spin into the gravel or an overtaking move into Variante Ascari.|$|E
50|$|The {{supercharged}} version, {{often referred}} to as the SJ, was reputed to achieve 104 mph in second gear and have a top speed of 135 - 140 mph <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> Zero-to-60 mph times of around eight seconds and 0 - 100 mph in 17 seconds were reported for the SJ in spite of the unsynchronized transmissions, at a time when even the best cars of the era were not likely to reach 100 mi/h km/h. Duesenbergs generally weighed around two and a half tons; up to three tons was not unusual, considering the wide array of custom coachwork available. The wheelbase was 142.5 in.|$|E
50|$|The A35 is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the A30, except for a larger rear window aperture and a painted front grille, with chrome horse-shoe surround, instead of the chrome grille on the A30. Both have 13 in wheels. The semaphore turn-signal indicators were replaced with modern front- and rear-mounted flashing lights. A slightly easier to operate remote-control gear-change was provided. Much of the improved performance {{is a result of}} different gearbox ratios. The A30 has the first three ratios close together then a big gap to top (fourth gear). The A35's ratios are better spaced and give a higher speed <b>in</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{shifting}} sequence {{was very}} different and much rougher than the Hydra-Matics that preceded it, or the Super Turbines and Turbo Hydramatics that followed it. The shift from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd range was long and drawn-out, ending with a harsh shift. The reason for this was that three things were happening. Not only was the transmission shifting to a very much higher range ( [...] 2.93 to 1.56, {{but it was also}} simultaneously emptying the fluid coupling and making a mechanical lock-up. The wide gap in the reduction ratio between first and second gears combined with the direct mechanical connection to the engine to create a shift that could be firm enough to lug the engine. Because of the mechanical lock-up, there was sometimes a shudder felt as the transmission shifted into <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> (fourth range) by refilling the fluid coupling. Direct drive (1:1 ratio) is achieved by splitting engine power between the fluid coupling (used for first gear) and the front clutch (used for second gear), which are both applied to provide <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> effectively locking the planetary gearsets and forcing them to spin at engine speed. The design is unique in that it provides <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> by applying first and second gears at the same time.|$|R
50|$|At Le Mans in 1955 the Cunningham C6-R, {{fitted with}} an Offenhauser engine, {{retired from the}} race. Second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> failed, and the engine, {{designed}} for methanol fuel and insufficiently modified for the mandatory French pump gasoline, overheated. A burned exhaust valve ended the car's run.|$|R
50|$|Rover's new car was {{announced}} 21 August 1931 described in advertisements as: a 12-horsepower six-cylinder having a four-speed gearbox with a silent <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> capable of 65 to 70 mph and 28 to 30 {{miles per gallon}} A de luxe model included safety glass in all windows.|$|R
