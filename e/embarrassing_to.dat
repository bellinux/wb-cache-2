5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> the regime {{was the fact}} that even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1865, {{his public}} {{behaviour}} became irritating and <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> his associates. He {{also began to}} drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes {{in the company of}} a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On July 13, 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} was hushed {{up at the}} time, {{since it}} was felt {{that it would have been}} <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> make public how a world-famous liner had run aground in friendly waters in good weather within a fortnight of beginning its service as a naval vessel. The revelation of such gross incompetence at this early stage of the war would have done nothing for national morale.|$|E

Blaine was unable to pass out fliers to people walking into the Mass offered by Cardinal Law.|$|E
25|$|Al Jazeera was not {{the first}} such {{broadcaster}} in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of Operation Desert Storm on CNN International underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.|$|E
25|$|Between 1726 and 1742, women {{voted in}} 17 of 31 {{examined}} mayoral elections. Reportedly, some women voters in mayoral elections preferred {{to appoint a}} male to vote for them by proxy in the city hall because they found it <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> do so in person, which was cited {{as a reason to}} abolish women suffrage by its opponents. The custom to appoint to vote by proxy was however used also by males, and it was in fact common for men, who were absent or ill during elections, to appoint their wives to vote for them.|$|E

25|$|According to Fredriksen, {{two events}} in the Gospels {{probably}} happened: John's baptism and Pilate's crucifixion of Jesus. These events are mentioned in all four gospels. Moreover, they {{do not conform to}} Jewish tradition in which there are no baptized and crucified messiahs. They are also <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> the early Church. John the Baptist's prominence in both the gospels and Josephus suggests that he may have been more popular than Jesus in his lifetime; also, Jesus' mission does not begin until after his baptism by John. Fredriksen suggests that it was only after Jesus' death that Jesus emerged as more influential than John. Accordingly, the gospels project Jesus' posthumous importance back to his lifetime. Ways this was accomplished were by minimizing John's importance by having John resist baptizing Jesus (Matthew), by referring to the baptism in passing (Luke), or by asserting Jesus' superiority (John).|$|E
500|$|British and European psychiatrists {{assessing}} the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971: [...] "The {{information we have}} about [...] suggests {{that he is the}} sort of person who might be <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him. But such people often have much to contribute, and deserve considerable respect." ...|$|E

The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours {{that he was}} secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: [...] "The one thing that's really bothered me through {{this whole thing is}} the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it's absolutely <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to write anything following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> sit there and think we could write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E
500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but {{there can be little}} question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) was <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views.|$|E
500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{animation}} received a mixed reception. The {{quality of the}} animation in early episodes was lauded Clover Harker of the UK Anime Network, who said it was, [...] "impressive". Kevin Cirugeda of Anime News Network commented that character designer Tadashi Hiramatsu was able to, [...] "make it feel fresh, but also weirdly reminiscent of the past", comparing the series to FLCL. In later episodes however, there was criticism of the animation skating routines, with one describing it as, [...] "at times painful, or perhaps <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> watch", while another said that the poor animation was the fault of Yamamoto's over-ambition. The music gained positive comment, especially the opening theme tune to the series, [...] "History Maker". Ian Wolf of Anime UK News commented on its rousing theme; the use of English connecting to the show's international feel; {{and the use of}} both unusual musical instruments such a xylophone in the introduction and of a [...] time signature, arguably make the song a fast waltz and thus a dance akin to ballet.|$|E

500|$|After the Nicaraguan Revolution was {{launched}} against U.S.-backed authoritarian ruler Anastasio Somoza Debayle in August 1978, Torrijos and Noriega initially supported the rebels, {{providing them with}} surplus National Guard equipment and allowing Panama {{to be used as}} a cover for arms shipments from Cuba to Nicaragua. Torrijos sought for himself the same aura of [...] "democratic respectability" [...] that the Sandinista rebels had in Nicaragua, and so abandoned the title of [...] "Maximum Leader" [...] he had taken in 1972, promising that elections would be held in 1984. Noriega also arranged for weapons shipments purchased in the U.S., a deal on which he too made a profit. The U.S. discovered Noriega's role in supplying weapons, and though the episode proved <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter, no charges were brought against Noriega because the U.S. did not wish to anger a friendly government, and the issue was rendered moot by the Sandinista victory in 1979. After Somoza's overthrow, Noriega continued to smuggle weapons, selling them to leftist guerrillas fighting the U.S.-backed authoritarian government in El Salvador. After one of these shipments was captured, Torrijos, who had friends in the Salvadoran military government, reprimanded Noriega, though the shipments did not stop altogether.|$|E
500|$|The first Soviet {{atomic bomb}} test in August 1949 was <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> the British (who had not {{expected}} a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, but {{it was for the}} Americans another reason for cooperation. The agreement on raw materials was due to expire {{at the end of the}} year. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to end their atomic bomb programme. This offer was rejected on the grounds that it was not [...] "compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance." [...] Instead, the British suggested that there would be a full exchange of atomic information, and in return for ending the production of atomic bombs in Britain, American bombs would be stored in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. The opposition of several key officials, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss, and Senators Bourke B. Hickenlooper and Arthur Vandenberg, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet spy, caused the proposal to be rejected.|$|E
500|$|Mayor Richard M. Daley {{criticized the}} Park Grill deal, blaming Chicago's Corporation Counsel Mara Georges, saying that {{lawyers for the}} city and the Chicago Park District erred and that the city wanted to renegotiate the pact. [...] "Lawyers do make mistakes," [...] Daley said. [...] "That's what it was. ... It's <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> them. Yes it is - the {{corporation}} counsel and the Park District counsel." [...] Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement [...] "does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities" [...] because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for defrauding tax payers, and was questioned by reporters about why the Park Grill had not paid any property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so. The Chicago Sun-Times dubbed the Park Grill the [...] "Clout Cafe" [...] and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals.|$|E
