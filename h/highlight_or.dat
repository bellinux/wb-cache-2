5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 {{it has been estimated}} that around 700 different periodic table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have been shaped, for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to <b>highlight</b> <b>or</b> emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Okay Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} contemporary African art fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 <b>highlight</b> <b>or</b> ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display of a popular artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E

25|$|A second, new universalist form, is {{the method}} of modern-style Jewish organisations and writers, who seek to {{disseminate}} kabbalah to every man, woman and child regardless of race or class, especially since the Western interest in mysticism from the 1960s. These derive from various cross-denominational Jewish interests in kabbalah, and range from considered theology to popularised forms that often adopt New Age terminology and beliefs for wider communication. These groups <b>highlight</b> <b>or</b> interpret kabbalah through non-particularist, universalist aspects.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{technical}} challenges {{depending on the}} subject, what the photographer wants to <b>highlight,</b> <b>or</b> how many subjects are in the frame. Therefore, photographing a single person and, for instance, if the photographer wants to highlight {{only half of the}} subject's face, a single light source placed laterally, at a certain distance and angle to the subject, and possibly a blend, will be usually used. Experimenting with different light intensities is performed until the desired effect is achieved. For photographing two people or a static scene, two or even three sources of light (one or two for contour, and a very low-intensity fill light) are usually used.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Crane Brinton {{a century}} later applauded Hazlitt's [...] "fine {{critical}} intelligence" [...] in judging Southey's character and works. Later, Tom Paulin, with admiration for the richness of Hazlitt's style, traced his writing on Southey from the [...] "savage" [...] attacks in 1816 and 1817 through the more balanced assessment in this sketch. [...] Paulin especially notes allusive and tonal subtleties in Hazlitt's poetic prose that served to <b>highlight,</b> <b>or</b> at times subtly qualify, the portrait of Southey {{he was trying to}} paint. This, Paulin observes, {{is an example of how}} Hazlitt [...] "invest his vast, complex aesthetic terminology with a Shakespearean richness ... perhaps the only critic in English" [...] to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Tradition {{can also}} refer to beliefs or customs that are Prehistoric, with lost or arcane origins, {{existing}} from time immemorial. Originally, traditions were passed orally, {{without the need}} for a writing system. Tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme and alliteration. The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an oral tradition. Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been [...] "invented" [...] by humans) at some point. Traditions are often presumed to be ancient, unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less [...] "natural" [...] than is presumed. It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three generations are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional. Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to <b>highlight</b> <b>or</b> enhance the importance of a certain institution. Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted {{as a part of the}} ancient tradition. Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant. Thus, those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change, and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations, it will be seen as unchanged.|$|E
