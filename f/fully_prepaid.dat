5000|$|On September 5, 2008, Chad <b>fully</b> <b>prepaid</b> {{both the}} IBRD and IDA {{components}} of the World Bank loan totaling $65.7 million from its [...] "national coffers swollen by more than $1 {{billion a year in}} oil revenues". This ended its involvement in the project. The World Bank noted that, [...] "over the years, Chad failed to comply with key requirements of this agreement", including devoting {{a substantial portion of the}} oil revenues to poverty reduction programs, and thus it [...] "concluded that it could not continue to support this project under these circumstances".|$|E
40|$|The Chad-Cameroon {{oilfield}} {{development and}} pipeline project {{was a major}} attempt {{by the international community}} to leverage an extractive industries project to promote development in a fragile state. The project is notable for its size and ambition, and for the intensive participation of multilateral institutions, multinational corporations, governments, and civil society. The centerpiece of the project was an elaborate revenue management program designed to funnel oil revenues to priority sectors in Chad. However, unanticipated developments, including a deteriorating security situation, gradually eroded the Chadian government’s compliance with the program, resulting in disbursement suspensions and renegotiations. The program was prematurely terminated when the government of Chad <b>fully</b> <b>prepaid</b> its remaining financial obligations to the World Bank after just seven years of the project’s anticipated 20 - 30 year lifespan. Once hailed as a newly emergent model for development, the project now offers important lessons stressing the need for greater pragmatism in the future. * Author note: The author would like to thank Ian Glenday and several anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on {{an earlier version of this}} article...|$|E
