The multipole discharge chamber investigated was shown capable of low discharge chamber losses and flat ion beam profiles {{with a minimum of}} optimization. Minimum discharge losses were 200 to 250 eV/ion for xenon and 300 to 350 eV/ion for argon, while <b>flatness</b> <b>parameters</b> in the plane of the accelerator grid were 0. 85 to 0. 95. The design used employs low magnetic field strengths, which permits the use of sheet-metal parts. The corner problem of the discharge chamber was resolved with recessed corner anodes, which approximately equalized both the magnetic field above the anodes and the electron currents to these anodes. Argon hollow cathodes were investigated at currents up to about 5 amperes using internal thermionic emitters. Cathode chamber diameter optimized in the 1. 0 to 2. 5 cm range, while orifices diameter optimized in the 0. 5 to 5 mm range.

The 40 cm ion optics utilized both NSTAR and TAG (Thick-Accelerator-Grid) aperture geometries. All 40 cm ion optics tests were conducted on a NEXT (NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster) laboratory model ion engine. Ion optics performance tests were conducted over a beam current range of 1. 20 to 3. 52 A and an engine input power range of 1. 1 to 6. 9 kW. Measured ion optics' performance parameters included near-field radial beam current density profiles, impingement-limited total voltages, electron backstreaming limits, screen grid ion transparencies, beam divergence angles, and start-up transients. Impingement-limited total voltages for 40 cm ion optics with the NSTAR aperture geometry were 60 to 90 V lower than those with the TAG aperture geometry. This difference was speculated {{to be due to}} an incomplete burn-in of the TAG ion optics. Electron backstreaming limits for the 40 cm ion optics with the TAG aperture geometry were 8 to 19 V higher than those with the NSTAR aperture geometry due to the thicker accelerator grid of the TAG geometry.

The PM 1 thruster exhibits operational behavior consistent with its predecessors, the engineering model thrusters, with substantial mass savings, enhanced thermal margins, and design improvements for environmental testing compliance. The dry mass of PM 1 is 12. 7 kg. Modifications made in the thruster design have resulted in improved performance and operating margins, as anticipated. PM 1 beginning-of-life performance satisfies all of the electric propulsion thruster mission-derived technical requirements. It demonstrates {{a wide range of}} throttleability by processing input power levels from 0. 5 to 6. 9 kW.

40|$|In {{the present}} article, {{we present a}} new {{gravitational}} galactic model, describing motion in elliptical {{as well as in}} disk galaxies, by suitably choosing the dynamical parameters. Moreover, a new dynamical parameter, the S(g) spectrum, is introduced and used, in order to detect islandic motion of resonant orbits and the evolution of the sticky regions. We investigate the regular or chaotic character of motion, with emphasis in the different dynamical models and make an extensive study of the sticky regions of the system. We use the classical method of the Poincare (r-pr) phase plane and the new dynamical parameter of the S(g) spectrum. The LCE is used, in order to make an estimation of the degree of chaos in our galactic model. In both cases, the numerical calculations, suggest that our new model, displays a wide variety of families of regular orbits, compared to other galactic models. In addition to the regular motion, this new model displays also chaotic regions. Furthermore, the extent of the chaotic regions increases, as the value of the <b>flatness</b> <b>parameter</b> b of the model increases. Moreover, our simulations indicate, that the degree of chaos in elliptical galaxies, is much smaller than that in dense disk galaxies.

The present study investigated accuracy of patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) for bone-cutting during simulated tumor surgery within the pelvis. A synthetic pelvic bone model was imaged using a CT-scanner. The set of images was reconstructed in 3 D and resection of a simulated periacetabular tumor was defined with four target planes (ischium, pubis, anterior ilium, and posterior ilium) with a 10 -mm desired safe margin. Patient-specific instruments for bone-cutting were designed and manufactured using rapid-prototyping technology. Twenty-four surgeons (10 senior and 14 junior) were asked to perform tumor resection. After cutting, ISO 1101 location and <b>flatness</b> <b>parameters,</b> achieved surgical margins and the time were measured. With PSI, the location accuracy of the cut planes {{with respect to the}} target planes averaged 1 and 1. 2  mm in the anterior and posterior ilium, 2  mm in the pubis and 3. 7  mm in the ischium (p <  0. 0001). Results in terms of the location of the cut planes and the achieved surgical margins did not reveal any significant difference between senior and junior surgeons (p =  0. 2214 and 0. 8449, respectively). The maximum differences between the achieved margins and the 10 -mm desired safe margin were found in the pubis (3. 1 and 5. 1  mm for senior and junior surgeons respectively).

Iterative optimizations using software, along with fundamental knowledge, are required to resolve remaining unknowns and obtain the final design. This is particularly the case for the gain <b>flatness</b> <b>parameter.</b> This project will present the amplifier design theory used, and the results of the two designs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for the surface quality assessment of safety-critical die-castings. We {{have developed a}} measurement system that measures {{the surface of a}} die-casting and provides quantitative surface quality assessment within a die-casting cycle of 70 s. The measurement system,based on the laser triangulation principle, has an asymmetrical measuring range and is capable of high-resolution measurements of the casting surface (0. 02 mm). Geometry specific <b>parameters</b> (<b>flatness</b> of the particular surface region, average deviation of the measured points and height of the surface defects) are calculated from the acquired surface data and then checked whether/how they fit within the tolerances specified in a technical documentation. The method has been tested in the laboratory by examination of a sample of castings taken randomly from the production process. A comparison of the results obtained by this method and by a qualified operator has shown good agreement...|$|R
40|$|A listener’s {{propensity}} to perceive affect as expressed by music can arise from {{factors such as}} acoustic features and culturally learned expectations. Studies investigating the link between musical flow and perceived affective content by means of continuous response measures and a 2 -dimensional circumplex framework of affect (i. e., arousal and valence) have given positive results. For example, time series models of perceived arousal in response to Western classical and electroacoustic music reveal a significant predictive influence of acoustic parameters such as intensity and spectral <b>flatness.</b> Acoustic <b>parameters</b> generally provide weaker models of perceived valence. Here we test the hypothesis that a continuous measure of musical engagement can be {{a significant predictor of}} perceived arousal and perceived valence, and will enhance time series models of affect based on acoustic parameters alone. Thirty-five nonmusicians continuously rated their level of engagement while listening to 5 Western classical and electroacoustic music excerpts. Grand unweighted mean engagement time series for each piece from all 35 participants were used to model continuous-response time series of perceived arousal and perceived valence. The hypothesis was partially supported: in univariate autoregressive analyses, 1 of the valence and 2 of the arousal models were strongly improved by adding engagement as a predictor; and in a further 2 of each, engagement made a minor contribution. In the remaining 2 models of valence and 1 of arousal, engagement was not pertinent. In multivariate (vector autoregressive) models, relating simultaneously both arousal and valence to acoustic parameters, engagement had a role in every case. It is concluded that listener engagement can play a mediating role in perceived affective response to music. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of an MRI linac fringe field on neighbouring radiotherapy accelerators and whether restoring their original steering calibration {{can be used to}} shorten downtime after changes of the magnetic field of the MRI linac. Methods and materials: A 1. 5  T MRI linac was installed in a treatment room, neighboured by three accelerators. A detector array was used to acquire gantry angle dependent beam <b>flatness</b> and symmetry <b>parameters.</b> Measurements were performed before and after ramping up the magnet, and again after adjusting the beam steering for deviations in flatness and symmetry. Results: Changes in beam symmetry as a function of gantry angle of up to 4 % (Linac A) and 1 % (Linac B) were observed, causing beam parameters to be out of clinical tolerance. After steering adjustment, the parameters were within tolerance for all gantry angles. Linac C did not show any significant change. Conclusion: The MRI linac magnetic fringe field can influence the beam steering of the accelerators in adjacent bunkers. The steering of two accelerators that were situated the closest to the MRI linac needed to be adjusted in order to bring beam parameters within tolerances. Adjusting the steering completely compensated {{the influence of}} the magnetic fringe field of the MRI linac...|$|R
