5|$|After graduating, Deady began {{teaching}} {{to pay off}} a <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> for his education, {{and began to read}} law. He read law in St. Clairsville, Ohio, under the guidance of judge and former Congressman William Kennon. Deady passed the Ohio bar on October 26, 1847, and began practicing law in St. Clairsville at the office of Henry Kennon. He remained there until on April 17, 1849, he began his overland journey over the Oregon Trail to the newly created Oregon Territory.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, Manchester United {{continued}} to thrive, with the 2005–06 season seeing Old Trafford's capacity being expanded and a lucrative new shirt sponsorship deal signed in April 2006 with American company AIG (which {{had a large}} stake in a hedge fund company that helped to fund Glazer's takeover of the club). Increased revenue from TV rights to each competition the club participates in, {{as well as its}} various sponsorship deals, also boosted the club's profitability. This came despite fears among many supporters that the <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> in buying the club could lead to insolvency.|$|E
5|$|The {{downturn}} in the aviation sector and ongoing disagreements between Julian Amery, the new Minister of Aviation and BOAC concerning writing off <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> buying and troubleshooting new British aircraft resulted in a further deterioration in relations between the airline and government. Amery commissioned an independent report into the financial performance of BOAC, undertaken by John Corbett. The ongoing disagreement about the funding arrangements for BOAC {{and the need for}} new Vickers VC10 aircraft would eventually be resolved in late 1963, when Slattery formally retired as chairman, though this was widely seen as a resignation; Slattery commented in 1964 that he had effectively been sacked.|$|E

25|$|The <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> by {{the toll}} company was paid off by August 2013. The company had by the {{collected}} NOK1,400 million, twice the <b>debt</b> <b>incurred.</b> The remainder {{was used for}} interest and to operate the toll plaza, which cost NOK14 million in 2012. In March 2012 the Public Roads Administration, based on the {{plans to build a}} second tube, announced a prolonging of the toll period, initially with another three years. The agency stated that advanced tolls on a new tube would allow for a lower total toll collection, as interest payments would be lowered. In addition the tolls would stimulate for less traffic through the tunnel, which the agency wanted to reduce until a second tube opens. Should the second tube not be built, the tolls will be used for other projects in the area.|$|E
25|$|The <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> {{during the}} war was gargantuan, {{approximately}} 4,200,000 florins. To pay, the state had to change the tax system. The current estimo system was replaced with the catasto. The castato {{was based on a}} citizen's entire wealth, while the estimo was simply a form of income tax. Apart from war, Filippo Brunelleschi created the renowned dome of the Santa Maria delFiore, which astounded contemporaries and modern observers alike.|$|E

50|$|In American tort law, {{recklessness}} of the tortfeasor {{can cause}} the Plaintiff {{to be entitled to}} punitive damages. Although there is no difference in the quantity of punitive damages awarded for recklessness instead of malice (that is, a plaintiff does not get more punitive damages for establishing malice than he would for establishing recklessness), plaintiffs may still desire to prove maliciousness because, in American bankruptcy law, <b>debts</b> <b>incurred</b> through willful and malicious injuries cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, but <b>debts</b> <b>incurred</b> through recklessness can.|$|R
25|$|In 1890, {{at the age}} of 15, Dhalla {{began his}} {{training}} for the priesthood. Shortly thereafter he interrupted his studies in order to work and so augment the family's meagre income. In 1894, Dhalla became editor of a monthly magazine Goolshan-e-Danesh. Two years later, Dhalla acquired ownership of the magazine but was forced to shut it down when funds ran out a few months later. The <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> would remain with him for many years.|$|E
25|$|Following recognition, Brooke {{expanded}} the kingdom territory {{at the expense}} of Brunei by reducing the territory of the latter. Several major rebellions occurred against his rule, causing him to be plagued by <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> in countering the rebellions, and the sluggish economic situation at the time. His nephew, Charles Brooke, succeeded James and normalised the situation by improving the economy, reducing government debts and establishing public infrastructure. The kingdom was made a British protectorate in 1888.|$|E
25|$|Before any {{concrete}} {{planning to}} regain solvency could be undertaken, an accurate {{accounting of the}} railroad's condition was required. The receivers' report, issued in June 1880, indicated total liabilities of US$145,494,005. Annual carrying charges were just over US$7.5 million, while net revenues were just under US$5.5 million. Already, this early into the process, the English bondholders' committee contended that expansions in the Reading's floating <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> during the six {{months prior to the}} bankruptcy were not covered by value in the corporation's assets.|$|E

25|$|A {{negative}} balance of payments, growing public <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> by the Vietnam War and Great Society programs, and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued. The drain on US gold reserves culminated with the London Gold Pool collapse in March 1968. By 1970, the U.S. had seen its gold coverage deteriorate from 55% to 22%. This, {{in the view}} of neoclassical economists, represented the point where holders of the dollar had lost faith in the ability of the U.S. to cut budget and trade deficits.|$|E
25|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the European Union. Since the airline's conception, Braathens SAFE had been a staunch opponent to the concession system and an avid proponent of free competition in the airline industry. With a deregulation around the corner, the airline change stands and warned against the consequences of a free market. In contrast, SAS embraced the new system. Braathens SAFE's main concern was that their high <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> after the purchase of the new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war.|$|E

25|$|Northwest was {{purchased}} in a 1989 leveraged buyout by an investment group headed by Al Checchi, Fred Malek and Gary Wilson, with KLM, and many others. To {{pay off the}} <b>debt</b> <b>incurred,</b> the new management sold many of the airline's aircraft to leasing companies, and sold property around the world, including land in central Tokyo. The expense of the buyout {{was so great that}} in 1993, following several years of losses due to industry overcapacity and a traffic downturn following the Gulf War, Northwest threatened bankruptcy unless its employee groups agreed to three years of wage cuts. After signing the concessionary agreements, Northwest made its first profit since 1989.|$|E
25|$|The United States Congress was {{established}} upon {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790, when the Residence Act was passed {{to pave the way}} for a permanent capital. The decision to locate the capital was contentious, but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Spanish Armada by Elizabeth I of England greatly reduced the {{strength}} of the Spanish navy and contributed to the country's <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> during the reign of Philip II. Spain became more dependent on the income from its Spanish colonies, including the exportation of Spanish wine to the Americas. The emergence of growing wine industries in Mexico, Peru, Chile and Argentina was a threat to this income, with Philip III and succeeding monarchs issuing decrees and declarations ordering the uprooting of New World vineyards and halting the production of wine by the colonies. In some countries, like Chile, these orders were largely ignored; but in others, like Argentina, they served to stunt growth and development until independence was gained from Spanish rule.|$|E

25|$|On January 10, 2008, Young Broadcasting {{announced}} it would sell KRON-TV. The company had been encountering difficulties in meeting interest payments on its outstanding debt and Young's stock, which had been trading for a few cents per share, would ultimately be delisted from NASDAQ in January 2009, after failing to meet the minimum standards for being on the exchange. One month later on February 13, Young made a filing to place the company under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. <b>Debt</b> <b>incurred</b> from its 1999 purchase of KRON {{was believed to be}} one key factor behind the company's cash problems. Young originally hoped to close a sale of the station {{by the end of the}} first quarter of 2008, but no buyer emerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} credit {{financing}} was also tailored to UK wartime needs. The UK {{agreed to pay}} for defence expenditures {{over and above the}} amount that India had paid in peacetime (adjusted for inflation). However, their purchases were made entirely on credit accumulated in the Bank of England and not redeemable until after the war. At the same time, the Bank of India was permitted to treat those credits as assets against which it could print currency up to {{two and a half times}} more than the total <b>debt</b> <b>incurred.</b> India's money printing presses then began running overtime, printing the currency that paid for all these massive defence expenditures. The tremendous rise in nominal money supply spurred monetary inflation, reaching its peak in 1944–45. The accompanying rise in incomes and purchasing power fell disproportionately into the hands of industries in Calcutta (in particular, munitions industries).|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{she assumed}} the {{presidency}} of the Philippines, Aquino moved quickly to tackle the issue of the US$28 billion-foreign <b>debt</b> <b>incurred</b> by her predecessor, which has badly tarnished the international credit standing and economic reputation of the country. After weighing all possible options such as choosing not to pay, Aquino eventually chose to honor all the debts that were previously incurred in order to clear the country's image. Her decision proved to be unpopular but Aquino defended that it was the most practical move. It was crucial for the country at that time to regain the investors' confidence in the Philippine economy. Beginning in 1986, the Aquino administration paid off $4 billion of the country's outstanding debts to regain good international credit ratings and attract the attention of future markets. Although it borrowed an additional $9 billion, increasing the net national debt by $5 billion within six years after the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, due to the need to infuse capital and money into the economy, the Aquino administration succeeded in wrangling lower interest rates and longer payment terms in settling the country's debts. From 87.9 percent when it inherited the foreign debt from the Marcos regime, the Cory Aquino administration was able to reduce by 30.1 percent the Philippines' external debt-to-GDP ratio to 67.8 percent in 1991.|$|E
