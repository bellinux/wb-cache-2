Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a eudiometer. Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of swamp gases in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with oxygen and another gas. The homogeneous mixture was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly catalyze a reaction by static electricity, using Volta's electrophorus. If the gases were flammable, they would explode, and increase the pressure within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the electrical unit, the volt, to be named after him.|$|R

Plotting of test results revealed that conditions of potential explosibility could be described using two dimensional flammability limit surfaces for coal dust/oxygen; methane/oxygen; and coal dust/methane mixtures. From these plots, the three dimensional flammability envelopes defining the explosibility of the coal dust/methane/oxygen mixtures can be defined and illustrated for a coal sample. The surfaces of the three dimensional envelope describe limits which separate inert mixtures of coal dust and methane at varying oxygen levels from those concentrations which are ignitable under defined conditions. It is considered appropriate to generalise that the geometric shapes of these limit regions are applicable to all type classifications of coal dust. There are practical applications of these results to the underground environment. The action of free radical initiators in the propagation of a methane gas explosion was examined for its applicability to the flammability of coal dust/gas/air mixtures. The oxides of nitrogen or NOx radicals have influence upon the lean limits of flammability of hybrid mixtures and this is illustrated by use of three dimensional coordinate geometry.

In this context high quality aerogel based thermal super insulation materials are {{of critical importance}} to energy-efficiency, {{as a lot of}} thermal and therefore energy losses can be reduced for example in industrial processes, buildings or even in the transportation sector. Research and development made great progress and nowadays the properties of silica aerogels with respect to density, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength and shrinkage are adjustable via sol-gel processing. Also the development of composite materials, like embedding aerogel granulates or infiltrating them to nonwoven felts improved the materials. Further investigations to manufacture super-insulating, low density, flame resistant boards leads to the combination of aerogels with honeycombs in general and silica aerogels with paper honeycombs especially. In this combination the selected silica aerogels provide a low density around 0. 1 g/cm 3, a specific surface area in the range of 100 - 1000 m 2 /g, low thermal conductivity under SATP conditions between 0. 01 - 0. 03 W/mK and a high sound absorption.

Hydrogen shows considerable promise due to its virtually unlimited supply, energy conversion efficiency, and neutral impact on the environment. However, due to the <b>flammability</b> of hydrogen <b>gas</b> in concentrations as low as 4 %, reliable sensors capable of detecting small concentrations of hydrogen with quick response times are a necessity. A novel type of hydrogen sensor utilizing a thin film of palladium deposited on the ridge of an edge-emitting laser has been designed and fabricated. This palladium film is well known to react to hydrogen, forming palladium hydride with optical properties dependent on the hydrogen concentration. This reaction yields a change in complex refractive index and thus also the laser???s output power. The advantages of these sensors are their small size, high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, inline integration, and scalability to arrays. These capabilities surpass most traditional optical sensors, which generally utilize fiber gratings, surface plasmon resonances, or surface reflectance. Although those methods can be effective, the edge-emitting laser sensors are easier to miniaturize, integrate, and array. This thesis is organized into four sections.

40|$|AbstractFor {{international}} trade and production of machinery used in potentially explosive atmospheres {{it is important to}} know about the regulations within the European Union. This paper presents an application of CHEMSAFE flammability data for fulfilling the requirements of the EU explosion protection directives. Most of the published data for flammability of substances are measured under atmospheric conditions although chemical processes operate often under non-atmospheric conditions. A couple of R&D projects were initiated in Germany to get more knowledge on explosion characteristics for non-atmospheric conditions. The explosion protection for machinery operated under non-atmospheric conditions is defined in the 2006 / 42 /EU Directive. CHEMSAFE fulfills this requirement while it contains data of flammable compounds measured under non-atmospheric conditions and with other oxidizers than air. Furthermore it includes <b>flammability</b> data for <b>gas</b> mixtures consisting of flammable, inert, and different oxidizing components and most of the data are measured according to international standards. Safety data on flammable dusts - such as minimum ignition energy, maximum explosion pressure, ignition temperatures - represents also an important part of the database. The potentially explosive atmospheres are defined in revised Directive 2014 / 34 /EU. For preparing risk assessment documents the following data for flammable gases and vapors, relating to the use of equipment, among others are necessary: Flammability limit, flash point, temperature class - auto-ignition temperature, maximum experimental safe gap. CHEMSAFE’ 2013 includes not only these data but also more than 200 triangular explosion diagrams, e. g. the newly measured methane/nitrogen/oxygen system under pressures up to 50 bars.

The transient vaporization of methanol and n-heptane was modeled to characterize the instantaneous gas phase composition surrounding the droplet prior {{to the introduction of}} an ignition source. The results for methanol/air showed that the entire gas phase surrounding a 2 mm methanol droplet deployed in zero-g. quickly falls outside the lean <b>flammability</b> limit. The <b>gas</b> phase surrounding an identically-sized n-heptane droplet, on the other hand, remains flammable. The combustion of methanol was then modeled considering a detailed gas phase chemical kinetic mechanism (168 steps, 26 species) and the effect of the dissolution of flame-generated water into the liquid droplet. These results were used to determine the critical ignition diameter required to achieve quasi-steady droplet combustion in a given oxidizing environment. For droplet diameters greater than the critical ignition diameter, the model predicted a finite diameter at which the flame would extinguish. These extinction diameters were found to vary significantly with initial droplet diameter. This phenomenon appears to be unique to the transient heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical kinetics of the system and thus has not been reported elsewhere to date. The extinction diameter was also shown to vary significantly with the liquid phase Lewis number since the amount of water present in the droplet at extinction is largely governed by the rate at which water is transported into the droplet via mass diffusion. Finally, the numerical results for n-heptane combustion were obtained using both 2 step and 96 step semi-emperical chemical kinetic mechanisms.

Yankee Atomic fuel, containing a fissia concentration of 10, 000 Mwd/ T uranium, was dissolved by the Darex and Sulfex Processes {{to determine the}} amount of acid insoluble residues formed. Solvent extraction studies revealed that thorium and uranium could be costripped from a 30 % TBP neutral solution with Al(NO/sub 3 /) /sub 3 /. Distribution coefficients were determined for thorium and uranium in 30 % TBP-Amsco systems. The presence of H/sub 2 /O/sub 2 / in Zirflex dissolver solutions was found to decrease the corrosion rates of Hastelloy F, type 309 stainless steel, and Ni-o-nel. Palladium-titanium alloys showed somewhat higher corrosion rates than Ti- 45 A in Zirflex and fluoboric-nitric acid solutions. Specimens of type 304 L stainless steel exposed to Darex-Purex waste solutions continued to show intergranular attack. The presence of borate in Thorex dissolver solutions lowered the corrosion rate of titanium in the solution phase, and eliminated pitting in the vapor phase. The radiation effects on di- sec-butyl phenylphosphonate were investigated. The distillation of degraded 30 % TBP in Amsco 125 - 82 was tested for use in solvent repurification operations. The ruthenium volatility during the evaporation of wastes was reduced from 66 to 79 % to 15 % in the presence of TBP, and to 7 to 8 % in a NO atmosphere, with or without TBP. A study was made of the nitrate-organic reactions taking place when Purex 1 WW concentrates containing TBP were processed. A satisfactory method was found for solidifying Sulfex decladding solutions yielding blocks having compression strengths of 3000 psi. A hydroxyl-form strong-base anion exchange resin removed 72 % of the gross fission product activity from low-level waste and raised the pH of the effluent water to 11. 3. The Purex 1 WW diluted waste was made 0. 124 M in oxalic acid, which increased the breakthrough capacity of Dowex 50 resin for strontium by 2 to 3 and for rare earths> 3. Thermogravimetric and static studies were made of the kinetics of hydrogen reduction of CaSO/sub 4 /. (For preceding period see CF- 60 - 3 - 84.) (B. O. B...|$|R
3000|$|Foaming is the {{creation}} of tiny bubbles into a polymer structure using gas penetration and solution as the physical blowing agent into the polymer matrix, and it is also {{the creation}} of a thermodynamic instability by reducing pressure and increasing temperature. Microcellular foams are defined as foams with a cell diameter lower than 10  μm and cell density more than 1010  cells/cm 3 (Jacobs et al. 2008). The cell radius of microcellular foams is less than the natural critical crack of a polymer; therefore, polymer weight can be reduced without having a negative effect on mechanical properties compared to traditional foams. Martini and Suh at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1981 introduced microcellular foams as a means {{to reduce the amount of}} plastic materials without sacrificing their functionality (Martini 1981). Batch microcellular foaming contains a saturated sample under non-reaction gas pressure in reservoir pressure until equilibrium gas concentration is achieved. Then the pressure is discharged, and samples are immersed in hot oil with temperatures approaching the transition temperature of the polymer. There is no doubt that foam expansion continues until polymer viscosity increases or all available supercritical fluid is used. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen (N 2) are the most common supercritical fluids in the microcellular foaming process used as physical blowing agents. They are eco-friendly, non-toxic, cheap, and abundant. However, the permeability and solubility of CO 2 in the polymers are higher than those of N 2, and the supercritical parameters of CO 2 are easily available (Tc[*]=[*] 31.1  °C, [...] Pc[*]=[*] 73.8  bar) (James et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2007). Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is an amorphous [...] [...] [...] co-polymer wherein acrylonitrile brings chemical resistance and heat stability, butadiene brings toughness, and styrene provides good processing characteristics. The foamed polymers’ structure including nanoparticles as nanofillers has been improved with reduced <b>flammability</b> properties, reduced <b>gas</b> permeability, increased strength-to-weight ratio, increased impact resistance, long fatigue life, and better thermal and electrical insulation properties compared to unfoamed polymers. Nanofillers can be used as a nucleation agent in the gas foaming process, but they are also known to promote the heterogeneous nucleation of extra cells during foaming; hence, polymer/clay nanocomposite foams are usually characterized by a small cell size and high cell density (James et al. 2005). Okamoto et al. used organically modified layered silicates as nucleating agents to produce polypropylene (pp)/clay composites (Okamoto et al. 2001). Yeh et al. studied the effect of dispersion capability of organoclay on cellular structure and physical properties of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA)/clay nanocomposite foams and demonstrated that the well-dispersed clay particles in the polymer matrix cause an increase in cell density, a decrease in cell size, and also an increase in mechanical strength of PMMA/clay nanocomposite foams (Yeh et al. 2009). Mamaghani Shishavan et al. studied the mechanical properties and composition capability of ABS/PMMA/clay nanocomposites and showed that ABS and clay nanoparticles with PMMA could be compounded and their mechanical properties are stronger than those of the pure ABS (Mamaghani Shishavan et al. 2014). Urbanczyk et al. studied the batch foaming of Styrene Acrylonitrile/clay nanocomposites with CO 2 gas and illustrated that adding nanoparticles significantly increases the cell density, from 8.5 [*]×[*] 1011  cells/cm 3 for pure SAN foam, to 3.6 [*]×[*] 1012  cells/cm 3 for the intercalated nanocomposite and 7.6 [*]×[*] 1013  cells/cm 3 for SAN containing the exfoliated clay. Therefore, the nanoclay clearly acts as an effective heterogeneous nucleating agent (Urbanczyk et al. 2010). Papers were also found on ABS foams which were produced by supercritical fluid CO 2. An article by Murray et al. has examined batch foaming conditions of ABS with CO 2 (Murray et al. 2000). Kamran et al. studied the mechanical and microstructural properties of microcellular foams of ABS composites with CO 2 (Beydokhti et al. 2006).|$|R
