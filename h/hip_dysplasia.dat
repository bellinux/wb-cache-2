5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy {{with an average}} life span of 12 to 15 years. <b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (HD) is {{a common}} genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but {{develops}} with age. <b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is diagnosed by X-rays, {{but it is not}} usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe HD, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is an {{abnormality}} of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E
50|$|Two main {{types of}} osteotomies {{are used in}} the {{correction}} of <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasias</b> and deformities to improve alignment/interaction of acetabulum - (socket) - and femoral head (femur head) - (ball), innominate osteotomies and femoral osteotomies. The bones are cut, reshaped or partially removed to realign the load-bearing surfaces of the joint.|$|R
40|$|The Marshall Smith Syndrome (MSS) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} disorder, {{displaying a}} constellation of unique symptoms, including orofacial dysmorphisms, accelerated osseous maturation and dysplasias, mental retardation, and respiratory maladies.

In this case report, we describe a unique treatment for a 30 year-old patient with MSS who presented to our pain medicine clinic for management of pain secondary to uncontrolled bilateral <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasias...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cimarrón Uruguayo {{should be}} tested for <b>hip</b> and elbow <b>dysplasia</b> before breeding.|$|R
5|$|An {{abnormal}} {{formation of}} the hip socket, known as <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> affected nearly 64% of Pugs in a survey performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals; the breed was ranked the second worst-affected by this condition out of 157 breeds tested.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers {{are also}} {{affected}} by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, {{and they can}} suffer from such other general maladies as <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> which are common across many types of dog breeds.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans is {{difficult}} to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: There is no {{consensus}} on the treatment of developmental <b>dysplasia</b> of the <b>hip</b> in children less than 24 months of age. The {{aim of this study}} was to present the results of open reduction and concomitant primary soft-tissue intervention in patients with developmental <b>dysplasia</b> of the <b>hip</b> in children less than 24 months of age. Materials and Methods: Sixty hips of 50 patients (4 male, 46 female) with mean age of 14. 62 ± 5. 88 (range 5 - 24 months) months with a mean followup of 40. 00 ± 6. 22 (range 24 - 58 months) months were included. Twenty five right and 35 left hips (10 bilaterally involved) were operated. Open reduction was performed using the medial approach in patients aged < 20 months (with Tönnis type II-III and IV <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasias)</b> and for those aged 20 - 24 months with Tönnis type II and III <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasias</b> (n = 47). However for 13 patients aged 20 - 24 months with Tönnis type IV <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasias,</b> anterior bikini incision was used. Results: Mean acetabular index was 41. 03 ± 3. 78 ° (range 34 °- 50 °) in the preoperative period and 22. 98 ± 3. 01 ° (range 15 °- 32 °) at the final visits. Mean center-edge angle at the final visits was 22. 85 ± 3. 35 ° (18 °- 32 °). Based on Severin radiological classification, 29 (48. 3 %) were type I (very good), 25 (41. 7 %) were type II (good) and 6 (10 %) were type III (fair) hips. According to the McKay clinical classification, postoperatively the hips were evaluated as excellent (n = 42; 70 %), good (n = 14; 23. 3 %) and fair (n = 4; 6. 7 %). Reduction of all hip dislocations was achieved. Additional pelvic osteotomies were performed in 14 (23. 3 %) hips for continued acetabular dysplasia and recurrent subluxation. (Salter [n = 12]/Pemberton [n = 2] osteotomy was performed). Avascular necrosis (AVN) developed in 7 (11. 7 %) hips. Conclusion: In DDH only soft-tissue procedures are not enough, because of the high rate of the secondary surgery and AVN for all cases aged less than 24 months. Bone procedures may be necessary in the walking age group with high acetabular index...|$|R
25|$|It is {{also common}} to X-ray the spine and legs, {{as well as}} the <b>hips,</b> where <b>dysplasia</b> is suspected, since soft tissues can be {{affected}} by the extra strain of a dysplastic hip, or there may be other undetected factors such as neurological issues (e.g. nerve damage) involved.|$|R
2500|$|In {{unilateral}} dysplasia {{only one}} joint shows deformity, the contralateral side may show resulting effects. [...] In {{the majority of}} unilateral cases the left <b>hip</b> has the <b>dysplasia.</b>|$|R
5|$|In addition, Clumbers {{often have}} {{difficulties}} conceiving and giving birth, and may require caesarian sections. Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to anaesthesia. The most common severe health {{conditions in the}} Clumber Spaniel are entropion/ectropion eye conditions, spinal disc herniation and <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> They have a median lifespan of around 10 years.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed is {{uncertain}} prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various British Monarchs, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 {{became one of the}} first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> or spinal disc herniation.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{somewhat}} prone to <b>hip</b> and elbow <b>dysplasia,</b> especially the larger dogs, {{though not as}} much as some other breeds. Hip scores are recommended before breeding and often joint supplements are recommended.|$|R
5000|$|Health {{concerns}} {{within the}} breed include <b>hip</b> and elbow <b>dysplasia,</b> progressive retinal atrophy, bloat, and cancer, {{with a relatively}} high incidence of lymphoma and mast cell tumours. Bullmastiffs are prone to certain hereditary diseases, including: ...|$|R
25|$|Like {{its native}} {{relative}} the Hortaya Borzaya, the borzoi {{is basically a}} very sound breed. OCD, <b>hip</b> and elbow <b>dysplasia</b> have remained almost unknown, as were congenital eye and heart diseases before the 1970s. However, in some countries modern breeding practices have introduced a few problems.|$|R
5|$|There {{are a few}} ocular {{conditions}} to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition. These include cataracts, retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia. <b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels. In a health {{survey conducted by the}} Kennel Club (UK), the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer, with the second most frequent cause being old age. The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months, which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. <b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the occurrence of <b>hip</b> joint <b>dysplasia</b> (HJD) was carried out on the following hunting dogs in the Slovak Republic in the period 1995 - 2000 : Bavarian mountain hound and Hannoverian hound. During the period under investigation we examined 299 animals of both breeds- 206 bitches and 93 dogs. Whereas in 1995 we found that 38. 3 % were affected by HJD, {{by the end of}} the observation period the number of HJD-positive dogs decreased to 26. 1 % in both breeds. Analysis of the results also showed that HJD was diagnosed in 22. 3 % of bitches and 18. 9 % of dogs. The differences between positive and negative findings during the investigated period were significant (P≤ 0. 05) when evaluated by χ 2 test. The incidence of HJD in both hunting dog breeds showed a decreasing tendency, probably as a result of selective breeding. HJD was evaluated using a 5 -point gradation system, extending from A to E. However, stages D and E were not diagnosed. Key words: <b>dysplasia,</b> <b>hip</b> joint, do...|$|R

5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is {{not common}} in the breed, {{although}} it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is {{uncommon}} in Salukis, with the breed ranking joint lowest {{in a survey}} by the British Veterinary Association in 2003. The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is high. In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma. The secondary cause of death was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects. Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death.|$|E
40|$|This {{new item}} is about: Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine invites Black Russian Terriers to {{participate}} in a genetic study that will improve {{the health and well-being of}} these dogs.

30|$|Twenty-eight {{patients}} (24 {{women and}} 4 men) aged between 44 and 50  years (mean 47  years) were observed. Clinical evaluation was rated with the Harris Hip Score. Radiographic evaluation consisted in standard anteroposterior and axial view radiographs of the hip. According to Crowe’s classification, 16 <b>hips</b> presented <b>dysplasia</b> grade 1, 14 grade 2, and 4 grade 3. All patients {{were treated with}} total hip arthroplasty using a cementless tapered stem (Wagner Cone Prosthesis). Six patients were operated bilaterally, with a totally of 34 hips operated. After surgery, the patients were clinically and radiographically checked at 3, 6, and 12  months and yearly thereafter until an average follow-up of 12  years (range 10 – 14  years).|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{present the}} 18 year {{survival}} and the clinical and radiological {{outcomes of the}} Müller straight stem, cemented, total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: Between 1989 and 2007, 176 primary total hip arthroplasties in 164 consecutive patients were performed in our institution by the senior author. All patients received a Müller cemented straight stem and a cemented polyethylene liner. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 62 years (45 - 78). The diagnosis was primary osteoarthritis in 151 <b>hips,</b> <b>dysplasia</b> of the <b>hip</b> in 12 and subcapital fracture of the femur in 13. Following discharge, serial follow-up consisted of clinical evaluation based on the Harris Hip Score and radiological assessment. The survival of the prosthesis using revision for any reason as an end-point was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four (15 %) patients died during the follow-up study, 6 (4 %) patients were lost, while the remaining 134 patients (141 hips) were followed-up for a mean of 10 years (3 - 18 years). HSS score at the latest follow-up revealed that 84 hips (59. 5 %) had excellent results, 30 (22. 2 %) good, 11 (7. 8 %) fair and 9 (6. 3 %) poor. There were 3 acetabular revisions due to aseptic loosening. Six (4. 2 %) stems were diagnosed as having radiographic definitive loosening; however, only 1 was revised. 30 % of the surviving stems showed no radiological changes of radiolucency, while 70 % showed some changes. Survival of the prosthesis for any reason was 96 % at 10 years and 81 % at 18 years. CONCLUSION: The 18 year survival of the Müller straight stem, cemented THA is comparable to those of other successful cemented systems...|$|R
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English Cocker Spaniel had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, {{the most common cause of}} death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second most common cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American Cocker Spaniel was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th.|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as <b>hip</b> <b>dysplasia</b> are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, <b>Hip</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
30|$|Holman {{and colleagues}} [9] {{conducted}} a retrospective review of 53 patients (66 hips) treated {{by either the}} Ludloff MAOR (18 hips) or anterior open reduction (48 <b>hips)</b> for developmental <b>dysplasia</b> of the <b>hip</b> between 1955 and 1995 across four specialist children hospitals in the USA. The mean age at surgery for the medial approach group was 1.4  years (0.41 – 3.5  years) with an average follow-up time of 25  years.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-two dysplastic hips with {{secondary}} osteoarthritis, in 28 patients aged 18 to 42 years, {{were treated}} by combined intertrochanteric and Chiari osteotomy. They were followed up for 2. 5 to 10 years. Pain {{was the main}} presenting symptom in all the patients. The indication for surgery {{was based on the}} severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia. The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47. 7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes. On final review the average score was 88. The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72 % of <b>hips</b> and <b>dysplasia</b> was improved in all cases. The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{may have}} produced a beautiful variety of dog breeds, {{but it has also}} left many with a legacy of genetic disease.
