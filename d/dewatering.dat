5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to <b>dewatering</b> by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
25|$|Rapid <b>dewatering</b> {{of sandy}} sediments, {{possibly}} triggered by seismic activity, can cause convolute bedding.|$|E
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} <b>dewatering</b> options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt presses and membrane filter presses. In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt press filter, for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of <b>dewatering</b> equipment. Belt press filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this <b>dewatering</b> occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of <b>dewatering</b> in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The <b>dewatering</b> achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote <b>dewatering.</b> <b>Dewatering</b> can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E
25|$|Unsuitable soils include soft clays {{and weak}} running soils that allow large {{movements}} such as loose sands. It {{is also not}} possible to extend the wall beyond {{the bottom of the}} excavation and <b>dewatering</b> is often required.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} {{secondary treatment}} processes, {{most of the}} electricity is used for aeration, pumping systems and equipment for the <b>dewatering</b> and drying of sewage sludge. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} dredge adjacent bodies of water. In early 2016, during the <b>dewatering</b> stage of the operation, {{a total of three}} geotubes discharged a small quantity of sediment containing several contaminants. Dredging was halted pending development of a plan to prevent future such spills.|$|E
25|$|The {{final output}} from {{anaerobic}} digestion systems is water, which originates {{both from the}} moisture content of the original waste that was treated and water produced during the microbial reactions in the digestion systems. This water may be released from the <b>dewatering</b> of the digestate or may be implicitly separate from the digestate.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in October 1998 with the {{excavation}} of the Gilman Portal and <b>dewatering</b> work at the two intermediate shafts. Tunnel excavation was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep <b>dewatering</b> wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>dewatering</b> {{objectives}} include {{reducing the}} volume {{to reduce the}} transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing fuel requirements before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes. Belt filters are specifically designed {{for each of these}} particular applications and feeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{belt filter}} is mainly used for <b>dewatering</b> of sludge and slurry and juice {{extraction}} from apples, pears and other fruits, {{as well as}} grapes for winemaking, etc. Belt filters are used both municipally and industrially {{in a range of}} areas including urban sewage and wastewater treatment, metallurgy and mining, steel plants, coal plants, breweries, dyeing, tanneries, as well as chemical and paper factories.|$|E
25|$|The {{filter cake}} usually {{has a high}} enough solid {{concentration}} to allow {{for all types of}} disposal methods without further treatment including recycling back into the process, landfill/composting and incineration. The polymer content makes filter cake from a belt press filter more suited to the aforementioned disposal methods than a cake conditioned with ferric chloride and lime which can occur with other <b>dewatering</b> processes.|$|E
25|$|The mine owners retaliated with a lockout of all {{the rest}} of the Leadville mines, so that by 22 June, the entire mining {{district}} was idled, with a total of about 2,250 mine workers out of work. The mine owners turned off the <b>dewatering</b> pumps and allowed the mines to start to fill with water, showing that they were prepared for a long strike.|$|E
25|$|A {{belt filter}} press {{is also known}} for its high {{capacity}} throughput, as {{it is designed to}} handle excess capacity. It has low initial costs and low energy running costs, however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the belt filter press may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical <b>dewatering</b> methods such as drying beds or reed beds.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} belt filter press used for <b>dewatering,</b> including centrifuges, vacuum-disc filters, and the {{plate and frame filter}} press. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the system}} uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the {{fermentation}} requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this front {{step in the}} process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in {{the front end of the}} process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after <b>dewatering,</b> where volumes are small.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 2011, {{the cruiser}} Cape St. George {{responded to a}} {{distress}} call from a sinking Iranian dhow by dispatching a rescue team via a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) (pictured). The U.S. naval team attempted to repair the dhow's <b>dewatering</b> pumps, but {{they were unable to}} stop the flooding. The Iranian fishermen were brought aboard the Cape St. George where they were examined by the medical staff before being transferred to an Iranian customs vessel.|$|E
25|$|That afternoon, a crane barge {{arrived on}} scene, and {{prepared}} to right and raise the ferry, which by now rested on the river bottom near the West Bank, with the hull barely protruding from the water. Overnight, the ferry was turned over by the salvage crew. The next morning, lifting operations began, and continued late into the night. At 10:00 p.m., the ferry was raised enough to permit <b>dewatering</b> operations, and the river reopened to limited marine traffic. The ferry was towed to the Louisiana Department of Highways yard in Plaquemine, LA, for further investigation. The damage was deemed irreparable, and the George Prince never sailed again.|$|E
25|$|The Rocky Mountains contain several {{sedimentary}} basins {{that are}} rich in coalbed methane. Coalbed methane is natural gas that arises from coal, either through bacterial action, or through exposure to high temperature. Coalbed methane supplies 7 percent of the natural gas used in the United States. The largest coalbed methane sources in the Rocky Mountains are in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado and the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. These two basins are estimated to contain 38 trillion cubic feet of gas. Coalbed methane can be recovered by <b>dewatering</b> the coal bed, and separating the gas from the water; or injecting water to fracture the coal to release the gas (so-called hydraulic fracturing).|$|E
25|$|Following the Roman {{departure}} from Britain in the 5th century, the mine lay abandoned for centuries. There was a revival in the 19th century {{and attempts to}} make successful ventures at the site in the early 20th century, but they were abandoned before the first world war. In the 1930s a shaft was sunk to 430 feet {{in an attempt to}} locate new seams. Falling into disrepair and unsafe due to flooding at its lower levels, the mine finally closed in 1938. It was during this period that ancient underground workings were found, and the fragment of the <b>dewatering</b> mill discovered within. The extensive surface remains, especially the traces of hydraulic mining, were to be discovered only in the 1970s by intensive fieldwork and surveying.|$|E
25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no <b>dewatering</b> capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety {{in the event}} of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent by}} which Searsville Reservoir {{serves as a}} source for {{non-native}} species was illustrated when Stanford biologists studied the aquatic fauna found in the plunge pool below the Searsville dam spillway. The plunge pool was drained in 2013 to allow for a safety inspection of the base of the dam. Native species found when the plunge pool was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the <b>dewatering</b> process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Other non-native in the plunge pool included 500 bullfrogs and 150 Louisiana red swamp crayfish.|$|E
25|$|A ribbon {{either side}} of the route from Spalding to Sutton Bridge was {{populated}} in Roman times, and was again evident in the Domesday Book. Enclosing and reclamation of the salt marsh to the north of this area took place from the seventeenth century, and drainage was overseen by the Court of Sewers. In 1793, the South Holland Drainage District was set up by Act of Parliament, and carried out extensive drainage work, but the schemes were hampered by the state of the River Nene outfall. This was replaced in 1832, and allowed the district to lower their own sluice in 1852, to provide better gravity discharge. The need to grow more food during and after the Second World War resulted in large areas of grassland being ploughed up for agriculture, and the drains were made deeper and wider to improve the soil conditions. The main outfall sluice was again rebuilt in 1937, and its construction involved the first use of well point <b>dewatering</b> equipment in England.|$|E
25|$|He {{describes}} the many innovations made in building design {{to improve the}} living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost {{among them is the}} development of the hypocaust, a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gives explicit instructions how to design such buildings so that fuel efficiency is maximised, so that for example, the caldarium is next to the tepidarium followed by the frigidarium. He also advises on using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he does not suggest it himself, it is likely that his <b>dewatering</b> devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel was used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks {{at the top of the}} larger thermae, such as the Baths of Diocletian. The one which was used in Bath of Caracalla for grinding flour.|$|E
500|$|Groundbreaking was on August 5, 1966, {{marking the}} {{beginning}} of construction of the World Trade Center's foundations. [...] The site of the World Trade Center was located on landfill, with the bedrock located [...] below grade. In order to construct the World Trade Center, {{it was necessary to}} build [...] "The Bathtub", with the slurry wall along the West Street side of the site, to keep water from the Hudson River out. [...] This method was used in place of conventional <b>dewatering</b> methods because lowering the groundwater table would cause large settlements of nearby buildings not built on deep foundations. [...] The slurry method involves digging a trench, and as excavation proceeds, filling the space with a [...] "slurry" [...] mixture, composed of bentonite which plugs holes and keeps water out. [...] When the trench was dug out, a steel cage was inserted, with concrete poured in, forcing the [...] "slurry" [...] out. [...] The [...] "slurry" [...] method was devised by Port Authority chief engineer John M. Kyle Jr. [...] Towards the end of 1966, work began on building the slurry wall, led by Montreal-based Icanda, a subsidiary of an Italian engineering firm, Impresa Costruzioni Opere Specializzate (I.C.O.S.). [...] It took fourteen months for the slurry wall to be completed, which was necessary before excavation of material from the interior of the site could begin. [...] The original Hudson Tubes, which carried PATH trains into Hudson Terminal, remained in service as elevated tunnels until 1971 when a new PATH station was built.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of a belt press filter is often assessed {{based on the}} dry solids content of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt. Solids recovery is the percentage of dry solids recovered from the feed sludge. Solids recovery {{is dependent on the}} filter media which must be selected for good permeability to promote <b>dewatering</b> but with pore diameter sufficiently small so that solids recovery is not greatly decreased. It is important that the belt press filter has an effective belt washing section so that blinding does not decrease the permeability of the belt. Solids recovery is directly related to filtrate quality and thus the filter media and process arrangement must satisfy the desired cake and filtrate qualities. Dry solids content {{is a measure of the}} degree of <b>dewatering.</b> The degree of <b>dewatering</b> is increased when the belt speed is decreased. Lowering the belt speed reduces the capacity of the process. The following correlation relates input mass flow rate to belt speed: ...|$|E
2500|$|New {{regulations}} {{published in}} the Federal Register on December 19, 2015, stipulate a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines for safe disposal and storage. Designed to prevent pond failures and protect groundwater, enhanced inspection, record keeping and monitoring is specified.

2500|$|PEMs are minimially invasive, {{typically}} covering approximately 0.00005% of the beach. The {{tubes are}} below the beach surface, with no visible presence.

2500|$|In 2014, {{radioactive}} sludge in the Pile Fuel Storage Pond (PFSP), built between 1948 and 1952, {{started to}} be repackaged in drums to reduce the [...] "sludge hazard" [...] and to allow the pond to be decommissioned. [...] Decommissioning will require retrieval of sludge and solids, prior to <b>dewatering</b> and deconstruction, with retrievals planned for completion in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Activated sludge is {{also the}} name given to the active {{biological}} material produced by activated sludge plants. Excess sludge is called [...] "surplus activated sludge" [...] or [...] "waste activated sludge" [...] and {{is removed from the}} treatment process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied in the wastewater in balance. This sewage sludge is usually mixed with primary sludge from the primary clarifiers and undergoes further sludge treatment for example by anaerobic digestion, followed by thickening, <b>dewatering,</b> composting and land application.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the strike}} in Coeur d'Alene {{just four years}} earlier, mine owners [...] "claimed that they {{accepted}} miners' unions and were {{willing to work with}} them". In Leadville, mine owners essentially denied that unions had any right to exist. The owners refused to use the word [...] "union". Their communications were addressed to miners, rather than to their organization. Some owners of mines with <b>dewatering</b> pumps may have threatened to turn off the pumps, flooding adjacent interconnected mine workings, along with their own, to keep the adjacent mines from meeting the union demands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{belt filter}} (sometimes called a belt press filter, or belt filter press) is an {{industrial}} machine, used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the <b>dewatering</b> of sludges in the chemical industry, mining and water treatment. Belt filter presses {{are also used}} {{in the production of}} apple juice, cider and winemaking. The process of filtration is primarily obtained by passing a pair of filtering cloths and belts through a system of rollers. [...] The system takes a sludge or slurry as a feed, and separates it into a filtrate and a solid cake.|$|E
2500|$|By August 10, {{excavation}} work {{was two weeks}} ahead of schedule, and 80 percent complete. All foundation work {{was expected to be}} finished by December 1. Engineers said that digging would stop when it reached [...] below grade, at which point 1,100 wells would begin a two-week period of draining water from the site. Once drainage was complete, the site would be excavated another [...] Excavation was expected to end in mid-October. Pumping began on August 25. Initially, drainage went well. The water table dropped by [...] by September 9, and {{excavation work}} was expected to resume on September 13. However, heavy silt prevented the wells from functioning correctly, and by October 10 excavation had still not resumed. A protracted dispute between Hunkin-Conkey and the city broke out. Hunkin-Conkey claimed that it knew the contractually-specified method of <b>dewatering</b> the site would not work, but the city was insistent. The firm also expressed concern that the drainage system specified for below the foundation would not work, either. With 850 wellpoints in operation, the water table had been lowered [...] Another [...] remained, but only [...] per minute were coming out of the wells, rather than the required [...] per minute. The excavation was now six weeks behind schedule, incurring a $2,000-a-day loss ($ per day in [...] dollars). Hunkin-Conkey refused to incur additional costs, and demanded that the city or the architect pay for a new means of <b>dewatering</b> the site. But the city argued that the contract required Hunkin-Conkey to incur the cost, and that the company could have added more wellpoints or contracted out the <b>dewatering</b> but chose neither. Mayor Celebrezze suggested that Hunkin-Conkey merely install 200 more wellpoints, a relatively inexpensive solution that would cost between $4,000 and $6,000. But Hunkin-Conkey now claimed they had 1,100 wells in operation, and additional wellpoints would not matter. Hunkin-Conkey declined to install the wellpoints, and sarcastically asked the mayor to specify exactly where the wells should be installed. By December 2, there was still no movement on the drainage issue, and the project was two months behind.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2014, the First Generation Magnox Storage Pond (FGMSP) {{remains as}} a {{priority}} decommissioning project. As well as nuclear waste, the pond holds about 1,200 cubic metres of radioactive sludge of unknown characteristics and 14,000 cubic metres of contaminated water. [...] Decommissioning initially requires retrieval of the radioactive sludge into a newly built Sludge Packaging Plant 1, as well as fuel and skip retrieval.

2500|$|They {{followed}} the veins with shafts and tunnels underground, {{some of which}} still exist on the site. The remains of Roman <b>dewatering</b> machines were found during the 1880s and the 1920s when the Rio Tinto mines in Spain were being mined by opencast methods. [...] At Dolaucothi, a similar discovery was made in 1935 during mining operations, and it included part of a reverse overshot water-wheel which {{is now in the}} National Museum of Wales. It was found with burnt timbers, suggesting that fire-setting was used to help break up the hard quartz in which the gold was trapped. A similar but larger wheel was rediscovered during mine operations at Rio Tinto in Spain, and is now in the British Museum, where it is displayed prominently in the Roman gallery. The Spanish example included a sequence of no fewer than 16 reverse overshot water-wheels, each pair of wheels feeding water to the next set in the sequence. Each wheel would have been worked like a treadwheel, from the side rather than at the top, {{but it would have been}} a hard and lonely activity for the miners working these wheels lifting water from the mine bottom. Since the fragment of a reverse overshot water-wheel was found 160 feet below any known adit or stope, it must have been part of a similar sequence at Dolaucothi to that in Spain. Gold mining was sophisticated and technologically advanced at Dolaucothi, suggesting that the Roman army itself pioneered exploitation at the site. The construction of such <b>dewatering</b> machines is described by the Roman engineer Vitruvius writing in 25 BC, and their use for irrigation and lifting water in thermae was widespread.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were also}} skilled in mining, {{building}} aqueducts needed {{to supply equipment}} used in extracting metal ores, e.g. hydraulic mining, and the building of reservoirs to hold the water needed at the minehead. It is known that they were also capable of building and operating mining equipment such as crushing mills and <b>dewatering</b> machines. [...] Large diameter vertical wheels of Roman vintage, for raising water, have been excavated from the Rio Tinto mines in Southwestern Spain. They were closely involved in exploiting gold resources such as those at Dolaucothi in south west Wales and in north-west Spain, a country where gold mining developed on a very large scale {{in the early part}} of the first century AD, such as at Las Medulas.|$|E
