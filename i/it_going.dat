5|$|Scouting {{virtually}} started itself, but {{the trigger}} that set <b>it</b> <b>going</b> was the 1908 publication of Scouting for Boys written by Robert Baden-Powell. At Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools, Baden-Powell {{had an interest}} in the outdoors. Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E
5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of <b>it</b> <b>going</b> back to 1953.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements in the subway.

The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of <b>it</b> <b>going</b> for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E

5|$|From the first, {{research}} into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a fission bomb, the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient to keep <b>it</b> <b>going.</b> The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. An important contribution was made by Emil Konopinski, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases {{five times as much}} energy as a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a fission bomb, but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.|$|E
5|$|On September20, {{roughly one}} day prior to Igor's arrival in Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issued {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings for southern Newfoundland and the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The following day the CHC issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} eastern and northern coasts. Although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island, warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Early on September22, all advisories were discontinued as Igor {{moved away from the}} region. In response to the storm's arrival, schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at St. John's International Airport. Offshore, an oil rig with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of Newfoundland on September19. In comparison to Hurricane Earl two weeks earlier, there was substantially less media attention given to Igor, attributed to the possibility of <b>it</b> <b>going</b> out to sea.|$|E

5|$|The first {{alternative}} was to march southeast to the River Kennet and cross <b>it,</b> <b>going</b> through Newbury {{and returning to}} Reading's fortifications, thus evading the Royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to London. The disadvantage to {{this was the time}} it would take to cross the relatively open land between Essex's position and the Kennet. The second, and the option Essex initially took, was to go north, either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade the Royalists. If Essex was able to cross to {{the west bank of the}} River Avon, he could secure the bridges across it and prevent the Royalists from crossing it and confronting his army. His cavalry advanced to Upton to screen the main force from Royalist interference on 11 September, with the rest of the soldiers quickly following. The Royalists were left wrong-footed; Charles did not discover Essex's retreat for another 24 hours, during which the gap between the armies widened. The Royalists finally began to march on 16 September, with Rupert's cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt the Parliamentarian retreat.|$|E
5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of <b>it</b> <b>going</b> extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.|$|E
