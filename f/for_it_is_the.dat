5|$|Curtis Benson {{wrote the}} film {{adaptation}} <b>for</b> <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> Law; unlike the theatrical version, his screenplay presents the story entirely in chronological order. J. Gordon Edwards directed, {{the only time}} he did so in 1924, as he was primarily serving as Fox Film's director-general at the time. It was also his last time to direct; he retired from Fox after the film's completion, and although he expressed an interest to returning to the role, he died of pneumonia the following year. Filming took place at Fox's New York studio, although most production had by then moved to Hollywood. It Is the Law was one of only four films Fox made at its East Coast facility in 1924. Except for four Allan Dwan films in 1926, they were the last Fox produced in New York. The Film Daily reported that a trailer was produced to advertise the film.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of bells}} is {{symbolic}} of the proclamation of the Gospel. Sometimes Orthodox churches and monasteries will combine the use of bells with the striking of a wooden or metal semantron, with the semantron being sounded first, then the bells being rung later. The quieter and simpler sound of the semantron is understood to symbolize the Old Testament prophets, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> symbol only of a coming event, whereas the ringing of the bells is spread far into the air symbolizing the annunciation of the Gospel throughout the world.|$|E

500|$|In art and architecture, acutely {{vertical}} {{buildings are}} {{often seen as}} a symbol of masculinity and horizontal buildings are seen as more feminine. The terms [...] "phallic verticality", [...] "phallic erectility" [...] and [...] "phallic brutality" [...] have been referred to by architectural theorists, including the likes of French sociologist Henri Lefebvre, who [...] argued that buildings of phallic architectural type metaphorically symbolize [...] "force, male fertility, masculine violence". Phallic erectility [...] "bestows a special status on the perpendicular, proclaiming phallocracy as the orientation of space" [...] while phallic brutality [...] "does not remain abstract, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> brutality of political power." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} Hoxne Hoard was discovered, there was speculation, {{based on the}} name [...] "Faustinus" [...] {{engraved}} {{on one of the}} spoons, that it may have come from the [...] "Villa Faustini" [...] that is recorded in Itinerary V of the Antonine Itinerary. The exact location of Villa Faustini is unknown, but as it was the first station after Colchester, it {{is believed to have been}} somewhere on the Pye Road (modern A140) and one of the possible locations <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> modern village of Scole, only a couple of miles from Hoxne. This early theory has since been rejected, however, because [...] "Faustinus" [...] was historically a common name, and it only occurs on a single spoon in the hoard. Furthermore, the logic of using inscriptions on individual items in the hoard to determine ownership of the hoard as a whole is considered flawed. Based on the dating of the coins in the hoard, the majority of which belong to the period 394–405, it also has been speculated that the contents of the hoard originally belonged to a military family that accompanied Count Theodosius to Britain in 368–369, and which may have left with Constantine III in 407.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{retired in}} 2006. He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red blood in his veins joins <b>for.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E
