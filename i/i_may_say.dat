5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding {{reached the}} Shangani about 08:00, but quickly {{saw that the}} water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance. Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still going on. On reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> {{that we are the}} sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E

And now {{for the cause of}} this disturbance, not unexpected, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams."

500|$|On September 12, {{the explorers}} {{resigned}} themselves to wintering {{on the ice}} and camped on a large floe, letting the ice take them where it would, [...] "which", writes Kjellström, [...] "it had really been doing all along" [...] (p.47). Drifting rapidly due south towards Kvitøya, they hurriedly built a winter [...] "home" [...] on the floe against the increasing cold, with walls made of water-reinforced snow to Strindberg's design (see plan, below, left). Observing the rapidity of their drift, Andrée recorded his hopes that they might get far enough south to feed themselves entirely from the sea. However, the floe began to break up directly under the hut on October 2 from the stresses of pressing against Kvitøya, and they were forced to bring their stores on to the island itself, which took a couple of days. [...] "Morale remains good", reports Andrée {{at the very end of}} the coherent part of his diary, which ends: [...] "Med sådana kamrater bör man kunna reda sig under snart sagdt hvilka omständigheter som helst." [...] ("With such comrades one should be able to manage under, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> any circumstances".) It is inferred from the incoherent and badly damaged last pages of Andrée's diary that the three men were all dead within a few days of moving onto the island.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, {{the patrol}} found {{the king and}} Wilson sent a message back to the laager {{requesting}} reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, {{under the command of}} Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson's patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson's patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other men, Pearl [...] "Pete" [...] Ingram (a Montana cowboy) and William Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that we are the sole survivors of that party." [...] Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.|$|E

500|$|Activity was {{happening}} {{elsewhere on the}} field, however, and as the battle drew to a close, Napoleon's Middle Guard launched {{an assault on the}} British line, to the 52nd's left, and were met by a number of regiments including the 1st Foot Guards, who repulsed the 3rd Chasseurs, but had to themselves retreat when the 4th Chasseurs moved forward to threaten their left. The 52nd, under Sir John Colborne, wheeled to the left, deploying parallel to the French column, and fired volleys against their left flank. William Hay, a Light Dragoon watching from the right, later recalled that [...] "so well-directed a fire was poured in, that down the bank the Frenchmen fell and, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say,</b> the battle of Waterloo was gained." [...] Seeing the 52nd begin an advance, Wellington reputedly ordered [...] "Go on, Colborne, they won't stand!"; the battalion then advanced diagonally across the field. When this was later followed by a bayonet charge by all of General Adam's 3rd Brigade, the Guard broke, forced into full retreat. Having pursued the French down the escarpment of Mont St Jean, the 52nd crossed the valley floor (that {{at the start of the}} battle had separated the armies) and on the other side attacked a square of Old Guard (part of the personal body guard of Napoleon,) that had formed up to the British right of the inn La Belle Alliance and forced it to retreat.|$|E
500|$|Of Locke's major {{claims in}} the Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Some Thoughts Concerning Education, two played a {{defining}} role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes {{at the opening of}} his treatise, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education." [...] In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the Augustinian view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in original sin, and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his Essay Locke posits an [...] "empty" [...] mind—a tabula rasa—that is [...] "filled" [...] by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on Plato's Theatetus, which suggests that the mind is like a [...] "wax tablet". Although Locke argued strenuously for the tabula rasa theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their [...] "aptitudes," [...] and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for." ...|$|E

But Asquith missed a magnificent opportunity, by failing to incorporate into the Bill any significant concessions to Ulster Unionists, who then campaigned relentlessly against it. Nonetheless by 1914 Redmond had become a nationalist hero of Parnellite stature and could have had every expectation of becoming head of a new Irish government in Dublin.|$|E
