2500|$|On June 27, 2001, the ICJ, rejecting {{all of the}} United States' arguments, {{ruled in}} favor of Germany. The ICJ held that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963 (Vienna Convention) [...] granted rights to {{individuals}} {{on the basis of its}} plain meaning, and that domestic laws could not limit the rights of the accused under the convention, but only specify the means by which those rights were to be exercised. The ICJ also found that its own provisional measures were legally binding. The nature of provisional measures has been a subject of great dispute in international law; the English text of the Statute of the International Court of Justice implies they are not binding, while the French text implies that they are. Faced with a contradiction between two <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> of the statute, the court considered which interpretation better served the objects and purposes of the statute, and hence found that they are binding. This was the first time in the court's history it had ruled as such.|$|E
40|$|The EU {{legal system}} and the legal systems of its Member States have {{to adapt to the}} ever-changing nature of society and are {{therefore}} in a constantly evolving state. The EU, which is characterised by a unique lawmaking system, has proved to be an inexhaustible source of legislation, giving rise to a dynamic legal context. The same dynamicity can be observed also from a linguistic perspective. Due to the multilingualism principle, which makes multilingual communication a mandatory activity in EU institutions, new EU legislation and, consequently, new legal concepts are expressed in <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> <b>texts.</b> As a result, 23 different varieties of national official languages are being developed within the EU and existing terms are already undergoing a Europeanisation process. This paper presents a case study conducted on the terminology extracted from a corpus of parallel EU documents in English and Italian on the specific subdomain of the standing of victims in criminal proceedings and victims’ rights, and discusses the consequences of concept transfer between legal systems within a multidimensional context and in terms of monolingual and multilingual secondary term formation...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{multilingualism}} {{within the}} EU {{is based on}} the widely accepted principle of equality of authentic texts, which have the same legal force and are thus expected to convey the same meaning. In this regard, it is to be acknowledged that the <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> building the acquis communautaire are not the result of multilingual legal drafting, which would involve 23 official languages, but rather the product of translation or, as some authors may prefer, “interlingual text reproduction” (Kjær 2007). In order to ensure intelligible and consistent legislation, in 2003 the Joint Practical Guide of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission for persons involved in the drafting of legislation within the Community institutions was published. Considering that in its Guideline 6 the Guide recommends an inter- and intra-textually consistent usage of terminology, a contrastive analysis of a selection of English and Italian terms extracted from victim-related EU acts will be conducted. The approach of this analysis will be parole-oriented and descriptive, and consequently different from traditional prescriptive multilingual terminological work, whose purpose is to examine specialized languages in order to select the most suitable equivalents in a specific field to be collected in a repository to be used by translators and technical writers. The main aim of the analysis is to observe the terms or other linguistic strategies which are used in the Italian texts to reproduce English domain-specific terms in order to shed light on terminological variation and different forms of interlingual lexical inconsistency in Italian texts, even when the latter maintain conceptual coherence when compared to the English texts. On the basis of such an analysis, an attempt is made to evaluate quality from a terminological perspective. Since no single definition of quality – especially in language-based professions – is available, {{for the purposes of this}} study quality is intended as the adequacy of terminological solutions adopted to guarantee “total concordance” (Vlachopoulos 2008) among different linguistic versions of the same legal texts, also in the light of the Guideline’s recommendation to maintain formal and substantive consistency in the usage of terminology in EU acts...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the ever-changing}} legal {{landscape}} of the European Union, the terminology used in EU documents is subject to constant formal and conceptual evolution. In this paper, a bilingual (Italian and English) corpus of <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> EU legal <b>texts</b> covering a time span of fifteen years (1998 - 2012) and concerning the legal area of victims of crime is analysed from a diachronic perspective. The aim is to discuss the terminological changes observed in the corpus {{in the light of}} the classification of evolution phenomena proposed by Tartier (2003) and Picton (2011). In order to examine both formal and conceptual terminological evolution, the distinction between genotypes and phenotypes introduced by Sacco (1991) is applied to the terms identified in the corpus and the underlying concepts. The analysis of the EU corpus shows that the three categories proposed by Tartier (appearance, disappearance and stability) and the first three (novelty and obsolescence, implantation of terms and concepts, and centrality) of the four categories proposed by Picton for the terminology of space technologies also apply to the terms of the examined legal area...|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{difference}} in CeCILL v2 {{is the fact}} that the English text was approved not as a draft translation (as in CeCILL v1) but as an <b>authentic</b> <b>text,</b> in addition to the <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> French version.

The province provision in its equally authentic languages [...] Chapter VI. Looking up [...] Bibliography [...] Appendices. The eventual migration of humans to outer space appears extremely likely when humanity’s development is viewed through the long‐term lens of the emerging discipline of ‘Big History’. When this future migration occurs, unexamined legal questions will arise {{at the intersection of}} international space law and international migration law. One possible governance model assisting such migration to outer space arises from an evolved understanding of the Outer Space Treaty, in particular its statement at Article I that the ‘exploration and use of outer space … shall be the province of all mankind. ’ The potential exists, de lege ferenda, to recognise the international legal personality of ‘mankind’ (or humankind), endowing this provision with the important role of investing residual sovereignty and ultimate title over areas of outer space in all of humanity. This thesis advocates such an evolutionary interpretation of the province provision, by recognising that the ordinary meaning of the word ‘province’ and both the activities of ‘exploration’ and ‘use’ all have legal associations with territory. Such a territorial conception can be highly facilitative of future migration to outer space and governance of space communities, by resulting in: 1) freedom of movement in outer space as an individual human right; 2) the bifurcation of sovereignty enabling territorial administration and resource utilisation by other subjects of international law; and 3) the ability for humankind to require acceptance of its compulsory jurisdiction over international disputes arising in outer space. This thesis undertakes a detailed examination of the Treaty’s travaux préparatoires to find a level of support exists within its negotiation history for this bold interpretation. Finally the term ‘the province of all mankind’ is analysed in each of the Treaty’s official languages, with this territorial conception of the province provision offering a unity of meaning between these five <b>equally</b> <b>authentic</b> <b>texts.</b> Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (vii, 142 pages...|$|E

Thus an empirical study was conducted within Sweden with the aim to examine the use of <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> in the Swedish EFL upper elementary classroom.

I intend to create language training materials for high‐intermediate to advanced students using <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> such as short stories, newspaper articles, poems, and famous essay. These texts will be supplemented with notes {{to assist with the}} understanding of vocabulary and cultural context. I will be writing original material in the form of explanations and activities that ensure students will focus on cultural and grammatical contexts as well, to help give students a greater understanding both of <b>authentic</b> <b>texts,</b> but also of United States culture, and American English from the past fifteen to twenty years in use. <b>Authentic</b> <b>texts,</b> such as newspaper articles, novels, or short stories, are often used for ESL/EFL learners in the classroom setting for their depictions of languagein‐ use. They are widely thought to give students more realistic linguistic examples as compared with traditional, simplified textbook language that is often presented in language textbooks. These materials are often adapted for the use of English learners in various countries, usually by means of simplification, so their language is closer {{to the level of the}} learners, often sounding stilted and inauthentic to native speakers, in order that the learners can more easily understand them. They are also generally somewhat deculturalized to account for the learner’s lack of knowledge cultural context of the original material. Bacon and Finnemann (1990), however, found that learners often preferred authentic reading material that related to current events, and to themselves. Young (1999) has found, as well, that evidence for the simplification of <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> being helpful for students is inconsistent at best, and that the most frequent problems encountered by English language learners are lexical in nature. I will get around the lexical problems Young discusses by providing vocabulary notes in the margins, with information on the difficulty of vocabulary, and thus the necessity of explaining it from English learner dictionaries.

Initially, a definition of authenticity and a survey of authentic material usage through history are provided. In the overview of the texts forming the corpus the texts are divided into authentic, adapted, apparently authentic and those for which no assumption can be made as to their authenticity. The authenticity analysis is also carried out by taking into account the analysis of/categorisation into text types (according to Adam).

However, none of the two hypo theses is confirmed, as <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> are found in the first three textbook sets, but not in the most recent one, while their presence is most pronounced in the oldest textbook set, i. e. in Le nouveau sans fronti`eres.
