50|$|Besides NEC, the VDC {{was used}} in two arcade games. The arcade version of Bloody Wolf ran on a custom version of the PC-Engine. Arcade {{hardware}} is missing the second 16-bit <b>graphic</b> <b>chip</b> known as the VCE, {{that is in the}} PC-Engine. This means the VDC directly accesses palette RAM and builds out the display signals/timing. A rare Capcom quiz-type arcade game also ran on {{a modified version of the}} SuperGrafx hardware, which used two VDCs.|$|E

Portion of text is devoted to signal {{processing}} and his affection of whole result including measuring it's quality. Describtion of the most important methods including super-resolution is given further in the text. An important part of this thesis is library implementing choosen methods with usage of paralelization on <b>graphic</b> <b>chip.</b> Achieved results of paralelization are demonstrated on set of speed tests...|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} now to program graphical hardware. Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) {{of the new}} generation as GeForce 3 of NVIDIA are containing processors which allow the software-developer to carry out short routines on the graphics hardware. In this thesis I will give a detailed summary of the structure and the capabilities of this new chip generation. Its pros and cons will be considered as well as I will discuss suggestions of improvement. One part of this paper will be a presentation of some shading methods and a water simulation both developed by myself. These demonstrators are directed to run completely on the processors of the new <b>graphic</b> <b>chip</b> generation. Refering to the defaults of the Application Programming Interfaces available right now, I will present an alternative Interface to drive the new GPU components. This Interface supports in particular the interchange-ability {{and the ability of}} combination of the GPU programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{company where}} this thesis was {{formulated}} constructs VR {{applications for the}} medical environment. The hardware used is ordinary dektops with consumer level graphics cards and haptic devices. In medicin some operations require microscopes or cameras. In order to simulate these in a virtual reality environment for educational purposes, the effect of depth of field or focus have to be considered. A working algorithm that generates this optical occurence in realtime, stereo rendered computer graphics is presented in this thesis. The algorithm is implemented in OpenGL and C++ to later be combined with a VR application simulating eye-surgery which is built with OpenGL Optimizer. Several different approaches are described in this report. The call for realtime stereo rendering (~ 60 fps) means {{taking advantage of the}} graphics hardware to a great extent. In OpenGL this means using the extensions to a specific <b>graphic</b> <b>chip</b> for better performance, in this case the algorithm is implemented for a GeForce 3 card. To increase the speed of the algorithm much of the workload is moved from the CPU to the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). By re-defining parts of the ordinary OpenGL pipeline via vertex programs, a distance-from-focus map can be stored in the alpha channel of the final image with little time loss. This can effectively be used to blend a previously blurred version of the scene with a normal render. Different techniques to quickly blur a renderedimage is discussed, to keep the speed up solutions that require moving data from the graphics card is not an option...|$|E
