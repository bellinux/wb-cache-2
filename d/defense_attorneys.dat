5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. <b>Defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail.

40|$|The {{right to}} have the {{assistance}} of <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> and to consult with him the way of defense {{is a part of}} the right of defense - a basic right in democratic countries, which is expressed in article 40 of Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms and also in various international treaties. The function of <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> in the criminal proceedings is irreplaceable. He provides legal aid though all stages of criminal procedure, but I concentrate on his role in preliminary procedure. The <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> defends his client from the beginning of criminal prosecution, but advocate can render help even before the criminal prosecution starts, during providing explanation. A right of <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> to search out evidence, present evidence and put it forward belongs among the means, which a <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> can use to defend his client and affect the course of criminal proceeding. Another right of <b>defense</b> <b>attorney</b> is to participate in the investigative act and the right to see the criminal file. Other rights of the defense counsel are listed in ยง 41 of the criminal procedure code. My thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter deals with the right of fair trial and a right of defense.

5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E

5|$|While {{the first}} trial was under way, events outside the {{courtroom}} influenced public perception of communism: the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon, and communists prevailed in the Chinese Civil War. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of {{up to five years}} in federal prison, further sentencing all five <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> to imprisonment for contempt of court. Two of the attorneys were subsequently disbarred.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} roles of various <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys,</b> {{including}} Phoenix Wright, his mentor Mia Fey, and his understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, and investigates cases and defends their clients in court; they find the truth by cross-examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence they have collected. The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney and the prosecutor. In the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations, the player takes the role of prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, and in the spin-off , they play as Phoenix's ancestor Ryลซnosuke Naruhodล.|$|E

Two <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys,</b> Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not accused them of this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single case {{that the government had}} alleged to have been fixed.|$|E

5|$|A {{more serious}} crisis {{occurred}} in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrรจs, whose early {{affiliation with the}} Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys,</b> with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Pรฉret and others as witnesses (a mannequin stood in for Barrรจs). Pรฉret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, Dada au grand air ("Dada in the Open Air") or Der Sรคngerkrieg in Tirol ("The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.|$|E
5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997โ2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys,</b> but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, <b>defense</b> <b>attorneys</b> used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
