50|$|Carbon dioxide {{can also}} be used as an {{atmospheric}} effect on its own. When liquid CO2 is released into the air, typically through an <b>electric</b> <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> to control timing and duration, the carbon dioxide liquid expands to a vapour and condenses the moisture in the air, creating large billowing plumes. When the solenoid valve is closed, the CO2 vapour rapidly disperses in the air, ending the effect nearly instantaneously. This effect can be used for a variety of applications, including simulating geysers of steam, in place of pyrotechnics, or to create an instant opaque wall for a reveal or disappearance during magic acts.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{landscape}} variability can be minimized through site-specific crop management. Variability in production agriculture affects profitability of operation mainly through yield impacts and {{the efficiency of}} input use. A field {{can be broken down}} into smaller areas called management zones. Management zones are created by an area in the field that has similar yield-limiting factors, and thus, the same rate of an input can be applied to that area to increase efficiency or yield. ^ Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is a site specific water management tool that can be utilized to apply the optimal amount of water on all acres resulting in increased overall yields. It has the potential to enhance water resources especially in areas with limited irrigation. The sector control system changes the pivot travel speed to alter the water application rates in each sector. Whereas, a zone control system varies rates in zones by pulse width modulation of <b>electric</b> <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves.</b> Defining field variability to build a prescription for water application typically uses soil electrical conductivity (EC) measurements. Tools are available to make irrigation scheduling decisions, which includes methods of feel and appearance of the soil, soil water content measurement, and soil water potential. Remote sensing imagery can also be important for in season and next year 2 ̆ 7 s evaluation of VRI prescriptions. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or <b>electric</b> <b>solenoid</b> operated shut-off <b>valve)</b> located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Incremental {{threshold}} loading (ITL) {{is a test}} of inspiratory muscle performance {{which is}} usually performed by breathing through a weighted inspiratory plunger, the load on the inspiratory muscles being increased by externally adding weights to the intake valve. This is not a true threshold device and may be inaccurate. This method was compared with a true threshold device consisting of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> which only opens to supply air at a predetermined negative mouth pressure. METHODS [...] Six naive, normal subjects (three men and three women) aged 22 - 24 years underwent three tests using each system. The inspiratory loads were increased every minute by equivalent amounts, - 10 cm H 2 O with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> and by 50 g with the weighted plunger, until the subjects could not inspire or sustain inspiration for a full minute. Six experienced subjects (four men and two women) aged 23 - 41 years were subsequently randomised to perform ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> twice with the breathing pattern fixed and twice free. RESULTS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> generated a more accurate mouth pressure response and was less variable at higher loads than the weighted plunger. The work performed (expressed as the pressure-time product) was less with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> but was more reproducible. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> was not influenced by controlling the breathing pattern of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> has several features that make it superior to the weighted plunger as a device for ITL. It generates a more accurate mouth pressure response which is less variable at higher loads. Increases in load are smoother and quicker to introduce. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> is not influenced by varying breathing patterns and does not require any external regulation...|$|R
