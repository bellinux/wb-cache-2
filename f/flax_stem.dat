40|$|Flax and hemp produce phloem fibres {{towards the}} {{periphery}} of their stems; individual fibre cells are cemented into discrete bundles around the xylem core by a complex matrix of pectins, hemi-celluloses and lignin. Extraction of undamaged fibres from this structure is critical in successful fibre production. Typically, the cut stems are laid {{on the ground in}} swaths for several weeks, where aerobic fungi colonize the senescing stem and hydrolytic enzymes digest the fibre-bundle matrix (dew-retting). More recently, <b>flax</b> <b>stems</b> have been chemically desiccated and the fibre-bundle matrix digested in the standing crop, prior to cutting (stand-retting). Dew-retted hemp stems were clamped horizontally into the jaws of a tensile testing machine and the work required to remove a strip of fibre-containing peel from the xylem core was measured. A similar investigation was carried out on desiccated <b>flax</b> <b>stems,</b> but samples were clamped vertically due to their finer diameters. Results show an initial increase in the work to peel associated with the dehydration of the stems, from 185 – 210 J m- 2 in dew-retted hemp and 210 – 540 J m- 2 in desiccated flax. In both cases this initial increase was followed by a 45 % reduction in the work to peel during the following 3 – 4 weeks, despite relatively constant stem moisture content.

40|$|Flax phloem fibers {{achieve their}} length by intrusive-diffusive growth, which {{requires}} them to penetrate the extracellular matrix of adjacent cells. Fiber elongation therefore involves extensive remodelling of cell walls and middle lamellae, including modifying the degree and pattern of methylesterification of galacturonic acid (GalA) residues of pectin. Pectin methylesterases (PME) are important enzymes for fiber elongation as they mediate the demethylesterification of GalA in muro, in either a block-wise fashion or in a random fashion. Our objective was to identify PMEs and PMEIs that mediate phloem fiber elongation in flax. For this purpose, we measured transcript abundance of candidate genes at nine different stages of stem and fiber development and found sets of genes enriched during fiber elongation and maturation as well as during xylem development.

40|$|Bast (phloem) fibers, {{tension wood}} fibers, and other cells with gelatinous-type {{secondary}} walls {{are rich in}} crystalline cellulose. In developing bast fibers of flax (Linum usitatissimum), a galactan-enriched matrix (Gn-layer) is gradually modified into a mature cellulosic gelatinous-layer (G-layer), which ultimately comprises most of the secondary cell wall. Previous studies have correlated this maturation process with expression of a putative β-galactosidase. Here, we demonstrate that β-galactosidase activity is in fact necessary for the dynamic remodeling of polysaccharides that occurs during normal secondary wall development in flax fibers. We found that developing stems of transgenic (LuBGAL-RNAi) flax with reduced β-galactosidase activity had lower concentrations of free Gal and had significant reductions in the thickness of mature cellulosic G-layers compared with controls. Conversely, Gn-layers, labeled intensively by the galactan-specific LM 5 antibody, were greatly expanded in LuBGAL-RNAi transgenic plants. Gross morphology and stem anatomy, including the thickness of bast fiber walls, were otherwise unaffected by silencing of β-galactosidase transcripts. These results demonstrate a specific requirement for β-galactosidase in hydrolysis of galactans during formation of cellulosic G-layers. Transgenic lines with reduced β-galactosidase activity also had biochemical and spectroscopic properties consistent with a reduction in cellulose crystallinity. We further demonstrated that the tensile strength of normal <b>flax</b> <b>stems</b> is dependent on β-galactosidase-mediated development of the phloem fiber G-layer. Thus, the mechanical strength that typifies <b>flax</b> <b>stems</b> is dependent on a thick, cellulosic G-layer, which itself depends on β-galactosidase activity within the precursor Gn-layer. These observations demonstrate a novel role for matrix polysaccharides in cellulose deposition; the relevance of these observations {{to the development of}} cell walls in other species is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{developing}} stem of {{fibre flax}} (Linum usitatissimum L.) contains a specific region called the `snap point', where the fiber-enriched bast tissues considerably change their mechanical properties. The snap point {{was found to}} be present during a restricted period of plant development¿¿the fast growth phase, and to disappear when stem growth was completed. To relate this snap point to bast fiber formation stages, the number of bast fiber cells and the thickness of their cell walls were followed on the stained cross-sections of the <b>flax</b> <b>stem</b> throughout plant development, using the progressing snap point as the reference. The snap point was shown to be the spot, above which the elongation of bast fiber cells is fully completed. This fast growth stage is the period when the maximum length of all bast fibers in the mature plant (a major characteristic of flax fiber quality) is fixed and would not be changed later. Autoradiography was used to visualize the mode of flax bast fiber elongation above the snap point. The even distribution of label was indicative for surface (diffusive) growth type. Elongation of individual fiber cells was estimated to take only 2 ¿ 4 days with a rate of 1 ¿ 2 cm per day, while cell wall thickening occurs mainly below snap point and lasts around 2 months.

In the present study, several architectural characteristics of <b>flax</b> <b>stems</b> are defined. Stem transverse sections from four varieties selected from the 1940 s to 2011 are compared. Anatomical changes over time are highlighted. The most important ones involve the gap between fiber bundles and the amount of fibers which can be improved with the selection (from 7. 8 % to 13. 4 % of the tissue area per section). This trend coincides with the increase in biomass production over time expected from the selection work. Moreover, this study demonstrates that flax fibers preserve their good mechanical performances in spite of the anatomical differences. Thus, through varietal selection, it is possible to increase the biomass yield while preserving the excellent specific mechanical properties of flax fibers.

Twenty-three bacterial and six fungal phyla were identified in soil samples and 11 bacterial and four fungal phyla in plant samples. Dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes (bacteria) and Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota (fungi) all of which have been previously associated with flax dew-retting except for Bacteroidetes and Basidiomycota that were identified for the first time. Rare phyla also identified {{for the first time in}} this process included Acidobacteria, CKC 4, Chlorobi, Fibrobacteres, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae and TM 6 (bacteria), and Chytridiomycota (fungi). No differences in microbial communities and colonization dynamics were observed between early and standard flax harvests. In contrast, the common agricultural practice of swath turning affects both bacterial and fungal community membership and structure in straw samples and may contribute to a more uniform retting. Prediction of community function using PICRUSt indicated the presence of a large collection of potential bacterial enzymes capable of hydrolyzing backbones and side-chains of cell wall polysaccharides. Assignment of functional guild (functional group) using FUNGuild software highlighted a change from parasitic to saprophytic trophic modes in fungi during retting.

Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry aromatic profiling (lignomics) identified 81 phenolic compounds, of which 65 were identified, to our knowledge, {{for the first time}} in flax and 11 {{for the first time in}} higher plants. Both aglycone forms and glycosides of monolignols, lignin oligomers, and (neo) lignans were identified in both inner and outer stem tissues, with a preponderance of glycosides in the hypolignified outer stem, indicating the existence of a complex monolignol metabolism. The presence of coniferin-containing secondary metabolites suggested that coniferyl alcohol, in addition to being used in lignin and (neo) lignan formation, was also utilized in a third, partially uncharacterized metabolic pathway. Hypolignification of bast fibers in outer stem tissues was correlated with the low transcript abundance of monolignol biosynthetic genes, laccase genes, and certain peroxidase genes, suggesting that flax hypolignification is transcriptionally regulated. Transcripts of the key lignan genes Pinoresinol-Lariciresinol Reductase and Phenylcoumaran Benzylic Ether Reductase were also highly abundant in <b>flax</b> inner <b>stem</b> tissues. Expression profiling allowed the identification of NAC (NAM, ATAF 1 / 2, CUC 2) and MYB transcription factors that are likely involved in regulating both monolignol production and polymerization as well as (neo) lignan production...|$|R
40|$|After some {{introductory}} {{words on}} flax, {{different forms of}} the parasite Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. were compared. Use of differences in production of organic acids as done by van Beyma Thoe Kingma were not a satisfactory distinction between formae lini of Botrytis. The M, Sc and Sp growth forms, few isolated interforms, B. bifurcata Miller and B. allii Munn. all produced significant amounts of citric acid; the amount depended on isolation, temperature, nutrient medium and amount of CaC 0 3 in the medium. Although the species was polyphagous, where it grew as a parasite was related to its growth form. Stages discussed of the disease in flax were the juvenile phase (caused by infected seed, spread through the soil to other plants), an intermediate phase (during accelerated growth of the <b>flax,</b> the <b>stem</b> base was attacked by spores of the juvenile phase), and the flowering phase (spores from elsewhere or from the interphase). Other topics were: environmental influences encouraging grey mould during the phases; ways of treating flax seed, research on seed infection (comparison of the Ulster and filter-paper method); differences in infectivity with environment; and finally chemical disinfection of seed and its toxicity to the plant...|$|R
40|$|Linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) {{grown for}} seed does not compete well with flax in fibre yield, {{but as a}} {{by-product}} of seed production its stems {{could be used in}} non-woven products. With the aim of discovering suitable linseed genotypes to be cultivated for dual-purpose use in Finland, Finnish linseed cv. Helmi was compared with ten other linseed genotypes and one <b>flax</b> cultivar for <b>stem</b> yield, bast fibre content in stem, stem length and diameter and bast fibre yield. In addition, breaking tenacity and elongation at break of the fibres were determined. The experiments were carried out in 1996 B 1997 at the Agricultural Research Centre (MTT) in Jokioinen, Finland (latitude 60 o 49 'N). Bast fibre content in stem averaged 16. 9 % and breeding line Bor 18 had significantly higher bast fibre content than cv. Helmi. Bast fibre yield averaged 301 kg dry matter ha- 1. Compared with cv. Helmi, breeding lines Bor 15 and Bor 18 and cvs. Flanders and Gold Merchant produced significantly higher fibre yield. The median for breaking tenacity varied among the genotypes between 41 and 67 cN/tex and the median for elongation at break between 3. 5 and 6. 8 %. Finnish breeding line Bor 18 is recommended for cultivation as dual-purpose linseed in Finland. ...|$|R
