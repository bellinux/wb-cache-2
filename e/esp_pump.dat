40|$|Master's thesis in Computer sciencePumps {{and their}} {{associated}} systems are essential {{in oil and}} gas facilities for the efficient transportation of fluids. Monitoring and controlling an <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> is vital and essential in management of ESP. Reliable and efficient alarm system with low-latency and real-time monitoring, helps operators to assess pump performance, avoid malfunction and result in increase in product and decrease in cost. One of the objectives of this thesis is to make an alarm system which {{will be used for}} monitoring an <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> implemented for Talisman Energy Company using OSIsoft PI ACE. The same target has been achieved by developing an application using different technology namely StreamInsight which is a complex event processing engine. The results and performance of these two technologies are discussed and compared. Also a fuzzy logic solution is proposed to add functionality to alarm system and improve the pump life time and performance...|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} formula, if evaluated over {{an appropriate}} range of liquid flow rates, represents the {{variation of the}} necessary head that the pump must develop to produce the possible liquid rates from the given well, see the curve in dashed line in Fig.  1. For an accurate installation design the <b>ESP</b> <b>pump’s</b> operating point must fall on this curve at its intersection with the desired liquid rate. Based on this, the required pump can be properly selected and no wellhead choke {{will be needed to}} control the flow rate. This scenario, of course, can only be followed if sufficiently accurate inflow performance data on the given well are available.|$|R

30|$|One common {{solution}} for over-designed ESP systems {{is the use}} of production chokes at the wellhead. Installation of the choke, due to the high pressure drop that develops through it, limits the well’s liquid rate so the <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> is forced to operate in its recommended pumping rate range. This solution eliminates the need for running a new ESP system of the proper capacity into the well and saves the costs of pulling and running operations. At the same time, however, the system’s power efficiency decreases considerably due to the high hydraulic losses occurring across the surface choke.|$|E
30|$|Most ESP {{installations}} {{are designed}} to operate using electricity at a fixed frequency, usually 60 or 50  Hz. This implies that the <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> runs at a constant speed and develops different heads for different pumping rates as predicted by its published performance curve. When designing for a constant production rate, a pump type with the desired rate inside of its recommended capacity range is selected. The number of the required pump stages is found from detailed calculations of the required total dynamic head (TDH), i.e. the head required to lift well fluids to the surface at the desired pumping rate. Thus, the head versus capacity performance curve of the selected pump can easily be plotted based {{on the performance of}} a single stage.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem with}} the {{conventional}} design detailed above is that the ESP installation is investigated for a single design rate only and no information is available for cases when well parameters are in doubt. All these problems are easily solved if system (NODAL) analysis principles are {{used to describe the}} operation of the production system consisting of the well, the tubing, the ESP unit, and the surface equipment. NODAL analysis permits the calculation of the necessary pump heads for different possible pumping rates and the determination of the liquid rate occurring in the total system, This will be the rate where the required head to produce well fluids to the separator is equal to the head developed by the <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> run in the well.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the realm}} of {{oilfield}} equipment maintenance, Prescriptive Analytics can optimize configuration, anticipate and prevent unplanned downtime, optimize field scheduling, and improve maintenance planning. According to General Electric, {{there are more than}} 130,000 electric submersible <b>pumps</b> (<b>ESP's)</b> installed globally, accounting for 60% of the world's oil production. [...] Prescriptive Analytics has been deployed to predict when and why an ESP will fail, and recommend the necessary actions to prevent the failure.|$|R
30|$|The {{solution}} of the problem, if pulling the ESP equipment {{and replacing it with}} a properly designed one is not desired, is to place a production choke of the proper diameter at the wellhead to restrict the liquid rate to the design target. At this rate, however, the installed pump develops the designed operating head as shown by Point  2. Since the actual head required for lifting the well fluids to the surface, as found from NODAL calculations, is less than this value, a sufficient head loss across the choke is needed. This head loss, found between Points  2 and 3 must be sufficient to supplement the system’s actual TDH to reach the TDH that was used for the original design. As a result, the head requirement of the production system is artificially increased and the <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> is forced to produce the desired liquid rate.|$|E
30|$|Over-, and under-design of {{artificial}} lift installations {{happens in the}} industry very often and professionals {{know how to deal}} with them. Some lifting methods such as gas lifting or sucker rod pumping are relatively easy to handle since their lifting capacity can be adjusted in quite broad ranges after installation. ESP installations, however, do not tolerate design inaccuracies because any given <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> can only be used in a specific, quite restricted range of pumping rates. If used outside its recommended liquid rate range, the hydraulic efficiency of the pump rapidly deteriorates; efficiencies can go down to almost zero. In addition to the loss of energy and the consequent decrease in profitability the ESP system, when operated under such conditions, soon develops mechanical problems that can lead to a complete system failure. The usual outcome is a workover job and the necessity of running a newly designed ESP system with the proper lifting capacity.|$|E
30|$|Electrical {{submersible}} pumping is {{the most}} inflexible of any artificial lift system because a specific <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> can only {{be used in a}} definite, quite restricted range of pumping rates. If it is used outside the specified range, pump and system efficiencies rapidly deteriorate and eventually mechanical problems leading to a complete system failure develop. When serious deviation from the design production rate is experienced, the possible solutions are (a) running a different pump with the proper recommended operating range, or (b) using a variable speed drive (VSD) unit. However, in case the ESP system produces a higher than desired liquid rate, a simple and frequently used solution is the installation of a wellhead choke. The wellhead choke restricts the pumping rate and forces the <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> to operate within its recommended liquid rate range. This solution, of course, is very detrimental to the economy of the production system because of the high hydraulic losses across the choke that cause a considerable waste of energy. The paper utilizes NODAL analysis to investigate the negative effects of surface production chokes on the energy efficiency of ESP systems as compared to the application of VSD drives. The power flow in the ESP system is described and the calculation of energy losses in system components is detailed. Based on these, a calculation model is proposed to evaluate the harmful effects of wellhead choking and to find the proper parameters of the necessary VSD unit. By presenting a detailed calculation on an example well using the proposed model the detrimental effects of wellhead choking are illustrated and the beneficial effects of using a VSD drive are presented. Using data of a group of wells placed on ESP production a detailed investigation is presented on the field-wide effects of choking. The energy flows and the total energy requirements are calculated for current and optimized cases where VSD units providing the required electrical frequencies are used. Final results clearly indicate that substantial electric power savings are possible if production control is executed by VSDs instead of the present practice of using surface chokes.|$|E
50|$|While the {{underground}} {{pressure in the}} oil reservoir is sufficient to force the oil to the surface, all that is necessary is to place a complex arrangement of valves (the Christmas tree) on the well head to connect the well to a pipeline network for storage and processing.

40|$|Abstract—Although {{electric}} submersible <b>pumps</b> (<b>ESPs)</b> {{have been}} produced for almost 100 years, the actual causes of certain electrical failures are still unknown. Why do failures occur on startup or two weeks after an electrical storm? Most of {{the answers to these}} questions can be found from an analysis of tra-ditional grounding techniques and consideration of how electrical insulation fails. ESPs are predominantly operated on ungrounded power, which can lead to arcing faults and residual charge. Fre-quently the wellhead is not even used as a ground. At other times cathodic protection installers insist on no other connections to the wellhead. Some ground wire connections can actually exacerbate the electrical damage done by lightning. Three-wire power systems are still quite prevalent in the oil field. Ferroresonance and lack of third-harmonic magnetizing current can produce very distorted waveforms. All these topic are investigated. A consensus seems to be building that one grounding configuration does provide superior reliability.

40|$|Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent artificial lifting method in industry due to its high liquid flow rate in both onshore and offshore applications. As oil exploration goes deep into water, ESP equipment is facing a crucial problem of slurry erosion which may affect life and cost significantly. The wear caused by slurry erosion may bring the issue such as unbalanced side loads, severe vibration and decreased pressure head. Eventually, this phenomenon {{will lead to a}} complete system failure. In present work, a systematic study on the erosion wear has been carried out in order to give better understanding. The WJE- 1000 <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> manufactured by Baker Hughes has been employed in this study.

40|$|Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) {{are widely}} {{being used in}} {{upstream}} oil production. To better understand the ESP pump?s behavior, two different ESPs, MVP-G 470 and ESP-WJE 1000, manufactured by Baker Hughes company have been studied experimentally and numerically to determine the pump and flow behavior in different operating conditions and for different working fluids. The MVP-G 470 is a multi-vane electrical submersible pump which {{has been designed to}} increase the gas handling capacity of typical multiphase ESPs up to 70 % gas volume fraction. Homogenized flow and finer bubbles produced by MVP pumps help the ESPs to delay the surging and gas lock condition to higher gas volume fractions and operate effectively. In this work, an experimental study on the performance of a 3 -stage MVP along with detail study on the performance of two stages of the pump are performed. Overall pump performance for different operating conditions such as different inlet pressure, inlet gas volume fraction, water flow rate and speeds are performed for a mixture of water and air. Detail study of a stage performance is done on the first and second stage of the pump using conductivity and pressure measurements accompanied by high speed visualization. The data obtained from these measurements is employed to relate stage head degradation to effective parameters on the pump performance.

40|$|There is a {{necessity}} to use artificial lift when the natural drive of oil is {{not strong enough to}} push the oil from the well bottom to the surface. Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) systems have been used far and wide by the petroleum industry to compensate the need of lift. The pump part of an ESP system needs to deal with the erosion due to both slurry working conditions and the presence of air. Presence of abrasive particles can erode hydraulic as well as secondary flow paths which can lead to damage of the pump resulting in affects ranging from performance degradation to pump failure. This study is focused on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) based evaluation of erosion in <b>ESP</b> <b>pump</b> section under different operating conditions. The pump was modelled at 3600 rpm at best efficiency point for different viscosities such as 1 cp, 5 cp, 20 cp and 60 cp. Two gram/liter of sand was introduced at the inlet of the pump. Eulerian approach was utilized to model the two phase flow simulation using ANSYS Fluent. An erosion model developed in the Turbomachinery lab for the pump was utilized to predict the erosion. The developed equation was compared with inbuilt ANSYS erosion prediction equations using the DPM approach. Erosion rates as a function of viscosity across different sections of the pump were obtained and compared with previously published data. From the previous erosion testing of ESPs, it is learned that erosion rates accelerated in the presence of gas. The CFD study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of gas presence on erosion rates. The two phase flow simulation was conducted to evaluate the effect of bubble size on flow separation and pump performance. A three phase flow simulation was performed for the first time using 850 gpm water, 15 % GVF (Gas Void Fraction) of air and 2 grams/liter of sand. The study concludes with a discussion about the effect of bubble size on phase separation erosion modeling in presence of gas and potential improvement required to calibrate the three phase flow simulation...|$|E

40|$|Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs) are a {{subgroup}} of pumps designed to have small diameters to accommodate tight working environments. The long length of an ESP (5 - 100 stages) requires {{a large amount}} of annular seals. Each seal provides a lateral reaction force for the rotor. Lateral loading caused by gravity and housing curvature changes the running position of the rotor in these seals. The running position of the rotor with respect to the housing is the Static Equilibrium Position (SEP). The SEP is important in determining the rotordynamic coefficients for the bearings/seals. An SEP analysis suitable for ESPs is shown. The analysis predicts the equilibrium position due to gravity and/or curvature loading in the well casing as well as for surface applications. The analysis can accept seals with eccentricity-dependent reaction forces. The code also interfaces with response codes to predict the rotordynamic characteristics of motion around the equilibrium position. The rotor or housing can be set to any prescribed position, and the remaining stations can be solved for. A static and rotordynamic analysis is presented for an ESP model. This model is of a Baker Hughes G 400 <b>ESP</b> <b>pump.</b> This study first finds the SEP and then shows a rotordynamic analysis about the SEP. Predictions are shown in a horizontal and a vertical orientation. In these two configurations viscosities and clearances are varied through 4 cases of: (1) Viscosity of 1 cP and interstage seal clearances of 127 ?m (2) Viscosity of 1 cP and interstage seal clearances of 381 ?m (3) Viscosity of 30 cP and interstage seal clearances of 127 ?m (4) Viscosity of 30 cP and interstage seal clearances of 381 ?m. The appropriate shorthand notations are: 1 X 1 cP, 3 X 1 cP, 1 X 30 cP, and 3 X 30 cP respectively. In a horizontal, straight-housing position, the model includes gravity and buoyancy on the shaft. At 1 X 1 cP, the horizontal statics show a moderate eccentricity ratio of 0. 53 for the shaft with respect to the housing. With 3 X 1 cP, the static eccentricity ratio is increased to 0. 76. With 1 X 30 cP, the predicted static eccentricity ratio is low at 0. 08. Increasing the clearance to 3 X 30 cP, the predicted eccentricity ratio increases to 0. 33. No horizontal case is expected to rub. With the housing is supported at five different housing positions instead of fixed straight, the static position had relatively no change. Predictions for a vertical case of the same model are also presented. The curvature of the housing is varied until rub or close-to-wall rub is expected. The curvature needed for a rub with a 1 cP- 1 X fluid is 7. 5 Degrees of Curvature (DOC). The DOC is a metric for curvature. It is defined as the amount of degrees which pass around a constant curve of 33. 3 m in length. The stability of the system with changing curvature is presented, and curvature is shown to have a minor impact. With 3 X 1 cP, there is a decrease in maximum eccentricity, but with more seals loaded than with 1 X 1 cP. With 1 X 30 cP, a smaller length of shaft that deviates from the housing centerline?s position. The maximum curvature for a static rub with 1 X 30 cP is greater than 25 DOC. Both 1 X 30 cP and 3 X 30 cP are unstable. No dynamic data predictions are shown for 30 cP since the model is unstable. The static position for 3 D housing shape with 1 cP fluid is lastly presented. A helix as the housing shape is used due to constant curvature. With respect to a curvature in only the Y direction, the helix static shape differed from the Y-Z plane curvature in attitude angle...|$|E

The principle of Gas lift is by lowering the hydrostatic pressure inside the production tubing through the injection of lighter fluid into the annulus. While the ESP gives an external pressure to the flow stream acting in series with the reservoir. GT oil field in the Niger Delta was used as case study, it has a production life span of eighteen 18 years. To increase GT production and extend the lifetime of the field, the operator decided to start an artificial lift project with an aim to optimize its production.
