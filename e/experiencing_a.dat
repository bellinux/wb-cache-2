50|$|In human sexuality, the {{refractory}} period {{is usually the}} recovery phase after orgasm during which it is physiologically impossible {{for a man to}} have additional orgasms due to increase in the penile sensory threshold (PST).

5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.

Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German Panzerkorps and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, and {{the remainder of the}} country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the Panzer 38(t), and their subsequent variants and production, to be incorporated into the German Army's strength.

Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of Mauritius suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole. Annual growth dropped to about 1.9 percent from approximately 5 percent in 2001. The sugarcane industry suffered greatly from the storm, <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> 19.3 percent decrease.|$|E
