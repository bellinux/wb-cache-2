500|$|Ron Harris was haunted {{for many}} years by his role in Masterton's death: [...] "It bothers you {{the rest of your}} life. It wasn't dirty and it wasn't meant to <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Still, it's very hard because I made the play. It's always {{in the back of my}} mind." [...] But Masterton's family held no {{animosity}} towards the players involved or the game. [...] Carol referred to the incident as a fluke, saying that it could have happened to anyone.|$|E
500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} {{walked into}} his role. He was doing play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in the}} part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to take that as a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E
2500|$|Of the scandal, in a 1981 interview, Bennett contrasted the {{judgmental}} 1950s {{with the}} sensation-crazed 1970s and 1980s. [...] "It would never <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> today," [...] she said, laughing. [...] "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{said that}} it did {{sometimes}} <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> though--that a man did sometimes lay on the right card, by accident.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton solemnly, [...] "I {{think it}} was, from the {{specimens}} {{he had brought}} along, but, and it's difficult sometimes to see why things should <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> he couldn't tell me where it was. Jimmy was dead, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now and then," [...] he said, [...] "things <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Perhaps, the Powers who direct {{our little}} comedy can smile on occasion. At least, we {{frequently}} afford them the opportunity. It {{is certain that}} there is no fool like the over-cunning man. But we will talk of something else. In the meantime, and while you stay here, you will consider this house of mine your home, and those in it your friends and servants." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the promotional}} {{lead up to}} J Roland Kelly, Stop Your Nursing Unless You're Rendering Fun he {{released}} a series of short films including Music Video, Billfold, and It Just <b>Happens</b> <b>that</b> <b>Way.</b> This experience led to him reworking a group of short films he made in adolescence to produce Dinosaur! which screened at film festivals {{in the spring of}} 2005.|$|R
60|$|Steele kept pretty closely under cover. He did not {{entertain}} the opinion, nor did I, {{that the first}} time he walked down the street he would be a target for Blome and his gang. Things seldom <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and when they did happen so it was more accident than design. Blome was setting the stage for his little drama.|$|R
60|$|Things <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> you know, in this world. There were a boy {{and girl}} once who loved each other very dearly. But they were both poor, so they agreed to wait till he had made enough money for them to live comfortably upon, {{and then they would}} marry and be happy. It took him a long while to make, because making money is very slow work, and he wanted, while he was about it, to make enough for them to be very happy upon indeed. He {{accomplished}} the task eventually, however, and came back home a wealthy man.|$|E
6000|$|... "As near as I {{could figure}} it out, Jimmy didn't {{have an idea}} that any one was near until {{he found himself in}} the very midst of the crowd, and then he swung around in order to stop quickly, when, of course, old Mr. Turtle flew out like a rock {{on the end of a}} string, without any idea of where he'd bring up. Cocky Robin and Mr. Jay were {{roosting}} quite near the ground, where they could keep an eye out for foolish worms which might <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and Mr. Turtle swept them off the branch like ninepins, knocking the two senseless.|$|E
6000|$|... "Want {{to see me}} on business? What business? I {{am doing}} no business. Can't you see that this ship is laid up?" [...] Massy had turned at bay before the {{pursuing}} irony of his disaster. Afterwards he could not believe his ears. What was that old fellow getting at? Things don't <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> It was a dream. He would presently wake up and find the man vanished like a shape of mist. The gravity, the dignity, the firm and courteous tone of that athletic old stranger impressed Massy. He was almost afraid. But it was no dream. Five hundred pounds are no dream. At once he became suspicious. What did it mean? Of course it was an offer to catch hold of for dear life. But what could there be behind? ...|$|E
500|$|No {{band that}} signed with Mr. Lady {{contained}} a male artist. Carland said [...] "It's not that we're necessarily {{never going to}} put out a band with men in it, but it's just kind of organically <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> We wanted to focus on putting out music by women. We do consider ourselves a feminist business and part of that involves prioritizing work made by women." ...|$|R

60|$|On the whole, {{such was}} Janet's {{notion of the}} Deity, though deep within her there may have existed a hope {{that he might be}} outwitted; that, by dint of energy and brains, the fair things of life might be {{obtained}} despite a malicious opposition. And she loved Ditmar. This must be love she felt, this impatience to see him again, this desire to be with him, this agitation possessing her so utterly that all day long she had dwelt in an unwonted state like a somnambulism: it must be love, though not resembling in the least the generally accepted, virginal ideal. She saw him as he was, crude, powerful, relentless in his desire; his very faults appealed. His passion had overcome his prudence, he had not intended to propose, but any shame she felt on this score was put to flight by a fierce exultation over {{the fact that she had}} brought him to her feet, that he wanted her enough to marry her. It was wonderful to be wanted like that! But she could not achieve the mental picture of herself as Ditmar's wife--especially when, later in the evening, she walked up Warren Street and stood gazing at his house from the opposite pavement. She simply could not imagine herself living in that house as its mistress. Notwithstanding the testimony of the movies, such a Cinderella-like transition was not within the realm of probable facts; things just didn't <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Once {{he stole}} the teacher's penknife, and, {{when he was}} afraid it would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped it into George Wilson's cap--poor Widow Wilson's son, the moral boy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed his mother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons, and {{infatuated}} with Sunday-school. And when the knife dropped from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if in conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon him, and {{was just in the}} very act of bringing the switch down upon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired, improbable justice of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike an attitude and say, [...] "Spare this noble boy--there stands the cowering culprit! I was passing the school door at recess, and, unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!" [...] And then Jim didn't get whaled, and the venerable justice didn't read the tearful school a homily, and take George by the hand and say such a boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him to come and make his home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and run errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife do household labors, and have all the balance of the time to play, and get forty cents a month, and be happy. No; it would have happened that way in the books, but didn't <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to Jim. No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make trouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim was glad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said he was [...] "down on them milksops." [...] Such was the coarse language of this bad, neglected boy.|$|E

50|$|It {{was adapted}} into the highly {{successful}} 1967 movie The Graduate, directed by Mike Nichols and with Dustin Hoffman {{in the title}} role.

50|$|A {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film had Cassidy, the Kid, and Etta in a Bolivian cinema and seeing a screen re-enactment of their gang, {{depicting}} Butch and Sundance as ruthless killers gunned down by the law. As the two men watch incredulously, shouting at the screen that it didn't <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Etta walks off to the station to catch the train that would begin her journey back to America. George Roy Hill thought that the scene was somewhat heavy-handed and unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|In 1933, A.J. Cotton stated [...] "Today the Arbitration Court (Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration) {{says that}} a jackeroo must be paid 25/- shillings per week.

60|$|Happy Jack didn't dare go home. Can {{you think}} of {{anything}} more dreadful than to be {{afraid to go to}} your own home? Why, home is the dearest place in the world, and it should be the safest.

It often <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> with the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. It was <b>that</b> <b>way</b> with Happy Jack Squirrel now.|$|R

We will not and cannot {{because it did not}} <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Agriculture is not the result of a happening, an idea, an invention, discovery or instruction by a god or goddess. It emerged as a result of long periods of intimate coevolution between plants and man... The coevolution took place over millennia and over vast regions measured in terms of thousands of kilometers.
