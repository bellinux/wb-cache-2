5|$|There {{are three}} {{theories}} {{as to how}} the three races of white-winged fairywren could have evolved. The first suggests that black-and-white plumage is an ancestral condition and, <b>following</b> <b>separation</b> of the three populations, blue-and-white plumage evolved in the mainland species. The second hypothesis suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved convergently on the two separate islands. The third suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue plumage.|$|E
5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent <b>following</b> <b>separation</b> of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E
25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum. In {{order for the}} A subunit to reach its target, a disulfide bond between the A1 and A2 domain must be broken. This breakage is catalyzed by a protein disulfide isomerase {{that is in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. <b>Following</b> <b>separation,</b> the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|Now {{mother and}} father and son are all separated. But the reader or {{listener}} knows that they will be reunited {{at the end of the}} tale, for this is a romance; in essence a comedy, not a tragedy. The baby boy is carried to the kingdom of Israel, where the griffin is spotted landing, stork-like, with the baby. News of this is brought to the king, the child is named Degarébel and he is raised as the king’s son. And his mother, in fact, suffers a curiously similar fate. Having set off again from the rock of seagulls, she is carried in the boat by wind and tide until she is washed ashore in Egypt where she is found by the king of that country. She tells him who she is and is informed by the King of Egypt that she is his niece. Quite quickly, as the tale proceeds, she becomes his daughter, in a plotting device that, although clearly inconsistent with the beginning of the tale, has similarities with a new identity, <b>following</b> <b>separation,</b> taken by Emare, and by Sir Degare, by the boy Florent in the romance Octavian and by the blacksmith Sir Isumbras. Fifteen years pass before she is made the high-ranking prize at a tournament for would-be suitors.|$|E

2500|$|Stating that [...] "children {{need two}} parents" [...] and that [...] "children have a {{fundamental}} human {{right to an}} opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility <b>following</b> <b>separation</b> and divorce. They call for laws creating a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it. They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide, and state that shared parenting is in fact {{in the best interests}} of the child. Warren Farrell states that for children, equally shared parenting with three conditions (the child has about equal time with mom and dad, the parents live close enough to each other that the child does not need to forfeit friends or activities when visiting the other parent, and there is no bad-mouthing) is the second best family arrangement to the intact two-parent family, followed by primary father custody and then primary mother custody, and he adds that if shared parenting cannot be agreed upon, children on average are better off psychologically, socially, academically, and physically, have higher levels of empathy and assertiveness, and lower levels of ADHD, if their father is their primary custodial parent rather than their mother.|$|E
