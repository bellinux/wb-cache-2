50|$|When {{hunting in}} {{shallower}} waters in New Zealand and Argentina, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> tend to forage during the day. The dolphins chase schools of fish or squid and herd them into stationary balls. They may control the school with light reflected from their white bellies. Dolphins herd prey against the surface, but also horizontally against the shore, {{a point of}} land, or the hull of a boat. During these times, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> are believed to increase prey availability for other predators, including other dolphins, seabirds, sharks, and pinnipeds. In Argentina, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> may use bird aggregations to locate and herd prey. Conversely, pinnipeds and sharks {{take advantage of the}} <b>dolphin</b> hunts. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> are themselves preyed on by killer whales and large sharks. Dolphins avoid killer whales by swimming into shallower water. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> are also susceptible to parasitism by certain nematode, cestode, and trematode species, mostly the genera Nasitrema and Anisakis, and Phyllobothrium delphini, Braunina cordiformis, and Pholeter gasterophilus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> prefer cool, {{upwelling}} waters, {{as well as}} cold currents. They largely live in {{inshore waters}} {{and can be found}} up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands. They can move over great distances (around 780 km), but have no well-defined seasonal migrations. However, dolphins off Argentina and New Zealand make inshore and offshore seasonal and diurnal movements. In Argentina, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> associate closely with southern right whales and South American sea lions. They have been found around bottlenose dolphins, but apparently do not interact with them, and may share feeding areas with Risso's dolphins. They also associate with various seabirds, such as kelp gulls, cormorants, terns, shearwaters, petrels, and albatrosses. In New Zealand, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> mingle with common <b>dolphins.</b> <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> have also been observed with southern right whale dolphins and pilot whales off southwestern Africa.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is {{a dolphin}} found in coastal {{waters in the}} Southern Hemisphere. Its {{specific}} epithet is Latin for [...] "dark" [...] or [...] "dim". It is very closely genetically related to the Pacific white-sided dolphin, but current scientific consensus holds they are distinct species. The dolphin's range is patchy, with major populations around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and various oceanic islands, with some sightings around southern Australia and Tasmania. The <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> prefers cool currents and inshore waters, but {{can also be found}} offshore. It feeds on a variety of fish and squid species and has flexible hunting tactics. The <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> is known for its remarkable acrobatics, having a number of aerial behaviours. The status of the dolphin is unknown, but it has been commonly caught in gill nets.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect of}} mussel farming on <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{has been studied}} in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> are {{commonly}} seen in this area, which is also where the greatest density of farming activity is proposed. Apparently, dolphins rarely enter existing farms, and when they do, they usually swim quickly up the lanes and between rows of lines and floats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> from Argentina and {{southwest}} Africa separated 2000 generations ago from an ancestral Atlantic population and subsequently diverged without much gene flow. Most populations have low genetic diversity, with the Peruvian population being an exception. Possible hybrids of <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{have been described}} with a long-beaked common dolphin and a southern right whale dolphin. There are four subspecies classified; (Lagenorhynchus obscurus obscurus), (L. o. fitroyi), (L. o. posidonia) and (L. o. superciliosis).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{live in a}} fission-fusion society, {{with most}} group size {{increases}} occurring during foraging and decreases in group sizes occurring during resting and traveling. In the Golfo San José off the Valdes Peninsula, dolphins commonly switch between small traveling groups and large sociosexual groups, and encounter a variety of associates. Studies of dolphins off Kaikoura, New Zealand, showed the dolphins normally live in large groups that split into smaller subgroups. These subgroups are composed of mating adults (mating groups), mothers with calves (nursery groups) and nonbreeding adults. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> have a promiscuous mating system in which {{both males and females}} mate with multiple partners. Mating groups are generally made of around 10 males and a single female. These mating groups can be found in both shallow and deep water but more often gather near shore.In the mating groups, the males pursue a female in high-speed chases. Females seem to prefer males with great speed and agility rather than size, strength, or aggression. Females may extend the chase as long as possible so only the best male remains. Females may try to evade males that are not vigorous or lack social skill. Males also may form alliances to catch females. Unlike male bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> male <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> cannot monopolise females. The time when female <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> first reproduce varies between regions. New Zealand dolphins first reproduce at about seven to years, with possibly six to seven years for Argentine dolphins. A study of <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> off the coast of Peru showed the reproductive cycle lasts around 28.6 months, with mother dolphins pregnant for 12.9 months, lactating for a further 12 months, and resting for 3.7 months before the cycle begins again. During copulation, females tend to be on the top. As with all species where females mate with multiple partners, male <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> have large testicles for sperm competition. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> sometimes engage in sexual behaviour for reasons other than reproduction, perhaps for greeting, communication, or strengthening social bonds. Homosexual behaviour between males has been observed. [...] Dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more relaxed.|$|R

25|$|Several {{species of}} {{dolphins}} and small whales also occur constantly around the peninsula; <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> and endangered endemic Hector's dolphins form strong {{connections with the}} area while bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins appears less frequently.

40|$|Research on {{the ecology}} of {{sympatric}} dolphins has increased worldwide in recent decades. However, many dolphin associations such as that between common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) are poorly understood. The pres-ent {{study was conducted in}} the San Matías Gulf (SMG) ecosystem (North Patagonia, Ar-gentina) where a high diet overlap among both species was found. The main objective of the present work was to explore the niche overlap of common and <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> in the habitat and temporal dimensions. The specific aims were (a) to evaluate the habitat use strategies of both species through a comparison of their group attributes (social composi-tion, size and activity), and (b) to evaluate their habitat preferences and habitat overlap through Environmental Niche modeling considering two oceanographic seasons. To ac-complish these aims, we used a historic database of opportunistic and systematic records collected from 1983 to 2011.

50|$|While <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{tourism is}} a larger {{industry}} in New Zealand {{than it is in}} Argentina, the effects of tourism on the dolphins seem to be lower in the former than the latter. New Zealand tours are operated under permits, and are limited in number and have conditions and guidelines related to approach procedures and swim operations. By contrast, no direct regulation of dolphin watching is done in Argentina. As such, dolphin activities are often disturbed by touring vessels.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} {{thought that the}} <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> was first described by John Edward Gray in 1828 from stuffed skin and a single skull shipped from the Cape of Good Hope to the British Museum.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides broad {{insights on}} aspects of sexual selection in cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and addresses the gap of knowledge regarding female mating strategies. A comparative approach {{is applied to}} investigate the coevolution of mating strategies between the sexes and between anatomy and behavior, using <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) as a model species. There are several key outcomes: (1) A heuristic framework is developed for the coevolution of mating strategies, in which males have low monopolization potentials of females, females evolved evasive behavioral maneuvers, males evolved large relative testes sizes, and females evolved convoluted vaginas. (2) Female mating behaviors are assessed {{in the context of}} exploitative scramble competition. Female <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> display evasive behavioral maneuvers during mating chases and discriminate among male behaviors. (3) A standardized measurement protocol is developed for female reproductive tracts and the microstructure of the unusual vaginal folds found in cetaceans is explored. The vaginal morphology of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) is conserved across sexual maturity and reproductive states and consists of one caudally-oriented vaginal fold. Vaginal fold tissue is comprised of smooth (autonomic origin), not skeletal muscle (somatic origin). (4) Issues of scaling are examined while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness across 19 species. Vaginal lengths and vaginal fold lengths are correlated with body length but not each other, setting the stage to test functional hypotheses. (5) Reproductive anatomy (post-copulatory mechanism) and mating behavioral effort (pre-copulatory mechanism) are explored across <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins,</b> bottlenose dolphins, and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). A pattern appears between vaginal complexity and testes size. However, female pre-copulatory traits (behavioral repertoire size and intensity) do not match the trends predicted based on post-copulatory traits. Female <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> display the highest behavioral effort. Behavioral variation across species may reflect different environmental conditions and indicate that females, like males, may use several pre- and post-copulatory mechanisms to control paternity. (6) Overall, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> adhere to the proposed heuristic framework. This dissertation demonstrates that female genitalia can provide important insights into cetacean mating strategies, and emphasizes the value of integrative approaches that examine coevolutionary interactions between the sexes and between anatomy and behavior...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> prey on {{a variety}} of fish and squid species. Common fish species eaten include anchovies, lantern fish, pilchards, sculpins, hakes, horse mackerel, hoki and red cod. They are {{generally}} coordinated hunters. Their very flexible foraging strategies can change depending on the environment. In certain parts of New Zealand, where deep oceanic waters meet the shore, <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> forage in deep scattering layers at night. They arrive at the hunting site individually, but form groups when in the layer. [...] The dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey. Groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when the layer is near the surface and decrease when it descends.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of morbillivirus-specific serum antibodies was examined by an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and virus neutralization tests in serum samples from 30 <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), 8 long-snouted common dolphins (Delphinus capensis), 2 inshore and 6 offshore bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and 20 Burmeister's porpoises (Phocoena spinipinnis) taken in fisheries off central Peru in 1993 – 1995. The sera from six <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins,</b> one common dolphin and three offshore bottlenose dolphins were positive on {{a coat of}} dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) antigen in the iELISA. Several of these sera were also positive when tested against peste des petits ruminants and rinderpest virus antigen.

These results strongly suggest that viruses closely related, or identical, to the cetacean morbillivirus present in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea infect several species of Delphinidae of the Southeastern Pacific. No convincing morbillivirus-specific antibody positive reactions were detected in the sera from either the Burmeister's porpoises or the inshore bottlenose dolphins...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> has a {{discontinuous}} semi- range.

Off South America, they range from southern Peru to Cape Horn {{in the west and}} from southern Patagonia to around 36°S in the east. [...] Its range also includes the Falkland Islands. They are particularly common from Peninsula Valdes to Mar de Plata. In comparison, they are uncommon in the Beagle Channel and the inshore waters of the Tierra del Fuego region.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> and the Pacific {{white-sided dolphin}} are {{considered}} phylogenetically related species. Some researchers have suggested {{they are the}} same species, but morphological and life-history evidence shows otherwise. The two sister species diverged at around 1.9-3.0 million years ago. Recent analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the genus Lagenorhynchus, as traditionally conceived, is not a natural (monophyletic) group. Another study finds that the dusky and the Pacific white-sided dolphin form the sister group to the (expanded) genus Cephalorhynchus. If this placement is accurate, a new genus name will need to be coined to accommodate these two species.|$|E

40|$|This paper briefly {{examines}} the cetacean catch composition by species in Peruvian fisheries between 1984 and 1993.

During the same period the proportion of long-beaked common dolphins increased from 6. 7 % to 31. 8 %. Possible reasons for this are discussed. One possibility is that this reflects a true decrease in the abundance of <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> in response to exploitation. It is argued that the precautionary principle requires that effective conservation measures are implemented as a matter of urgency. In addition, studies should be carried out to determine the true reason for the change in proportions...|$|R
40|$|In 1990, 74 <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) and 10 Burmeister's {{porpoises}} (Phocoena spinipinnis) {{were examined}} {{for the presence}} of hyperpigmented marks and pinhole lesions on the skin (tattoo lesions) at the fishing terminal of Pucusana, central Peru. Prevalences of tattoo lesions were 8. 1 % and 30 % in the dolphins and porpoises, respectively. Intracytoplasmic poxviruses were demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy in ultrathin sections of three of eight samples of infected epidermis from both species. The reason for the negative results in others is unclear but may be related to stages of infection with low virus density or even incorrect classification of some lesions as genuine viral tattoos. An irregular arrangement of tubules on the outer viral membrane, similar to those in orthopoxviruses, was visible in negative contrast preparations for P. spinipinnis. This is the first record of poxvirus in porpoises (Phocoenidae) and also the first report for <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins,</b> and generally for cetaceans of the southern hemisphere...|$|R

The size for dusky dolphins in New Zealand have been recorded to be a length range of 167-178 cm and a weight range of 69-78 kg for females and a length range of 165-175 cm and a weigh range of 70-85 kg for males.|$|E
50|$|Dolphins is an IMAX {{documentary}} {{produced in}} 2000. The film {{was nominated for}} an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject.

The main focus is on research into dolphin communication and intelligence, along with some exploration of feeding habits and human interaction.

50|$|However, Gray {{later wrote}} {{that a similar}} dolphin was {{described}} as Delphinus supercilious by French surgeons and naturalists René Primevère Lesson and Prosper Garnot from a specimen collected {{off the coast of}} Tasmania two years before his own classification. Gray classified D. supercilious as a junior synonym of his D. obscurus and credited Lesson and Garnot (1826) for their original description. Meanwhile, Charles Darwin also described {{what turned out to be}} this species as Delphinus fitzroyi from a specimen harpooned off Argentina in 1838. The <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphin</b> was reclassified as Prodelphinus obscurus in 1885 by British naturalist William Henry Flower, before gaining its current binomial name, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, from American biologist Frederick W. True in 1889.|$|E
50|$|In general, three {{different}} types of sounds are produced by dolphins (and other toothed whales). These are click trains, which are made of numerous individual clicks, usually broadband signals that change from low value to high value quickly, burst pulses, which are individual clicks with high repetition and can be heard by humans only as a buzzing sound, and whistles, which are signals that are pure-tones and whose frequency varies depending on the time. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> produce all three sounds, but most commonly make burst pulses. Whistling is more common when <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> mingle with other dolphin species such as common dolphins. Their echolocation signals are broadband and of short duration, much like those other whistle-producing toothed whales. They tend to have bimodal frequency spectra which peak between 40 and 50 kHz at low frequency and between 80 and 110 kHz at high frequency. The species' echolocation signals are about 9-12 dB lower than for the larger white-beaked dolphin.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{perform a}} number of aerial displays, {{including}} leaps, backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, spins, and noseouts. They also perform head-over-tail leaps which have been called the most [...] "acrobatic" [...] of the displays. A headfirst re-entry is performed when a dolphin leaps entirely {{out of the water}} and positions its back in a curve while it flips the tail to land back in the water head-first. [...] "Humping" [...] is similar, except the snout and tail remain in the water when the dolphin is the arch. Leaps, head-over-tail leaps, backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, and spins are often done over and over again. Young <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> apparently are not born with the ability to perform the leaps and must learn to master each one. Calves appear to learn the leaps in this order: noisy leaps, head first re-entries, coordinated leaps, and acrobatic leaps. Adults may perform different leaps in different contexts, and calves may independently learn how to perform leaps, but learn when to perform these when interacting others.|$|R
40|$|Foraging theory {{suggests}} that hungry animals balance {{a complex set of}} costs and benefits when determining what and how to eat. Prey distribution, patch size, and the presence of conspecifics are important factors influencing a predator's feeding tactics, including the decision to feed individually or socially. <b>Dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) in New Zealand employ different feeding tactics in varying habitats and seasons. I used programmed survey routes and opportunistic sightings to examine the habitat use and feeding mechanics of <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand, a protected shallow-water environment frequented by wintering dolphins. I encountered 253 dolphin groups, of which 58. 5 % were engaged in food-acquisition activities. Photographic efforts revealed a total of 177 individually-recognizable dolphins, 100 of which were returnees from previous seasons. Thirty-seven feeding groups and 70 bouts of feeding behavior were followed. Two-minute interval sampling as well as active acoustic sonar were used to test the hypothesis that diurnally-feeding dolphins would work in a coordinated manner to bring schooling fish to the surface. Feeding tactics observed in Admiralty Bay were then compared to foraging by some of the same animals in the unprotected, deep-water environment off Kaikoura, where large numbers of <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins</b> feed during the night on organisms associated with a vertically-migrating scattering layer. Evidence supporting coordinated surface feeding was not statistically significant, but indicative of behavioral flexibility in feeding styles {{as part of a larger}} feeding repertoire. A potential shift in prey distribution from previous years may also explain some observed patterns. Feeding groups were positively correlated with seabirds and New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). Mean group size of 6. 1 (? 8. 23 S. D., n= 253) in Admiralty Bay is dramatically less than groups observed off Kaikoura, a variation likely reflecting differences in prey number and distribution, as well as differences in predation risk by deep-water sharks and killer whales. Behavioral flexibility likely confers an adaptive advantage for species subject to environmental fluctuation, whether due to natural or anthropogenic sources. Further research is necessary to evaluate prey distribution in Admiralty Bay and its possible effects on feeding <b>dusky</b> <b>dolphins...</b>|$|R
