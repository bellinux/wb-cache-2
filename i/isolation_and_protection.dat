The roofs were built of straw and other similar organic materials, providing thermal <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection</b> from the rain. Because thatch was lighter, less timber was required in the roof structure to support it. Thatch is also versatile material {{when it comes to}} covering irregular roof structures and is naturally waterproof. The walls were constructed in wattle and daub technique. The walls were probably made of a woven lattice of wooden strips, also inside of the buildings, and later covered with a composite building material, a mixture of clay, sand, animal dung and straw. One of the houses discovered in Brezno in the Czech Republic was 24 m long and approximately 6.5 m wide.One of the most characteristic features associated with settlements are storage pits of Únětice type. They were located beneath the houses, deep and spacious, with a cylindrical or slightly conical neck, arched walls and relatively flat bottom. Pits often served as a granary.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{mechanical}} response under large elastic strains of pentamode layers confined between stiffening plates, {{and the potential}} use of such systems as novel seismic <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> impact <b>protection</b> devices. We analyze pentamode materials that exhibit three soft deformation modes in the infinitesimal stretching regime that follow {{by the presence of}} perfectly hinged connections between the rods. The response of these metamaterials under large elastic strains is characterized by an elastic-stiffening effect in terms of the lateral force-displacement response, which increases in the presence of rigid connections and decreases by increasing the number of layers. Our results lead us to conclude that the analyzed pentamode metamaterials can be effectively employed as novel, performance-based devices for seismic <b>and</b> mechanical vibration <b>protection,</b> by designing the lattice geometry, the stiffness properties of the joints, and the lamination scheme in a suitable manner and {{as a function of the}} operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multiple Level Security (MLS) {{has always}} been a center of focus since the usage of {{computers}} in military and intelligence systems. Extensive studies have been done on how to utilize virtualization technologies to provide multiple level secured execution in the cloud, yet the general assumption is that all components in the cloud service provider are trusted.

The ability of an encapsulant to protect against surface corrosion is related to its adhesional strength. The adhesion of candidate encapsulants under accelerated environmental stress was examined to determine what materials have the best hydrolytic stability {{and are more likely}} to reduce corrosion rates. Under environmental exposure, the ingress of water has been correlated with increased corrosion rates. The diffusivity of different encapsulants has been measured to determine how long it takes for water to enter a module. The high diffusivity of ethylene vinyl acetate indicates that, even with the use of an impermeable back-sheet, moisture from the sides will diffuse throughout the entire module. To significantly reduce moisture ingress requires a true hermetic seal, the use of an encapsulant loaded with desiccant, or the use of a very low diffusivity encapsulant...|$|E
30|$|Microscopically, skin is a {{multilayered}} organ {{composed of}} many histological layers. It is generally subdivided into three layers; the epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The uppermost nonviable {{layer of the}} epidermis, the stratum corneum, has been demonstrated to constitute the principal barrier to percutaneous penetration (Walker and Smith 1996). The excellent barrier properties of the stratum corneum can be ascribed to its unique structure and composition. The viable epidermis that lies beneath {{is responsible for the}} generation of the stratum corneum. Dermis lies exactly adjacent to the epidermis and is composed of a matrix of connective tissue, which endows the skin with its elasticity and resistance to deformation. The blood vessels that are present in the dermis nourish the skin with nutrients and oxygen (Michael et al. 2013).

40|$|Reciprocity is a {{fundamental}} principle governing various physical systems, which ensures that the transfer function between any two points in space is identical, regardless of geometrical or material asymmetries. Breaking this transmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> source <b>protection.</b> So far, devices that break reciprocity have been mostly considered in dynamic systems, for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical wave propagation associated with spatio-temporal variations. Here we show {{that it is possible}} to strongly break reciprocity in static systems, realizing mechanical metamaterials that, by combining large nonlinearities with suitable geometrical asymmetries, and possibly topological features, exhibit vastly different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well as one-way displacement amplification.

40|$|Programmers use {{databases}} {{when they}} want {{a high level of}} reliability. Specifically, they want the sophisticated ACID (atomicity, consistency, <b>isolation,</b> <b>and</b> durabil-ity) <b>protection</b> modern databases provide. However, the ACID properties are far from trivial to provide, partic-ularly when high performance must be achieved. This leads to complex and error-prone code—even at a low defect rate of one bug per thousand lines, the millions of lines of code in a commercial OLTP database can harbor thousands of bugs. Here we propose a method to expose and diagnose violations of the ACID properties. We focus on an os-tensibly easy case: power faults. Our framework in-cludes workloads to exercise the ACID guarantees, a record/replay subsystem to allow the controlled injec-tion of simulated power faults, a ranking algorithm to prioritize where to fault based on our experience, and a multi-layer tracer to diagnose root causes. Using our framework, we study 8 widely-used databases, ranging from open-source key-value stores to high-end commer-cial OLTP servers. Surprisingly, all 8 databases exhibit erroneous behavior. For the open-source databases, we are able to diagnose the root causes using our tracer, and for the proprietary commercial databases we can repro-ducibly induce data loss. ...|$|R

The impact of the fire on the structure is assessed with respect to the ability of the structure to continue to carry imposed loads and the ability of the building elements to act as barriers to fire and smoke. The impact of the fire on the occupants is examined with respect to the mobility of the occupants and the relative locations of the fire and the occupants. Control of the fire hazard with respect to the contents is based largely on economics.

RA {{can be used}} to establish a static or dynamic root of trust in embedded and cyber-physical systems. It can also be used as a building block for other security services and primitives, such as software updates and patches, verifiable deletion and memory resetting. There are three major classes of RA designs: hardware-based, software-based, and hybrid, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks. This paper presents the first hybrid RA design, called HYDRA, that builds upon formally verified software components that ensure memory <b>isolation</b> <b>and</b> <b>protection,</b> as well as enforce access control to memory and other resources. HYDRA obtains these properties by using the formally verified seL 4 microkernel. (Until now, this was only attainable with purely hardware-based designs.) Using seL 4 requires fewer hardware modifications to the underlying microprocessor. Building upon a formally verified software component increases confidence in security of the overall design of HYDRA and its implementation. We instantiate HYDRA on two commodity hardware platforms and assess the performance and overhead of performing RA on such platforms via experimentation; we show that HYDRA can attest 10 MB of memory in less than 500 msec when using a Speck-based message authentication code (MAC) to compute a cryptographic checksum over the memory to be attested...|$|E

Cloud paradigm leverages the instruments of the virtualization technique, such as the VM Live Migration, which can be exploited in order to achieve multiple objectives. For instance, it could be used for hardware maintenance purposes or to avoid over-load and under-load in the resources utilization. Another typical use of the VM migration is the consolidation of the workload into a smaller number of physical hosts: {{this is one of the}} techniques aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of the IT infrastructure, which represents the motivation behind the birth of the Green Computing.

Another consideration is that the glass transition of EVA, as measured using dynamic mechanical analysis, begins at temperatures of about - 15 C. Temperatures lower than this can be reached for {{extended periods of time}} in some climates. Due to increased moduli below the glass transition temperature, a module may be more vulnerable to damage if a mechanical load is applied by snow or wind at low temperatures.
