5|$|During 1976, {{construction}} of a new shopping center directly across the street from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the <b>Galleria</b> Edina, an upscale shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring shopping centers. In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain of stores, which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.|$|E
5|$|London's fledgling {{city centre}} mall was first opened in 1960 as Wellington Square with 400,000 sq. ft. of leasable area with Eaton’s and Woolworths as anchors. From 1986-89, Campeau {{expanded}} Wellington Square into <b>Galleria</b> London with 1,000,000 sq. ft. of leasable area and 200 stores including The Bay and Eaton’s. However the early 1990s recession, following by {{the bankruptcy of}} Eaton's in 1999 and then the departure of The Bay in 2000 resulted in only 20 stores left by 2001. <b>Galleria</b> London then begun seeking non-retail tenants, becoming the home for London's central library branch, and satellite campuses for both Fanshawe College and Western University. The complex was purchased and renamed to Citi Plaza by Citigroup in 2009. Citi Plaza has been redeveloped as a mixed use complex that blends retail, office, businesses, and education providers. Alongside Citi Cards Canada's offices, in November 2016, CBC announced plans to move its expanded operations into the building.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Sibley's parent, May Co., merged {{operations}} with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Kaufmann's. That same year, local chain AM's (Adam, Meldrum & Anderson Company) {{moved from the}} nearby Thruway Mall into the space originally planned for B. Altman. The owner of the Thruway Mall sued the AM's chain, claiming breach of contract; the chain would later be declared liable for damages to the Thruway Mall, which was subsequently torn down and rebuilt as a strip mall in the early 1990s. Finally, Hoyts sold the Walden <b>Galleria</b> theater complex to General Cinemas {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of {{similarities between the}} innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the <b>Galleria</b> mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E

5|$|NY324 crosses {{its last}} major route, Transit Road (NY78), on an {{overpass}} {{just north of}} the once-thriving Eastern Hills Mall, which had been the premier mall in the Buffalo area until it began losing tenants and customers to the larger Walden <b>Galleria</b> in Cheektowaga. Beyond Transit, the road is still four-lane but primarily residential as it enters the Town of Clarence. After Harris Hill Road, the highway bends to the southeast once again for a final mile into its eastern end at Main Street (NY5). This last section was widened from two lanes to four in the mid-1990s, and has seen some development but still remains lightly trafficked most of the day.|$|E
5|$|The cast was rounded {{out with}} Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley, who portray John's foster parents, Janelle and Todd Voight. S.

Michael Biehn returned to the series as Kyle Reese, a soldier from 2029, in a short appearance in Sarah's dream. Biehn's scene was not featured in the theatrical release of the film, but it was restored in extended versions of the film. Hamilton's then-twenty-month-old son Dalton plays her on-screen son in a dream sequence set in a playground.

5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden <b>Galleria</b> and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} sub-lethal doses of {{cypermethrin}} onto the larval host Achoria grisella Fabr. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were evaluated on egg-adult development time, number of offspring produced, sex ratio, longevity, {{and size of}} the larval endopara-sitoid Apanteles <b>galleriae</b> Wilkinson (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Overall time to adult eclosion increased by more than 50 % when Ap. <b>galleriae</b> was reared on cypermethrin-treated host larvae and the development time of the wasp increased in a dose-dependent manner. Adult longevity and the number of surviving offspring produced decreased with increasing insecticide dose. The number of surviving offspring decreased more than 50 % at the lowest dose of the insecticide. Neither sex ratio nor adult body sizes were altered by cypermethrin exposure when compared to untreated wasps. This work suggests that sublethal doses of the insecticide could limit the development, survival, and growth of parasitoid wasps due to possible metabolic, hormonal, and nutri-tional deficiencies. The potential adverse effects that cypermethrin has on the natural enemy of the pest can impact on the success of IPM programs.

40|$|A novel cryIC-type gene was {{isolated}} from {{a strain of}} Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. <b>galleriae.</b> A new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique {{with a set of}} several oligonucleotide primer pairs specific to the cryIC gene was used to screen a number of B. thuringiensis strains. PCR amplified several DNA fragments ranging from 100 bp to 1 kb for B. thuringiensis strains containing a cryIC gene. PCR fragments amplified from the Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. <b>galleriae</b> HD 29 DNA differed from the fragments amplified from other cryIC-containing strains, indicating strain HD 29 contained a novel cryIC-type gene. To isolate crystal genes homologous to cryIC, an HD 29 gene library was probed with a 984 -bp fragment of the amino-terminal coding region of the cryIC gene cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. aizawai HD 229. A putative toxin gene {{was isolated}} from a phage that hybridized strongly to the cryIC probe. Translation of the putative toxin DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1, 176 amino acids whose predicted molecular mass was 132. 8 kDa. Comparisons of the toxin gene sequence with sequences of other cry genes indicated that this gene is a subclass of cryIC. We propose to designate this gene cryIC(b).

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis harbors genes {{encoding}} Cry proteins {{found in}} chromosomes or plasmids {{of different sizes}} (4 - 150 Mb). Although the smaller plasmids are more abundant in B. thuringiensis, their specific function is unknown. As for the megaplasmids, their main recognized function is to harbor cry genes, although the sequencing {{of some of these}} plasmids indicates the occurrence of other important genes. This work used a new protocol for practical and rapid extraction of plasmid DNA in order to characterize the plasmid patterns of Brazilian strains belonging to Embrapa Milho e Sorgo research center B. thuringiensis bank. We tried to further assess the relationship of plasmid patterns with strains belonging to the same serovars and strains causing 100 % and no mortality to Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) larvae. It was possible to characterize 59 strains based on the migration of bands in agarose gel.
