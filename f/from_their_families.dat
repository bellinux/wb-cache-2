5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing them <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> depriving {{them of their}} ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities.|$|E
5|$|During the occupation, {{approximately}} 4,000 {{children were}} forcibly removed <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> by Indonesian soldiers {{as well as}} by state and religious organizations. Although some were well-treated, others were subjected to various forms of abuse, including sexual abuse. Some were converted to Islam. A number of soldiers who kidnapped these children still hold senior positions within the Indonesian military.|$|E

5|$|Women {{acted as}} an {{important}} part of the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> as farm servants and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all the major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading.|$|E
5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.|$|E

5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women. Women formed {{an important part of}} the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> as farm servants, and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, such as Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh Wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she amassed a moveable estate of Â£22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. Lower down the social scale, the rolls of poor relief indicate that large numbers of widows with children endured a marginal existence.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{training}} his men, al-Qassam {{stressed that}} maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should {{provide for the}} needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties {{with their families and}} pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa's labor slums who lived away <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} storm struck, CARE {{operated}} airlifts of food to flooded areas. The World Food Programme approved $2 million to help airlifting 53,000 metric tons of food. A fleet of 29 helicopters had rescued 14,204 people by March 7 as well as operating airlifting missions. This included 12 planes and helicopters from South Africa, six helicopters with crews along with 100 motorboats from the United Kingdom, ten helicopters from Germany, and two from Malawi. Many residents in flooded areas initially had to hold onto trees and roofs {{due to lack of}} helicopters, with 100,000 people needing rescue as of March 1. After the floodwaters receded, the need for rescue diminished, allowing families to return home, although helicopters were still required to airlift relief goods. Emergency road repairs allowed supplies to be delivered by road in some areas by March 5. The United States sent a crew of 700 soldiers in what became Task Force Atlas Response, a $37 million operation to coordinate disaster relief, rebuild roads, deliver crop seed, and drop off aid. This was ordered by U.S. President Bill Clinton on March 2 after criticism that the international assistance was insufficient. The Save the Children organization helped reunited separated children <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> while World Relief flew seeds and tools to help 26,260 farmers regrow their damaged crops. The United Kingdom assisted by canceling the country's $150 million debt earlier than scheduled, and urged other nations to follow suit; Italy canceled its $500 million debt in March. On February 24, the World Bank provided $2.5 million to rebuild roads, and later provided an additional $15 million. The same agency delayed debt payments for one year. Portugal and Spain canceled $150 million and $20 million worth of debt, respectively. Through the Jubilee 2000, most wealthy nations postponed debt payments for one year on March 16.|$|E

25|$|A {{minority}} of historians dispute that {{substantial numbers of}} mixed-blood Aboriginal children were forcibly taken <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> They contend that some children were removed mainly {{to protect them from}} neglect and abuse. Official government estimates are that between one in ten and one in three indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> and communities between 1910 and 1970, affecting all regions of the country.|$|E

30|$|Generally, {{students}} {{who came from}} business-owned family {{are more likely to}} be self-employed compared to {{students who}} came from non-business-owned families. But students who have business-owned colleagues are not significantly different from students who do not have business-owned colleagues. TableÂ  8 tells us that students who came from business-owned families were 25.4 % (OR[*]=[*] 1.254) more likely to be self-employed compared to students who came from non-business-owned families. The reason might be that they may have prior business experience from families. The experience gained <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> member may influence the studentsâ engagement in entrepreneurship. This is in agreement with the findings in other studies (Fitzsimmons and Douglass, 2005; Dohse and Walter, 2012; Sanditov and Verspagen, 2011; Robson, 2015). Similarly, the odd of self-employment intention of students who have prior business experience <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> was 45.1 % more likely to be self-employed than students who have no any prior business experience <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> controlling other variables.|$|R
