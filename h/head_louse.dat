40|$|<b>Head</b> <b>lice</b> {{infestation}} is {{most common}} among children 3 to 12 years of age; {{with an estimated}} 6 to 12 million infestations in the United States each year. <b>Head</b> <b>lice</b> are not a health hazard or a sign of poor hygiene and {{are not responsible for}} the spread of any disease.

These guidelines provide a general outline of shared responsibilities as recommended by the Sheboygan County Division of Public Health. SHEBOYGAN COUNTY DIVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES: 1. Provide consultation and science-based, factual information as requested to individuals and community groups (i. e. schools, day cares, worksites, etc.) regarding <b>head</b> <b>lice,</b> <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> treatment, and control. 2.

40|$|<b>Head</b> <b>lice</b> {{are very}} common among {{children}} 3 to 12 years of age.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare {{in a particular area}} (e.g. school), and socioeconomic status were found to be significant factors in <b>head</b> <b>louse</b> infestation.

25|$|One pair of antennae, {{each with}} five segments, {{protrudes}} from the insect's head. Head lice also have {{one pair of}} eyes. Eyes are present in all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the <b>head</b> <b>louse</b> is a member), but are reduced or absent in most {{other members of the}} Anoplura suborder. Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding.|$|E
25|$|The nondisease-carrying <b>head</b> <b>louse</b> {{differs from}} the related disease-carrying body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) in preferring to attach eggs to scalp hair rather than to clothing. The two {{subspecies}} are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed, although they will do so in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies, they {{are thought to have}} diverged as subspecies about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing. A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or crab louse (Pthirus pubis), also infests humans. It is visually different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. Lice infestation of any part of the body is known as pediculosis.|$|E
40|$|Background: Due {{to a lack}} of evidence, {{controversy}} exists {{about the}} role of bedding in the transmission of <b>head</b> <b>lice.</b> Aims: To determine the proportion of the <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> population found on pillowcases of people with <b>head</b> <b>lice,</b> and to test strategies available to householders to kill <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> on pillowcases. Methods: To assess the incidence of <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> on pillowcases, people with active pediculosis had their <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> collected and counted and the pillowcase they had used the night before examined for <b>head</b> <b>lice.</b> To test strategies to kill <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> on pillowcases, live <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> were experimentally placed in miniature pillowcases, and the cases were subjected to a hot wash, a cold wash, hot dryer, and hanging out to dry on an outdoor clothes line. Results: Forty-eight people and their pillowcases were recruited from Townsville, Qld, Australia (dry tropics). One thousand, eight hundred and forty-five lice were collected from their heads to give an average and median intensity of infection of 38. 4 and 21 lice, respectively. Two of the 48 pillowcases contained live lice, one nymph on each, 2 h and 9 h after the pillowcases had been removed from the bed. Another pillowcase contained a dehydrated nymph.

40|$|Background <b>Head</b> <b>lice</b> {{infestation}} (pediculosis) is {{a serious}} health problem that can cause {{a high level of}} anxiety and psychological frustration, especially in developing countries.

This study aimed to determine the <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> infestations and the factors affecting the rate of infestationin primary school girls.   Materials and Methods In this cross-sectional study, a total of 358 school girls from two urban and three rural primary school girls in Sirik County, Southern Iran, were randomly selected. For the diagnosis of <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> infestation, students were examined carefully by visual inspection of the scalp and hair for the presence of lice. Self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic and associated factors of <b>head</b> <b>lice</b> infestation. SPSS version 21. 0 was used to analyze the data.

500|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genome of {{the human}} species of body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), the <b>head</b> <b>louse</b> (Pediculus humanus capitis) and the pubic louse (Phthirus pubis) fragmented into a number of minichromosomes, at least seven million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in African than in non-African lice. [...] Human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in pre-history. The dominating theory of anthropologists regarding human migration is the Out of Africa Hypothesis. Genetic diversity accumulates over time, and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate. Because there is more genetic diversity in African lice, the lice and their human hosts must have existed in Africa before anywhere else.|$|E
