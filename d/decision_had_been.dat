5|$|Perseus {{was ordered}} on 14 March 1942 {{under the name}} Edgar. She was laid down at Vickers-Armstrong in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 1 January 1943 and was {{launched}} on 26 March 1944. The ship was renamed Perseus in July 1944, after the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to convert her to an aircraft maintenance ship, and she was completed on 19 October 1945.|$|E
5|$|Lützow {{graduated}} with his Abitur (university-preparatory high school diploma) on 31 March 1931 from the Schulpforta, {{a boarding school}} for academically gifted students. Unlike his brothers, who both pursued a naval career, Lützow joined the Reichswehr (Army of the Weimar Republic) following his graduation from school. This <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> influenced by his mother's youngest brother, Eberhard Kinzel, at the time {{an officer in the}} Reichswehr and later General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) in the Heer (German Army).|$|E
5|$|Pioneer {{was ordered}} on 7 August 1942 {{under the name}} Ethalion, but was renamed Mars later in 1942. She was laid down at Vickers-Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness on 2 December and was {{launched}} on 20 May 1944 The ship was renamed Pioneer in July 1944 after the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to convert her to an aircraft maintenance ship. and was completed on 8 February 1945.|$|E
40|$|Now {{the world}} of {{emergency}} management is partly in the political world.

5|$|Prince Paul {{was found}} guilty of war crimes in September 1945 {{for his role in the}} Yugoslav {{accession}} to the Tripartite Pact. In 2011, a High Court in Serbia found the sentence to be politically and ideologically motivated and Prince Paul was officially rehabilitated. A similar <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made in 2009 to rehabilitate Cvetković for war crimes charges relating to the signing of the pact.|$|E
5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained {{at this juncture}} following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery {{took the opportunity to}} completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E

5|$|The Amtrak {{ticket office}} was closed in April 2001 {{as part of}} {{austerity}} measures. Vandalism also forced the closure of elevators. The same year, SEPTA proposed closing the station because it served few inbound commuters. However, advocacy from the Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers, which showed that the station was more heavily used by commuters from the Chestnut Hill West Line changing to SEPTA Trenton Line trains and Amtrak Clockers to Trenton and New York, succeeded in persuading SEPTA to keep the station open for the time being. By 2005, no official <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to permanently keep the station, but SEPTA planned repairs to the deteriorated platforms.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty affair {{reinforced}} {{a previously}} made British decision to suppress unrest in Boston with {{a show of}} military might. The <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> prompted by Samuel Adams's 1768 Circular Letter, which was sent to other British American colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to the Townshend Acts. Lord Hillsborough, {{secretary of state for}} the colonies, sent four regiments of the British Army to Boston to support embattled royal officials, and instructed Governor Bernard to order the Massachusetts legislature to revoke the Circular Letter. Hancock and the Massachusetts House voted against rescinding the letter, and instead drew up a petition demanding Governor Bernard's recall. When Bernard returned to England in 1769, Bostonians celebrated.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{a charismatic}} and {{dominant}} leader often precipitates the decline of such groups, but the Spirit Fruit Society persevered. This made the society unique among other groups of this time. Though the commune continued after his death, their two publications, Spirit Voice and Spirit Fruit, ceased to be produced. Virginia Moore was chosen president of the society upon Beilhart's death, and the community stayed together and carried on its activities as before. In 1911, the society put an advertisement in the local papers seeking to sell their lakefront property and 'temple'. Virginia Moore stated that the Illinois climate was not suitable for their activities and the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to move to California. In the winter of 1914–1915, the society moved west.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E
5|$|Edward sent assurances to the Pope {{that the}} {{conflict}} surrounding Gaveston's role was at an end. On {{the basis of these}} promises, and procedural concerns about the how the original <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken, the Pope agreed to annul the Archbishop's threat to excommunicate Gaveston, thus opening the possibility of Gaveston's return. Gaveston arrived back in England in June, where he was met by Edward. At the parliament the next month, Edward made a range of concessions to placate those opposed to Gaveston, including agreeing to limit the powers of the royal steward and the marshal of the royal household, to regulate the Crown's unpopular powers of purveyance and to abandon recently enacted customs legislation; in return, the parliament agreed to fresh taxes for the war in Scotland. Temporarily, at least, Edward and the barons appeared to have come to a successful compromise.|$|E

5|$|Overlapping the {{military}} chain of command, {{there was a}} plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office, Felix Benzler, reporting to the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and for economic affairs, a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Franz Neuhausen. These power structures competed with each other, {{to a greater extent}} than anywhere else in occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of his priorities was to improve coordination of policies towards the Volksdeutsche (or Germans of Yugoslavia), concentrated in the Banat region, as the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen-SS division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Patton did not {{command a}} force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was {{selected}} to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made before the slapping incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the French cemeteries was complicated by even more heated arguments over how {{the bodies of the}} war dead should be dealt with. During the conflict the French war dead had ended up being split between special war cemeteries, local civilian cemeteries and some had been returned to their original villages. Catholic traditionalists in the government called for the bodies to be buried together in special cemeteries along the Western front, while others campaigned for them to be returned to local cemeteries. In 1919, the decision was taken to use special war cemeteries and to ban the repatriation of bodies, but by 1920 this <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> reversed and 300,000 French bodies were repatriated to their original homes. The French war cemeteries were typically much larger than their IWGC equivalents and used concrete Catholic crosses for all the graves, {{with the exception of the}} Islamic and Chinese war dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of handling the}} divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{had arrived}} off the Cape on 26 July with no {{knowledge}} of Elphinstone's dispositions. He had more pressing concerns: it had been several months since his ships had sighted land and his supplies of drinking water were running dangerously low. A significant proportion of his crews were suffering from disease and {{he had decided to}} send these men to an encampment ashore to allow for better treatment. Lucas even ordered that the sails on his ships be removed for repairs, rendering his ships temporarily immobile. On 9 August, Lucas was warned by a servant of a Dutch inhabitant of the Cape that a superior English force was present. He was informed that the Dutch population would not assist an attack on the British and strongly advised to sail away. Lucas however, on hearing this sailed deeper into the bay. Sir James Craig sent cavalry to Saldanha Bay to harry Batavian shore parties and organised the withdrawal of the local population and livestock to prevent their capture, following with a larger force under his own command. Lucas held a council with his senior officers, debating whether an attack on Cape Town was practical or whether they should abandon the operation. By 16 August the <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to sail for Île de France, but Lucas delayed, unwilling to leave his sick men ashore.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, the {{commander}} of the 9th Division, Major General Leslie Morshead, was informed by General Harold Alexander, {{the commander}}-in-chief of the Middle East Command, that a <b>decision</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> made to return the division to Australia. Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East. On 3 December Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's 25th Infantry Division would be transferred to Australia during December. Following these messages the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment, and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.|$|E
