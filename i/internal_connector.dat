25|$|The {{first version}} of {{conventional}} PCI found in consumer desktop computers was a 32-bit bus using a 33MHz bus clock and 5V signalling, although the PCI 1.0 standard provided for a 64-bit variant as well. These have one locating notch in the card. Version 2.0 of the PCI standard introduced 3.3V slots, physically distinguished by a flipped physical connector to preventing accidental insertion of 5V cards. Universal cards, which can operate on either voltage, have two notches. Version 2.1 of the PCI standard introduced optional 66MHz operation. A server-oriented variant of conventional PCI, called PCI-X (PCI Extended) operated at frequencies up to 133MHz for PCI-X 1.0 and up to 533MHz for PCI-X 2.0. An <b>internal</b> <b>connector</b> for laptop cards, called Mini PCI, was introduced in version 2.2 of the PCI specification. The PCI bus was also adopted for an external laptop connector standard the CardBus. The first PCI specification was developed by Intel, but subsequent development of the standard became {{the responsibility of the}} PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare in vitro the {{mechanical}} resistance of 7 different implant-abutment connections and determine which of them has the best mechanical performances (both statically and when subjected to dynamic loads) and which of them can guarantee the best level of tenacity during the clinical use of the intraoral electro-welded implantology with the bi-phase implants. All the implants were machined by Falappa Medical Devices – Rome. Two types of tests have been performed: static tests and fatigue tests. The static tests were performed on four specimens for each typology of connection, the fatigue tests on three specimens for each typology of connection. Configuration followed ISO 14801 standard [...] The static tests were performed until rupture while the fatigue tests were performed applying a 108 - 1080 N load until either break was detected or 5 Mcycles were reached. Results showed that good static behavior does not involve automatically that the connection has also good long-term performances. Statistically significant differences were noted among the configurations: in particular <b>internal</b> <b>connectors</b> showed better results in comparison to external ones and among <b>internal</b> <b>connectors</b> the hexagonal one turned out to the best one even if almost all the connectors had sufficient resistance to withstand normal masticaticatory load...|$|R

50|$|Two {{compounds}} {{used for}} such purposes are Epsom salts and EDTA. Epsom salts reduces the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may allow {{a small amount of}} extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the sulfate deposits of heavily discharged plates. However, the dissolved material is then no longer available to participate in the normal charge/discharge cycle, so a battery temporarily revived with EDTA will have a reduced life expectancy. Residual EDTA in the lead-acid cell forms organic acids which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and <b>internal</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Petri nets-based approach for architectural modeling of mobile agent systems.

40|$|The {{process of}} agent {{migration}} {{is the major}} difference between logical code mobility of software agents and physical mobility of mobile nodes in ad hoc networks. Without considering agent transfer, it would make little sense to mention the modeling of strong code mobility, which aims to make a migrated agent restarted exactly from the state when it was stopped before migration. From the perspective of system' s architecture, this paper proposes a two-layer approach for the formal modeling of logical agent mobility (LAM) using predicate/ transition (PrT) nets. We view a mobile agent system {{as a set of}} agent spaces, and agents could migrate from one space to another. Each agent space is explicitly abstracted to be a component, consisting of an environmental part and an <b>internal</b> <b>connector</b> dynamically binding agents with their environment. We use a system net, agent nets and a connector net to model the environment, agents and the connector respectively. In particular, agent nets are packed up as parts of tokens in system nets, so that agent transfer and location change are naturally captured by transition firing (token game) in Petri nets. Agent nets themselves are active only at specific places and disabled at all the other places in a system net. The semantics of such a two-layer LAM model is defined by transforming it into a PrT net. This facilitates the analysis of several properties about location, state, and connection. In addition, this paper also presents a case study of modeling and analyzing an information retrieval system with mobile agents...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} the BIP component framework to hierarchical components by considering also port sets of atomic components to be structured (ports may be in conflict or ordered, where a larger port re{{presents an}} interaction set with larger interactions). A composed component consisting of a set of components connected through BIP connectors and a set of ports representing a subset of the <b>internal</b> <b>connectors</b> and ports, has two semantics: one in terms if interactions as defined by the BIP semantics, and one in terms of the actions represented by external ports where the structure of the port set of the component is derived from the internal structure of the component. A second extension consists in the addition of implicit interactions which is done through an explicit distinction of conflicting and concurrent ports: interactions involving only non conflicting ports can be executed concurrently without the existence of an explicit connector. Finally, we define contract-based reasoning for component hierarchies...|$|R
