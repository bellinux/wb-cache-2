40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose an offline feature mapping {{algorithm}} capable of identifying and correctly closing multiple loops in cyclic environments (see video). The proposed algorithm iteratively alternates between a Kalman smoother based localization step and a map features recalculation step. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>loops</b> is done during the localization step by a hybrid localization algorithm that generates and tracks hypotheses generated each time the robot visits an already mapped area. The main contribution of this paper lies {{on the ability of}} the proposed algorithm to exploit information contained within the hypotheses histories in order to calculate correct maps, regardless of the complexity of the environment and the number of loops in the robot’s path.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for solid model reconstruction from 2 D sectional views based on volume-based approach. None {{of the existing}} work in automatic reconstruction from 2 D orthographic views have addressed sectional views in detail. It is believed that the volume-based approach is better suited to handle different types of sectional views. The volume-based approach constructs the 3 D solid by a boolean combination of elementary solids. The elementary solids are formed by sweep operation on loops identified in the input views. The only adjustment {{to be made for}} the presence of sectional views is in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>loops</b> that would form the elemental solids. In the algorithm, the conventions of engineering drawing for sectional views, are used to identify the loops correctly. The algorithm is simple and intuitive in nature. Results have been obtained for full sections, offset sections and half sections. Future work will address other types of sectional views such as removed and revolved sections and broken-out sections.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{for the first}} time stereoscopic triangulation of coronal loops in active regions over the entire range of spacecraft separation angles (α_sep≈ 6 ^∘, 43 ^∘, 89 ^∘, 127 ^∘, and 170 ^∘). The accuracy of stereoscopic correlation depends mostly on the viewing angle with respect to the solar surface for each spacecraft, which affects the stereoscopic correspondence <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>loops</b> in image pairs. From a simple theoretical model we predict an optimum range of α_sep≈ 22 ^∘- 125 ^∘, which is also experimentally confirmed. The best accuracy is generally obtained when an active region passes the central meridian (viewed from Earth), which yields a symmetric view for both STEREO spacecraft and causes minimum horizontal foreshortening. For the extended angular range of α_sep≈ 6 ^∘- 127 ^∘ we find a mean 3 D misalignment angle of μ_PF≈ 21 ^∘- 39 ^∘ of stereoscopically triangulated loops with magnetic potential field models, and μ_FFF≈ 15 ^∘- 21 ^∘ for a force-free field model, which is partly caused by stereoscopic uncertainties μ_SE≈ 9 ^∘. We predict optimum conditions for solar stereoscopy during the time intervals of 2012 [...] 2014, 2016 [...] 2017, and 2021 [...] 2023. Comment: Solar Physics, (in press), 22 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

In this paper, an effective nonparametric identification method, Non-causal Impulse Response Component Method (NIRCM) is developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological neural networks, which uses only time-series experimental data.

40|$|Introduction: Primary {{health care}} is the nucleus of country's health care {{delivery}} system. Bottlenecks in delivery of services at PHC level leads to decreased efficiency of health system and indirectly affects health {{of the citizens of}} a country. Keeping these issues in mind a study was carried out with the objectives i) To identify constraints/bottlenecks in implementation of elements of primary health care ii) To find out solutions to address these bottlenecks. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Cuttack district during Dec 2010 and January 2011 using a semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. Data regarding various difficulties faced while delivering health care services at PHC was collected from participants attending district level IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness) training after getting verbal consent. All 72 respondents who had attended the training during the above mentioned period were included in this study (Medical officer, AYUSH medical officer, Maternal Child Health co-coordinators and Block Programme Officers). Data were analyzed manually using content analysis. Results: Difficulty in vaccine delivery, inadequate infrastructure and lack of sufficient manpower for smooth functioning of JSY, difficulty in card updation and difficulty in retrieval of defaulter of alcoholic TB patients for Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse (DOTS) are some of the problems identified in general. Conclusion: The study identified the need for strengthening infrastructure and manpower to provide quality care for institutional delivery.

We found that, in embryonic chick retina neurons, microtubules were abundant in the ends of neurites and showed an unusual pattern of organization.

Occasionally these looping microtubules re-entered the neurite and returned {{in the direction of the}} cell body.

One family member, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), selectively introduces uracil into antibody variable and switch regions, promoting antibody diversity through somatic hypermutation or class switching. Other family members, including APOBEC 3 F and APOBEC 3 G, {{play an important role}} in retroviral defense by acting on viral reverse transcripts.

In the recent past, proteins from non-immunoglobulins have attracted attention as they mimic antibodies with respect to binding potential and provide further potential advantages. In this regard, we have attempted to explore a three-finger neurotoxin protein (3 F). 3 F proteins are small (~ 7 kDa), structurally well defined, thermally stable and resistant to proteolysis that presents them as promising candidates for directed evolution. Results We have engineered a snake α-neurotoxin that belongs to the 3 F family by randomizing the residues in the loops involved in binding with acetylcholine receptors and employing cDNA display to obtain modulators of interleukin- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R). Selected candidates were highly specific for IL- 6 R with dissociation constants and IC 50 s in the nanomolar range. Antagonists as well as agonists were identified in an IL- 6 dependent cell proliferation assay. Size minimization yielded peptides of about one-third the molecular mass of the original proteins, without significant loss of activities and, additionally, lead to the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loops</b> responsible for function.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} is to study the physics of the solar corona through {{the analysis of the}} EUV and UV data produced by two flights (12 May 1992 and 25 April 1994) of the Lockheed Solar Plasma Diagnostics Experiment (SPDE) sounding rocket payload, in combination with Yohkoh and ground-based data. Each rocket flight produced both spectral and imaging data. These joint datasets are useful for understanding the physical state of various features in the solar atmosphere at different heights ranging from the photosphere to the corona at the time of the, rocket flights, which took place during the declining phase of a solar cycle, 2 - 4 years before the minimum. The investigation is narrowly focused on comparing the physics of small- and medium-scale strong-field structures with that of large-scale, weak fields. As we close th is investigation, we have to recall that our present position in the understanding of basic solar physics problems (such as coronal heating) is much different from that in 1995 (when we proposed this investigation), due largely to the great success of SOHO and TRACE. In other words, several topics and techniques we proposed can now be better realized with data from these missions. For this reason, at some point of our work, we started concentrating on the 1992 data, which are more unique and have more supporting data. As a result, we discontinued the investigation on small-scale structures, i. e., bright points, since high-resolution TRACE images have addressed more important physics than SPDE EUV images could do. In the final year, we still spent long time calibrating the 1992 data. The work was complicated because of the old-fashioned film, which had problems not encountered with more modern CCD detectors. After our considerable effort on calibration, we were able to focus on several scientific topics, relying heavily on the SPDE UV images.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{recently}} discovered duality between color and kinematics in gauge theories. This duality {{leads to a}} remarkably simple double-copy relation between diagrammatic numerators of gravity scattering amplitudes and gauge-theory ones. We summarize nontrivial evidence that the duality and double-copy property holds to all loop orders. We also comment on other developments, including a proof that the gauge-theory duality leads to the gravity double-copy property, and the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> gauge-theory Lagrangians whose double copies yield gravity Lagrangians.

40|$|Introduction: The {{use of the}} Mini PCNL {{has been}} gaining {{momentum}} since its first description in 2001. The range of indications for this particular procedure may also be expanding. We describe {{a case of a}} large renal calculus in a renal collecting system, found in a patient who underwent an Anatrophic Nephro-Lithotomy [ANL] procedure a few years back. He subsequently developed a flank (incisional) hernia after the ANL. Some, twenty years later he presented with another large (22  mm) stone in the same system. Observation: Attempt at stone clearance was performed using the Mini PCNL. To avoid iatrogenic injury to the surrounding bowel loops in the hernia sac, a combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic technique was performed, with limited respiration and suspended abdominal fat at the time of renal access. The dilation was performed to accommodate the Mini PCNL sheath, thus minimizing the possibility of iatrogenic bowel injury. A serial balloon dilator was not used, in the presence of such severe fibrosis from the previous open surgery (ANL). Conclusion: The presence of a hernial sac within the ipsilateral flank may be amenable to Mini PCNL, provided the basic principles of puncture are maintained. This includes the use of adequate positioning, limited respiration and the use <b>of</b> ultra-sound <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the bowel <b>loops</b> during access puncture and tract dilatation. A new indication for the use of Mini PCNL is thus reported...|$|R
