The <b>issuing</b> <b>institution</b> is usually one without official sanction from the central government. This occurs usually when sufficient state-produced money is not available from the central bank. Most notably, notgeld generally refers to money produced in Germany and Austria during World War I and the Interbellum. Issuing institutions could be a town's savings banks, municipality and private or state-owned firms.|$|E

In practice, extension of study terms to three years slightly disadvantages vocational schools' male students who intend to continue: they reach conscription age before graduation or immediately after it, and normally must serve in the army before applying to undergraduate-level institutions.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, bank drafts do {{not carry}} any {{different}} legal weight {{as opposed to}} a standard check, but are provided as a service to clients as a payment instrument with guaranteed funds. Drafts (or money orders depending on the <b>issuing</b> <b>institution)</b> usually have better security features than standard checks, and as such are often preferred when the receiver is concerned about receiving fraudulent payment instruments. However, bank drafts can also be subject to counterfeiting, and as such can be held or verified by depositing institutions in accordance with their hold funds policy, prior to providing access to the funds.|$|E

30|$|Additional {{concerns}} {{raised with}} {{increasing use of}} analytics include data interpretation, data ownership, data preservation, sharing data with parties outside of the institution environment, and proper training of staff members regarding the data (Sclater & Bailey, 2015). Moreover, {{the question of who}} owns aggregated data, because having an infrastructure with the capacity to house large amounts of information becomes a daunting task (West, 2012). Because of these different <b>issues,</b> <b>institutions</b> must achieve a balanced approach to safeguarding data while also assuring benefits to the educational process because the acceptance of analytics in higher education will depend on how <b>institutions</b> address these <b>issues.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unanticipated {{factors and}} the general {{mobility}} of our society create numerous circumstances under which students must move from one institution to another without prior planning. Reasons for such movements can range from mismatches between students and institutions, employment, military movement, to geographic relocations by the families. The fundamental challenge with college transfer, whether planned or unplanned, is to aggregate coursework conducted at different institutions with different academic policies, different curricula, and different levels of expected rigor into an academic credential that the <b>issuing</b> <b>institution</b> can stand behind. College transfer is complex, because disparate and sometimes non-comparable coursework is brought together, often without prior involvement of the institutions from which the student enrolls and expects to graduate.|$|E

The FDIC announced a new program on October 14, under which newly issued senior unsecured debt issued on or before June 30, 2009, would be fully protected in the event the <b>issuing</b> <b>institution</b> subsequently fails, or its holding company files for bankruptcy.

In addition, while large institutions still enjoy lower issuance costs linked to the TBTF framework, we find evidence of enhanced market disciple for systemically important banks which face, since the onset of the financial crisis, an increased premium on bond placements...|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{paper is}} a money-market {{security}} issued (sold) by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations (for example, payroll), and is backed only by an issuing bank or company promise {{to pay the}} face amount on the maturity date specified on the note. Since it is not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings from a recognized credit rating agency {{will be able to}} sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price. Commercial paper is usually sold at a discount from face value, and generally carries lower interest repayment rates than bonds due to the shorter maturities of commercial paper. Typically, the longer the maturity on a note, the higher the interest rate the <b>issuing</b> <b>institution</b> pays. Interest rates fluctuate with market conditions, but are typically lower than banks' rates.|$|E
