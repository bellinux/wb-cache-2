5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction.

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the <b>frequency</b> <b>dependence</b> {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The <b>frequency</b> <b>dependence</b> of {{electrical}} response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{frequency}} interval of 10 ⁻¹ to 10 ⁶ Hz investigated were the <b>frequency</b> <b>dependences</b> of the capacitance C and resistance R for modified С 60 films in darkness and on {{exposure to the}} focused white light. A clamping ITO electrode with an intermediate layer of isotropic liquid (glycerin or distilled water) was taken instead of the traditionally used deposited top metal electrode. Found are the conditions when C and R changes are caused by near-electrode (f 10 ⁴ Hz) processes. It was shown that the sharp reduction of C and R with growing {{the frequency}} corresponds to the transition from one condition to the other, and such process can be described with account of the “classical” Maxwell-Wagner mechanism of interlayer polarization.

25|$|In organisms, sexual {{selection}} extends past differential reproduction to affect sperm composition, sperm competition, and ejaculate size. Males of C. lectularius allocate 12% of their sperm and 19% of their seminal fluid per mating. Due to these findings, Reinhard et. al proposed that multiple mating {{is limited by}} seminal fluid and not sperm. After measuring ejaculate volume, mating rate and estimating sperm density, Reinhardt et al. showed that mating could be limited by seminal fluid.

25|$|This {{extraordinary}} strong <b>frequency</b> <b>dependence</b> can {{be explained}} by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing AC frequency. Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.|$|E
40|$|We derive and {{evaluate}} one-loop functional flow equations for the effective interactions, self-energy and gap function in spin-singlet superfluids. The flow {{is generated by}} a fermionic frequency cutoff, which is supplemented by an external pairing field to treat divergencies associated with the Goldstone boson. To parametrize the singular momentum and <b>frequency</b> <b>dependences</b> of the effective interactions, the Nambu interaction vertex is decomposed in charge, magnetic, and normal and anomalous pairing channels. The one-loop flow solves reduced (mean-field) models for superfluidity exactly, and captures also important fluctuation effects. The Ward identity from charge conservation is generally violated, but can be enforced by projecting the flow. Applying the general formalism to the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model, we obtain detailed results on the momentum and <b>frequency</b> <b>dependences</b> of the effective interactions for weak and moderate bare interactions. The gap is reduced by fluctuations, with a stronger reduction at weaker interactions, as expected. Comment: 51 pages, 20 figure...|$|R

A field-theoretical description of the dynamic effects of acoustic-wave propagation in solids during phase transitions is performed with allowance for both fluctuation and relaxation attenuation mechanisms. The temperature and <b>frequency</b> <b>dependences</b> of the scaling functions of the attenuation coefficient and the ultrasound velocity dispersion are calculated in a two-loop approximation for pure and structurally disordered systems, and their asymptotic behavior in hydrodynamic and critical regions is separated. As compared to a pure system, the presence of structural defects in it is shown to cause a stronger increase in the sound attenuation coefficient and the sound velocity dispersion even in the hydrodynamic region as the critical temperature is reached.

500|$|The modern {{concept of}} the photon was {{developed}} gradually by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical wave model of light. The benefit of the photon model was that it accounted for the <b>frequency</b> <b>dependence</b> of light's energy, and explained the ability of matter and electromagnetic radiation to be in thermal equilibrium. The photon model accounted for anomalous observations, including the properties of black-body radiation, that others (notably Max Planck) had tried to explain using semiclassical models. In that model, light was described by Maxwell's equations, but material objects emitted and absorbed light in quantized amounts (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts). Although these semiclassical models contributed {{to the development of}} quantum mechanics, many further experiments beginning with the phenomenon of Compton scattering of single photons by electrons, validated Einstein's hypothesis that light itself is quantized. [...] In 1926 the optical physicist Frithiof Wolfers and the chemist Gilbert N. Lewis coined the name photon for these particles. [...] After Arthur H. Compton won the Nobel Prize in 1927 for his scattering studies, [...] most scientists accepted that light quanta have an independent existence, and the term photon was accepted.|$|E
