40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a complete}} {{model of the}} world copper economy. Supply equations for primary copper are estimated for four principal producing countries {{and the rest of}} the world; demand equations are estimated for the United States, Europe, Japan, and the Rest-of-World. Scrap supply equations are estimated for the U. S. and non-U. S. sectors as are price adjustment equations. The model is closed with a net input equation for the United States and various identities. The two separate copper markets (U. S. and non-U. S.) are converted by inputs, the generally free London Metal Exchange and scrap markets, and the price-setting behavior of U. S. producers. The copper market is found to be characterized by low short-run but very high long-run price elasticities, making for considerable sensitivity to exogenous forces. The model, fitted to 1948 - 1969 data, is used for forecasting and simulation experiments. Generally, short-run forecasts are good and longer-run forecasts are not very satisfactory. Perhaps the most interesting finding of the simulation is the prediction that Chilean output would be very sluggish even in the absence of nationalization and that Chilean revenues would be substantially increased were the Chilean government to increase <b>domestic</b> <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> and to allow world prices to adjust accordingly. ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> {{schedule}} {{defines the}} sequence of extraction of selected mine units {{over the life of}} the mine, and consequentially establishes the ore supply and total material movement. This sequence should be optimized so as to maximize the overall discounted value of the project. Conventional schedule approaches are unable to incorporate grade uncertainty into the scheduling problem formulation and may lead to serious deviations from forecasted <b>production</b> targets. Stochastic <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> schedulers are considered to obtain more robust <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> schedule solutions. The application of stochastic approaches to the <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> schedule problem is recent and additional testing is required to better understand these tools and to define the value of a stochastic solution as compared to the conventional result. Two stochastic schedulers are tested in a low-grade variability copper deposit, optimization parameters are discussed and their results compared with a conventional schedule. The first method uses a stochastic combinatorial optimization approach based on simulated annealing to address the <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> schedule problem. The method aims for maximization of the net present value (NPV) of the project and minimization of deviations from the production targets. These objectives are attained by incorporating grade uncertainty into the <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> schedule problem formulation. The second method formulates the problem as a stochastic integer programming problem, in which the objective is the maximization of the projects' NPV and the minimization of production targets deviations. The model can also manage how the risk of deviating from the targets is distributed between production periods. Both stochastic approaches were tested in a low-grade variability copper deposit. In both case studies, the value of a stochastic solution is demonstrated to be higher than the conventional one. This fact demonstrated the misleading results that a conventional schedule may produce and shows the importance of not ignoring the presence of uncertainty when defining the <b>mine</b> <b>production</b> schedule for a project...|$|R
