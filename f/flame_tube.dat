5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} overhauled in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by metal fatigue that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 high-pressure compressor blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure compressor, of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was overhauled, but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of excessive vibration of the high-pressure compressor, but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the port wing of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E
50|$|A Rubens' tube, {{also known}} as a {{standing}} wave <b>flame</b> <b>tube,</b> or simply <b>flame</b> <b>tube,</b> is an antique physics apparatus for demonstrating acoustic standing waves in a tube. Invented by German physicist Heinrich Rubens in 1905, it graphically shows the relationship between sound waves and sound pressure, as a primitive oscilloscope. Today, it is used only occasionally, typically as a demonstration in physics education.|$|E
50|$|A cannular {{combustor}} {{was used}} with seven flame tubes. This {{was a recent}} development in jet engines and the Orpheus also included the innovation of incorporating the turbine entry duct and its stator vanes into the <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> outlet, each <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> providing one seventh of the overall duct. This had two advantages, it simplified the manufacture of a complicated and unreliable component, also the segmented design allowed easier allowance for thermal expansion.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} into the ranges of Damk¨ohler number and Lewis number, less than unity, in which different forms of combustion phenomena arise within a non-premixed counterflow; cases that are symmetrical across the counterflow are chosen for study. These link oscillatory and steady propagation of flame edges, zero propagation speeds, isolated <b>flame</b> <b>tubes,</b> quenching and marginal stability of planar diffusion flames. Over a range of Lewis numbers, the transition between steady and oscillatory propagation of a flame edge has characteristics {{that are consistent with}} a subcritical Hopf bifurcation.

50|$|The mine {{consisted}} of a large fuel cylinder 53 cm high and 30 cm with a capacity of 29.5 L containing a black viscid liquid; a mix of light, medium, and heavy oils. A second, smaller cylinder, 67 mm in diameter and 25 cm high, was mounted {{on top of the}} fuel cylinder; it contained the propellant powder, which was normally either black powder or a mixture of nitrocellulose and diethylene glycol dinitrate. A <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> was fixed centrally on top of the fuel cylinder, it was a 50 mm diameter pipe that rose from the centre of the fuel cylinder and curved to extend horizontally approximately 50 cm. When the mine was buried, only the <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> was normally above ground.|$|E

This original Rubens' tube was a four-meter section of pipe with 200 holes spaced evenly along its length.|$|E
50|$|The engine has a 14-stage axial-flow compressor, {{producing}} compression ratios between 9:1 to 13:1 {{depending on}} altitude, also controlled by variable {{inlet guide vanes}} and blowoff valves. The combustion system used is a cannular-type: each <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> is centrally mounted on a downstream injector that ends in an annular secondary region. The contra-rotating propellers and compressor are driven by the five-stage axial turbine. Mass flow is 65 kg (143 lb) per second.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the combined influence of heat-loss and strain (characterized here by non-dimensional parameters ? and ?, respectively) on premixed flame-edges in a two-dimensional counterflow configuration. The problem is formulated as a thermo-diffusive {{model with a}} single Arrhenius reaction. In order to help classify the various flame-edge regimes, the non-adiabatic one-dimensional problem which characterizes the wings (far downstream) of the flame-edge is briefly revisited and its solutions are delimited in the ?–? plane. An analytical description of the flame-edges is then presented in the weak-strain limit ?? 0. This is complemented by a detailed numerical study. Several combustion regimes are found and their domains of existence are identified in the ?–? plane. These include ignition fronts, extinction fronts, solutions with propagation speeds that depend non-monotonically on the strain-rate, propagating <b>flame</b> <b>tubes</b> and stationary <b>flame</b> <b>tubes.</b> Multiplicity of solutions and hysteresis phenomena, which are partly but not exclusively associated with the one-dimensional regimes, are also identified and discussed...|$|R

50|$|Lt Tribe {{was among}} the first group of {{soldiers}} that were trained to operate a trench warfare weapon called a flamethrower. According to Thomas Wictor, the Author of “Flamethrower Troops of World War I: The Central and Allied Powers,” Lt Tribe accompanied the delivery of Vincent battery flamethrowers to allies in World War I and also trained soldiers {{in the use of the}} weapon. In the early phases of utilizing the flamethrower operators were experiencing noxious design problems.The <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> that transferred oil would come apart, spraying operators with burning oil.

25|$|The first engine, its {{development}} designation being BOl.1 (Bristol Olympus 1), had six LP compressor stages and eight HP stages, each {{driven by a}} single-stage turbine. The combustion system was novel in that ten connected <b>flame</b> <b>tubes</b> were housed within a cannular system: a hybrid of separate flame cans and a true annular system. Separate combustion cans would have exceeded the diameter beyond the design limit, and a true annular system was considered too advanced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The air {{preheater}} was {{installed on the}} furnace to decrease the exhaust gas temperature and heat the air to about 290 ˚C. A radiant cylinder {{was added to the}} radiation section. Swirl flames were formed by adjusting the shape and the installation angles of the burner <b>flame</b> <b>tubes.</b> The radiation heat transfer was strengthened and the heat absorption was enhanced in the radiation section, while the temperature at the outlet of the furnace was decreased.

50|$|An engine, uprated {{from the}} J47, was {{required}} for the F-86H. The mass flow was increased by relocating accessories from {{the centre of the}} compressor inlet to the underside of the engine. This allowed a reduction in blade hub diameter, which together with an increase in tip diameter, gave a bigger area for air to enter the compressor. The area through the combustion chambers also had to be increased. This was done by replacing the multiple individual chambers with a single annular casing with individual <b>flame</b> <b>tubes</b> or cans known as cannular.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{circular}} {{and has a}} very rounded appearance, with {{a central}} metal cap that covers the mine's safety device, a large screw. The mine is unusual in that it uses five igniter/fuzes linked to a central detonator {{by a series of}} flame tubes. Sufficient pressure on the top surface of the mine causes it to press down on {{one or more of the}} igniters, compressing a spring and allowing two steel striker retaining balls to escape, releasing the striker, which is forced upwards by a second spring. The striker hits a percussion cap at the top of the igniter, the flash from which travels along a <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> to a metal chamber in the centre of the mine. If the safety screw is removed then the flash is free to ignite the detonator, which in turn detonates the main charge.|$|E

Also, it deals with the identification of some solutions of the differential equation for reduced temperature under imposed initial conditions. Some models of combustion numerical computations have been applied, as presented by the specialized documentation, to establish the combustion rate and flame speed for laminar combustion.

40|$|A {{counterflow}} {{diffusion flame}} model is studied revealing that, {{at least as}} a part of the quenching boundary is approached in parameter space at low enough Lewis numbers, an edge of a diffusion flame, or triple flame, has a propagation speed that still advances the burning solution into regions that are not burning. In crossing the quenching boundary, the advancing flame edge remains a robust part of the solution but the flame behind the edge is found to break up into periodic regions, resembling “tubes ” of burning and non-burning, accompanied by the appearance of an oscillatory component in the speed of propagation of the edge. In crossing a second boundary the propagation speed of the flame edge disappears altogether. The only unbounded, non-periodic stationary solution then consists of an isolated <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> although stationary periodic flame tubes can also exist under the same conditions. In passing back through parameter space, starting with a single <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> already present, there is no sign of hysteresis and the oscillatory edge propagation reappears at the same point where it disappears. On the other hand, in continuing forwards across a third, final boundary the <b>flame</b> <b>tube</b> is extinguished leaving no combustion whatever.
