5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) and <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>You</b> by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory's party).|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times {{stated that}} [...] "Cabaret" [...] is a [...] "percolating bedroom jam that depicts sex {{as a form}} of at-home theater". Boston Globes Sarah Rodman called the song a [...] "sexed-up jam". HitFix's Melinda Newman {{described}} the song as a [...] "loop-driven to getting down with your lady, who’s taking off her clothes as quickly as she can". According to Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine, in [...] "Cabaret", Timberlake compares the love to a burlesque and noted that the song resembles producer Timbaland's earlier work. Andy Kellman of Allmusic wrote that the song features Timbaland's signature sound and finds Timberlake proclaiming more [...] "clever/nauseating" [...] lyrics: [...] "If sex is a contest, then you're coming first"; [...] "'Cause <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>you</b> saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger." [...] The chorus is consisted of Timberlake singing [...] "It's a cabaret" [...] while being accompanied by Timbaland, who repeats [...] "Put on a show, get on the floor". According to Stern, in his part with a duration about two minutes, Drake raps raunchy and fast-talking lines, [...] "I’mma fuck you like we’re having an affair". Nick Krewen of Toronto Star wrote that Drake raps lines [...] "about a sexual tête-à-tête amidst a melee of scattershot rhythms".|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "In My Eyes" [...] {{utilizes}} tingling synths. Colly {{said that}} Robyn is [...] "an encouraging den mother" [...] on the song, singing [...] "Little star, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>you.</b> You'll be okay." [...] Luke O'Neill of The Boston Globe {{said that the}} song showcases [...] "the tension-and-catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals." [...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised stop-start funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It is really very simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click your heels for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some reviews were harsh, Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Too much of [...] "Echo" [...] is mired in soppy balladry and standard-issue dancery" [...] adding that [...] "When it works, however, {{as on the}} soaring Happy and feathery, synth-laden <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>You,</b> all is (momentarily) redeemed". The Guardian said that [...] "Echo's 13 tracks, which were co-written by Justin Timberlake, OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder and other costly names, follow the formula of her debut: the slow, piano-accented build-up, punctuated by sharp intakes of breath and vocal curlicues, then the climactic {{explosion}} as the drums crash in and she hits the chorus. That voice is impressive enough and there's no denying the stolid catchiness of some songs – notably Happy and her cover of Oasis's Stop Crying Your Heart Out – but she appears to lack the lightness of touch this album desperately needs". Slant Magazine stated that [...] "...less compelling material, particularly in the album's second half, finds Lewis's talent squandered. The gooier adult contemporary numbers, of which [...] "I Got You" [...] is the worst, tend to add a lot of unnecessary vocal doctoring to the mix, edging on the faceless robo-pop that has become all too ubiquitous {{in the age of}} Auto-Tune. And too much of the album's runtime is dominated by altogether thoughtless ballads, like the languid late-album duo of [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Down," [...] in which Lewis confronts dull, piano-driven arrangements with vocals that, while technically unimpeachable, lack any warmth or emotional expression".|$|E
