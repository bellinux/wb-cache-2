50|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>making</b> {{began in}} Upstate South Carolina {{just before the}} Revolutionary War. The <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> {{furnaces}} were located in areas that had deposits of iron ore and limestone, forests to supply wood to make charcoal, and water power to operate the bellows. In the 1850s, the local iron works faced increased competition from Northern furnaces using anthracite coal to produce iron that could be easily transported by rail.|$|R

50|$|Henry {{began his}} <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> career early on, and was {{apparently}} {{determined to make}} it a success. An iron master of the time needed an appropriate residence, and Henry had begun the Mount Hope Mansion by 1800. He may have designed the elaborate formal gardens himself. The mansion and gardens were completed by 1805, and various outbuildings and a church were added over the years. Mount Hope Estate became the center of the family's <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> empire and is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
5000|$|Kulti Works of IISCO {{had grown}} {{to be a major}} foundry complex in stages. The light {{castings}} foundry was established in 1875, general castings shop in 1915, non-ferrous foundry in 1948, steel foundry and heavy mechanised foundry in 1958. The spun pipe plants (three in number) came up in 1944, 1958 and 1981. The <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> facilities were closed down at Kulti in 1958 and it was decided to supply foundry iron in liquid form from Burnpur. Thus the curtain came down on 83-year long tradition of <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> at Kulti.|$|R

50|$|Molten {{steel is}} also less fluid than molten <b>iron,</b> <b>making</b> it more {{difficult}} to pour and fill intricate gaps in a mold cavity. Molten steel is also more likely to react with internal mold surfaces, making for more unpredictable results.|$|R
5000|$|The iron {{industry}} in Maesteg continued, {{with varying degrees}} of success, until wrought <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> was replaced by the manufacture of cheaper, mass-produced steel during the 1870s. In its heyday, after the opening of the broad gauge, steam-hauled Llynfi Valley Railway in 1861, the Llynfi Works had a reputation for producing high-quality iron. In the mid-Victorian period there was a flourishing export trade to Southern Italy and Turkey for example, rails were exported to the United States and Llynvi [...] "Navy Quality" [...] No.3 Cable Iron was highly regarded by the makers of Admiralty-tested anchor chains. However, as the Llynfi site could not be adapted for the production of steel, <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> ceased in the Maesteg area in 1885.|$|R
40|$|Since {{coking coal}} {{reserves}} {{all over the}} world is not sufficient to meet the demand of fuel used in iron making,DRI route of <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> is being adopted. Taking into account the current scenrio,India produces around 20 MT per annum in which non-coking coal is used extensively. In this project work,studies on effect of different carbonisation temperatures(400, 600, 800, 1000),chemical and physical properties(Proximate analysis,caking characteristics,porosity) of different coal samples,obtained from different mines in India were conducted for their effective use in sponge <b>iron</b> <b>making.</b> In the project work studies has been done on chars prepared from Jagannath,Lingaraj Mines,Ananta mines,Bhubaneswari and Talcher open field mines. Non-coking coals at four different Carbonisation temperatures were analysed for detremination of their physical and chemical properties. It was concluded that increase in carbonisation temperature,volatile matter and calorific value decreases where as fixed carbon content and ash content increases. It was also found out that Bhubaneswari mines coal has high fixed carbon content. Talcher mines coal has highest calorific value. This test examines which coal is best applicable for industrial applications like sponge <b>iron</b> <b>making.</b> Studies on different soaking rate as well as different soaking time was also investigated...|$|R

5000|$|The iron {{industry}} shifted to one largely {{determined by the}} production of steel during the British Industrial Revolution and in the later half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] As such, blast furnaces, steam and electric power, and coke fuel replaced the largely land- and labor-intensive practices of <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> on plantations dependent on large tracts of land to produce charcoal and additional labor to sustain both the <b>iron</b> <b>making</b> operations and the community at large. Though iron produced on plantations remained practically useful for Westward Expansion, the eastern United States and Europe increasingly demanded more pliable and resistant steel for use in buildings, ships, engines, and railroads. Though demand still remained for pig iron as an ingredient in steel production, most iron plantations were no longer economically competitive with coke-powered smelters which located themselves increasingly closer to the major cities requiring their products.|$|R
