5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, <b>David</b> <b>J.</b> Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Department of Recreational Sports, the BGSU Outdoor Program offers outdoor trips, {{an indoor}} {{climbing}} wall, team-building, and an outdoor equipment rental center to BGSU students, faculty, staff and surrounding community members.

5|$|In 2003, paleontologists Simon R. Harris, <b>David</b> <b>J.</b> Gower, and Mark Wilkinson {{examined}} previous phylogenetic {{studies of}} aetosaurs and criticized {{the way in}} which they used certain characters to produce cladograms. They concluded that only three hypotheses of aetosaur relationships from previous studies were still true: that Aetosaurus is the most basal aetosaur, that Aetosauroides is the sister taxon of Stagonolepis robertsoni, and that Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus are more closely related to each other than either is to Neoaetosauroides. They also went on to correct the trees from all previous analyses.|$|E
50|$|Bauhaus {{combined}} these influences {{to create}} a gloomy, earnest and introspective version of post-punk, which appealed to many music fans who felt disillusioned {{in the wake of}} punk's collapse. Its crucial elements included Murphy's deep and sonorous voice, Ash's jagged guitar playing and <b>David</b> <b>J's</b> dub-influenced bass. Their sound and gloomy style would eventually {{come to be known as}} gothic rock.|$|R

5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and <b>David</b> <b>J.</b> Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to evolve into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable. At a distance of 150light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth. However, {{in the time it}} will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth but may yet pose a threat.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly.

However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and <b>David</b> <b>J.</b> Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E
