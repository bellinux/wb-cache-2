5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when both parents carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E

5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Film critic Ben Zipper {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout {{a number of his}} films. He points out that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings is reminiscent of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{formerly}} being working class, Summer Hill {{and many}} of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. Culturally, Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney suburbia, with Italian influences (which are most <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> Leichhardt to <b>the</b> east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which are most strongly <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> Ashfield to <b>the</b> West), and smaller influences from many other cultures.|$|R

5|$|Marrakesh {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence was <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias was <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself {{did not support the}} headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E

5|$|The Betsimisaraka ("the many inseparables") are {{the second}} largest ethnic group in Madagascar after the Merina and make up {{approximately}} fifteen percent of the Malagasy people. They occupy a large stretch of the eastern coastal region of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion. Tromba (spirit possession) ceremonies feature strongly in Betsimisaraka culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} that quickly developed between Cairano and the experts of the Sanmicheli studio is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artworks and their chronological sequence.

The first documentary evidence of the company of the Sanmicheli brothers, Bartolomeo and Giovanni, originally from Porlezza on Lake Como, appears in the 1480s in Verona; by the end of the century, they had obtained important commissions in various northern Italian cities.|$|E
