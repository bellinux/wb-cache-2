50|$|The {{statement}} {{may sound}} like a truism or cliche, but Torah Aura takes it very seriously. They say that it means they believe that students need enough Judaica - and the right Judaica - to build a Jewish future. Torah Aura's observation is that many to most Jews are not taught enough Judaism and to survive as Jews.For a supplemental school to succeed, it needs to offer a real Jewish <b>foundation.</b> <b>Facts</b> are not a foundation. Concepts are. Feelings are important. They are necessary but not sufficient. Being able to name the objects used on Sukkot doesn’t lead to the building of a personal Sukkah. The ability to perform prayers from the Siddur is an enabling skill, but not one that alone will lead students as they grow to use services as moments of personal connection with the divine.According to Torah Aura, Jewish schools {{spend a lot of time}} on Bible stories, but nowhere near enough on developing the skills of extracting meaning from the biblical text. To survive as a Jew, to care to survive as a Jew, one needs a web of understandings and conceptual tools. Torah Aura was created to produce tools that make the “meanings” of Judaism accessible.|$|R
