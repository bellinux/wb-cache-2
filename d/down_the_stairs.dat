5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{in hope of}} {{just getting}} outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E

Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E

Baxter punches the grandfather, intimidates the family and orders Daisy to strip naked. When she does, Perowne notices that she is pregnant. Finding out she is a poet, Baxter asks her to recite a poem. Rather than one of her own, she recites Dover Beach, which affects Baxter emotionally, effectively disarming him. Instead he becomes enthusiastic about Perowne's renewed talk about new treatment for Huntington's disease. After his companion abandons him, Baxter is overpowered by Perowne and Theo, and knocked unconscious after falling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> That night Perowne is summoned {{to the hospital for}} a successful emergency operation on Baxter.

5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship in which the {{champion}} Samoa Joe defended against the challenger Sting. The duration of the encounter was 16 minutes and 54 seconds. The beginning of the match had Joe on the offensive, with Joe performing a dive between the ropes to hit Sting {{in the face with}} his forearm. The competitors then fought throughout the crowd for an extended period. At one point while the two were fighting on the arena steps, Joe jumped from a luxury box and kicked Sting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Afterwards, Sting and Joe fought back towards the ring with each trading the offensive advantage. Back in the ring, Sting earned a near-fall after an aerial splash from the top of a turnbuckle. Joe placed Sting in an STF submission hold after a powerbomb next. Sting reached the ropes, causing the hold to be broken by the referee. Sting threw Joe into a ring corner and performed his signature Stinger Splash before lifting Joe up and slamming Joe neck-first onto the mat with Joe's signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe got up off the mat immediately and attacked Sting. He then slammed Sting head and back-first into the mat with Sting's trademark Scorpion Death Drop maneuver. Sting also got up immediately after the move. Later, Kevin Nash entered the arena and walked to the ringside area. Nash had reportedly left the company but his attendance backstage was leaked to various media outlets. As Joe was arguing with the referee, Sting retrieved a baseball bat that he had left at ringside. Nash pulled the bat from Sting's hands, not allowing him to use it in the match. Afterwards, Joe and Sting fought in the ring when Sting dodged a running Joe, causing him to almost collide with referee Earl Hebner who dodged as well. At this time, Nash hit Joe across the back with the baseball bat when Joe came in contact with the ring ropes. Sting followed by performing the Scorpion Death Drop on Joe and pinned him to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The event came to a close as Sting celebrated in-front of the crowd.|$|E
