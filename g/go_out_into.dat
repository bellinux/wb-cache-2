5|$|A Newsboy Hero is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. A standard melodrama, it has the alcoholic John Bailey return home in a drunken state. He strikes his wife and by this act drives {{his wife and child}} from the house. They <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the snow and fall asleep, but are saved by a newspaper boy and taken home. John searches for them, but believes they are dead after reading a newspaper story and decides to commit suicide. He is saved {{by a member of the}} Salvation Army and then is reunited with his family. The only known credit in the production is that of Marie Eline as the couple's child, Marie. The film was released on February 24, 1911, and it received mixed reviews by critics over its melodramatic plot, but the actors strong skills was the strongest redeeming factor in the negative reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) {{encourages}} Paul {{to start}} dating again, {{and he has}} a number of casual relationships using a dating app. He falls out with Daniel when he puts his romance with Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) before work. After they argue, Daniel and Amber <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> a tornado that hits Erinsborough. Paul goes after them and his car is hit by a dislodged skip. Daniel and Amber rescue him. He suffers broken ribs and a cracked prosthetic. Paul decides he is ready to be mayor again and organises a media gathering at Sonya's Nursery, {{but it has to be}} postponed when the nursery is vandalised. Paul discovers Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) was behind the vandalism, and he blackmails Jayden's mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) into stepping down as interim mayor. Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy), a fling from Paul's time in Brazil, arrives in Erinsborough and tells Paul that he abandoned her without explanation to return to Australia in 2004. Paul's memories of this are unclear due to his brain tumour, but he agrees to help her set up a bar. Paul falls in love with Dakota, but he soon learn that she is involved in diamond smuggling. She leaves after asking him for money.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E

25|$|During {{her early}} period she {{reported}} night time visitations by an apparition of Hor-Ra. He slowly dictated to her, over a twelve-month period, {{the story of}} her previous life. The story took up around seventy pages of cursive hieroglyphic text. It described the life of a young woman in ancient Egypt, called Bentreshyt, who had reincarnated in the person of Dorothy Eady. Bentreshyt ("Harp of Joy") is described in this text as being of humble origin, her mother a vegetable seller and her father a soldier during the reign of Seti I (c.1290 BC to 1279 BC). When she was three, her mother died, and she was placed in the temple of Kom el-Sultan because her father couldn't afford her. There, she was brought up to be a priestess. When she was twelve years old the High Priest asked her if she wished to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world or stay and become a consecrated virgin. In the absence of full understanding and without a practical alternative, she took the vows.|$|E

500|$|Indigenous {{leaders have}} spoken out against {{individuals}} from {{within their own}} communities who may <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world to become a [...] "white man's shaman," [...] and any [...] "who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole". The term [...] "plastic shaman" [...] or [...] "plastic medicine people" [...] {{has been applied to}} outsiders who identify themselves as shamans, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent.|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "I Worship You" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "falling somewhere between adult contemporary and rock", and utilizes acoustic guitars and synthesizers. [...] "Here Am I" [...] relates the story {{of people who are}} not being reached by Christians, and [...] "challenges the listener to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world and stand up for their King". [...] "On My Way to You" [...] is a worship song, requesting [...] "wisdom, purity, and humility in our pursuit of holiness". [...] "How Great is Your Love" [...] incorporates both string and electronic instruments; Millard's vocals in the song utilize [...] "effect–laden delays". [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] is a ballad, opening with just piano before building to include drums and guitar. Lyrically, it asks what it will be like in Heaven, standing before God.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri {{says that}} Valhalla {{must be an}} immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways. High {{responds}} that {{there are plenty of}} doors, and that crowding doesn't occur around them. In support, High again quotes a stanza from Grímnismál. In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla and sit down to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E

500|$|The second film, a family-friendly adventure, {{is called}} Pee-wee's Playhouse: The Movie by Reubens, and follows Pee-wee and his Playhouse friends on a road-trip adventure, {{meaning that they}} would leave {{the house for the}} first time and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> [...] "Puppetland". All of the {{original}} characters of the show, live-action and puppets are included in Reubens' script. The story happens in a fantasy land that would be reminiscent of H.R. Pufnstuf and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In January 2009, Reubens told Gary Panter that the rejected first script of Pee-wee's Big Adventure (which they co-wrote) could have a movie deal very soon and that it would be [...] "90 minutes of incredible beauty". On December 2009, while in character, Reubens said this film is [...] "already done, the script is already fully written; It's ready to shoot." [...] Most of the film will take place in Puppetland and claymation might be used.|$|E
500|$|In pre-Code Hollywood, the sex film became {{synonymous with}} women's {{pictures}} — Darryl F. Zanuck once told Wingate {{that he was}} ordered by Warner Brothers' New York corporate office to reserve 20% of the studio's output for [...] "women's pictures, which inevitably means sex pictures." [...] Vice films typically tacked on endings where the most sin-filled characters were either punished or redeemed. Films explored Code-defying subjects in an unapologetic manner with the premise that an end-reel moment could redeem all that had gone before. The concept of marriage was often tested in films such as The Prodigal (1931), {{in which a woman}} is {{having an affair with a}} seedy character, and later falls in love with her brother-in-law. When her mother-in-law steps in at the end of the film, it is to encourage one son to grant his wife a divorce so she can marry his brother, with whom she is obviously in love. The older woman proclaims the message of the film in a line near the end: [...] "This the twentieth century. <b>Go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world and get what happiness you can." ...|$|E
500|$|Later, a {{group of}} {{students}} <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the woods at night to play with black magic, an attempt to [...] "score" [...] {{on the part of the}} boys in the group. The experiment causes unexplainable things to happen, causing all but one of the teenagers to flee. The remaining teen's mutilated body is discovered the next day, leading Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to investigate. Locals—including the faculty members—claim that the children have unleashed a demonic force with their rituals; a theory which is given validity by strange occurrences, such as frogs falling from the sky and water in the drinking fountain draining counter-clockwise, contrary to the Coriolis effect. Unknown to the agents, substitute teacher Mrs. Phyllis Paddock (Susan Blommaert) is behind the murder, keeping the eyes and heart of the victim in her desk. One of the faculty members, Jim Ausbury (Dan Butler) suspects one of his colleagues killed the boy, but the others believe it was an outside force. Ausbury's stepdaughter, Shannon (Heather McComb), suffers a breakdown during science class while dissecting a pig fetus, seeing its heart beat and its head move.|$|E

500|$|Rumors that Isabeau and Orléans were lovers {{began to}} circulate, a {{relationship}} that was considered incestuous. Whether the two were intimate has been questioned by contemporary historians, including Gibbons who believes the rumor may have been planted as propaganda against Isabeau as retaliation against tax increases she and Orléans ordered in 1405. An Augustinian friar, Jacques Legrand, preached a long sermon to the court denouncing excess and depravity, in particular mentioning Isabeau and her fashions—with exposed necks, shoulders and décolletage. The monk presented his sermon as allegory {{so as not to}} offend Isabeau overtly, but he cast her and her ladies-in-waiting as [...] "furious, vengeful characters". He said to Isabeau, [...] "If you don't believe me, <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the city disguised as a poor woman, and you will hear what everyone is saying." [...] Thus he accused Isabeau as having lost touch with the commoners and the court with its subjects. At about the same time a satirical political pamphlet, Songe Veritable, now considered by historians to be pro-Burgundian propaganda, was released and widely distributed in Paris. The pamphlet hinted at the Queen's relations with Orléans.|$|E
500|$|In Greece, a {{large log}} was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or {{smoldering}} through the Twelve Days of Christmas. This was {{done as a}} protection against the demons called Kallikantzaroi, believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the Kallikantzaroi from entering the house down the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the buzm, as the log was called there, {{was about to be}} brought into the house, {{a member of the family}} would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the yard, shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the buzm was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying [...] "You are welcome!" [...] and the buzm would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.|$|E
