"Truman {{left the}} Presidency {{thinking}} that Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley were nuts, crackpots, scoundrels, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{say that a}} fissure began in American political life that's never really closed. It reverberates, and I can say more about it. But in the main, American liberalism—Arthur Schlesinger, one of the conspicuous examples—got it wrong. We were {{on the side of}} the people who denied this, and a president who could have changed his rhetoric, explained it, told the American people, didn't know the facts, they were secret, and they were kept from him."– Secrecy: The American Experience, October 1998 ...|$|E

Goldsmith later said of the event [...] "Cannabis was found in my room. I was guilty throughout my time at school, but on this one occasion I was innocent.

2500|$|Jim Schembri in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age (Melbourne) wrote, [...] "The film is fine, {{and never}} boring but, boy, is it overlong," [...] and added, [...] "More importantly, local films with black themes or major {{indigenous}} characters {{tend to do}} poorly, so if Australia succeeds here it could represent a breakthrough. We've always had trouble dealing with racial issues on film, so, in that regard, the film could be a landmark." [...] Claire Sutherland, in her review for the Herald Sun (Melbourne) wrote, [...] "A love letter to the Australian landscape and our history, Australia has international blockbuster written all over it", and Sydney's The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Kidman's screen presence {{is nothing short of}} radiant." [...] In his review for The Australian (Sydney), David Stratton wrote, [...] "It's not the masterpiece that we were hoping for, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say that it's a very good film in many ways. While it will be very popular with many people I think there's a slight air of disappointment after it all. Despite its flaws — and it certainly has flaws — I think Australia is an impressive and important film." [...] Mark Naglazas of The West Australian (Perth) accused positive reviews from News Ltd press outlets of being manipulated by 20th Century Fox, as they are all owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, calling Australia a film of [...] "unrelenting awfulness" [...] that [...] "lurches drunkenly from crazy comedy to Mills and Boonish melodrama {{in the space of a}} couple of scenes".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] says I, [...] "you done it, but <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could.</b> It ain't no slouch {{of a name}} to spell--right {{off without}} studying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I not, my dear, dear Jockey! <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have {{a better}} chief. I have always heard that Sir Philip {{was such a good}} man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate cutting {{my things}} down. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> alter a word here without spoiling the sense. It reads better aloud than when I was writing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{request is}} a very {{reasonable}} one," [...] Holmes answered. [...] "Dr. Mortimer, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not do better than to tell your story as you told it to us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} with an {{encouraging}} smile, [...] "there {{is no reason why}} you shouldn't make a career yet. <b>I</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> if <b>you</b> wanted to." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. And oh, by the way! I've {{got hold}} of a young fellow that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do {{something}} for, Wade. Do you happen to remember the article on the defalcation in the Boston Abstract?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, brother, that do <b>I</b> not. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never despise one who {{has felt}} such genuine pity for you as to risk and endure so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I {{should have}} known <b>you,</b> if I <b>could</b> have seen you; but I couldn't, and you spoke so gruff. <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> speak gruff to me, Mark, at first coming back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seeing {{it through}} such a fresh mind?" [...] I suggested. [...] "Well, I'll own that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have found a much fresher one. Has she read the Last Days of Pompeii?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little lady}} smiled at him. [...] "Oh, I understand. That {{is what made}} me almost afraid. It cannot be nice to borrow from a woman. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> if it was necessary, do even harder things." ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT. What I really dread is misunderstanding. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> help me {{to avoid}} that.

6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, Herbert, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> persuade her to anything. Of course {{we must not}} hurry her too much.

6000|$|... "No. Will you, dear Cousin Clym, go and try {{to persuade}} him not to go? He takes no notice of what I say, and puts me off {{with the story of}} his going on a journey, and will be home tomorrow, and all that; but I don't believe it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{influence}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He left {{at eleven}} o'clock," [...] I answered. [...] "He saw me, and I suppose {{he knew that}} I was looking for him.

[...] "The next {{thing to do is}} to find out where he has gone to. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> help here, Fritz." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could only}} make a guess. As {{she seems to}} be a {{comparatively}} new vessel and is probably in good repair except for the damage she received on the night in question <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hold out for two thousand dollars. It's quite possible that she only started a plank or two, and a new mainmast wouldn't cost a great deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is safe enough. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come to much real damage; but {{remember}} that for Kally a start or an alarm would be really as hurtful as an accident to a person in health.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I congratulate you, my boy," [...] {{he said as}} heartily as he could. [...] "To be {{completely}} frank, when you started out, <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do it. By the way, I suppose Mrs. Pickett was pleased?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sitting on {{a throne}} of {{rejected}} pictures? No, I shan't, dear. The notion in itself has fascinated me.--Of course you don't care for fancy heads, Dick. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do them. <b>You</b> like blood and bones." ...|$|R
