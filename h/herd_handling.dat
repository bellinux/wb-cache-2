40|$|Goat {{production}} {{is an important}} economic activity for rural communities in the Gran Chaco of Argentina. Goat corrals are important {{for the survival of}} peridomestic populations of Triatoma infestans. This study evaluated the impact of modifying the traditional structure of goat corrals on T. infestans populations and goat productivity in the region of Los Llanos (La Rioja). Thirty-nine experimental corrals were constructed and 57 traditional corrals were used as controls. We evaluated the infestations of the control and experimental corrals for five years following construction of the structures. The results showed that the new structures did not prevent the colonization, although it enhanced the detection of infestation at low densities of T. infestans. No significant difference was found in T. infestans population abundance between control and experimental corrals, probably because of the different detectability in the two types of structures, especially among the small nymphs. Although goat productivity average was higher in experimental than in control corrals, no significant difference was found because of high variability. The new structures {{can be used as a}} complement to promote the development of rural communities. Acceptability and adoption of the new corrals by the owners was high, as the enclosures offered better protection for the goats, increased growth of kids and facilitated <b>herd</b> <b>handling.</b> Fil: Gorla, David Eladio.

40|$|Eighteen {{red deer}} hinds {{were used to}} study the {{behavioural}} responses {{over a period of}} 10 weeks to three management practices which were expected to cause increasing levels of stress. The practices were <b>herding,</b> <b>herding</b> and <b>handling</b> and <b>herding,</b> <b>handling</b> and a veterinary procedure. One of three groups of six animals received a long-acting neuroleptic (LAN - perphenazine enanthate and zuclopenthixol acetate) in Weeks 1, 5 and 9 of the experiment whilst the other groups were untreated. The LAN-treated and one of the untreated groups received the stressors in sequence and one undisturbed group acted as a control. The siting of the paddocks in which the three groups were rotated had a marked effect on behaviour: the further the deer were from the handling area, the less stress-related behaviour they exhibited. In response to the management procedures animals decreased their inactive lying and increased their moving activity. Based on behavioural responses the deer did not appear to find the practices increasingly challenging. Behaviour type was the chief influence on interindividual distancing. Differences in distancing between animals were most noticeable while the animals were moving. LAN treatment promoted maintenance of a more normal activity pattern when the animals were disturbed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{impact of}} stress was studied in semidomesticated {{reindeer}} subjected to various <b>herding</b> and <b>handling</b> methods. In <b>herded</b> and <b>handled</b> animals, stress lesions were found, such as abomasal haemorrhage, muscular and myocardial degeneration and marked changes in blood constituents. The degree of change was dependent {{of the magnitude}} of stress the animal had been exposed to. Manual handling and restraint was found {{to be one of the}} major stress factors. There were evident indications of a cumulative effect of repeated stress events. The use of motor vehicles (helicopter and snow-scooter), for herding and transporting the animals, was found to be an important stress factor. It is concluded that various <b>herding</b> and <b>handling</b> methods studied in the present investigation led to varying degrees of deleterious effects on the health of the animals and a poorer meatquality from slaughtered animals. Hence herding should be undertaken as carefully as possible, the time taken for manual handling should be minimized, and the corrals be so constructed as to cause a minimum of disturbance, capture and restraint. Transportation should be undertaken very cautiously with as little manual handling as possible during loading and unloading. To obtain a good meat quality, animals to be slaughtered should be subjected to a minimum of handling, i. e. slaughter should take place as quickly as possible. Transportation of live animals to slaughterhouses and the keeping of animals in corrals, pens or crate...|$|R

Raw milk, like any other food product, is susceptible to contamination by foodborne pathogens which may result in illness. However, advocates maintain that a herdshare arrangement may offer the shareholder certain assurances relating {{to the care of}} the <b>herd</b> and <b>handling</b> of the milk that may result in a safer product that may otherwise be unavailable to consumers of retail raw milk purchased from either a grocery store, a farmers market or directly from the farmer at the farm or elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{segregation}} {{is common}} among north temperate ungulates {{and has been}} investigated {{for a number of}} speries (Main and Coblentz, 1990).

40|$|Twelve {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus) hinds from a {{research}} facility in Eastern Scotland were randomly {{divided into two}} groups between June and September to study the physiological response to three management practices, given sequentially, which were expected to cause increasing levels of stress (herding; herding and handling; and <b>herding,</b> <b>handling</b> and a veterinary procedure). One group of animals received a long-acting neuroleptic (LAN; perphenazine enanthate and zuclopenthixol acetate) on three occasions at 4 -week intervals. Automatic blood sampling equipment (ABSE) was used to obtain blood samples remotely before, during and after the application of each of the stressors. The plasma concentrations of cortisol, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein (TP), 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4) and testosterone (T) were measured and heart rates recorded. The ABSE provided a useful means of collecting blood samples without the superimposition of stress factors associated with conventional sampling. Increases in plasma concentrations of cortisol (P < 0 · 01), CPK (P < 0 · 01) and AST (P < 0 · 05) were observed in all animals in response to all three management practices. There were smaller increases in plasma cortisol concentration (P < 0 · 05) in those animals treated with LAN. The results suggested a degree of habituation of the hinds to some procedures common to all treatments, in agreement with previous analysis of the behavioual response of these animals. Peaks of heart rate were recorded over the 30 -min period stressors were applied. Higher heart rates and T 3 and T 4 concentrations were observed in LAN-treated animals. Heart rates returned to baseline more rapidly in the LAN-treated animals. Higher plasma concentrations of testosterone were recorded {{in the first week of}} the study (P < 0 · 001). Physiological and behavioural evidence supports the view that LANs are effective long-term tranquillizers in red deer...|$|R
50|$|Domestication {{of animals}} {{requires}} certain traits {{in the animal}} that antelope do not typically display. Most species are difficult to contain in any density, due to the territoriality of the males, {{or in the case}} of oryxes (which have a relatively hierarchical social structure), an aggressive disposition; they can easily kill a human. Because many have extremely good jumping abilities, providing adequate fencing is a challenge. Also, antelope will consistently display a fear response to perceived predators, such as humans, making them very difficult to <b>herd</b> or <b>handle.</b> Although antelope have diets and rapid growth rates highly suitable for domestication, this tendency to panic and their nonhierarchical social structure explains why farm-raised antelope are uncommon. Ancient Egyptians kept herds of gazelles and addax for meat, and occasionally pets. It is unknown whether they were truly domesticated, but it seems unlikely, as no domesticated gazelles exist today.|$|R
30|$|The high animal {{mortality}} rate for some herders indicated poor herd management, specifically {{with respect to}} veterinarian services. In 2009, the RBG staff conducted trainings on different veterinarian topics, which helped control the {{mortality rate}} in almost all the herds. Herder 3, however, had the highest mortality rates due to a mismanagement decision to purchase sick lambs and kids. It {{is important to know}} when and how lamb and kid mortality occurs, in order to avoid such losses in the future. This information {{should be included in the}} <b>herd’s</b> records to <b>handle</b> future losses.|$|R

40|$|Animal {{waste from}} animal feeding {{operations}} (AFOs) {{is a significant}} contributor to nitrate contamination of groundwater. Some animal waste also contains heavy metals and salts that may build up in cropland and underlying aquifers. This thesis focuses on pollution reduction from the largest AFOs, in particular, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), which present the greatest potential risk among all AFOs to environmental quality and public health. To find cost-effective policies for controlling pollution at the field level and at the farm level, a dynamic environmental-economic modeling framework for representative CAFOs is developed. The framework incorporates four models (i. e., animal model, crop model, hydrologic model, and economic model) that includes various components such as <b>herd</b> management, manure <b>handling</b> system, crop rotation, water sources, irrigation system, waste disposal options, and pollutant emissions. The operator maximizes discounted total farm profit over multiple periods subject to environmental regulations. Decision rules from the dynamic optimization problem demonstrate best management practices for CAFOs to improve their economic and environmental performance. Results from policy simulations suggest that direct quantity restrictions of emission or incentive-based emission policies are much more cost-effective than the standard approach of limiting the amount of animal waste that may be applied to fields; reason being, policies targeting intermediate pollution and final pollution create incentives for the operator {{to examine the effects}} of other management practices to reduce pollution in addition to controlling the polluting inputs. Incentive-based emission policies are shown to have advantages over quantity restrictions over multiple years when seasonal or annual emissions fluctuate either due to inherent operation practices or the accumulation of precursors to the pollution. My approach demonstrates the importance of taking into account the integrated effects of water, nitrogen, and salinity on crop yield and nitrate leaching as well as the spatial heterogeneity of nitrogen/water application. It also suggests that ecosystem services can play an important role in pollution control and thus deserve more attention when designing policies...|$|R
40|$|In a {{dairy farm}} {{with more than}} 1200 cows kept in loose housing and with 10 - 14 % Streptococczs agalactiae-infected animals, {{mycoplasma}} californicum was first detected in the milk of 16 dairy cows in 1993. Over a period of 3 years and 6 months, a mastitis control program was tested, by which the farm intended to lower the infection rate and lessen predisposing factors. The program focussed on the improvement of cleaning and disinfection as well as optimisation of milking hygiene. In addition, antibiotic treatment for drying off milk cows was carried out. Cows, with clinical mastitis during lactation had to be treated, kept in isolation from the <b>herd</b> and <b>handled</b> separately. Unproductive cows and cows with therapy-resistant mastitis were rigorously selected. The success of these measures was verified by clinical examination of all the udders of the herd, via the time-course of the morbidity rate, the mastitis frequency rate {{and the proportion of}} cows having diseased udders, and via the results obtained from bacteriological checks and the time-course of the cell counts. By analysing the culling and reproductive rates, the cost incurred by veterinary treatment and the reduced profit due to the smaller amount of milk, the financial losses caused by udder health disturbances were established for 1993 ý 1996. Besides, the efficacy of Enrofloxacin (Baytril ®) in cows having mycoplasma mastitis was tested. Fifteen cows during lactation and 7 dry cows were treated with 5 mg/kg of Enrofloxacin on three successive days. The therapeutic success was tested by means of clinical, cytological and bacteriological control checks. The results derived from milk recording as well as the subsequent morbidity rate and the culling rate were compared with those of a control group. Our studies yielded the following results: 1. 	Even after two years of investigation, pathological findings were obtained from udders of 43 % of the cows. 20. 1 % of the cows examined had an atrophic quarter and 3. 1 % a dead quarter. 4. 6 % of the cows suffered from teat wounds. 2. 	The mean value of the monthly morbidity rate continued to rise from 1994 till 1996. The annual morbidity rate per cow and the mean value of the proportion of cows having diseased udders increased in the period under study. 3. 	The proportion of Streptococcus agalactiae-infected cows could not be reduced between October 1993 and November 1995. Simultaneously, the proportion of cows having pathogens in the milk rose from 19. 5 % to 45. 9 %. The infection rate with mycoplasma could not be assessed on the basis of mixed milk yields. 4. 	In the random sample tests, mycoplasma was detected in the milk of cows having dis-eased udders, in addition to Sc. agalactiae, staphylococci and other streptococci. In species differentiation, the laboratory identified either Mycoplasma californicum or Mycoplasma alcalescens. 5. 	The geometric annual mean of cell counts in bulk milk and in milk recording rose in 1995 ý 1996 as compared with 1993 ý 1994. The greatest value in milk recording was measured in August 1996. It was only by handling cows with cell counts greater than million/ml separately from the remaining crowd that the farm prevented financial losses caused by reduced milk yield. The proportion of cows with cell counts of less than 100. 000 /ml fell from 45., 2 % in 1993 to 31., 7 % in 1996. 6. 	The culling rate did fall from 48. 06 % in 1993 to 41. 00 % in 1996, but remained above the national average of German cattle-breeders while investigations were in progress. The proportion of cows to be slaughtered because of uddder health disturbances was greater than 60 % throughout the study. 7. 	The annual cost per cow incurred by the farm due to udder health disturbances amounted to 521. 91 DM in 1993, 538. 07 DM in 1994, 408. 95 DM in 1995 and 464. 92 DM in 1996. Less expenditure was achieved only by reducing the herd, i. e. by lowering the cost for reproduction. 8. 	The therapeutic application of Baytril ® to 15 lactating cows diseased with mycoplas-ma mastitis resulted in a recovery rate of 73. 3 %. In all bacteriological control checks mycoplasma was no longer found in the milk of the lactating group, nor in the group of dry cows. However, in four of nine cows examined in the control group, mycoplasma was again detectable. The decrease in milk yield and the recurrence rate were higher in the control group than in the lactating group. The changes in cell counts were better in the lactating group than in the control group. In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} the farm was able to supply consumable milk throughout the study. The measures taken by the farm did not result in improving udder health of the herd. The financial burden caused by udder health disturbances was above the national average. Unless existing predisposing factors are eliminated and pathogenic infection is reduced, a decrease in mycoplasma-infection and Streptococcus agalactiae-infection will not be achieved. Ultimately, only consistent separation of infected animals from uninfected ones will lead to freeing the herd from disease...|$|R
