5|$|Johnson {{implemented}} his own form of Presidential Reconstruction– {{a series}} of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to <b>fire</b> <b>Cabinet</b> officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.|$|E
5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to <b>fire</b> <b>Cabinet</b> secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E

50|$|Johnson, who {{was himself}} from Tennessee, favored quick {{restoration}} of the seceded states to the Union. He implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction - a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. His plans did not give protection to the former slaves, and he came into conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and established military districts across the South. Johnson vetoed their bills, and congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Frustrated by Johnson's actions, Congress proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states, and the amendment was ratified in 1868. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to <b>fire</b> <b>Cabinet</b> officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, but narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. In foreign policy, Johnson's presidency saw the purchase of Alaska {{and the end of the}} French intervention in Mexico. Having broken with Republicans, and failing to establish his own party under the National Union banner, Johnson sought the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, but it went to Horatio Seymour instead.|$|E

40|$|The Constitution inevitably must be interpreted. There are countless issues — such {{as whether}} the {{president}} can <b>fire</b> <b>cabinet</b> officials or rescind treaties or assert executive privilege — where the document is silent, but a constitutional answer is necessary. So much of the Constitution is written in broad language that must be given meaning and applied to specific situations. What 2 ̆ 2 Commerce... among the several States 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 liberty 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 cruel and unusual punishments 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 {{equal protection of the}} laws 2 ̆ 2 — and countless other phrases — are must be defined and applied. The assurances of freedom and equality in the Constitution are not absolute, and it is necessary to decide what justifications are sufficient to allow the government to infringe rights or discriminate. Obviously, for all of these reasons, courts must interpret the Constitution, but so must all government officials, all of whom take an oath to uphold the Constitution. A constitutional theory is an approach that is used to interpret and give meaning to the Constitution. Over the last few decades, two competing constitutional theories have been originalism and nonoriginalism. Originalists believe that the meaning of a constitutional provision is fixed {{at the time of its}} adoption and is changeable only by constitutional amendment. Under this view, Article I of the Constitution means the same thing as it did in 1787 or the First Amendment means the same thing as it did in 1791, and nothing that has happened since should matter in deciding their meanings. By contrast, nonoriginalists believe that the Constitution’s meaning evolves by both interpretation and by amendment; loosely speaking, nonoriginalists believe in a 2 ̆ 2 living Constitution. 2 ̆ 2 Of course, there are many variants of each of these approaches, and there are other constitutional theories as well. There is a huge scholarly literature debating these and other theories of constitutional interpretation. Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a former law professor and highly respected judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, has written a provocative book arguing against constitutional theory. In it, he identifies several of the most prominent constitutional theories and presents powerful critiques of them. He concludes that 2 ̆ 2 [w]hat’s needed is not yet another theory but an escape from theorizing 2 ̆ 2 (p 115). He contends that constitutional theories have been harmful to democratic governance. He says that 2 ̆ 2 the theories are taking us down the road to judicial hegemony where the self-governance at the heart of our political order cannot thrive 2 ̆ 2 (p 4). In one sense, Judge Wilkinson is surely correct. Throughout American history, justices and judges have decided cases with-out having a 2 ̆ 2 cosmic constitutional theory. 2 ̆ 2 In deciding constitutional cases courts always look at the Constitution’s text (which rarely provides answers), the Framers’ intent (if any can be ascertained), the structure of the Constitution, precedent, and social needs. The vast majority of constitutional cases have been decided without any invocation of a constitutional theory. Moreover, no theory ever has been developed for deciding what is a 2 ̆ 2 compelling 2 ̆ 2 or an 2 ̆ 2 important 2 ̆ 2 or a 2 ̆ 2 legitimate 2 ̆ 2 government interest, even though such determinations are at the core of litigation about individual rights and equal protection. No theory exists for deciding what is an “unreasonable” search or arrest, even though judges in courts across the country make that determination countless times everyday. Yet, in another sense, Judge Wilkinson is profoundly wrong because there is simply no way to avoid a constitutional theory in deciding, or having views on, constitutional issues. Justices and judges — and executives and legislators — need to decide how they will go about giving the Constitution meaning. For example, as explained above, a fundamental question is whether the meaning of a constitutional provision is fixed when it is adopted or whether its meaning can evolve by interpretation; this deter-mines what materials and what arguments are even relevant in interpreting a constitutional provision. In deciding what is cruel and unusual punishment, should the focus be solely on what the Framers deemed objectionable or should the inquiry be about 2 ̆ 2 evolving standards of decency 2 ̆ 2 ? There is no way to avoid that question, and whatever the answer, that is a constitutional theory. More generally, there needs to be an approach to deciding when courts should defer to the political process and when they should overrule it. This, too, is a constitutional theory. Judge Wilkinson’s underlying thesis — that constitutional theory is unnecessary and harmful (p 4) — is wrong because constitutional theory is inescapable. This Review is divided into three parts. First, I briefly summarize Judge Wilkinson’s argument. Second, I argue that despite his protestations to the contrary, Judge Wilkinson has a constitutional theory; it is one that calls for great judicial deference to the elected branches of government. Third, I contend that Judge Wilkinson’s theory is neither defended nor desirable...|$|E
