The HTML code would be [...] This has been protested because it bypasses everything at the other site but the image. Such protests have been largely ineffective. This argument on Kelly's behalf is articulated in the amicus curiae brief supporting Kelly by the American Society of Media Photographers:It was the actual display of the full-size images of Kelly’s work stripped from the original context that was not fair use. Merely linking to Kelly’s originating home page, on the other hand, without free-standing display of the full-size images, would not run afoul of the fair use limits established by the Panel.

In February 1999, the case was settled out of court in a non-disclosure agreement that led to Microsoft no longer having deep links to Ticketmaster. In July 1999, Ticketmaster filed a lawsuit against Tickets.com with ten causes of action, including charges that Tickets.com had violated federal copyright laws and violated Ticketmaster's terms and conditions.|$|R

It focuses on the Opinion of the ‘European Copyright Society’ on the Svensson case. The ALAI Opinion is also briefly discussed. This article proposes nine angles as part of the multi-factor test to determine whether linking is actionable under European Copyright law: four policy arguments (harmonization, high level protection, technology neutral, authorization) and five factors (‘making available’, ‘to the public’, ‘new public’, ‘intervention’ and ‘profit’). The author concludes that properly balancing those nine factors can ensure that copyright and linking can tango, in step with existing policy goals and case-law, allowing linking in some situations, while requiring separate authorization in others...|$|R
