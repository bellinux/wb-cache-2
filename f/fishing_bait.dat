5|$|N.californiensis {{is used as}} <b>fishing</b> <b>bait,</b> and is {{frequently}} transported alive between U.S. states, prompting fears that existing population structure may be obliterated, {{and that it could}} introduce the castrating parasitic isopod Ione cornuta outside its native range.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are also}} used in medicine, for example fly larvae (maggots) were {{formerly}} used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operating {{close to}} the power station is a <b>fishing</b> <b>bait</b> company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method of}} rock <b>fishing</b> is using <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b> The <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> may be bought from a store, or the angler can catch them himself. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{can be used}} either whole or cut up into pieces. The size and type of <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> used will vary {{depending}} what species is being targeted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> can be {{contrasted with}} forage <b>fish.</b> <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> {{is a term}} used {{particularly}} by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch <b>fish</b> to <b>bait</b> longlines and traps. Forage fish is a fisheries term, and is used in that context. Forage fish are small fish that are preyed on in the wild by larger predators for food. The predators can be other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish,</b> by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as <b>bait</b> for other <b>fish.</b> The terms also overlap {{in the sense that}} most <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> are also forage fish, and most forage fish can also be used as <b>bait</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Little Ice Age {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait</b> was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk {{at the same time that}} hunting for food, <b>fishing</b> <b>bait,</b> and oil decreased.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets or <b>fishing</b> <b>bait,</b> and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait</b> and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E

25|$|The Calliphoridae (commonly {{known as}} blow flies, blow-flies, carrion flies, bluebottles, greenbottles, or cluster flies) are {{a family of}} insects in the order Diptera, with 1,100 known species. The maggot larvae, often used as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait,</b> are known as gentles. The family {{is known to be}} polyphyletic, but much remains disputed {{regarding}} proper treatment of the constituent taxa, some of which are occasionally accorded family status (e.g., Bengaliidae, Helicoboscidae, Polleniidae, and Rhiniidae).|$|E

50|$|<b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> are {{consumed}} by larger, aquatic predators. Swimming in ocean water with <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> can be dangerous, as these <b>fish</b> attract sharks. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> will sometimes use whale sharks {{as a shield}} from their other predators such as tuna, as tuna are usually wary of approaching the sharks. The shark cannot attack the <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> easily, as they constantly swim above them and are too fast for the shark to manoeuvre its mouth into position. However, the sharks eventually dive deep, where the <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> cannot follow, and as the other predators finally dare attack the stranded <b>bait</b> <b>fish,</b> the shark comes back to eat numerous <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> who are already preoccupied with the attacking tuna.|$|R

25|$|The fishery {{went into}} a steep decline in 1936, due to a {{collapse}} in the export market due to the ongoing effects of the Great Depression and the intensification of war and revolution in China. After World War II, the fishery was limited to a much lower volume catch for local sale as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait.</b> Third generation Chinese-American shrimp fisherman Frank Quan had continued small volume shrimp fishing into the 21st century, living in China Camp until passing away 15 days prior to his 91st birthday.|$|E
25|$|The {{third part}} of the novel {{describes}} a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale, but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story {{in which he is}} adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait,</b> then kills the sailor himself as well as Pi's mother for food, and soon he is killed by Pi, who dines on him.|$|E
500|$|The {{great auk}} was an {{important}} part of many Native American cultures, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with great auk bones. One burial discovered included someone covered by more than 200 great auk beaks, which are presumed to be the remnants of a cloak made of great auk skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the great auk as a convenient food source or as <b>fishing</b> <b>bait,</b> reducing its numbers. The bird's down was in high demand in Europe, a factor that largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Scientists soon began to realize that the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws, but this proved ineffectual.|$|E
25|$|Forage {{fish are}} {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> or feeder <b>fish.</b> <b>Bait</b> <b>fish</b> is a term used particularly by recreational fishermen, although commercial fisherman also catch <b>fish</b> to <b>bait</b> longlines and traps. Forage fish is a fisheries term, and is used in the context of fisheries. <b>Bait</b> <b>fish,</b> by contrast, are fish that are caught by humans to use as <b>bait</b> for other <b>fish.</b> The terms overlap in the sense that most <b>bait</b> <b>fish</b> are also forage fish, and vice versa. Feeder fish is a term used particularly in the context of fish aquariums. It refers essentially to the same concept as forage fish, small fish that are eaten by larger fish, but the term is adapted to the particular requirements of working with fish in aquariums.|$|R

L.gigas is among the most important fishery resources in the Caribbean: its harvest value was US$30 million in 1992, increasing to $60 million in 2003. The total annual harvest of meat of L.gigas ranged from 6,519,711kg to 7,369,314kg between 1993 and 1998, later production declined to 3,131,599kg in 2001. Data about US imports shows a total of 1,832,000kg in 1998, as compared to 387,000kg in 2009, a nearly 80% reduction twelve years later.|$|E
