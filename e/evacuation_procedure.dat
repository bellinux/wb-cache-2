2500|$|A full {{investigation}} was launched into the accident by several government agencies, {{as well as}} legal representatives {{for the families of}} the deceased. The investigation determined that the leak was initially discovered by employees of the contractor J.M. Brennan Inc., who helped maintain plumbing, heating, air conditioning and ventilation equipment at the plant. These four employees noticed propane gas pooling as Falk employees started the propane system, which the factory uses as a backup fuel supply when natural gas is shut down during peak demand. These employees alerted other workers to the problem. There had been testing conducted on the system for a full 40minutes prior to the explosion. It is also thought the leak came from an underground pipe that ran from propane tanks to the propane/air mixers, which convert the liquid propane into gaseous form, so that it is in a form usable by the boilers. This is backed up by the discovery of a small pocket of gas trapped below asphalt directly below the Annex building. Pressure testing of the pipe using nitrogen has since confirmed it was leaking. Subsequent excavation showed it had two separate leaks; [...] Metallurgists have examined the damaged sections of pipeline and determined that the pipe corroded. Falk's <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> will also feature prominently in the investigation.|$|E

50|$|Recovery from {{an intact}} {{dilation}} and <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is similar to}} recovery from a non-intact dilation and extraction.

Postoperative pain is usually minimal and managed with NSAIDs. In cases of uterine atony and corresponding blood loss, methergine or misoprostol can be given to encourage uterine contraction and achieve hemostasis. Patients who have recently undergone an intact D&E are monitored for signs of coagulopathy, uterine perforation, uterine atony, retained tissue, or hemorrhage.|$|E

50|$|The {{automated}} {{public address}} announcement can be generated automatically by the station's fire warning system, or can be triggered from the station control. The message audio file is usually stored as the primary standard emergency announcement on the station PA/VA system. The message may indicate that a single fire alarm call point in a public area has been operated. If an automatic fire detector in a non-public area is operated, or more than one device or zone reports a fire, the system will start the <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> and the fire brigade is automatically called. The announcement can be triggered by the station controller to alert station staff of other incidents which need urgent attention. The automated nature of the announcement and its high priority means that it has occasionally been known to cut into manual (lower priority) announcements being made by station staff.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was scheduled to}} ferry 13 empty cargo pallets to be filled at Jeddah then returned to Kano. The flight was nearly canceled because only five pallets were loaded onto the aircraft, and the employee who had keys to the cargo pallet storage area did not report for work that day. The captain nearly cancelled the flight until arrangements were made for seven more cargo pallets to be added. The aircraft took at approximately 17:00 UTC and arrived in Jeddah a few minutes past 22:00 UTC. The turnaround time would have normally taken {{an hour and a}} half, but it took {{two and a half hours}} since the cargo pallets had to be loaded after arrival in Jeddah. The {{aircraft was}} ready for takeoff at 00:30 UTC, but during the engine start up procedure engine number 4 would not start. Engine number 4 was repaired and the flight took off at 13:48 UTC en route to Kano and was expected at Kano at 18:19 UTC. The captain was not warned about any classified or hazardous material aboard. The flight engineer sensed a strange odor in the cockpit at flight level 35 as the aircraft approached N'Djamena, at about 17:00 UTC. The rest of the crew as well as the ground engineer and the load-master confirmed the smell had persisted for a while. The two passengers traced to odor to pallet 11 and which appeared to be misty. After being handed a fire extinguisher the applied it to the pallet and when they returned they were breathing heavily. Afterwards the smoke <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure</b> was followed and the smell temporarily ceased. The flight was cleared to descend at 18:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards the master warning followed a minute later by a fire warning sounded. With smoke entering the cabin, the flight went into a descent of nearly 3000 feet per minute. Control of the pitch trims was lost. The flight engineer started a radio transmission to the airline at 1804:57 UTC that ended suddenly at 1805:04, the same time the cockpit voice recordings stopped. The two survivors both reported that the first explosion tripped the autopilot and the aircraft rocked sharply. The aircraft descended slowly in the grasses but rolled upon contact with the water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{emergency}} situation taking place inside a confined space, {{such as a}} building, is a challenging task due {{to the presence of}} dynamic conditions. Pervasive systems can prove beneficial for the <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure,</b> as they can provide directions to the evacuees regarding the best available exit. In this paper we describe two pervasive systems geared towards emergency support, which are deployed inside a building. Both systems use simple communications in order to collect and disseminate information regarding the best evacuation paths. We use a multi-agent simulation platform to demonstrate how the use of the systems improves the outcome of the <b>evacuation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Keywords-pervasive systems; emergency simulation; disaster management; building evacuation; opportunistic communications.
