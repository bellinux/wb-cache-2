50|$|A {{vectorscope}} uses an overlaid circular reference display, or graticule, for visualizing chrominance signals, {{which is}} the best method of referring to the QAM scheme used to encode color into a video signal. The actual visual pattern that the incoming chrominance signal draws on the vectorscope is called the trace. Chrominance is measured using two methods—color saturation, encoded as the amplitude, or gain, of the subcarrier signal, and hue, encoded as the subcarrier's phase. The vectorscope's graticule roughly represents saturation as distance {{from the center of the}} circle, and hue as the angle, in standard position, around it. The graticule is also embellished with several elements corresponding to the various components of the standard color bars video test signal, including boxes around the circles for the colors in the main bars, and perpendicular lines corresponding to the U and V components of the chrominance signal (and additionally on an NTSC vectorscope, the I and Q components). NTSC vectorscopes have one set of boxes for the color bars, while their PAL counterparts have two sets of boxes, because the R-Y chrominance component in PAL reverses in phase on alternating lines.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report the}} small-signal {{modulation}} {{characteristics of a}} monolithic dual resonator vertical cavity surface emitting laser. The modulation response is described by a system of rate equations with two independent carrier populations and a single longitudinal optical mode. The independent optical overlaps and <b>differential</b> <b>gains</b> of the two active regions can each be adjusted to maximize the output response. We show that under certain conditions, the composite resonator may achieve a higher bandwidth than a single cavity laser with the same photon density. We find the relaxation oscillation frequency to depend mainly on the total photon density and not the individual currents in the two cavities. With appropriate current injection, the composite resonator laser achieves a max-imum 3 -dB bandwidth of 12. 5 GHz and a maximum modulation current efficiency factor of approximately 5 GHz/ma 1 2.
