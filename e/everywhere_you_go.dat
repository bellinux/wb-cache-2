500|$|Critics have {{sometimes}} struggled {{to define the}} immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About <b>everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".|$|E

First was a batch of {{vermilion}} strips, with the mystic script, in big black letters: Houghton's Picture Palace, underneath which, quite small: Opens at Lumley on October 7th, at 6:30 P.M. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>went,</b> these vermilion and black bars sprang from the wall at you. Then there were other notices, in delicate pale-blue and pale red, like a genuine theatre notice, giving full programs.

60|$|We {{took a long}} {{afternoon}} walk, {{and soon}} found out that that exceedingly white town was built of blocks of white coral. Bermuda is a coral island, with a six-inch crust of soil on top of it, and every man has a quarry on his own premises. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> you see square recesses cut into the hillsides, with perpendicular walls unmarred by crack or crevice, and perhaps you fancy that a house {{grew out of the}} ground there, and has been removed in a single piece from the mold. If you do, you err. But the material for a house has been quarried there. They cut right down through the coral, to any depth that is convenient--ten to twenty feet--and take it out in great square blocks. This cutting is done with a chisel that has a handle twelve or fifteen feet long, and is used as one uses a crowbar when he is drilling a hole, or a dasher when he is churning. Thus soft is this stone. Then with a common handsaw they saw the great blocks into handsome, huge bricks that are two feet long, a foot wide, and about six inches thick. These stand loosely piled during a month to harden; then the work of building begins.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> in Italy, {{this truth}} is forced upon your {{attention}} {{even to the}} present day. Art here is no exotic. It smacks of the soil; it springs spontaneous, like a weed; it burgeons of itself out of {{the heart of the}} people. Not high art, understand well; not the art of Burne-Jones and Whistler and Puvis de Chavannes and Sar Peladan. Commonplace everyday art, that is a trade and a handicraft, like the joiner's or the shoemaker's. Look up at your ceiling; it's overrun with festoons of crude red and blue flowers, or it's covered with cupids and graces, or it bristles with arabesques and unmeaning phantasies. Every wall is painted; every grotto decorated. Sham landscapes, sham loggias, sham parapets are everywhere. The sham windows themselves are provided, not only with sham blinds and sham curtains, but even with sham coquettes making sham eyes or waving sham handkerchiefs at passers-by below them. Open-air fresco painting is still a living art, an art practised by hundreds and thousands of craftsmen, an art as alive as cookery or weaving. The Italian decorates everything; his pottery, his house, his church, his walls, his palaces. And the only difference he feels between the various cases is, that in some of them a higher type of art is demanded by wealth and skill than in the others. No wonder, therefore, he blossomed out at last into Michael Angelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel! ...|$|E

60|$|The {{roads were}} a wonder, and well they might be. Here was an island {{with only a}} handful of people in it--25,000--and yet such fine roads do not exist in the United States outside of Central Park. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> in any direction, you find either a hard, smooth, level thoroughfare, just {{sprinkled}} with black lava sand, and bordered with little gutters neatly paved with small smooth pebbles, or compactly paved ones like Broadway. They talk much of the Russ pavement in New York, and call it a new invention--yet here they have been using it in this remote little isle of the sea for two hundred years! Every street in Horta is handsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks, and the surface is neat and true as a floor--not marred by holes like Broadway. And every road is fenced in by tall, solid lava walls, which will last a thousand years in this land where frost is unknown. They are very thick, and are often plastered and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone. Trees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down, and contrast their bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and make them beautiful. The trees and vines stretch across these narrow roadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be riding through a tunnel. The pavements, the roads, and the bridges are all government work.|$|E

500|$|Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough {{said that}} Sellers [...] "had the genius {{comparable}} to Chaplin", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as [...] "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts {{he gave to}} the world. For them, he is assured of {{a place in the}} history of art as entertainment." [...] Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that [...] "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>went,</b> the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything". Director Blake Edwards thought that [...] "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said [...] "I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, [...] "Anything to avoid paying for dinner". Secombe later declared to journalists [...] "Bluebottle is deaded now". Milligan later said that [...] "it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time." [...] The Daily Mail described Sellers as [...] "the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness", a [...] "flawed genius" [...] who, once he latched on to a comic idea, [...] "loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes".|$|R

The charity appeal went on {{to become one of the}} longest-running in broadcasting and the most recognised in British radio. In 1976, Capital Radio, Thames Television, London Weekend Television and British Telecom launched the Capital Radio Helpline which helped listeners through matters ranging from how to cook a turkey at Christmas time to suicide intervention.
