On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E

500|$|In a hotel lobby, the {{concierge}} answers {{a phone call}} from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room– pausing to play the opening bars of the song [...] "Where Do You <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> (<b>My</b> Lovely)?" [...] by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system– and runs a bath.|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

Kunis said she tried her best to protect her and Culkin's privacy, noting that [...] "We don't talk about it to the press. It's already more high profile than I want it to be." [...] When {{asked if it was}} difficult {{to stay out of the}} tabloids and press, Kunis responded: [...] "I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can." [...] Asked if that is difficult she said, [...] "I don't care. I will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall.

500|$|He took a boat {{to inspect}} the {{destruction}} around Pudding Lane at close range and describes a [...] "lamentable" [...] fire, [...] "everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off; poor people staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them, and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by the water-side to another." [...] Pepys continued westward on the river to the court at Whitehall, [...] "where people come about me, and did give them an account dismayed them all, and word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell the King and Duke of Yorke what I saw, and that unless His Majesty did command houses to be pulled down nothing could stop the fire. They seemed much troubled, and the King commanded me to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Lord Mayor from him, and command him to spare no houses, but to pull down before the fire every way."

They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he [...] "will never be [...] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. [...] "Where Do You <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> (<b>My</b> Lovely)?"
