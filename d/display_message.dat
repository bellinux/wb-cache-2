This {{is one of the}} fastest systems to display any message on notice board almost immediately without any delay just by sending a SMS which is consistently good in quality than conventional way of pasting message on notice board. This proposed system can be used for consciousness in public place for any emergency conditions to avoid the possibility of suffering harm or injury. The results shows that only authenticated user can only <b>display</b> <b>message</b> on the notice board which proves the reliability of the proposed systems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new system for SMS {{information}} display board. The system will display texts and icons of {{a message on the}} matrix LED. To sending a message to the system, A user have to send a message SMS on a mobile phone. It's mean, the user can be anywhere in the range of mobile signal to control the message on the display board. Furthermore, the user is able to control the pattern, speed and time duration of the <b>display</b> <b>message.</b> In additional, the user can set the time of the message to display on the system in advance or cancel it. The system provide the security by using password method to verified the authorize user only. Finally the system can apply to variety of usage with a lot of concurrent users and message scheduling application...|$|E
40|$|Marshalling (LCM) {{library for}} message passing and data marshalling. The {{primary goal of}} LCM is to simplify the {{development}} of low-latency message passing systems, especially for real-time robotics research applications. Messages can be transmitted between different processes using LCM’s publish/subscribe message-passing system. A platform- and language-independent type specification language separates message description from implementation. Message specifications are automatically compiled into language-specific bindings, {{eliminating the need for}} users to implement marshalling code while guaranteeing run-time type safety. LCM is notable in providing a real-time deep traffic inspection tool that can decode and <b>display</b> <b>message</b> traffic with minimal user effort and no impact on overall system performance. This and other features emphasize LCM’s focus on simplifying both the development and debugging of message passing systems. In this paper, we explain the design of LCM, evaluate its performance, and describe its application to a number of autonomous land, underwater, and aerial robots. I...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{has announced}} its arrival on big {{stage and the}} world is going mobile. We want to control everything and without moving an inch. This remote control of appliances is possible through Embedded Systems. The use of “Embedded System in Communication” has given rise to many interesting applications that ensures comfort and safety to human life. The main aim of the project will be to design a SMS driven automatic display toolkit which can replace the currently used programmable electronic display. It is proposed to design receive cum display toolkit which can be programmed from an authorized mobile phone. The message to be displayed is sent through a SMS from an authorized transmitter. The toolkit receives the SMS, validates the sending Mobile Identification Number (MIN) and displays the desired information after necessary code conversion. The system is made efficient by using ‘clone’ SIMs of same MIN in a geographical area so that the same SMS can be received by number of display boards in a locality using techniques of time division multiple access. Started of as an instantaneous News display unit, we have improved upon it and tried {{to take advantage of the}} computing capabilities of microcontroller. We envision a toolkit that will not only <b>display</b> <b>message</b> but also can be used to do some mechanical work...|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} that snacks could cause problem in diet and bodyweight, makes this study interesting. Because this product, Fitbar, {{appears on the}} market as a healthy snack that is contrary to this assumption. This product is about to prove {{that there is a}} healthy and tasty snack as snacks. Marketing communications through advertising billboards with the media aims to reach the target market. Fitbar billboard ads convey the message content in the form of information about the attributes and benefits of products such as nutritional content and product slogans. This study uses path analysis techniques to determine the effect of variable X (advertisement message) to variable Y (brand awareness) and its implications on the variable Z (brand image). The results showed that the content of the message components such as message structure, message <b>display,</b> <b>message</b> format, and the source of the message have contributed in the formation of brand awareness, which further on has implications on brand image. Influence on brand awareness message content is equal to 0. 609. The effect of variable X (message) and Y (brand awareness) to variable Z (brand image) amounted to 0, 365. Therefore, the use of billboards media in conveying the message to the target market of Fitbar products is to build brand awareness and the implications for brand image.  </p...|$|E
