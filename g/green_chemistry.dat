40|$|Reduction {{of waste}} {{production}} in chemical processes {{is the idea}} of <b>greener</b> <b>chemistry</b> by using less toxic or benign methods and eliminating purification steps. Because of this, using a catalytic rather than stoichiometric method is much preferred. In this dissertation, 2 -quinoxalinol salen (salqu) copper(II) complexes are used in selective oxidation of alcohols and in C-H functionalization. The oxidation of propargylic alcohols was investigated using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. This catalytic system produced excellent yields (up to 99 %) of α,β-acetylenic carbonyl compounds {{from a wide variety of}} substrates within a short reaction time (1 h). This catalytic protocol can also be used with propargylic alcohols that contain alkyl groups in the α-position, which can be difficult to oxidize selectively using other available oxidation methods. Excellent selectivity was achieved for the oxidation of propargylic alcohols over that of isolated hydroxy groups, triple bonds or propargylic methylene groups.

40|$|Biocatalysis can {{be applied}} in organic {{synthetic}} chemistry to counter challenges posed by increased demands towards chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity, not forgetting the need for <b>greener</b> <b>chemistry.</b> During the last 30 years, biocatalysis {{with the use of}} enzymes as chiral catalysts has become more common in chemistry laboratories and industrial processes. In this thesis, the use of lipases as versatile biocatalysts in the acylation of alcohols is examined both in the light of literature examples and four original publications. In {{the first part of the}} work presented in this thesis lipases were utilized in two examples concerning secondary alcohols. First, the kinetic resolution of heterocyclic aromatic secondary alcohols through transesterification was thoroughly examined including the studies of competing hydrolysis and esterification reactions. In another example, lipases were utilized in the formation of a dynamic systemic resolution (DSR) process which in turn was used as a developmental tool in the optimization of the dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of five heterocyclic aromatic cyanohydrins in one pot for the preparation of cyanohydrin esters as single enantiomers. In the second part of the work, the regio- and stereoselectivity of lipases was used to form sugar conjugates of glyceric and β-amino acids. The primary hydroxyl groups of methyl α-D-galacto-, -gluco- and -mannopyranosides were now acylated trough lipasecatalyzed transesterification and enantioselective lipase-catalyzed ring-opening of β- lactams, respectively...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel real-time PCR assay to identify and perform preliminary genotyping of mycobacteria in a manner tailored to our local service. Within a single thermocycler run, mycobacterial 16 S rDNA and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis global lineage-defining RD 750 polymorphism are targeted in separate reaction tubes, each of which includes both TaqMan and SYBR <b>Green</b> <b>chemistries.</b> The results of this 16 S-RD assay differentiate M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and recognize whether or not MTBC isolates belong to the East African-Indian lineage, the single most frequently isolated global MTBC lineage in our service. If required, NTM amplicons may be sequenced to provide more specific identities. We report the technical performance of this assay on 88 mycobacteria-positive cultures and discuss its use in the initial management of mycobacterial infections. The 16 S-RD assay correctly identified all 70 MTBC-positive cultures and 17 NTM-positive cultures while contemporaneously recognizing 26 MTBC isolates as within and 44 outside the East African-Indian lineage. In artificial samples, the combined assay also showed limited potential to detect mixed mycobacterial infections (MTBC/NTM) and tuberculosis infections involving more than one global MTBC lineage. The approach we have established can be readily tailored to targets of particular value for any mycobacterial diagnostic service, thereby optimizing {{the value of the}} results for local clinical and public health management of mycobacterial infections. 1557...|$|R

40|$|Gas-expanded liquids (GXL) {{are a new}} and benign {{class of}} liquid {{solvents}} that are intermediate in physical properties between normal liquids and supercritical fluids and therefore may offer advantages in separations, reactions, and advanced materials. Phase-transfer catalysis (PTC) is a powerful tool in chemistry that facilitates interaction and reaction between two or more species present in immiscible phases and offers the ability to eliminate the use of frequently expensive, environmentally undesirable, and difficult to remove polar, aprotic solvents. The work presented here seeks to further characterize the transport properties of GXLs and apply these new solvents to PTC systems, which could result in both <b>greener</b> <b>chemistry</b> and improved process economics. The transport properties of GXL are characterized by the measurement of diffusivities by the Taylor-Aris dispersion method and calculation of solvent viscosity based on those measurements. The measurement of these bulk properties {{is part of a}} larger effort to probe the effect of changes in the local structure surrounding a solute on the solution behavior. The two technologies of PTC and GXL are combined when the distribution of a phase-transfer catalyst between GXL and aqueous phases is measured and compared to changes in the kinetics of a reaction performed in the same system. The results show that increased reaction rates and more efficient catalyst recovery are possible with GXL solvents. Ph. D.
