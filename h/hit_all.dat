5|$|The SuperSkills {{competition}} {{began with}} the Fastest Skater competition, where the competitors skated one lap around the rink. The winner of each round earned a point for their team. The opening round was skated backwards, followed by each team's rookie representative. Then two goaltenders skated off {{before returning to the}} traditional form. Following preliminary rounds the two fastest competitors from each team faced off in a final round, where Michael Grabner defeated Taylor Hall earning two points for Team Staal. The Breakaway Challenge featured six players (three from each team) taking four shoot-out attempts. Fans voted for the winner via text message. The winner earned four points for his team. Second place was awarded three points and third received one point. Alexander Ovechkin won by a wide margin defeating second place P. K. Subban by over 17 percentage points, it was the third consecutive win in the competition by Ovechkin. Loui Eriksson finished third to round out the point earners from the competition. The Shooting Accuracy featured two players shooting targets in the four corners of the net. Winners were determined by the fastest player to <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> four targets. Daniel Sedin <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> four targets on four shots in his first round setting the overall fastest time hitting them all in just 7.3 seconds. He followed that up by hitting four in five shots during the final round to defeat the Blackhawks' Patrick Kane.|$|E
5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{made his}} debut for the Hornets in the team's season opener against the Miami Heat on October 28, scoring 17 points {{off the bench}} in a 104–94 loss. On December 17, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 109–99 {{overtime}} win over the Toronto Raptors. On March 21, 2016, he scored 15 of his 29 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to help Charlotte rally from a 30–7 deficit in the second quarter for a 91–88 comeback victory over San Antonio, snapping the Spurs' six-game winning streak. Charlotte was the first team to score seven points or fewer in the opening quarter and come back to win since 2008. It was also the largest comeback surrendered by the Spurs in the Tim Duncan era, which began in 1997. Lin was 11-of-18 from the field and <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> four three-point attempts, including three in the fourth quarter, and provided the go-ahead jumper with 48 seconds left. Lin's first and only season with the Hornets came to an end after the Hornets were defeated by the Heat {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One stairwell in the South Tower, Stairwell A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 <b>hit,</b> <b>all</b> three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of the August 14, the barrage stopped for long enough for the French to {{resupply}} their batteries.

25|$|Not to {{be outdone}} by his wife, Lieutenant-Governor Franklin opened the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery a year later in October 1843. In 1844 he also founded the Royal Society of Tasmania, the first such Royal Society outside of the United Kingdom. The enlightened {{governorship}} of the Franklins brought much social and cultural improvement to Hobart Town, and culminated in the town's incorporation as a city in 1842. The town had grown from a defensive outpost into a penal settlement, and from there, into a prosperous trading port. Free settlers were outstripping the arrival of convicts, and soon the colonists were clamouring {{for an end to}} transportation, and greater self-representation. The Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science was first published in 1840; however economic depression <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> of the Australian colonies that year, and Hobart Town suffered badly in what was to be the beginning of the first of many economic downturns.|$|E

25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer in order {{to make sure that the}} digital raindrops <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to get shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E
25|$|The replay {{just under}} {{three weeks later}} {{was the first time}} an All-Ireland hurling decider was played on a Saturday. Clare emerged as champions {{for the first time since}} 1997 after {{defeating}} Cork by 5-16 to 3-16 in a classic at Croke Park. Shane O'Donnell, a late call-up to the starting line-up in place of Darach Honan, justified his inclusion with a stunning individual haul of 3-3, all from play. O'Donnell <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> three goals in the opening nineteen minutes of the first half and while Cork came from eight points down to draw level during the second half, the winners had a kick left in them as goals from Conor McGrath and sub Honan secured a fourth Liam MacCarthy Cup success for Clare. With 18 minutes left on the watch, the scores were level at 1-16 to 3-10 and they were deadlocked again with ten minutes left as Séamus Harnedy's goal brought Cork on terms, 2-16 to 3-13. But Clare’s response was magnificent as McGrath crashed home a magnificent 62nd-minute goal into the top corner of the Davin Stand netting. Clare pushed six points clear, 4-16 to 2-16, before Stephen Moylan’s stoppage time goal for Cork brought a spellbound Croke Park to life once more. But in the second minute of stoppage time, Honan cut in from the left touchline and somehow managed to bundle the ball over the line for the eighth goal of a quite incredible spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Christiansen was re{{selected}} {{ahead of}} the 2014–15 season, the whole team being reselected. In September, Christiansen competed at the Norwegian Summer Championships in Steinkjer. There, he came sixth in both the sprint and the pursuit. At the season start races at Sjusjøen, Vetle came third in the sprint, but came 17th in the mass start. He was selected for the mixed relay and individual in Östersund, with a chance of getting the last place in the sprint. In the mixed relay, Christiansen again helped the Norwegians to a second-place finish. In the individual, he finished a disappointing 53rd, but was still given the last spot in the sprint due to Lars Helge Birkeland finishing 84th. In the sprint, Christiansen finished 45th despite missing only once, but he climbed thirty places in the pursuit by being {{the only one to}} <b>hit</b> <b>all</b> twenty targets, and finished 15th. Christiansen's results in Östersund were below expectations and he was not selected for {{the second round of the}} World Cup. He returned in the last round before the Christmas break, and delivered better results by finishing 30th in the sprint and 39th in the pursuit. However, he was not selected for the World Cups in Oberhof and Ruhpolding, but after both Tarjei Bø and Emil Hegle Svendsen fell ill, he was needed for the relay and sprint in Oberhof. He took the first leg in the relay, changing in fourth place. The rest of the team, Alexander Os, Johannes Thingnes Bø and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, gained the lead, but victory was snatched in a sprint finish with Anton Shipulin, and so the Norwegians finished second. Christiansen finished 67th in the sprint and decided to return to Norway for a medical examination, having been feeling tired for some time. It was revealed that he had been affected in some way by the Rhinovirus, but he remained unable to compete and train properly for the next six months.|$|E
