40|$|A convex quadrilateral, $Q$, {{is called}} a {{midpoint}} diagonal quadrilateral if the intersection point of the diagonals of $Q$ coincides with the midpoint {{of at least one}} of the diagonals of $Q$. A parallelogram, P, is a special case of a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral since the diagonals of P bisect one another. We prove two results about ellipses inscribed in midpoint diagonal quadrilaterals, which generalize properties of ellipses inscribed in parallelograms involving convex quadrilaterals. First, $Q$ is a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral if and only if each ellipse inscribed in $Q$ has tangency chords which are parallel to one of the diagonals of $Q$. Second, $Q$ is a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral if and only if each ellipse inscribed in $Q$ has a pair of <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameters</b> parallel to the diagonals of $Q$. Finally, we show that there is a unique ellipse, $E_I$, of minimal eccentricity incribed in a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral, $Q$, and we show that the equal <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameters</b> of $E_I$ are parallel to the diagonals of $Q$. Comment: We incorporated an earlier paper (arXiv: 1607. 02086) into this paper. The main result in arXiv: 1607. 02086 was replaced by a stronger result: the equal <b>conjugate</b> <b>diameters</b> of the unique ellipse of minimal eccentricity incribed in a midpoint diagonal quadrilateral, $Q$, are parallel to the diagonals of $Q$.

50|$|For an ellipse, the {{standard}} terminology is different. A diameter of an ellipse is any chord {{passing through the}} center of the ellipse.

The longest diameter is called the major axis.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, Book VIII principally treats mechanics, the {{properties}} of the center of gravity, and some mechanical powers. Interspersed are some propositions on pure geometry.
