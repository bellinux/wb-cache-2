Mary's charitable works, for example, are not a passing fad: they are a heartfelt reaction to social injustice. Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> sexual desire rather than sublimating it.|$|E

Mary's marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty, was already decided before her first birthday.

This inspires her to follow her father's advice, and give a passionate public statement about the necessity of a politically independent scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{served as}} a nurse in Port Royal, {{preparing}} remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery. She rendered assistance to men with smallpox; {{that she did not}} contract the disease herself started more rumors that she was blessed by God. At first, she received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought she was getting special treatment. To ease the tension, she gave up <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.|$|E

The story of Artemisia formed an iconography for Catherine and reinforced <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> serve as regent.

5|$|After {{the death}} of King Edward VI on 6July 1553, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who had led the young King's {{government}} {{for the last three}} and a half years, tried to install his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey on the English throne; she was the King's Protestant cousin to whom Edward had willed the Crown, bypassing his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. When Mary Tudor asserted <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the throne, an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable. Northumberland marched on 14July, accompanied by his eldest sons, John and Ambrose. Five days later the Privy Council changed sides; on hearing this on 20July, Northumberland, who had been staying at Cambridge, gave up and was arrested with his party the next day.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the throne.|$|E

5|$|Save Our Children, Inc. was a {{political}} coalition formed in 1977 in Miami, Florida to overturn a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation. The coalition was publicly headed by celebrity singer Anita Bryant, who claimed the ordinance discriminated against <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> teach her children biblical morality. It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between unprepared gay activists and highly motivated Christian fundamentalists. When {{the repeal of the}} ordinance went to a vote, it attracted the largest response of any special election in Dade County's history, passing by 70%. In response to this vote, a group of gay and lesbian community members formed Pride South Florida, now known as Pride Fort Lauderdale, an organization whose mission was to fight for the rights of the gay and lesbian community in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{and four}} others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973, {{on charges of}} {{attempting}} to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in an ambush in St. Albans, Queens on January 28, 1973. On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges. On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed an extradition order to move Shakur to New York to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, and possession of dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to waive <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> an extradition hearing, {{and asked for a}} full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E.

5|$|The {{courts in}} Malaysia {{have taken a}} similar {{approach}} in defining the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices. In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia (1992), the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant's face while on duty. According to the appellant, this contravened <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the purdah was part of her religious practice as a Muslim. However, the court disagreed and held that the purdah was not considered a religious practice as {{it was not a}} requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran.|$|E

5|$|The detainee {{is also to}} be {{informed}} within 14 days of his or <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> make representations against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{generated}} several controversies {{related to its}} violence and depiction of women. A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste. The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups. The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women, particularly {{in the wake of}} backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit when she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review. After Petit's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely negative comments, many journalists defended <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> an opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses. Their lawsuits were later dismissed. Australian department store Target pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition against depictions of violence towards women in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
