A special element structure with three layers (shell/volume/shell) has been used to model the laminated glass windscreen. A fracture criterion for brittle fracture based on the maximum principal stress (I  c) was applied to model the fracture behaviour of glass. The PVB interlayer was modelled with both a linear elastic and a hyperelastic material law without damage. The critical fracture stress of glass was determined by fitting the failure force measured from static bending tests on laminated glass windscreens. The transferability of the fracture criterion and the corresponding parameter was checked by simulating two different loading cases of the component tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Quality {{inspection}} plays a {{key role}} in the food industry. Besides metal detection finding small stones and <b>glass</b> <b>splinters</b> is of great importance. Furthermore, already established devices like conventional metal detectors offer only a low spatial resolution. In contrast to this method a rather novel technique is terahertz timedomain spectroscopy (THz TDS). The experimental set-up to simulate THz TDS consists of a standard free space THz spectrometer with photoconductive emitter and detector antennas driven by a femtosecond laser source. 2 D images are obtained by scanning the samples perpendicular to the THz beam. We show 2 D THz images that reveal contaminations like a metal screw, a small stone and a glass splitter with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. We go on to propose a measurement technique that allows for faster scanning times compared to the conventional technique. Since THz waves can penetrate different kinds of foods which are opaque in the visible spectrum, THz TDS promises to be a powerful tool in quality monitoring especially for the detection of non-metallic contaminations...|$|R

40|$|For {{laminated}} glass, the adherent {{properties of}} an interlayer {{reduce the risk}} of airborne <b>glass</b> <b>splinters</b> in case of blast loading. In this thesis, experimental and numerical studies were performed to investigate the mechanical properties of laminated glass exposed to blast loading. The experimental part consisted of five different experiments. Bend and tensions experiments were performed to investigate mechanical properties of glass, interlayer, and laminated components under quasi-static loading. While a compressed gas gun and free field explosions were used to study the behavior of pure and laminated glass under dynamic pressure loading. For the numerical study, finite element models were built to predict the response of the experimental tests. Stochastic initial damage distribution and node splitting was defined for the glass material. In the blast model, node splitting was also introduced in the interlayer to enable plastic deformation. Delamination between glass and interlayer was seen in quasi-static experiments, but could not be detected in dynamically loaded panes. For the case of 3 -point bend loading of laminated glass, good correlation was found between numerical predictions and experimental observations. Enabling plastic deformation of the interlayer seems to be vital to predict a reasonable response of laminated glass under blast loading.
