5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the scope of review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a <b>jurisdictional</b> or precedent fact is involved. Where no <b>jurisdictional</b> fact is involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a <b>jurisdictional</b> fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any <b>jurisdictional</b> fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
5|$|Although London {{has many}} ties to Middlesex County, it {{is a totally}} {{separate}} entity; the two have no <b>jurisdictional</b> overlap. The exception is the Middlesex County courthouse and former jail, as the judiciary is administered directly by the province.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the <b>jurisdictional</b> and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between <b>jurisdictional</b> and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jurisdictional</b> {{areas for}} District Attorneys {{are created by}} state law and while some follow {{traditional}} county boundaries, names and geographic areas covered are often different.|$|E
5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the <b>jurisdictional</b> {{requirement}} of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E
5|$|NMFS then {{reversed}} {{itself and}} declared that there was sufficient, credible information to declare that Aliso Creek had been steelhead habitat and {{was added to the}} Distinct Population Segment List under the <b>jurisdictional</b> domain of NOAA. It is now considered a candidate for re-colonization.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-seven Native American {{tribes are}} {{represented}} in Oklahoma, including 39 federally recognized tribes, who are headquartered and have tribal <b>jurisdictional</b> areas in the state. Western ranchers, Native American tribes, Southern settlers, and eastern oil barons have shaped the state's cultural predisposition, and its largest cities have been named among the most underrated cultural destinations in the United States.|$|E
5|$|This {{provided}} {{a connection between}} Michigan's M-3 and Ontario's Highway3 until 2001, when <b>jurisdictional</b> changes within downtown Detroit created a discontinuous segment of M-3, and this international Route3 connection was lost when the portion of M-3 along Fort Street was redesignated M-85.|$|E
5|$|According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, {{duties and}} {{jurisdiction}} of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of <b>Jurisdictional</b> Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a <b>jurisdictional,</b> or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|In 1508, the Caribbean {{coast of}} Honduras was superficially {{explored}} by Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez, but {{the focus of}} their expeditions lay further to the north. In the 1510s, expeditions from the Spanish settlements on Cuba and Hispaniola reported that the Bay Islands were inhabited. The first efforts to conquer Honduras were launched from several {{different areas of the}} Spanish Indies, including Hispaniola, Mexico, and Panama. This resulted in <b>jurisdictional</b> disputes over the territory that delayed the progress of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|On 6 February 2006, on ABC's Good Morning America, Van der Sloot's parents {{stated that}} {{their son was}} unfairly singled out and that the {{investigation}} left them devastated. Later that month, while Van der Sloot and his father were in New York City {{for an interview with}} ABC's Primetime, they were served with a lawsuit filed by Natalee's parents, Beth and Dave Holloway, alleging personal injury; the case was dismissed on <b>jurisdictional</b> grounds that August.|$|E
5|$|Pedrarias {{travelled}} from Panama {{to take up}} {{his command}} of Nicaragua, and was greeted everywhere as the rightful governor. López de Salcedo attempted to leave the province and return to Honduras but was prevented by his rival's supporters. Pedrarias arrested López de Salcedo in March 1528 and forced him to relinquish some of his territory, although the Spanish monarch later rejected the settlement. Pedrarias kept López de Salcedo prisoner for almost a year. He released him after coming to an agreement with mediators, in which the <b>jurisdictional</b> limits of Honduras were defined by the Caribbean coast extending from Puerto de Caballos {{in the west to}} Cabo Gracias a Dios in the east and extending inland {{in the form of a}} triangle. This agreement effectively settled all <b>jurisdictional</b> disputes with Nicaragua; border disputes with Guatemala remained a problem. López de Salcedo returned to Honduras early in 1529 as a broken man; he was unable to settle the dispute between Méndez de Hinostrosa and Vasco de Herrera, and was held in contempt by many residents of Trujillo. In order to reestablish his reputation, he organised a large expedition to settle the Naco valley, where gold had been discovered. López de Salcedo, weakened by his ordeals, did not live to lead the expedition; he died early in 1530.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version of M-179 {{was established in}} 1935 as a shortcut near Le Roy between US131 and what was M-63. That route was turned back to local control in late 1958 or 1959, and the designation disappeared from the system. (The original M-63 itself was decommissioned {{a few years later}} in 1961.) On October 1, 1998, as part of the Rationalization process, a <b>jurisdictional</b> transfer turned county road A-42 between US131 and M-43 over to the state, which the state later designated as M-179 for the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} All-American Councils {{is set at}} three years, {{although}} {{this is not always}} the case. The first thirteen Councils (held from 1907–1970) are referred to as All-American Sobors, reflecting the American Church's <b>jurisdictional</b> ties to the Russian Orthodox Church. The fourteenth Sobor (held in 1970) is jointly known as the 1st All-American Council, reflecting the autocephalous status of the OCA. The most recent All-American Council (18th) was held in July 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{statutes}} {{differ in}} their <b>jurisdictional</b> elements, the mens rea that they require (for example, {{a quid pro quo}} or a nexus), the species of official actions that are cognizable, whether or not non-public official defendants can be prosecuted, and in the authorized sentence. The statutes most often used to prosecute public corruption are the Hobbs Act, Travel Act, RICO, the program bribery statute, and mail and wire fraud statutes.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the first}} sub-heading, a public {{authority}} {{will be considered}} as having acted illegally {{if there is no}} legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made (simple ultra vires), or, more specifically, if the authority has made an error concerning a <b>jurisdictional</b> or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts that must objectively exist, or in the presence of facts that must not exist, before it has the power to act or decide.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} to Panama, {{governor}} of Panama Pedro Arias Dávila (better known {{by the name of}} Pedrarias Dávila) decided to claim the territory they had explored. While Gil González Dávila was in Santo Domingo organising a new expedition to Central America, Pedrarias Dávila sent Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to establish his jurisdiction over the region. Spanish settlement in Nicaragua was concentrated along the Pacific coast, and Honduras was seen as a better route to the Caribbean and Spain rather than an inland route across Nicaragua itself. This provoked <b>jurisdictional</b> clashes between the two provinces.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, the utility of the Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, <b>jurisdictional</b> squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} <b>jurisdictional</b> facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed <b>jurisdictional</b> errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|In March 1524, Gil González Dávila {{became the}} first Spaniard to arrive {{in what is now}} Honduras with the {{intention}} of conquest. He founded the first Spanish port upon the Caribbean coast, Puerto de Caballos, which became an important staging post for later expeditions. The early decades of the Spanish conquest of Honduras were beset by <b>jurisdictional</b> disputes between different Spanish colonies attempting to invade the territory, which resulted in conflict between rival expeditions launched from Mexico, Hispaniola, and Panama. The Spanish territory was reorganised as Higueras in the west, and Honduras in the east. As the Spanish became established throughout Central America, the colony of Honduras-Higueras became involved in territorial disputes with neighbouring colonies in Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{clashed with}} Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York, over the {{respective}} {{rights of the}} two sees throughout his time as archbishop. In 1175, at a council held in London, there was a fight between their supporters. King Henry II managed to secure a truce for five years between the two archbishops but Richard was soon embroiled in another dispute. This one was with Roger, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury and revolved around {{whether or not the}} abbey depended directly on the pope or if the archbishop had <b>jurisdictional</b> rights over the abbey. In the end, the papacy arranged a settlement that left the abbey dependent on the pope direct, but gave the archbishop spiritual authority over the churches of the Isle of Thanet, which had previously been held by the abbey.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original <b>jurisdictional</b> matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|The first {{settlement}} {{formed in}} the Iron Age where a prehistoric track crossed the River Slea. It was a tribal centre and home to a mint for the Corieltauvi in the 1st centuries BC and AD. Evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement has been uncovered, and by the late Saxon period the town was an economic and <b>jurisdictional</b> centre with a court and market. In the medieval period, records differentiate between Old and New Sleaford, the latter emerging in the areas around the present day market place and St Denys' Church. Sleaford Castle was constructed in the 12th century for the Bishops of Lincoln, who owned the manor. Granted the right to hold a market in the mid-12th century, New Sleaford developed into a market town and became locally important in the wool trade, while Old Sleaford declined.|$|E
5|$|When Richard died on 6 April 1199, the {{archbishop}} invested Richard's youngest brother John as duke of Normandy on 25 April 1199. At the ceremony, John pledged {{to protect the}} Norman church, and soon afterwards confirmed the grant of Dieppe and the other manors to the archdiocese. John contested the right of {{the archbishop}} to some <b>jurisdictional</b> rights however, as well as forest rights, forcing Coutances to pay 2,100 Angevin pounds to secure most of the contested rights. In May 1200, Coutances was involved in the peace treaty of Le Goulet between King John and King Philip of France, but took no active part in the Angevin defence of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Boxing was {{introduced}} and practiced in a clandestine manner in Puerto Rico while the archipelago {{was still a}} Spanish colony. Fights were organized in haciendas among the workers of the sugar and coffee plantations, and the objective {{was to determine the}} best fighter among the employees. Following the culmination of the Puerto Rican Campaign and Spanish–American War, American soldiers who were stationed in the main island practiced the sport. During World War I, a championship known as Campeonato Las Casas was held as training for military personnel. Nero Chen, the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain recognition, began his career in these tournaments. The Combat Maneuver Training Center followed this example and organized boxing activities, which they named Los Campeones del Campamento. These were received with enthusiasm by the young recruits. Most of these events were celebrated without restriction due to military <b>jurisdictional</b> limits, although prohibitions were put in place for the civilian population. Illegal matches were organized on the rooftops of residences in Old San Juan, empty terrain's in El Condado and in hippodromes.|$|E
5|$|In 1529, El Salvador became {{embroiled in}} a <b>jurisdictional</b> dispute with {{neighbouring}} Nicaragua. Pedrarias Dávila sent Martín de Estete {{at the head of}} an expedition to annex the territory to Nicaragua. Estete captured the leader of a rival Spanish expedition in eastern El Salvador, and marched on San Salvador, before being repulsed by a relief force sent from Guatemala. In 1530, Pedro de Alvarado ordered the establishment of a new settlement at San Miguel, in the east of the country, to protect against further incursions from Nicaragua, and to assist in the conquest of the surrounding area. Indigenous uprisings against the invaders continued, spreading from neighbouring Honduras. The general uprising across the two provinces was put down by the end of 1538, and by 1539 the province was considered pacified. The conquistadores discovered that there was little gold or silver to be found in El Salvador, and it became a colonial backwater with a small Spanish population, within the jurisdiction of the Captaincy General of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the <b>jurisdictional</b> system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the <b>jurisdictional</b> issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a <b>jurisdictional</b> or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various <b>jurisdictional</b> elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
5|$|The {{postwar period}} saw {{considerable}} deflation; {{the shortage of}} labor and materials during the war had led to much higher wages and prices, and in the postwar economic readjustment, wages were cut heavily. In Chicago, employers in the building trades attempted a 20%wage cut; when this {{was rejected by the}} unions, a lockout followed. Both sides agreed to submit the matter to a neutral arbitrator, and settled on Landis, who agreed to take the case in June 1921. By this time, Landis was Commissioner of Baseball, and still a federal judge. In September, Landis issued his report, cutting wages by an average of 12.5%. To improve productivity, he also struck restrictions on machinery which saved labor, established a standardized overtime rate, and resolved <b>jurisdictional</b> conflicts between unions. The labor organizations were not completely satisfied, but Landis's reforms were adopted in many places across the country and were credited with reviving the building industry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jurisdictional</b> facts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jurisdictional</b> {{disputes}} between unions became {{more frequent and}} intractable over time, occupying much of {{the attention of the}} American Federation of Labor (AFL). Nearly 95 percent of all strikes from 1897 to 1914 were <b>jurisdictional</b> strikes. Increasingly, the debate involved a growing battle over craft versus industrial unionism.|$|E
