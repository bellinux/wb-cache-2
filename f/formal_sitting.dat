50|$|Bernini's {{approach}} to portraiture was unique in several respects. Unlike other artists {{of his time}} that relied primarily on subject sittings—an approach that often produced stiff and overly-formal results—Bernini preferred to observe his subjects in their daily work and activities {{over a period of}} time, making numerous sketches that captured their features, characteristic poses, and natural expressions. He used these sketches to build preliminary models using moist clay. Using those models, Bernini would then begin the marble portrait of the subject. It was only toward the end of this process of carving the marble portrait that he would bring in the subject for <b>formal</b> <b>sittings.</b> This approach also accommodated the time constraints of his preoccupied clientele.|$|R

50|$|Beechmoor has {{remained}} under {{the ownership of}} Colonel Laban T. Moore's descendants since 1868. It is still a grand residence, with a library featuring over 2,000 works of literature, a music parlor, a <b>formal</b> <b>sitting</b> parlor, a formal dining room, and four bedrooms upstairs in the main house. Several 64 in wood logs of virgin timber hold the 42 ft house up from its natural stone cellar. The Catlett House portion is not recognizable as a log cabin, the logs have been covered over with wood siding. The last full-time resident of the Catlett House/Beechmoor home was Rebecca Patton, Colonel Laban T. Moore's granddaughter. She died in 1986, well over 90 years of age. Before her death, she dedicated herself {{to the preservation of}} her beloved lifelong home. Since her 1986 death the home has been maintained with proceeds from a trust fund she created before her death and the rental income from seven houses on the estate. The first portico was replaced with a second larger portico. It has since been removed, and the original green wood swinging shutters have also been removed. An effort to restore the estate has been underway by Col. Moore's present-day descendants recently, with exterior painting completed in June 2014.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Jarvis {{designed}} {{his home}} in the picturesque Italianate style, which dominated American houses constructed between 1850 and 1880, particularly in the towns and cities of the Midwest. The house is significant and distinctive by its outstanding state of preservation and architectural integrity, and by its being the only remaining example in the local community of the asymmetrical, compound-plan subtype. The two-story house has a projecting mass {{on one side of the}} front facade and a porch on the other. A polygonal window bay protrudes from the first floor of the projecting mass. All of the house's windows are sash windows, constructed of sugar pine, and topped by pediment hoods. The house's cross gabled roof features overhanging eaves and a cornice decorated with large, ornately scrolled eave brackets with turned finials.The entryway of the home features a curving staircase, with a large, octagonal carved walnut newel post at the base, turned spindles, and scrolled stair brackets. The handrail is constructed of seven pieces of solid, hand-carved walnut, each individually numbered and butt-joined together. The first floor features marble fireplaces in the Italianate style in the front and main parlors, and a brick fireplace in the <b>formal</b> <b>sitting</b> room. The two main doors are solid wood with oval, beveled glass cutouts, in the Victorian style. All doors have transom windows above. A narrow stairway to the former maid’s quarters on the second floor is concealed within an interior wall. The unique floor in the formal dining room consists of alternating slats of oak and walnut. Light fixtures throughout much of the house are the original gas futures which were subsequently converted to electric.Soon after construction, Jarvis made alterations to the house in the interest of gaining living space for his growing family. None of these alterations changed the fundamental structure and, as owner of Troy’s lumber yard, his unencumbered access to fine construction materials enabled his ability to accomplish structural alterations with matching materials and little impact. Subsequent owners added an approximately 20 foot addition to the rear of the home and a detached garage, both of which are complimentary to the original structure.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tribunal}} sat for 76 days - {{the longest}} inquiry of its type in British history {{up to that}} time - interviewing 136 witnesses, examining 300 exhibits and hearing 2,500,000 words of testimony, which ranged from the history of mining in the area to the region's geological conditions. The tribunal report thought [...] "much of the time of the Tribunal could have been saved if ... the National Coal Board had not stubbornly resisted every attempt to lay the blame where it so clearly must rest — at their door" [...] Not until day 49 had an NCB witness conceded that that tip safety arrangements had been inadequate; not until day 65 had one conceded that (contrary to the assertions of Lord Robens) the instability of Tip 7 could clearly have been foreseen, and that this had been known within the NCB [...] "even before the <b>formal</b> <b>sittings</b> of the inquiry had started" [...] (italicised in original). [...] Robens was then invited to testify (effectively to explain NCB failure to publicly correct his statements once they were known to be erroneous). He said that he had known before the inquiry started that the tip instability was foreseeable, but during cross-examination he [...] "gave inconsistent answers": invited by NCB counsel to disregard Robens' evidence the tribunal did so. The tribunal retired on 28 April 1967 to consider its verdict, publishing its report on 3 August.|$|R

50|$|The cover art for Shadows in the Night {{presents}} {{images and}} {{a design that}} evoke the early 1960s. The front cover incorporates a photo of Dylan in a thoughtful pose in formal attire, presented in shadow behind a vertical-bar design that emulates the cover of jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's 1962 Blue Note album Hub-Tones. The back cover photo shows Dylan and a masked woman, both in <b>formal</b> wear, <b>sitting</b> at a small nightclub table looking at a seven-inch Sun Records single.
