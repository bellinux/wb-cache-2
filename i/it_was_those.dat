[...] The Tunku considered Lee too extremist in his views, while other UMNO politicians thought Lee was simply pandering to Malaysian Chinese with his rhetoric. Lee's statement about allegedly recent Malay migration met with stinging rebuttals; Albar declared: [...] "To say that the Malays are in the same category as other races is an insult..." [...] The UMNO newspaper Malaya Merdeka warned: [...] "If the Malays are hard-pressed and their interests are not protected," [...] they would merge Malaysia with Indonesia. It was this that the Tunku feared the most.

500|$|The first {{definite}} {{mention of}} cricket in Sussex was in 1611 and relates to ecclesiastical court records stating that two parishioners of Sidlesham, now in West Sussex, {{had failed to}} attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 pence each and made to do penance, which meant confessing their guilt to the whole church congregation the following Sunday. The case {{is the first of}} several 17th century cricket references, until the Restoration in 1660, arising from Puritan disapproval of recreational activity, especially on Sundays. These references indicate that inter-parish matches were being played but there is nothing to suggest that any teams representative of counties were formed before the Restoration. There is no evidence of large scale gambling or patronage prior to the English Civil War and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>those</b> factors which drove the formation of [...] "representative" [...] teams in the 18th century. It must be concluded, therefore, that the cricket being played before the war was of minor standard only: i.e., village cricket.|$|E

500|$|Weber {{ended his}} {{research}} {{of society and}} religion in India by bringing in insights from [...] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems. He notes that the beliefs saw {{the meaning of life}} as otherworldly mystical experience. The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a prophet or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic. In Asia, there was no Messianic prophecy to give plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike. Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (also called ethical prophecies), notably from the Near East region to the exemplary prophecies found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>those</b> differences that prevented the countries of the Occident from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, Ancient Judaism was an attempt to prove this theory.|$|E
500|$|Now {{two years}} since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the {{attention}} of the three-piece production team The Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: [...] "Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?" [...] According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained [...] "a Faith Hill kind of vibe". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, [...] "we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go". The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>those</b> kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into [...] "Complicated" [...] and another song called [...] "Falling Down" [...] (Falling Down appears on the Sweet Home Alabama Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese liberals such as Hu Shi often {{condemned}} the Boxers for their irrationality and barbarity. Chinese nationalists initially disdained {{them for their}} superstition and xenophobia. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China and of the Nationalist Party at first believed that the Boxer Movement was stirred up by the Qing government's rumors, which [...] "caused confusion among the populace", and delivered [...] "scathing criticism" [...] of the Boxers' [...] "anti-foreignism and obscurantism". Sun praised the Boxers for their [...] "spirit of resistance" [...] but called them [...] "bandits". Students shared an ambivalent attitude to the Boxers, stating that while the uprising originated from the [...] "ignorant and stubborn people of the interior areas", their beliefs were [...] "brave and righteous", and could [...] "be transformed into a moving force for independence". After {{the fall of the}} Qing dynasty in 1911, nationalist Chinese became more sympathetic to the Boxers. In 1918 Sun praised their fighting spirit and said the Boxers were courageous and fearless, fighting to the death against the Alliance armies, specifically the Battle of Yangcun. The leader of the New Culture Movement, Chen Duxiu, forgave the [...] "barbarism of the Boxer... given the crime foreigners committed in China", and contended that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>those</b> [...] "subservient to the foreigners" [...] that truly [...] "deserved our resentment".|$|E
2500|$|In 900, {{by which}} time Emperor Xizong's brother Emperor Zhaozong was emperor, Pei Zhi was made Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the {{legislative}} bureau; he was also made a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). [...] He was also soon given the additional post of minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu). [...] At one point, Emperor Zhaozong suspected that Pei, despite a stern appearance, was actually sexually immoral, and asked the trusted imperial scholar Han Wo for his opinion. [...] Han {{pointed out that the}} reason why rumors of immorality may have developed against Pei was that Pei was friendly to his clan members and allowed many of them to live in his mansion, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>those</b> people's associations with other people that caused rumors to taint Pei — and, in stating so, Han also referred to Pei Zhi as a nephew of Pei Tan's, knowing that since Pei Tan served Emperor Zhaozong's and Emperor Xizong's father Emperor Yizong, Emperor Zhaozong would be touched by that reference. [...] Emperor Zhaozong thereafter took no action against Pei Zhi. [...] In 901, when Emperor Zhaozong was forcibly seized by the powerful eunuchs led by Han Quanhui and taken to Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then ruled by the eunuchs' ally, the warlord Li Maozhen, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Pei as the defender of Daming Palace (大明宮).|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} the mirrors {{of the women}} who [...] "performed tasks" [...] ( [...] , ha-tzovot) at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting in [...] The Midrash told that when the Israelites were suffering hard labor in Egypt, Pharaoh decreed that they should not sleep at home or have sexual relations with their wives. Rabbi Shimon ben Halafta told that the Israelite women would go down to draw water from the river, whereupon God caused them to draw up small fish in their pitchers. The Israelite women would sell some of the fish, cook some of them, buy wine with the proceeds, and go out to the work fields to feed their husbands. After they had eaten, the Israelite women took their mirrors and looked into them together with their husbands. The wives would say that they were better looking than the husbands. The husbands would say that they were better looking. And in this way, they aroused their sexual desire and became fruitful and multiplied, as [...] reports, [...] "And the children of Israel were fruitful and swarmed and multiplied and became exceedingly mighty." [...] It was through the use of these mirrors that the Israelites were able to continue to have children even under the demands of harsh labor. When God told Moses to make the Tabernacle, all of the men came to contribute. Some brought silver, some brought gold or brass, onyx, and other gems to be set. They readily brought everything. The women brought the mirrors and presented them to Moses. When Moses saw the mirrors, he was furious with the women, saying that whoever brought the mirrors should be punished, asking what possible use they could have in the Tabernacle. God told Moses not to look down on them, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>those</b> mirrors that raised up all of the hosts of children born in Egypt. God thus directed Moses to take them and make from them the washbasin and its base for the priests.|$|E
