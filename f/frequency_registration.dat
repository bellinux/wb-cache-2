40|$|The orbital {{velocity}} of a spacecraft and other celestial objects is monitored by observing the Doppler frequency {{shift of the}} signals received at the ground station. This is possible one-way in case the transmitted frequency is stable enough. In most spacecraft a calibrated transponder allows two-way Doppler <b>frequency</b> <b>registrations.</b> In general, the factor 2 is expected as the quotient between two- and one-way frequencies. However, {{this is no longer}} the case when the motion of the observed object deviates from the orbit as predicted. Frequency differences appear. Porsche (1999) has published a formula to describe these differences based on the assumption of a double projection of the true velocity vector. In the present paper a more sophisticated analysis of the influence of state errors on the track-ing results is deduced. This theory has been tested by the Doppler measurements during flybys of the comet space probe GIOTTO penetrating through the comae of the comets P/Halley and P/Grigg-Skjellerup.

DESIGN: At baseline, 7, 000 lapsed donors were randomized to 1 of 6 experimental conditions or to a control condition. Participants in the experimental conditions {{were asked to complete}} a 6 -item postal questionnaire assessing intentions only, interrogative intention, moral norm plus intention, anticipated regret plus intention, positive self-image plus intention, or implementation intentions. OBJECTIVE measures of behavior were obtained 6 and 15 months later. The <b>frequency</b> of <b>registrations</b> to give blood over the next 6 and 15 months was measured. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis of the <b>frequency</b> of <b>registrations</b> (GENMOD procedure, Poisson distribution) indicated main effects for condition (experimental vs. control) at both 6 months, χ²(1) = 4. 64, p <. 05, and 15 months, χ²(1) = 5. 88, p <. 05. Positive self-image and implementation intention interventions outperformed the control condition at 6 months. At 15 months, standard intention, interrogative intention, and regret plus intention conditions showed more frequent registrations compared with control and were just as effective as implementation intention formation. Moderation analysis showed that the moral norm and positive self-image conditions were significant for first-time (1 previous donation) but not repeat (2 or more previous donations) donors.

40|$|NASARC was {{developed}} from the general planning principles and decisions of both sessions of the World Administrative Radio Conference on the Use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit and on the Planning of Space Services Utilizing It (WARC- 85, WARC- 88). NASARC was written to help countries satisfy requirements for nation-wide Fixed Satellite services from at least one orbital position within a predetermined arc. The NASARC-generated predetermined arcs are each based on a common arc segment visible {{to a group of}} compatible service areas, and provide a means of generating a highly flexible allotment plan with a reduced need for coordination among administrations. The selection of particular groupings of service areas and their associated predetermined arcs is made according to a heuristic approach using several figures of merit designed to confront the most difficult allotment problems. NASARC attempts to select groupings and predetermined arc sizes so that the requirements of all administrations are met before the available orbital arc is exhausted. The predetermined arcs allow considerable freedom of choice in the positioning of space stations for all members of any grouping. The approach to allotment planning for which NASARC was designed consists of two phases. The first is the use of NASARC to identify predetermined arc segments common to groups of administrations. Those administrations within a group and sharing a common predetermined arc segment would be able to position their individual space stations at any {{one of a number of}} orbital positions within the predetermined arc. The second phase involves the use of a plan synthesis program (such as the ORBIT program resident at the International <b>Frequency</b> <b>Registration</b> Board in Geneva, Switzerland) to identify example scenarios of specific space station placements. NASARC software is modular, and consists of several programs to be run in sequence. The grouping module, NASARC 1, identifies compatible groups of several service areas that are sufficiently separated geographically so that co-location or near co-location of their space stations will permit a user-specified downlink performance criterion to be satisfied. Pairwise compatibility between systems is assessed on the basis of the satellite separation required to meet this criterion. NASARC 2 examines all groups of compatible administrations with their corresponding arc segments and computes a common predetermined arc. After an orbital slot of sufficient size has been found, NASARC 2 calculates the required orbital separation between the critical group and its potential east and west neighbors and determines predetermined arc placement accordingly. NASARC 3 updates and extends the feasible orbital locations for predetermined arcs associated with compatible groups of service areas to provide flexibility for rearrangement if necessary. NASARC 4 performs rearrangement of predetermined arc segments where rearrangement will provide increased total arc available for subsequent placement of additional predetermined arcs and produces the final output report of the NASARC package. In addition to planning assumed homogeneous systems, NASARC can take into account such factors as rain attenuation, individual antenna parameters, power calculation options, minimum power values, different required carrier-to-interface ratios, variable grouping criteria, and affiliated sets of service areas. The modules allow the baseline assumptions to be modified, some on an individual service area basis.

40|$|Objective: To {{gain insight}} into the {{performance}} of deterministic record linkage (DRL) vs. probabilistic record linkage (PRL) strategies under different conditions by varying the <b>frequency</b> of <b>registration</b> errors {{and the amount of}} discriminating power. Study Design and Setting: A simulation study in which data characteristics were varied to create a range of realistic linkage scenarios. For each scenario, we compared the number of misclassifications (number of false nonlinks and false links) made by the different linking strategies: deterministic full, deterministic N- 1, and probabilistic. Results: The full deterministic strategy produced the lowest number of false positive links but at the expense of missing considerable numbers of matches dependent on the error rate of the linking variables. The probabilistic strategy outperformed the deterministic strategy (full or N- 1) across all scenarios. A deterministic strategy can match the performance of a probabilistic approach providing that the decision about which disagreements should be tolerated is made correctly. This requires a priori knowledge about the quality of all linking variables, whereas this information is inherently generated by a probabilistic strategy. Conclusion: PRL is more flexible and provides data {{about the quality of the}} linkage process that in turn can minimize the degree of linking errors, given the data provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background: Telemedicine may {{increase}} accessibility to pulmonary rehabilitation in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), thus enhancing long-term exercise maintenance. We {{aimed to explore}} COPD patients’ adherence and experiences in long-term telerehabilitation to understand factors affecting satisfaction and potential for service improvements. Methods: A two-year pilot study with 10 patients with COPD was conducted. The intervention included treadmill exercise training at home and a webpage for telemonitoring and self-management combined with weekly videoconferencing sessions with a physiotherapist. We conducted four separate series of data collection. Adherence was measured in terms of <b>frequency</b> of <b>registrations</b> on the webpage. Factors affecting satisfaction and adherence, together with potential for service improvements, were explored through two semi-structured focus groups and an individual open-ended questionnaire. Qualitative data were analysed by systematic text condensation. User friendliness was measured by the means of a usability questionnaire. Results: On average, participants registered 3. 0 symptom reports/week in a web-based diary and 1. 7 training sessions/week. Adherence rate decreased during the second year. Four major themes regarding factors affecting satisfaction, adherence and potential improvements of the intervention emerged: (i) experienced health benefits; (ii) increased self-efficacy and independence; and (iii) emotional safety due to regular meetings and access to special competence; (iv) maintenance of motivation. Participants were generally highly satisfied with the technical components of the telerehabilitation intervention. Conclusions: Long-term adherence to telerehabilitation in COPD was maintained for a two-year period. Satisfaction was supported by experienced health benefits, self-efficacy, and emotional safety. Maintenance of motivation was a challenge and might have affected long-term adherence. Four key factors of potential improvements in long-term telerehabilitation were identified: (i) adherence to different components of the telerehabilitation intervention is dependent on the level of focus provided by the health personnel involved; (ii) the potential for regularity that lies within the technology should be exploited to avoid relapses after vacation; (iii) motivation might be increased by tailoring individual consultations to support experiences of good health and meet individual goals and motivational strategies; (iv) interactive functionalities or gaming tools might provide peer-support, peer-modelling and enhance motivatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The Internet is {{becoming}} the dominating medium for modern communications. The SIP protocol delivers the majority of VoIP services. The SIP usage in mobile environments becomes reality due to the widespread of portable devices together with dynamic lifestyle. Unfortunately, SIP is not designed to work in mobile environments where access network and IP addresses change frequently. Intermediate NAT devices change additionally the network parameters without notifying the end hosts. To eliminate disconnection due to change of the IP or port parameter, the SIP client must proactively register and update its current parameters in this way. The <b>frequency</b> of SIP <b>registration</b> is decisive for the potential disconnection. The current registrations are executed in constant intervals set regardless of the mobility and network properties. The result in mobile environments is wasted resources and overloaded links. A new method for optimization of the registration intervals is presented in this paper. The key idea is to set the registration intervals proportional to the probability for disconnection. The probability density function is built from the past disconnections. The new approach is based on extended Kalman filter. A simulation shows the qualities of the new method, where clear outperformance is demonstrated. The algorithm can be implemented in protocols like IKE, routing protocols, Mobile IP etc. Index Terms- Session Initialization Protocol, SIP, registration, extended Kalman Filter, mobile update...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In {{recent years}} proved the {{involvement}} of papillomaviruses {{in the development of}} a wide range of diseases, which are based neoplastic processes of precancerous and tumor genesis. Human papilloma virus (HPV) are highly contagious, progressive increase in the incidence of genital tract lesions and high oncogenicity. Proven link between the risk of precancerous disease in patients with HPV and chlamydia infection, viruses (HSV, CMV) and pathogens "new generation". The purpose of this study was to evaluate the state of microbiota and analysis of associative forms of genital tract infection in women with HPV depending on the degree of cervical pathology. Materials and methods. In order to assess the state microecology cervical cancer in women with HPV infection examined 90 patients. Analysis of the results of bacteriological studies conducted taking into account the nature of pathological changes in the lining of the cervix. In particular, examined 23 women (group I) type of inflammatory disorders of the mucosa, 45 patients (group II) with mild cervical dysplasia (CIN I) and 22 - (third group) with cervical dysplasia moderate severity (CIN II). As a control, examined 25 healthy women. Conducting microbiological analysis and calculation of results was performed according to the order number 535 Ministry of Health from 1985 years and the order number 234 Ministry of Health of Ukraine of 10. 05. 2007 years. Crops performed by sectoral dense planting on differential - diagnostic culture media, to determine the degree of microbial contamination and to identify the best possible range of aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms. Taxonomic position microorganisms was determined according to the directory Bergey. Diagnosis of herpes, cytomegalovirus, chlamydia, mycoplasmosis, ureaplasmosis and fluorescent performed by using a set of "Herpes-Scan", "CMV-Scan "," Сhlamy-Scan "," Urea-Scan "and" Miko-Scan "(Moscow). HPV infection detected by PCR. Gardnerellesis diagnosed by microscopy by staining smears on Romanovsky with subsequent calculation of "core" of cells, setting amine test, determination of pH. The results of bacteriological studies were subject to statistical analysis by Student's method. Results. The obtained data indicate that patients of the first group identified changes microecology which was to raise the <b>frequency</b> of <b>registration</b> of mixed infection of the cervix opportunistic gram-positive cocci in combination with viruses, as well as the tendency to reduce the protective microflora. The frequency of associative forms of cervical infection was significant and was 72, 7...|$|R
