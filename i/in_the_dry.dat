5|$|Herbivores, {{including}} wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela {{conservation area}} and migration {{corridor to the}} south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.|$|E
5|$|Late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season (around April) of each year, females {{give birth}} to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains {{attached}} to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the properties of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) exposed to convective air <b>drying</b> and freeze-drying. <b>The</b> samples were analyzed in terms of physical properties (colour and texture). <b>The</b> trials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> convective chamber were done at 40 ºC and 60 ºC, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> tunnel at 60 ºC and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freeze dryer at - 50 ºC. It was concluded that <b>the</b> freeze <b>drying</b> and <b>the</b> air <b>drying</b> at 40 ºC produced smaller changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colour while <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel originated more intense colour changes. With respect to texture, {{it was possible to}} deduce that <b>the</b> pulp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fresh product at 2 cm off from the skin is harder than the pulp at 4 cm off from the skin. As to <b>the</b> effect of <b>drying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> texture of the pumpkin, it was observed that all dryings affected texture considerably when compared to <b>the</b> fresh product. <b>In</b> fact, hardness varied from 75 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> <b>in</b> chamber at 40 ºC to 90 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel <b>drying,</b> when compared to the fresh product. As to springiness, it was changed more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> at 40 ºC, while cohesiveness showed <b>the</b> higher change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freeze <b>drying</b> treatment...|$|R

5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of Paspalum distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; Acacia nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture was the empire's {{main source}} of income through taxes on land and produce. The {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and worked farming the staple crops of rice, pulses, and cotton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> areas and sugarcane in areas having sufficient rainfall, with areca and betel being the chief cash crops. The living conditions of the labourers who farmed the land must have been bearable as there are no records of revolts by the landless against wealthy landlords. If peasants were disgruntled the common practice was to migrate in large numbers out of the jurisdiction of the ruler who was mistreating them, thereby depriving him of revenue from their labor.|$|E

5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E
30|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature of isolated porcine lens as a biological tissue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dried</b> condition could be measured by differential scanning calorimetry. We could not detect any significant change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glass transition}} temperature of <b>the</b> <b>dried</b> lens tissues with pretreatment by different sugars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different concentrations. However, trehalose pretreatment appeared to make the {{glass transition temperature}} more noticeable on the thermogram, compared with other sugar treatment. The presence of trehalose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> condition might lead to more regular alignment of biological macromolecules, and thus, would result in more apparent detection of the glass transition temperature. Thermal analysis of the whole tissue, such as <b>the</b> lens <b>in</b> this study, by differential scanning calorimetry, {{would lead to the}} elucidation of mechanism for cataract formation (Biro et al. 2006) and also to the development of methods to preserve cells and tissues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>drying</b> or frozen condition (Wolkers et al. 2001, 2002; Li et al. 2007; Orlien et al. 2003; Lynch et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dry</b> upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet contain more than one species.|$|E
