5000|$|Chevrolet {{introduced}} a mechanical fuel injection option, made by General Motors' Rochester Products Division, for its 283 V8 engine in 1956 (1957 U.S. model year). This system directed the inducted engine air across a [...] "spoon shaped" [...] plunger that moved {{in proportion to}} the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a [...] "pulse" [...] or <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection,</b> but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central [...] "spider" [...] of injection lines. The fuel meter adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a carburetor's float chamber. With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the fuel meter, the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a [...] "port" [...] injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.|$|E

40|$|The {{antiviral}} {{efficacy of}} prophylactic 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) therapy administered by continuous infusion or <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection</b> was compared in pediatric cats infected with feline leukemia virus. A 4 -week treatment regimen of AZT was initiated at - 48, 8, or 96 h postinfection (p. i.).

The results suggest that intermittent AZT administration is less efficacious than continuous infusion. Higher peak AZT concentrations in plasma associated with <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection</b> compared with those associated with continuous infusion may be immunotoxic, thus reducing the drug-induced vaccine effect.

30|$|The {{differential}} pressure fluctuated significantly during intermittent and pulsed injection of water (Fig.  10). The amplitude of pressure fluctuations was relatively large when water was intermittently injected into Well L 1 every 25  min, while {{the frequency of}} pressure fluctuations was relatively high during pulsed injection of water. This indicates that unsteady-state water injection, including <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection</b> and pulsed injection, might promote the instability of fluid flow rate, flow direction, and pressure distribution in the model. In this way, the water displacement efficiency was improved. However, the displacement efficiency of <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection</b> was {{not as good as}} expected. This is due to the serious heterogeneity and the complex structure of fractures and caves in the fractured-vuggy reservoir model.|$|E
30|$|Because Well D 1 was drilled {{deeply into}} a cave that was near to {{injection}} well L 1, water breakthrough occurred easily during subsequent water injection. The final oil recovery of Well D 1 after <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection</b> {{was the highest}} among these three water injection modes. During <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection,</b> the injection pressure of Well D 1 was high enough to suppress bottom water coning. Therefore, the oil/water co-production duration of Well D 1 was long and its oil recovery was relative high. However, the incremental oil recovery was still at a low level, less than 5.5  %. All these phenomena {{can be attributed to}} the well location, well depth, and the early water breakthrough.|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown {{different}} effects on cell proliferation and weight characteristics by sulfated cholecystokinin- 8 (CCK- 8 S) in the rat pancreas when the peptide has been administered continuously rather than intermittently. The {{aim of this study}} was as follows: (i) to compare the effect of continuous infusion and of <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> of CCK- 8 S on cell proliferation, weight gain, and induction of apoptosis and (ii) to examine the effect of injections of CCK- 8 S on CCK-A receptor gene expression in the rat pancreas. Male Sprague-Dawley rats had subcutaneous continuous infusion of CCK- 8 S in a dose of 5 microg/kg/h or 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) (vehicle) by implanted osmotic minipumps. The rats were killed after 4 days. Other rats were either injected subcutaneously only once or injected twice daily for 3 days with either 6 microg of CCK dissolved in 0. 5 mL BSA or 0. 5 mL BSA alone. The rats were killed 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the last injection. One hour before death they received 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally to localize and quantitate the cell proliferation. Plasma was collected for analysis of CCK. The pancreas was dissected and immunohistochemistry was performed for analysis of the expression of the apoptosis promoting protein bax and the apoptosis inhibiting protein bcl- 2, and for BrdU and CCK-A receptor localization. In situ hybridization (ISH) was used for examination and semiquantification of CCK-A receptor mRNA expression. Continuous infusion of CCK- 8 S led to a sixfold increase in plasma CCK and a 40 % increase in pancreatic weight without any effect on BrdU labeling. Immunohistochemistry revealed decreased tissue expression of bax but unaffected expression of bcl- 2. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> of CCK- 8 S led to hyper-CCK-emia with increased incorporation of BrdU, indicating increased cell proliferation but no increase in pancreatic weight. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of bax, whereas bcl- 2 remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence and ISH for the CCK-A receptor and its gene expression, respectively, showed a lowest intensity at 3 hours after CCK- 8 S injections. The results indicate that decreased apoptosis could explain the increased pancreatic weight during continuous infusion of CCK- 8 S. An increased apoptosis could explain the lack of pancreatic weight gain upon <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> of CCK- 8 S despite the stimulation of cell proliferation.

40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of local anaesthetic tech-niques in the postoperative period have long been recognized. In a review of early work, Simpson and Parkhouse (1961) pointed out that, in 1935, Capelle irrigated abdominal wounds with local anaesthetic injected through large, curved, hollow needles. These were inserted {{at the end of}} the operation and left in place in a manner similar to deep tension sutures. The method was apparently effective, but was not adopted widely because of fear of wound infection and delayed healing. Gerwig, Thompson and Blades (1951) used the same principle when they inserted polyethylene tubes deep to the anterior rectus sheath for wound irrigation, and they noted that patients so treated required only a quarter of the usual amount of morphine. Gius (1940) described the use of para verte-bral block with procaine for the treatment of post-operative atelectasis, and Cleland (1949) used "continuous " caudal and extradural analgesia for over 100 abdominal and ano—rectal cases. He claimed that this resulted in normal postoperative respiration and early, painless ambulation. Bonica (1953) used <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> through an indwelling extradural catheter to produce seg-mental analgesia, and found that this gave com-plete pain relief and allowed effective ventilation and coughing. Dawkins (1956) preferred to give extradural lignocaine as an infusion. He found that this technique was capable of providing truly continuous analgesia, and pointed out that the use of the word "continuous " is a misnomer when applied to <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> or top-ups of local anaesthetic.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the therapeutic margin of aminoglycoside therapy may be improved by manipulation of dosing strategy.

Due to diminished receptor concentration, hepatic EGF binding was decreased in male and female lit/lit mice to a level that was unaffected by gender or androgen treatment. GH replacement therapy by <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> and continuous infusion restored the EGF binding of hypophysectomized mice to normal male and female levels, respectively, suggesting a role for the more pulsatile GH secretion in normal males. In lit/lit mice, however, both continuous and intermittent GH resulted in EGF binding levels comparable to those in normal females. In normal males continuous GH suppressed EGF binding. In conclusion, endogenous GH secretion induces EGF receptors in mice and this effect may be modulated by sex differences in GH secretion...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is to clarify the exact causes of the production of CO and HC emissions relevant for the partial-load range of the engine and to indicate capabilities of reducing the same. For this purpose exhaust gas samples were taken at 264 locations within the flame tube of a DART tubular combustion chamber and analyzed for continuous kerosine and diesel oil injection. Theoretical considerations of pollutant generation with respect to chemical equilibrium and kinetically induced nitrogen oxide concentrations {{on one hand and}} the combustion of fuel droplets on the other hand are intended to complement and support experimental results. Using <b>intermittent</b> <b>injection</b> with its greatly load-independent high injection pressure gradient, one expected an improvement of the efficiency of liquid fuel atomization within the lower load range.

40|$|The {{positive}} correlation between the protein concentration in bronchial secretions and the penetration of amikacin and tobramycin {{in the present study}} suggests that inflammation favorably affects the penetration of aminoglycosides into these secretions. As shown in this and other studies, local inactivation of aminoglycosides might counterbalance this effect to some extent. The relatively low penetration of aminoglycosides into the bronchial secretions (- 200 %) probably accounts for the poor antibacterial activity of bronchial secretions of aminoglycoside-treated patients and, possibly, for the poor clinical outcome of bronchopneumonia due to gram-negative bacteria. Continuous infusion of these antibiotics, even at high dosage, does not appear to solve the problem; it does not achieve at any time satisfactory inhibitory activity against Enterobacteriacae or Pseumodomanas aeruginosa in the bronchial secretions. Although <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> can result in higher levels of aminogtycosides within the bronchial secretions, such levels cannot be maintained for prolonged periods unless the dosage is increased.

Methods: A total of 60 patients with severe AOPP, defined as cholinergic crisis with respiratory failure or cerebral edema, were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients each. In the experimental group, patients received a continuous micropump of atropine and pralidoxime chloride; in the control group, patients were given <b>intermittent</b> <b>injections</b> of atropine and pralidoxime chloride.
