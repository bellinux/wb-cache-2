40|$|Species' {{geographical}} distributions are tracking latitudinal and elevational {{surface temperature}} <b>gradients</b> under global climate change. To evaluate {{the opportunities to}} track these <b>gradients</b> across space, we provide a first baseline assessment of the steepness of these <b>gradients</b> for the world's terrestrial birds. Within the breeding ranges of 9, 014 bird species, we characterized the spatial <b>gradients</b> in temperature along latitude and elevation for all and a subset of bird species, respectively. We summarized these temperature <b>gradients</b> globally for threatened and non-threatened species and determined how their steepness varied based on species' geography (range size, shape, and orientation) and projected changes in temperature under climate change. Elevational temperature <b>gradients</b> were steepest for species in Africa, western North and South America, and central Asia and shallowest in Australasia, insular IndoMalaya, and the Neotropical lowlands. Latitudinal temperature <b>gradients</b> were steepest for extratropical species, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Threatened species had shallower elevational <b>gradients</b> whereas latitudinal <b>gradients</b> differed little between threatened and non-threatened species. The strength of elevational <b>gradients</b> {{was positively correlated with}} projected changes in temperature. For latitudinal <b>gradients,</b> this relationship only held for extratropical species. The strength of latitudinal <b>gradients</b> was better predicted by species' geography, but primarily for extratropical species. Our findings suggest threatened species are associated with shallower elevational temperature <b>gradients,</b> whereas steep latitudinal <b>gradients</b> are most prevalent outside the tropics where fewer bird species occur year-round. Future modeling and mitigation efforts would benefit from the development of finer grain distributional data to ascertain how these <b>gradients</b> are structured within species' ranges, how and why these <b>gradients</b> vary among species, and the capacity of species to utilize these <b>gradients</b> under climate change...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAimTo compare {{estimated}} pressure <b>gradients</b> from routine follow-up cardiovascular phase-contrast {{magnetic resonance}} (PC-MR) {{with those from}} Doppler echocardiography and invasive catheterization in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction. MethodsIn 75 patients with pulmonary outflow tract obstruction maximal and mean PC-MR <b>gradients</b> were compared to maximal and mean Doppler <b>gradients.</b> Additionally, in a subgroup of 31 patients maximal and mean PC-MR and Doppler pressure <b>gradients</b> were compared to catheter peak-to-peak pressure <b>gradients</b> (PPG). ResultsMaximal and mean PC-MR <b>gradients</b> underestimated pulmonary outflow tract obstruction as compared to Doppler (max gradient: bias=+ 8. 4 mmHg (+ 47. 6 %), r= 0. 89, p< 0. 001; mean gradient: + 4. 3 mmHg (+ 49. 0 %), r= 0. 88, p< 0. 001). However, in comparison to catheter PPG, maximal PC-MR <b>gradients</b> (bias=+ 1. 8 mmHg (+ 8. 8 %), r= 0. 90, p= 0. 14) and mean Doppler <b>gradients</b> (bias=− 2. 3 mmHg (− 11. 2 %), r= 0. 87, p= 0. 17) revealed best agreement. Mean PC-MR <b>gradients</b> underestimated (bias=− 7. 7 mmHg (− 55. 6 %), r= 0. 90, p< 0. 001) while maximal Doppler <b>gradients</b> systematically overestimated catheter PPG (bias=+ 13. 9 mmHg (+ 56. 5 %), r= 0. 88, p< 0. 001). ConclusionsEstimated maximal PC-MR pressure <b>gradients</b> from routine CHD follow-up agree well with invasively assessed peak-to-peak pressure <b>gradients.</b> Estimated maximal Doppler pressure <b>gradients</b> tend to overestimate, while Doppler mean <b>gradients</b> agree better with catheter PPG. Therefore, our data provide reasonable arguments to either apply maximal PC-MR <b>gradients</b> or mean Doppler <b>gradients</b> to non-invasively evaluate the severity of pulmonary outflow tract obstruction in the follow-up of CHD...|$|R

5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind <b>gradient</b> can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind <b>gradient</b> is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the <b>gradient.</b> When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind <b>gradient</b> on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind <b>gradient</b> and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{is discussed}} for an experimental program {{for studying the}} behavior of acoustic wave propagation {{in the presence of}} strong <b>gradients</b> of pressure, temperature, and flow. Theory suggests that <b>gradients</b> effects can be experimentally observed as resonant frequency shifts and mode shape changes in a waveguide. A convenient experimental geometry for such experiments is the annular region between two co-rotating cylinders. Radial temperature <b>gradients</b> in a spinning annulus can be generated by differentially heating the two cylinders via electromagnetic induction. Radial pressure <b>gradients</b> can be controlled by varying the cylinder spin rates. Present technology appears adequate to construct an apparatus to allow independent control of temperature and pressure <b>gradients.</b> A complicating feature of a more advanced experiment, involving flow <b>gradients,</b> is the requirement for independently controlled cylinder spin rates. Also, the boundary condition at annulus terminations must be such that flow <b>gradients</b> are minimally disturbed. The design and construction of an advanced apparatus to include flow <b>gradients</b> will require additional technology development...|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure <b>gradient</b> within the star. The pressure <b>gradient</b> is established by the temperature <b>gradient</b> of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E

A strong linear correlation between peak velocity and peak flow, and mean velocity and mean flow, was found in all four valve types (r = 0. 96 to 0. 99). In small St. Jude and Hancock valves, Doppler velocities and corresponding <b>gradients</b> increased dramatically with increasing low, resulting in velocities and <b>gradients</b> as high as 4. 7 m/s and 89 mm Hg, respectively. The ratio of velocity across the valve to velocity in front of the valve (velocity ratio) was independent of flow in all St. Jude, Medironic-Hall, Starr-Edwards and Hancock valves when the two lowest flow rates were excluded for Hancock valves. Although Doppler peak and mean <b>gradients</b> correlaied well with catheter peak and mean <b>gradients</b> in all four valve types, the actual agreement between the two techniques was acceptable only in Hancock and Medtronic-Hall valves. For St. Jude and Starr-Edwards valves, Doppler <b>gradients</b> significantly and consistently exceeded catheter <b>gradients</b> with differences as great us 44 mm Hg. Thus, Doppler velocities and <b>gradients</b> across normal prosthetic heart valves are highly flow dependent. However, the velocity ratio is independent of flow. Doppler and catheter <b>gradients</b> across prostheses show acceptable agreement in Medtronic-Hall and Hanccck valves, but Doppler <b>gradients</b> may significantly exceed catheter <b>gradients</b> in St. Jude valves and Starr-Edwards valves, especially at high flow rates. The discrepancy between Doppler and, catheter <b>gradients</b> in both St. Jude and Starr-Edwards valves is of potential clinical importance and suggests that localized high velocity jets and pressure recovery occur in these valves...|$|R
