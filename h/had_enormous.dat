However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He <b>had</b> <b>enormous</b> drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E

By the end of 1925 Reis had managed to introduce escudo banknotes worth £1,007,963 (at 1925 exchange rates: £ in modern pounds) into the Portuguese economy. The exchange rate of the Portuguese escudo fell and it lost much of its credibility. After the scheme was found out, the Bank of Portugal ordered the withdrawal of all 500 escudo banknotes within 20 days, by December 26; 115,000 counterfeit notes were withdrawn.|$|E

Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand.

Production by Factory No. 500 totaled 97 in 1948 and 462 in 1949. Factory No. 16 in Kazan was brought into the program and built 300 engines in 1949.

25|$|Hermione is {{depicted}} as starting a campaign to emancipate the enslaved House elves, using the methods of real-world campaigns on social and political issues such as badges with slogans.

But in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the campaign turns out to have <b>had</b> <b>enormous</b> unforeseen results, with House elves joining the struggle and making several indispensable contributions to Voldemort's final defeat and saving the main protagonists' lives. Rowling said in an early interview that Hermione and her political conscience about the rights of elves was fairly autobiographical.|$|E
25|$|Two {{developments}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century– the construction of the first Croton Dam and Aqueduct, and the coming of the railroad– <b>had</b> <b>enormous</b> impacts on the growth of Westchester. The Croton Dam and Aqueduct was begun in 1837 and completed in 1842; now a National Historic Landmark, the Croton Aqueduct is considered one of the great engineering achievements of the 19th century. In the 1840s, the first railroads were built in Westchester, and included the New York and Harlem Railroad, the Hudson River Railroad, and the New York and New Haven Railroad. The railroads often determined the growth of a town, and the population shifted from Northern to Southern Westchester. By 1860, the total county population was 99,000, with the largest city being Yonkers.|$|E

Although stone walls were built in China during the Warring States (481–221BC), mass {{conversion}} to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). Sections of the Great Wall had been built prior to the Qin Dynasty (221–207BC) and subsequently connected and fortified during the Qin dynasty, although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644AD) during the 15th and 16th centuries.
