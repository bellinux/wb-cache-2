5|$|In the Second World War {{thousands}} of children were evacuated from metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool. One evacuee from Woolwich, Patricia Armstrong aged nine, was knocked down by a passenger train and killed on a Saturday afternoon in May 1943 while using the Gelynis foot crossing at Morganstown. She was lodged with a family in Morganstown. As air raids on Cardiff increased, <b>even</b> <b>younger</b> children from Radyr were evacuated to boarding schools at Rhoose and Bridgend.|$|E
5|$|Kīlauea {{is one of}} five subaerial volcanoes {{that make}} up the island of Hawaii, created by the Hawaii hotspot. The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old, and Kīlauea, the youngest, is {{believed}} to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age; Lōʻihi Seamount on the island's flank is <b>even</b> <b>younger,</b> but has yet to breach the surface. Thus it is the second youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.|$|E

After the Trojans witness Achilles' treatment of Hector's body, Troilus insists on rejoining the battle despite his wounds and Hecuba's attempts to stop him. Achilles kills him with an arrow.

5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or <b>even</b> <b>younger,</b> could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
5|$|Since the {{establishment}} of Maribor's youth system {{in its present form}} in 1990, the academy has been the most successful in the country. U19 team holds the record for most titles than any other team, having won six times. The same team has also won four Youth Cups. Other teams are equally successful as both the U17 and U15 teams holds the record for most titles (six) in their category. <b>Even</b> <b>younger</b> selections of the club also play in top-flight of their respective age categories and share similar success. In addition, Maribor's youth squads became the first in the country that were able to achieve league victories in the four highest youth levels (U19, U17, U15, and U13) during the course of one season. In 2012, a record eight Maribor players were called to the Slovenia national under-17 football team for the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship.|$|E

25|$|Justus Hiddes Halbertsma {{was born}} on October 23, 1789, {{in the village of}} Grou, in {{the central part of the}} Dutch {{province}} of Friesland, in the house of his parents on Kowemerk ("Cow Market") street. He was the eldest son of the baker and small-time merchant Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756–1809) and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk) Tsjallings Binnerts (1767–1809). He had three younger brothers: Tsjalling (1792–1852), Binnert (1795–1847), and Eeltsje (1797–1858). Two children who were born later died in early childhood, the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. The four brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age and the others were <b>even</b> <b>younger.</b> Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the Brothers Halbertsma later in life, were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother.|$|E

25|$|Estonia {{was soon}} occupied, and {{refugees}} were evacuated {{further into the}} inner Russian provinces. Most of the Scouts were among the refugees.

In Tartu, the second largest city in Estonia and the seat of a 300-year-old university, Scout troops were organized at every large school with no other aid than a Russian translation of Baden-Powell's 'Scouting for Boys' and some consultation with a visiting Scouts in uniform from Pärnu. A few patrols of these troops were even able to continue their activities when Scouting was banned during the following German occupation. The Estonian War of Liberation, however, brought a pause to Scouting in Tartu as most boys over 16 (many <b>even</b> <b>younger)</b> volunteered for the fighting forces. But they restored their troops and patrols {{as soon as they were}} able to return to their school benches; one of these Scouts, now in the United States, is still active among Scouts of Estonian extraction.|$|E

The samples have been treated with skepticism by the scientific community, and their ages have been directly challenged. The rocks collected from the west site have not been tested by subsequent experiments. The lava samples collected from the eastern site were allegedly found under a Mauna Loa lava flow, which had been previously dated to 187,000 years.
