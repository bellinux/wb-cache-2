To evaluate the longterm performance of insulators, properties such as hydrophobicity, surface roughness, and chemical composition are often studied. In this paper, evaluation of hydrophobicity based on the Dynamic <b>Dropping</b> <b>Test</b> (DDT) method is proposed. Using a high-speed camera (Vision Research Phantom v 1610) with 65 mm f/ 4. 5 Macro-Nikkor lens and Nikon PB- 6 bellows unit, which is fixed in a level 45 ° to the specimen surface, the full sequence of the water droplet making contact with the composite surface was recorded and analyzed. The DDT was performed on specimens of different ageing levels. Further investigation on hydrophobicity using the optical contact angle device (OCAH 200) is performed to study the relationship between DDT over the surface and the contact angle. Our results show that more time is needed for the water droplet to settle over the surface when the hydrophobicity is decreased due to aging.

The anti-diarrhoeal effect of aqueous extract of Tithonia diversifolia leaves (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg doses) was studied using castor-oil-induced-diarrhoea model (<b>dropping</b> <b>test),</b> castor-oil-induced enteropooling (secretory test) and gastrointestinal transit test (charcoal transit) in rats. In castor-oil-induced diarrhoea test, the rats’ droppings were observed and noted as wet or dry with wet signifying characteristic diarrhoea. The castor-oil-induced enteropooling was done to determine the volume of intestinal content induced by castor oil while in gastrointestinal transit, the speed and percentage distance travelled by charcoal meal were noted to determine the anti-motility properties of the extract. The results showed that Tithonia diversifolia leaves’ aqueous extract reduced wet faecal output in castor-oilinduced diarrhoea but with slightly greater frequencies in comparison with loperamide treated animals and had less volume of intestinal contents as compared with the negative control (distilled water treated animals).

40|$|As the {{complexity}} of Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) devices increases, so does the cost of testing the VLSI devices. VLSI testing has to be cost effective {{to meet the challenges}} of the technology advance. Test cost is incurred during both the test-preparation and test-application phases. In this thesis we address test cost issues in these two phases. First we present a simple, accurate fault coverage model, which can help to reduce the cost of test preparation; then we propose test optimization methods which can help reduce the cost of the test application process. ^ Previous models of fault coverage analysis are either too simplistic or require full fault simulation. We present a new probabilistic fault coverage model that is accurate, simple, predictive, and easily integrated with the normal design flow of built-in self-test circuits. The parameters of the model are determined by fitting the fault simulation data obtained on an initial segment of the random test. A cost-based analysis finds the point at which to stop fault simulation, determine the parameters, and estimate fault coverage for longer test lengths. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in making accurate predictions at a low computational cost. ^ We examine potential methods that may reduce the cost of test application. We first show that by permuting test vectors based on normal test data, we can improve the test efficiency by over 10 %. Algorithms for test reordering are developed with the goal of minimizing the test cost. Best and worst case bounds are established for the performance of a reordered sequence compared to the original sequence of test application. Secondly, the risk of <b>dropping</b> <b>test</b> vectors that do not fail any chips is analyzed against the cost benefits. The same idea is used to optimize the test plans by changing the order of different tests. ...|$|E
40|$|Outdoor bronzes {{exposed to}} the {{environment}} form naturally a layer called patina, which {{may be able to}} protect the metallic substrate. However, since the last century, with the appearance of acid rains, a strong change in the nature and properties of the copper based patinas occurred [1]. Studies and general observations have established that bronze corrosion patinas created by acid rain are not only disfiguring in terms of loss of detail and homogeneity, but are also unstable [2]. The unstable patina is partially leached away by rainwater. This leaching is represented by green streaking on bronze monuments [3]. Because of the instability of the patina, conservation techniques are usually required. On a bronze object {{exposed to the}} outdoor environment, there are different actions of the rainfall and other atmospheric agents {{as a function of the}} monument shape. In fact, we recognize sheltered and unsheltered areas as regards exposure to rainwater [4]. As a consequence of these different actions, two main patina types are formed on monuments exposed to the outdoor environment. These patinas have different electrochemical, morphological and compositional characteristics [1]. In the case of sheltered areas, the patina contains mainly copper products, stratified above a layer strongly enriched in insoluble Sn oxides, located at the interface with the uncorroded metal. Moreover, different colors of the patina result from the exposure geometry. The surface color may be pale green for unsheltered areas, and green and mat black for sheltered areas [4]. Thus, in real outdoor bronze monuments, the corrosion behavior is strongly influenced by the exposure geometry. This must be taken into account when designing conservation procedures, since the patina is in most cases the support on which corrosion inhibitors are applied. Presently, for protecting outdoor bronzes against atmospheric corrosion, inhibitors and protective treatments are used. BTA and its derivatives, which are the most common inhibitors used for copper and its alloy, were found to be toxic for the environment and human health [5, 6]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that BTA is efficient when applied on bare copper but not as efficient when applied on bare bronze [7]. Thus it was necessary to find alternative compounds. Silane-based inhibitors (already successfully tested on copper and other metallic substrates [8]), were taken into consideration as a non-toxic, environmentally friendly alternative to BTA derivatives for bronze protection. The purpose of this thesis was based on the assessment of the efficiency of a selected compound, to protect the bronze against corrosion, which is the 3 -mercapto-propyl-trimethoxy-silane (PropS-SH). It was selected thanks to the collaboration with the Corrosion Studies Centre “Aldo Daccò” at the Università di Ferrara. Since previous studies [9, 10, 11] demonstrated that the addition of nanoparticles to silane-based inhibitors leads to an increase of the protective efficiency, we also wanted to evaluate the influence of the addition of CeO 2, La 2 O 3, TiO 2 nanoparticles on the protective efficiency of 3 -mercapto-propyl-trimethoxy-silane, applied on pre-patinated bronze surfaces. This study is the first section of the thesis. Since restorers have to work on patinated bronzes and not on bare metal (except for contemporary art), it is important to be able to recreate the patina, under laboratory conditions, either in sheltered or unsheltered conditions to test the coating and to obtain reliable results. Therefore, at the University of Bologna, different devices have been designed to simulate the real outdoor conditions and to create a patina which is representative of real application conditions of inhibitor or protective treatments. In particular, accelerated ageing devices by wet & dry (simulating the action of stagnant rain in sheltered areas [12]) and by dropping (simulating the leaching action of the rain in unsheltered areas [1]) tests were used. In the present work, we used the <b>dropping</b> <b>test</b> as a method to produce pre-patinated bronze surfaces for the application of a candidate inhibitor as well as for evaluating its protective efficiency on aged bronze (unsheltered areas). In this thesis, gilded bronzes were also studied. When they are exposed to the outside environment, a corrosion phenomenon appears which is due to the electrochemical couple gold/copper where copper is the anode. In the presence of an electrolyte, this phenomenon results in the formation of corrosion products than will cause a blistering of the gold (or a break-up and loss of the film in some cases). Moreover, because of the diffusion of the copper salts to the surface, aggregates and a greenish film will be formed on the surface of the sample [13]. By coating gilded samples with PropS-SH and PropS-SH containing nano-particles and carrying out accelerated ageing by the <b>dropping</b> <b>test,</b> a discussion is possible on the effectiveness of this coating, either with nano-particles or not, against the corrosion process. This part is the section 2 of this thesis. Finally, a discussion about laser treatment aiming at the assessment of reversibility/re-applicability of the PropS-SH coating can be found in section 3 of this thesis. Because the protective layer loses its efficiency with time, it is necessary to find a way of removing the silane layer, before applying a new one on the “bare” patina. One request is to minimize the damages that a laser treatment would create on the patina. Therefore, different laser fluences (energy/surface) were applied on the sample surface during the treatment process in order to find the best range of fluence. In particular, we made a characterization of surfaces before and after removal of PropS-SH (applied on a naturally patinated surface, and subsequently aged by natural exposure) with laser methods. The laser removal treatment was done by the CNR Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara” of Sesto Fiorentino in Florence. In all the three sections of the thesis, a range of non-destructive spectroscopic methods (Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), μ-Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffractometry (XRD)) were used for characterizing the corroded surfaces. AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy) was used to analyze the ageing solutions from the <b>dropping</b> <b>test</b> in sections 1 and 2. ...|$|E

This also explains the observed wide dispersion in the number of drops to failure. On the other hand, the test boards that were isothermally annealed before the <b>drop</b> <b>testing</b> failed by mode (4) ...|$|R

40|$|Free fall <b>drop</b> <b>testing</b> is an {{important}} part of the development of commercial electronic components and devices. In the process of optimizing the quality of their entire product range, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB have decided to review their free fall <b>drop</b> <b>test</b> equipment with the goal of increasing the precision, repeatability, and time efficiency of their <b>drop</b> <b>test</b> applications. In regard to the free fall <b>drop</b> <b>test</b> principle a robot system with management software, named Doris Drop Test System, is developed to meet these goals. As the amount of related work for this application is as minimal as the timeframes for this project, the development process is empirical and entrepreneurial with engineering skills as the governing line of work. Combining the competence from fields such as mechanics, electronics and product development, reaching the goals is successful enabling the identifying of two different drop methods – Impact Position and Drop Position. Increasing the repeatability from approximately 10 % to 85 % enables anyone at any time to perform the exact mobile phone <b>drop</b> <b>test.</b> By reaching a precision of up to 100 %, performing free fall <b>drop</b> <b>tests</b> aiming for testing specific mobile phone parts, optimizes the development process by faster detection of mechanical weaknesses. Achieving these results in parallel with increasing the throughput by shortening the testing time, has proven the success of the Doris Drop Test System. ...|$|R
