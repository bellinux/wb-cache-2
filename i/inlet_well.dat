40|$|Efficiency {{increases}} in fossil energy boilers and steam turbines are being achieved {{by increasing the}} temperature and pressure at the turbine <b>inlets</b> <b>well</b> beyond the critical point of water. To allow these increases, advanced materials are needed {{that are able to}} withstand the higher temperatures and pressures in terms of strength, creep, and oxidation resistance. As part of a larger collaborative effort, the Albany Research Center (ARC) is examining the steam-side oxidation behavior for ultrasupercritical (USC) steam turbine applications. Initial tests are being done on six alloys identified as candidates for USC steam boiler applications: ferritic alloy SAVE 12, austenitic alloy Super 304 H, the high Cr-high Ni alloy HR 6 W, and the nickel-base superalloys Inconel 617, Haynes 230, and Inconel 740. Each of these alloys has very high strength for its alloy type. Three types of experiments are planned: cyclic oxidation in air plus steam at atmospheric pressure, thermogravimetric ana lysis (TGA) in steam at atmospheric pressure, and exposure tests in supercritical steam up to 650 C (1202 F) and 34. 5 MPa (5000 psi). The atmospheric pressure tests, combined with supercritical exposures at 13. 8, 20. 7, 24. 6, and 34. 5 MPa (2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 psi) should allow the determination of the effect of pressure on the oxidation process...|$|R

The Euler two-phase flow model is taken in the modeling. Secondary air parameter play an important part in the remodeling. Through the adjustment of secondary air, including the relative area and height of the <b>inlet</b> as <b>well</b> as adjustment of the nozzle geometry, the distribution of the concentration of solid particles is improved and the the pressure loss is reduced, thus exert the transport efficiency and energy consumption with a positive effect...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} in a square-sectioned U-bend are investigated. Turbulence models with linear and non-linear expressions for the Reynolds stresses are used. The near wall turbulence is {{treated by the}} damping functions approach and a two-layer model with Wolfshtein's sub-layer treatment. The inlet conditions {{have a significant effect}} on the predictions. The results from the non-linear low-Reynolds number k-epsilon models including Suga's cubic low-Re model were closest to experimental data. These models predicted the stress-induced secondary motion in the straight <b>inlet</b> duct <b>well.</b> This secondary motion had a small impact on the flow in the bend...|$|R
60|$|As soon as captain Truck {{arrived at}} the mouth of this passage, he felt so much {{encouraged}} by the appearance of things that he gave the concerted signal for the ship to veer round and to stand to the southward. This was losing ground in the way of offing, but tack the Montauk could not with so little wind, and the captain saw by the drift she had made since he left her, that promptitude was necessary. The ship might anchor off the <b>inlet,</b> as <b>well</b> as anywhere else, if reduced to anchoring outside at all, and then there was always the chance of entering.|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} here {{was carried out}} at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, located near Gary, Indiana. The goal of the reported project was to fix an incorrectly designed storm water management system located at the Portage lakefront. Because the original design could not handle peak water flows, there has been erosion of the sand dunes. The erosion of the sand dunes {{has led to the}} collapsing of stairs, and the exposure of water mains. To fix these problems, a new design was made that incorporated additional water <b>inlets,</b> as <b>well</b> as a pipeline to take water to a different location. After completing these initial ideas and calculations, the project is being sent to a contracting company for construction...|$|R
50|$|Wellington {{was one of}} the {{original}} ten Legislative Council districts created by the Legislative Council Act 1870 (33 Vict, No. 13). The district's initial boundary had Bunbury as its main population centre, and reached north to Bannister and south to the Wonnerup <b>Inlet,</b> as <b>well</b> as east to the Great Australian Bight. It was bounded by the district of Fremantle to the north and the districts of Vasse and Albany to the south. After the passage of the Legislative Council Act Amendment Act 1873 (37 Vict. No. 22), the district's boundaries were altered, with some of its northern portions transferred to the new district of Murray and Williams. Murray and Williams replaced Fremantle as Wellington's northern neighbour.|$|R
50|$|The <b>inlets</b> at Seething <b>Wells</b> {{sucked up}} too much mud with the water because of {{turbulence}} caused by the River Mole, River Ember and The Rythe. The Chelsea Waterworks Company attempted to build works opposite Hampton Court but followed the Lambeth Waterworks Company to a new installation at Molesey in 1875 where the Molesey Reservoirs were built. Both companies were incorporated into the Metropolitan Water Board in 1902.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} a study involving {{residual stress}} measurement in a cracked fluid end section from an industrial well stimulation pump. In order to withstand extremely high operating pressures, fluid ends typically are autofrettaged to introduce residual compressive stresses in stress concentration areas. In this study, neutron diffraction measurements {{were conducted on}} a cracked fluid end section to determine if these compressive stresses were still present or whether they had disappeared during the service lifetime of the component. Our work found that {{despite the fact that}} cracking had occurred, significant levels of residual stress were still present in the component. The cracking was attributed to a gouge in the suction <b>inlet</b> region, <b>well</b> away from the position of high compressive residual stresses. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5000|$|According to Walbran Masset <b>Inlet</b> (as <b>well</b> as Masset Island, Masset Sound and {{the village}} of Masset) came from the Haida word Masst, meaning [...] "large island". Captain Douglas, on his second visit from Nootka Sound aboard the Iphigenia on June 19, 1789 named the bay leading to the inlet McIntyre's Bay. This name was used on the charts of Dixon and Meares. The American traders called the inlet Hancock's River as shown in Ingraham's chart of 1792 after the American brig Hancock. In 1853 H.N. Knox of the Royal Navy, mate on HMS Virago did a sketch survey of the harbour when the name Masset {{was adopted by the}} British. A survey was made in 1907 by Captain Learmouth on HMS Egeria.|$|R
5000|$|The European {{versions}} were {{equipped with}} a SAE J1772-2009 <b>inlet</b> as <b>well</b> until the automotive industry settled on the IEC Type 2 [...] "Mennekes" [...] connector as the standard inlet - since all IEC connectors use the same SAE J1772 signaling protocol the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The {{only difference is that}} most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of three-phase electric power with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as Chevrolet Volt / Opel Ampera).|$|R
50|$|After rejoining the navy, Johnstone {{signed on}} as master of the HMS Chatham, which would {{accompany}} George Vancouver in the HMS Discovery on an upcoming voyage to chart the Northwest coast of America. His old friend Menzies was appointed naturalist of the expedition. The two ships left in April 1791, reaching {{what is now the}} U.S. state of Washington in the spring of 1792. During the next three summers (1792, 1793, and 1794), Johnstone would lead many of the boat parties that surveyed the intricate coastline that makes up much of the region. During the first summer, besides helping to chart Hood Canal and exploring up Bute and Loughborough <b>Inlets,</b> as <b>well</b> as Fitz Hugh Sound and Burke Channel, Johnstone, early in July, discovered what Vancouver later named Johnstone Strait in his honor.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the total water volume entering a lagoon during a characteristic tidal cycle (i. e., the prism) {{and the size of}} its <b>inlet</b> is <b>well</b> established empirically since the classic work of O’Brien and Jarrett widely cited in the geomorphic and hydrodynamic literature. Less known is a rather deep theoretical explanation proposed by Marchi. This paper reviews the empirical and theoretical evidence on which the relation is based, setting the various theoretical approaches so far pursued within the general framework ensured by Marchi’s theoretical treatment of the problem. We conclude that the depth of the empirical and theoretical validations and the breadth and the importance of its implications suggest that the O’Brien–Jarrett–Marchi law relating the minimum inlet cross-sectional area and the tidal prism flowing through it may be referred to thereinafter...|$|R
