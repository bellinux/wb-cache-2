He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies. The following year, much to his father's disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an [...] "unholy trade", and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters. In contrast to his father's rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art. He wrote his goal in his diary: [...] "in my art <b>I</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> explain life and its meaning to myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 160 years Wirt's {{account was}} taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to {{question}} the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction. Contemporary historians observe that Henry was known to have used fear of Indian and slave revolts in promoting military action against the British and that, according to the only written first-hand account of the speech, Henry used some graphic name-calling that Wirt did not include in his heroic rendition. Tucker's account was based upon recollections and not notes several decades after the speech; he wrote, [...] "In vain should <b>I</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> give any idea of his speech". Scholars have argued {{to what extent the}} speech we know is the work of Wirt or Tucker.|$|E

40|$|During {{this summer}} <b>I</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> better {{understand}} the political philosophy of the historian Leo Strauss. To do this, I broke my research into three distinct sections. First, I focused on Strauss?s political philosophy by <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> understand his criticisms of modernity and understanding of classical philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. Second, I focused on Strauss and art of esoteric and exoteric writing. Third, <b>I</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> locate Strauss on a contemporary political spectrum; in this vein <b>I</b> also <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> gauge what role, if any, Strauss hoped to have in American politics...|$|R
