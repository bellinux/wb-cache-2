5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E

5|$|In pregnancy, {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> TSH between 2.5 and 10mIU/l with {{a normal}} thyroxine level, while those with TSH above 10mIU/l {{are considered to be}} overtly hypothyroid even if the thyroxine level is normal. Antibodies against TPO may be important in making decisions about treatment, and should, therefore, be determined in women with abnormal thyroid function tests.|$|E

5|$|A double-double <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{performance}} {{in which a}} player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points and assists. Double-doubles are fairly common in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E

There are only two known quintuple-doubles, both only done at the high-school level. The first was recorded by Tamika Catchings of Duncanville High School (Duncanville, Texas) with 25points, 18rebounds, 11assists, 10steals and 10blocks in 1997. The second was by Aimee Oertner of Northern Lehigh High School (Slatington, Pennsylvania), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11 blocks on January 7, 2012.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> commutative division ring.|$|E

The gamma function <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> integral from zero to infinity. This contrasts with the lower incomplete gamma function, which <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> integral from zero to a variable upper limit. Similarly, the upper incomplete gamma function <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> integral from a variable lower limit to infinity.|$|R

A URI reference <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E

Tolbert's predecessors included John and Margaret Larson, who both served as mayor from 1980 to 1990 and 2003 to 2011, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E

5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year that Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} their theory, G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair. Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure.|$|E

A microzone <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic receptive field. Microzones were found to contain {{on the order of}} 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, narrow strip, oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them at right angles.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E

This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, {{the owner}} of the club, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research gave the project of {{building}} a new sports city to the Spanish company TriArena. They are constructing a main football stadium with a capacity of 16,000 spectators and an area of 71,150 m². The project also includes two tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball court, a fustal pitch, a handball court, a hotel, restaurants, and a covered swimming pool. Al-Talaba <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sports club, not just a football one, and it has supported other sports at minor level only in the past. The foundation stone was laid by the former minister of higher education and scientific research, Ali al-Adeeb, in February 2014. The cost of the project is estimated to be $84 million and the duration of construction was expected to be 30 months, meaning that by 2017 the Al-Talaba Sports City should be open. Due to the financial crisis in Iraq, the project was scratched after spending $4 million on designs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after {{a finite number of}} steps.
