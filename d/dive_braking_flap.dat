50|$|<b>Dive</b> <b>brakes</b> or <b>dive</b> <b>flaps</b> are {{deployed}} {{to slow down}} an aircraft when in a dive. They often consist of a metal flap that is lowered against the air flow, thus creating drag and reducing dive speed.|$|R

50|$|In {{the past}} <b>dive</b> <b>brakes</b> were mostly used on dive bombers, which needed to dive very steeply, but without {{exceeding}} their red line speed, {{in order to}} drop their bombs accurately. The airbrakes or spoilers fitted to gliders often function both as landing aids, to adjust the approach angle, {{and to keep the}} aircraft's speed below its maximum permissible indicated air speed in a vertical dive. Most modern combat aircraft are equipped with air brakes, which perform the same function as <b>dive</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There was {{a desire}} for the Do 217 {{to be capable of}} {{performing}} dive bombing, so it was therefore fitted with the aforementioned, tail-mounted <b>dive</b> <b>brakes,</b> with dorsal and ventral panels that were hinged, [...] "clamshell"-fashion, at the extreme rear of the tail extension they emerged from. This could not be made to function adequately in the early models however, and was omitted until the Do 217 E-2 entered service. When this mark reached service, use of the <b>dive</b> <b>brake</b> was found to sometimes overstrain the rear fuselage, so it was often removed.|$|R

40|$|These {{two reports}} are surveys on the {{progress}} and present state of development of dive-control flaps for gliders and airplanes.

Pressure records confirm a two-dimensional load distribution along the brake-flap surface Aerodynamically, the location of the <b>brake</b> <b>flaps</b> along the span is of importance for reasons of avoidance of vibration and oscillation phenomena on control and tail surfaces; statically, because of the magnitude of the frontal drag in diving with respect to the bending moments, which may become decisive for the dimensions of the wing attachment and for the wing covering...|$|R

2500|$|Since {{appropriations}} {{were available}} for an attack aircraft, Echols specified modifications to the P-51 {{to turn it into}} a dive bomber. The contract for 500 A-36A aircraft fitted with bomb racks, <b>dive</b> <b>brakes,</b> and heavier-duty wing, was signed by Kelsey on 16 April 1942, even before the first flight of the first production P-51 in May 1942. With orders on the books, North American Aviation (NAA) began modifying the P-51 to accept the bomb shackles which had already been tested in a [...] "long-range ferry" [...] program that the RAF had stipulated. Engineering studies totaling 40,000 hours and wind tunnel testing with a ⅛-scale model were completed in June 1942. Utilizing the basic P-51 airframe and Allison engine, structural reinforcing [...] "beefed up" [...] several high stress areas and [...] "a set of hydraulically operated <b>dive</b> <b>brakes</b> were installed in each main wing plane". Due to the slightly inboard placement of the bomb racks and unique installation of four cast aluminum <b>dive</b> <b>brakes,</b> a complete redesign of the P-51 wing was required.|$|R
2500|$|The 1-23H was {{designed}} by adding balanced <b>dive</b> <b>brakes</b> to the [...] "G", designing a square fin and rudder to replace the rounded ones found on earlier models, adding removable wingtips plus other minor changes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dive</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{employed}} on many designs to create drag which slowed the aircraft in its dive and increased accuracy. Air brakes on modern aircraft {{function in a}} similar manner in bleeding off excessive speed.|$|R

50|$|The XBK {{dive bomber}} program was {{initiated}} in February 1944 with {{a contract for}} two prototypes. To keep the aircraft size down, {{it was decided that}} all stores would be carried externally. A radar could be carried underneath the left wing. The <b>dive</b> <b>brakes</b> were of the lower and upper picket fence type at the inboard wing trailing edge. The horizontal tail was mounted on the tailfin above the fuselage. This feature avoided empennage buffet when the <b>dive</b> <b>brakes</b> were open. The placement of the engine exhausts was unusual, being almost aft of the cockpit. It was hoped that this feature would significantly decrease drag.|$|R
