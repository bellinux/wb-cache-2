5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k <b>if</b> <b>and</b> if they are different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k <b>if</b> <b>and</b> only if it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable <b>if</b> <b>and</b> {{only if it is}} K'k-colorable.|$|E

We show how to generate <b>IFs</b> <b>and</b> GIFs and prove that GIFs include minimum ESOPs.

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra.

More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, <b>if</b> <b>and</b> {{only if it is}} a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
