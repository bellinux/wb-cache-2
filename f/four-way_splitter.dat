40|$|An {{apparatus}} that generates four signals at a frequency of 7. 1 GHz having precisely controlled relative phases and equal amplitudes {{has been designed}} and built. This apparatus is intended mainly for use in computer-controlled automated calibration and testing of a phase-comparison digital tracker (PCDT) that measures the relative phases of replicas of the same X-band signal received by four antenna elements in an array. (The relative direction of incidence of the signal on the array is then computed from the relative phases.) The present apparatus {{can also be used}} to generate precisely phased signals for steering a beam transmitted from a phased antenna array. The apparatus (see figure) includes a 7. 1 -GHz signal generator, the output of which is fed to a <b>four-way</b> <b>splitter.</b> Each of the four splitter outputs is attenuated by 10 dB and fed as input to a vector modulator, wherein DC bias voltages are used to control the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal components. The bias voltages are generated by digital-to-analog- converter circuits on a control board that receives its digital control input from a computer running a LabVIEW program. The outputs of the vector modulators are further attenuated by 10 dB, then presented at high-grade radio-frequency connectors. The attenuation reduces the effects of changing mismatch and reflections. The apparatus was calibrated in a process in which the bias voltages were first stepped through all possible IQ settings. Then in a reverse interpolation performed by use of MATLAB software, a lookup table containing 3, 600 IQ settings, representing equal amplitude and phase increments of 0. 1, was created for each vector modulator. During operation of the apparatus, these lookup tables are used in calibrating the PCDT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{the design and}} {{fabrication}} of one element and four element printed dipole for smart antenna application is discussed. The design of the single element printed dipole on a substrate RT Duroid 5880 of dielectric constant 2. 2, its subsequent development into four element array and the realization of a suitable power divider network to feed the array. The <b>four-way</b> power <b>splitter</b> is attained using Wilkinson type power dividers, which improves the isolation and matching of the ports. This {{is followed by a}} computer simulation in order to optimize the design. The antenna array and the feed networks are then fabricated using this optimized design. The fabricated array is tested to confirm the simulated results. The working of the complete unit is analyzed. The software used for antenna simulation is IE 3 D, electromagnetic simulation and optimization software. Printed dipole antenna simulated in S band (2. 7 GHz). The four element array forms the prototype or basic building block of larger arrays that are used in various applications such as satellite communications, missiles, telemetry, and aircraft antennas. The basic aim of using printed dipole antennas is that they are small and can be mounted on the surface of satellites and instruments in other applications, reducing the weight and the cost.

40|$|The lower hybrid (LH) {{launcher}} configuration {{has been}} redesigned {{to integrate the}} functions of the vertical <b>four-way</b> power <b>splitter</b> and the front waveguide array (front array). This permits 256 waveguide channels to be fed by only 64 waveguides at the vacuum window interface. The resulting configuration is a more compact coupler, which incorporates the simplicity of a multijunction coupler while preserving the spectral flexibility of a conventional lower hybrid launcher. Other spin-offs of the redesign are reduction in thermal incompatibility between the front array and vacuum windows, improved maintainability, in situ vacuum window replacement, a reduced number of radio frequency (rf) connections, and a weight reduction of 7300 kg. There should be a significant cost reduction as well. Issues associated with the launcher design and fabrication have been addressed by a research and development program that includes brazing of the front array and testing of the power splitter configuration to confirm that phase errors due to reflections in the shorted splitter legs will not significantly impact the rf spectrum. The Conceptual Design Review requires that radiation levels at the torus radial port mounting flange and outer surface of the toroidal field coils should be sufficiently low to permit hands-on maintenance. Low activation materials and neutron shielding are incorporated in the launcher design to meet these requirements. The launcher is configured to couple 3 MW of steady state LH heating/LH current drive power at 3. 7 GHz to the Tokamak Physics Experiment plasma...|$|R
40|$|A 5 -GHz {{steady-state}} lower hybrid (LH) {{current drive}} (LHCD) system is planned to support steady-state and advanced tokamak operation on the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) experiment. As an initial phase, a pulsed 5 -GHz, 500 -kW LHCD {{system has been}} installed in KS TAR for basic experimental studies of the LH coupling and flux saving in the plasma current ramp-up, prior to long-pulse noninductive operation in KS TAR. A Toshiba-made klystron developed in collaboration with Pohang University of Science and Technology in 2006 is utilized for the initial KSTAR LHCD system. The LH launcher is designed as a fully active wave guide grill type with a parallel refractive index n(parallel to) value ranging from 1. 8 to 4. 3 and with high directivity. In the initial stage, the LH launcher consists of eight columns of <b>four-way</b> power <b>splitters</b> and two columns of dummy wave guides, one on each side. The operational n(parallel to) value is fixed at 2. 1 but can be adjusted by replacing wave guide components external to the vacuum vessel. Since the target operation pulse duration of the initial LHCD system is 2 s with an output power of 500 kW at the klystron window, the prototype klystron was recently successfully conditioned to a radio frequency power of 514 kW for a maximum pulse duration of 3 s using a matched dummy load (voltage standing wave ratio of 1. 16 : 1). This paper presents {{the progress of the}} initial KS TAR LHCD system and the performance test results of the prototype klystron. The research plan aiming at steady-state LHCD operation in KS TAR is also described in this paperclose 3...|$|R
