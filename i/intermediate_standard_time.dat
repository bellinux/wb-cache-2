30|$|Calibration metal {{standard}} solutions {{were prepared}} {{for each of the}} metals from an <b>intermediate</b> <b>standard</b> solution containing 10  mg/L which was prepared from the atomic absorption spectroscopy standard stock solutions that contained 1000  mg/L. These <b>intermediate</b> <b>standards</b> were diluted with deionized water to obtain four working standards for each metal of interest. Then, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Fe, Co, Cr, Pb and Cd were analyzed with FAAS (Buck Scientific Model 210 GP) equipped with deuterium arc background corrector and standard air-acetylene flame system using external calibration curve. Three replicate determinations were carried out on each sample. All the eleven metals were determined by absorption/concentration mode and the instrument readout was recorded for each solution manually. The same analytical procedure was employed for the determination of elements in digested blank solutions.|$|R

These <b>intermediate</b> <b>standards</b> were diluted with deionized water to obtain four working standards for each metal of interest. The absorbances of the working standard solutions were measured and the calibration curves {{for each of the}} analyte metal (Ca, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) were constructed.

5000|$|The <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> Act of 1918 {{authorized}} the Interstate Commerce Commission to define each time zone.

50|$|In Ireland, the <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> Act 1968 legally {{established}} that the time for general purposes in the State (to be known as <b>standard</b> <b>time)</b> shall be one hour in advance of Greenwich mean time throughout the year. This act was amended by the <b>Standard</b> <b>Time</b> (Amendment) Act 1971, which legally established Greenwich Mean Time as a winter time period. Ireland therefore operates one hour behind <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> during the winter period, and reverts to <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> in the summer months. This is defined {{in contrast to the}} other states in the European Union, which operate one hour ahead of <b>standard</b> <b>time</b> during the summer period, but produces the same end result.|$|R
