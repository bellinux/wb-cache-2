The occurrence of one cot death makes it likely that the family in question has such conditions, and the probability of subsequent deaths is therefore greater than the group average.

Rather than using a composite or aggregative index, we define the vulnerability index as the probability of facing non-zero deaths due to severe cyclones and calculate the indexes from a cyclone impact (human casualty) function using both Logit and Poisson specifications. We use human casualty data of the Super cyclone of Oct 1999 in India and other geo-physical and socioeconomic data for the same year and study the 262 villages lying within 10 km of the coast in Kendrapada district, a highly vulnerable district in India. We find 112 to 132 villages qualifying as least vulnerable with a <b>death</b> <b>probability</b> of less than 0. 1; 72 - 82 villages as moderately vulnerable with a <b>death</b> <b>probability</b> ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 3; 34 - 37 villages rated as more vulnerable with a <b>death</b> <b>probability</b> in between 0. 3 to 0. 5; and 21 to 34 villages displaying high vulnerability with a <b>death</b> <b>probability</b> greater than 0. 5.

40|$|Background: TOPALS {{is a new}} {{relational}} model for smoothing and projecting age schedules. The model is operationally simple, flexible, and transparent. Objective: This article demonstrates how TOPALS {{can be used for}} both smoothing and projecting age-specific mortality for 26 European countries and compares the results of TOPALS with those of other smoothing and projection methods. Methods: TOPALS uses a linear spline to describe the ratios between the age-specific <b>death</b> <b>probabilities</b> of a given country and a standard age schedule. For smoothing purposes I use the average of <b>death</b> <b>probabilities</b> over 15 Western European countries as standard, whereas for projection purposes I use an age schedule of ‘best practice’ mortality. A partial adjustment model projects how quickly the <b>death</b> <b>probabilities</b> move {{in the direction of the}} best-practice level of mortality. Results: On average, TOPALS performs better than the Heligman-Pollard model and the Brass relational method in smoothing mortality age schedules. TOPALS can produce projections that are similar to those of the Lee-Carter method, but can easily be used to produce alternative scenarios as well. This article presents three projections of life expectancy at birth for the year 2060 for 26 European countries. The Baseline scenario assumes a continuation of the past trend in each country, the Convergence scenario assumes that there is a common trend across European countries, and the Acceleration scenario assumes that the future decline of <b>death</b> <b>probabilities</b> will exceed that in the past. The Baseline scenario projects that average European life expectancy at birth will increase to 80 years for men and 87 years for women in 2060, whereas the Acceleration scenario projects an increase to 90 and 93 years respectively. Conclusions: TOPALS is a useful new tool for demographers for both smoothing age schedules and making scenarios...|$|R
30|$|The {{estimation}} of life expectancy requires the {{estimation of}} death rates beyond the age sample. By design, the LC model cannot be used to estimate death rates outside of the age sample. A potential {{solution to this problem}} is to use a parametric mortality model, such as the Kannisto law model (Kannisto 1996), and to combine it with the LC estimations of death rates (Ševčíková et al. 2016; Antonio et al. 2017; Bohk-Ewald et al. 2017). When using the CoDe 2.1 model, we do not encounter this problem because the estimates of the <b>death</b> <b>probabilities</b> at higher ages stem from Eqs. 1 and 2. Moreover, in the CoDe 2.1 model, the <b>death</b> <b>probabilities</b> level off at higher ages and asymptotically approach the value of parameter g.

40|$|The Penna {{model is}} a {{strategy}} to simulate the genetic dynamics of age-structured populations, in which the individuals genomes are represented by bit-strings. It provides a simple metaphor for the evolutionary process {{in terms of the}} mutation accumulation theory. In its original version, an individual dies due to inherited diseases when its current number of accumulated mutations, n, reaches a threshold value, T. Since the number of accumulated diseases increases with age, the probability to die is zero for very young ages (n = T). Here, instead of using a step function to determine the genetic death age, we test several other functions {{that may or may not}} slightly increase the <b>death</b> <b>probability</b> at young ages (n < T), but that decreases this probability at old ones. Our purpose is to study the oldest old effect, that is, a plateau in the mortality curves at advanced ages. Imposing certain conditions, it has been possible to obtain a clear plateau using the Penna model. However, a more realistic one appears when a modified version, that keeps the population size fixed without fluctuations, is used.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMany {{unicellular}} organisms age: as time passes, they divide {{more slowly}} and ultimately die. In budding yeast, asymmetric segregation of cellular damage results in aging mother cells and rejuvenated daughters. We hypothesize that the organisms {{in which this}} asymmetry is lacking, or can be modulated, may not undergo aging. ResultsWe performed a complete pedigree analysis of microcolonies of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe growing from a single cell. When cells were grown under favorable conditions, none of the lineages exhibited aging, which {{is defined as a}} consecutive increase in division time and increased <b>death</b> <b>probability.</b> Under favorable conditions, few cells died, and their death was random and sudden rather than following a gradual increase in division time. Cell death correlated with the inheritance of Hsp 104 -associated protein aggregates. After stress, the cells that inherited large aggregates aged, showing a consecutive increase in division time and an increased <b>death</b> <b>probability.</b> Their sisters, who inherited little or no aggregates, did not age. ConclusionsWe conclude that S.  pombe does not age under favorable growth conditions, but does so under stress. This transition appears to be passive rather than active and results from the formation of a single large aggregate, which segregates asymmetrically at the subsequent cell division. We argue that this damage-induced asymmetric segregation has evolved to sacrifice some cells so that others may survive unscathed after severe environmental stresses...|$|E
