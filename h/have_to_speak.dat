5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with NPCs and then {{figure out a way to}} help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E
500|$|Several {{journalists have}} {{commented on the}} {{apparent}} conflict between the group's sexualized and often violent lyrics and their stated spiritual message. In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] the stuff that {{people are talking about}} on the streets...to get attention, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E
500|$|Brittany's role in {{the show}} was {{initially}} intended to be minor, but grew {{towards the end of}} the first season. She does not have any solo musical performances during season one, but Morris hoped she would have one in the second season. On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun. I literally just stand there and doze off and then I'm like, 'Oh yeah, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> now! At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated that Brittany would have [...] "big storylines" [...] in the new season, as viewers want to know more about her.|$|E

500|$|Most of the band's improvisations on Black Beauty {{centered}} around vamps or themes Davis introduced and restated during the performance. According to Davis scholar Paul Tingen, {{the record is}} filled with [...] "coded phrases" [...] he played on his trumpet to signify a change from one composition to the next. [...] "The music would be continuous so Miles wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and announce things to the audience", DeJohnette recalled. [...] "He'd just speak with his horn and just cue the numbers by stating the front part of the melody, and then we automatically knew, which was great, because {{he wanted it to}} be a seamless kind of thing." [...] Holland, who played both acoustic and electric bass at the show, elaborated on the tradition of using such musical signals in jazz and their use in Davis' group: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the initial}} Persona 4 game, the main player-controlled {{character}} is {{known simply as}} the [...] "Protagonist" [...] or [...] "Hero", whose name is decided by the player. The name [...] "Yu Narukami" [...] was first given to the character in the 2011 anime adaptation, , and has since been used in official games where the character is unable to be named by the player, beginning with Persona 4 Arena. Prior to this, {{he was given the}} name of Sōji Seta in the game's manga adaptation. In an interview, game director Katsura Hashino drew attention {{to the way in which}} the Protagonist remains silent and emotionless throughout the game. This leaves the player to interpret the Protagonist's emotional reactions subjectively at any particular point. Hashino elaborated on this particular character trait becoming an obstacle for Persona 4: The Animations director Seiji Kishi, since the character would undoubtedly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and show some level of emotion. In the same interview, Kishi admitted the difficulty of transitioning the silent Protagonist into the anime without destroying what Hashino had already established.|$|E
500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> up {{and you have to be}} able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

500|$|The first lap {{collision}} between Kvyat and Vettel {{that put}} the latter {{out of the race}} was a major talking point afterwards. The two had already been embroiled in an argument after the previous Grand Prix in China, when Vettel felt that Kvyat had caused a collision between the two Ferrari drivers. This time around, Vettel reacted to his retirement with what The Telegraph described as [...] "one of the most explosive outbursts heard over team radio for years". He later demanded an apology from Kvyat, as did Red Bull teammate Ricciardo, who felt that Kvyat, who pushed Vettel into him, had ruined his race as well. Red Bull announced that they would summon Kvyat to talks about the incident, calling their race a [...] "disaster", with Helmut Marko, the team's young driver coordinator, calling him [...] "over-motivated". Kvyat received three penalty points on his licence {{as a result of the}} incident. He himself said after the race: [...] "I apologise to everyone who is involved and I will learn from it. I think we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> It is easy now to attack me and I guess everyone will, but I am OK with that." ...|$|E
