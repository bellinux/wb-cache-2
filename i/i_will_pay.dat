A report from the Senate Finance Committee documented Geithner's errors. While working for IMF, Geithner signed a tax worksheet stating his [...] "obligation of the U.S. Social Security tax, which <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> on my fund income" [...] and another annual worksheet stating [...] "I wish to apply for tax allowance of U.S. federal and state income taxes {{and the difference between}} the 'self-employed' and 'employed' obligation of the U.S. Social Security tax which <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> on my Fund income." ...|$|E

In 2014, Peabody emailed the Hawaii NAACP {{and two other}} African American Hawaiian groups requesting copies of their birth certificates, writing: [...] "If you or your Negro members were born in Hawaii between 1955 to 1965, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> $50 {{for a copy of}} your Hawaii long form certified birth certificate." [...] Peabody wrote that his goal was to [...] "expose the fraud" [...] at Hawaii Department of Health, later claiming that the state's birth certificate for the president was [...] "clearly ... a fraud." [...] The recipients were angered by Peabody's actions, saying they were racist.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a hundred miles away, where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E
