5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{airborne}} assault on 20 May, the 2/7th became heavily engaged fighting German parachute troops around Canea. It then undertook a local counter-attack at 42nd Street {{during which the}} 2/7th launched a ferocious bayonet charge {{in concert with the}} New Zealand Maori Battalion that resulted in heavy German casualties. The 2/7th later covered the withdrawal to Sphakia where the Royal Navy attempted to evacuate the garrison by the sea, undertaking a three-day stand in the hills, before they were ordered down to the evacuation beaches. As Allied naval losses mounted the operation was called off before the 2/7th could embark. As a result, most of the battalion – over 400 personnel – was taken prisoner. Several 2/7th soldiers later escaped captivity; one of them, John Peck, became part of a Special Operations Executive team responsible for helping Allied prisoners of war escape. The battalion's commanding officer, Walker, was one of those captured, giving up his position on one of the last evacuation ships when it became apparent {{that the rest of the}} battalion would not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> clear. Walker remained in captivity until the end of the war, along with many others of the battalion who went to prisoner of war camps in Greece, Germany, Austria and Poland.|$|E

25|$|Hopkinson did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{acquainted with}} the House {{before the end of}} the war pitched him into a {{re-election}} battle. Owing to boundary changes he fought the new Mossley constituency where he was adopted as a Liberal who supported David Lloyd George's governing Coalition. However, during the campaign he said that calling himself the Coalition candidate did not bind him to supporting the Coalition, and that he might oppose anything the government did. He insisted that he had merely taken the 'badge' of the Coalition for the good of the country. Hopkinson faced opposition only from the Co-operative Party and won with more than 75% of the vote.|$|E
500|$|... "Jackie was {{a college}} educated {{man who had been}} an officer in the service and who played at the Triple-A level. Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey {{specifically}} to be the first black player in major league baseball. Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn't <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his full college education, and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season. I think, because of those circumstances, he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson. I don't think he has gotten the credit he deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{shortly before}} dawn on May 12, Union forces {{comprising}} three full divisions (Major General Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps) attacked the Mule Shoe through heavy fog, taking the Confederate forces by surprise. Exhaustion, inadequate food, lack of artillery support, and wet powder from the night's rain {{contributed to the}} collapse of the Confederate position as the Union forces swarmed out of the mist, overwhelming Steuart's men and effectively putting an end to the Virginia Brigade. Confederate muskets would not fire due to damp powder, and apart from two remaining artillery pieces, the Southerners were effectively without firearms. During the thick of the fierce hand-to-hand fighting that followed, Steuart was forced to surrender to Colonel James A. Beaver of the 148th Pennsylvania Infantry. Beaver asked Steuart [...] "Where is your sword, sir?", to which the general replied, with considerable sarcasm, [...] "Well, suh, you all waked us up so early this mawnin' that I didn't <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it on." [...] Steuart was brought to General Hancock, who had seen Steuart's wife Maria in Washington before the battle and wished to give her news of her husband. He extended his hand, asking [...] "how are you, Steuart?" [...] But Steuart refused to shake Hancock's hand; although the two men had been friends before the war, they were now enemies. Steuart said: [...] "Considering the circumstance, General, I refuse to take your hand", to which Hancock is said to have replied, [...] "And under any other circumstance, General, I would have refused to offer it." [...] After this episode, an offended Hancock then left Steuart to march to the Union rear with the other prisoners.|$|E

2500|$|When the attacking wave {{was twenty}} metres from the dyke the bugles sounded the charge, {{and the two}} marine {{infantry}} companies stormed the embankment. [...] Taccoën's company, leading the way, lost 5 men killed and 10 wounded in its approach. [...] Guérin de Fontjoyeux's men suffered almost as heavily, and two lieutenants were also killed during the assault. [...] But the attack was so rapid that around fifty Black Flags, who had been lying on their backs asleep, did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to their feet, and were pinned {{to the ground with}} bayonet thrusts. [...] The surviving Chinese fled across the rice paddies. [...] The French killed many of them with rifle fire as they fled.|$|E
2500|$|Through {{the course}} of the fall and spring letter of intent days, the Cougars would bolster their lineup. On November 11, Coach Rose {{announced}} that Cory Calvert and Jordan Chatman had signed letters of intent to play for BYU. He revealed then that both Calvert and Chatman planned to serve church missions before joining the team, meaning they wouldn't become part of the BYU team until the 201415 season. Freshman Cooper Ainge, son of former BYU great Danny Ainge, announced he would walk-on at BYU. He plans to play for 1 year before departing on a mission. The spring national Letter of Intent Signing Days began on April 10, 2012 and ran through May 16. On the first day of eligibility, Raúl Delgado and Agustín Ambrosino signed letters of intent. Both will come in as juniors and have two years of eligibility. [...] On April 20, it was announced that Cory Calvert would play one season before going on his mission, just as Ainge is doing, because he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into playing shape for the 201415 season after his mission.|$|E

6000|$|Siona, {{who was now}} {{distinctly}} coquetting with Wayland, {{held out}} her hand. [...] "I hope you'll find <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come up and see us. I know we have other mutual friends, if we <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she murmured, meditatively, {{looking up}} the street as if that would settle it. [...] "If it's only half-past three now, I should <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> home more naturally." ...|$|E
