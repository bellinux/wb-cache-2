5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out,</b> owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to explain {{that he was doing}} {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out</b> of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that he worried about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out.</b> Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

The city would then try to recoup its costs for the facility from lease payments by Cirrus over time. The city is concerned that without the government support Cirrus will locate jet production elsewhere due to better incentives. This was confirmed by Cirrus CEO Dale Klapmeier and Duluth Mayor Don Ness, who both indicated that time <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out</b> for the state to commit funds.|$|E
25|$|An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela {{places her}} son and {{daughter}} with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. Encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth {{he claims to have}} has not appeared, the patience of the legacy-hunters <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out.</b> Eumolpus's will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body. In the final passage preserved, historical examples of cannibalism are cited (141).|$|E

25|$|In California, Republican gubernatorial {{candidate}} John Kory {{is trying to}} raise his dismal poll numbers. Sunny Kurishingal, Kory's chief adviser, <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out</b> of ideas to ensure Kory's victory. Sunny asks Francis Kunjappan, a Public Works Department minister in Kerala and his friend, for advice on hiring a political consultant. Kunjappan, recommends his friend (and political rival) Jagannathan, hoping to rid himself {{of a threat to}} his ministerial position. Jagannathan, a young politician and sports enthusiast, knows no English but has a talent for solving serious problems prudently (as Kunjappan knows firsthand). However, Kunjappan thinks that Jaganathan’s unorthodox ideas will fail in the United States. Kunjappan meets Jagannathan and offers him the job for 30 crore (300 million), enough to realize Jagannathan's dream project of a sports academy. Jagannathan accepts the assignment and flies to the US with his assistants, Pottakuzhi Jabbar and Vayalar Varkey.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Time Is On My Side", Dean discovers Bela {{no longer}} has the Colt. He later gets her {{criminal}} record from England and learns her true name is Abbie. Almost ten years prior, when she was 14, she had her parents killed in exchange for her soul as part of a ten-year deal made with a Crossroads Demon; though Dean believes that she killed them to inherit their fortune and Bela supports this story, the audience is shown a flashback that suggests that she had actually agreed to the deal to escape abuse from her father. Now desperate because her time <b>is</b> <b>running</b> <b>out,</b> Bela tries to kill the Winchesters, but they anticipate her and escape ahead of time. Dean then calls her a few minutes before her deal is up and she confesses to him she tried {{to get out of the}} deal with the Crossroads Demon by trading the Colt. Once she gave it up, however, the deal changed so she had to kill Sam as well. Though Dean refuses her pleas for help, she reveals to him the demon Lilith holds all the contracts brokered by Crossroads Demons, including his own. Bela's deathand her soul's resulting descent into Hellis inevitable, but not shown.|$|E

2500|$|Thomson sailed {{on board}} the cable-laying ship [...] in August 1857, with Whitehouse {{confined}} to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after [...] when the cable parted.
