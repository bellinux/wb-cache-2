40|$|We {{consider}} the K 3 surfaces that arise as double covers of the elliptic modular surface of level 5, $R_{ 5, 5 }$. Such surfaces {{have a natural}} elliptic fibration induced by the fibration on $R_{ 5, 5 }$. Moreover, they admit several other elliptic fibrations. We describe such fibrations in terms <b>of</b> linear <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> on $R_{ 5, 5 }$. This has a major advantage over other methods of classification of elliptic fibrations, namely, a simple algorithm that has as input equations <b>of</b> linear <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> in the projective plane yields a Weierstrass equation for each elliptic fibration. We deal in detail with the cases for which the double cover is branched over the two reducible fibers of type $I_ 5 $ and {{for which it is}} branched over two smooth fibers, giving a complete list of elliptic fibrations for these two scenarios.
