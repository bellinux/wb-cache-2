The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even {{to the extent that}} an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it. Rosalind Krauss espoused this concept <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. Mieke Bal argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.|$|E

In Chronicle of a Death Foretold, according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language. However, The General in His Labyrinth [...] "differs from these earlier works in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and didactic fashion questions that the novel poses about history".|$|E
500|$|Goldman {{was also}} a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the {{treatment}} of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure", she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors Fyodor Dostoevsky and Oscar Wilde on prisons, and wrote: Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.|$|E
500|$|Many artists also {{traveled}} to the third notch, Franconia Notch, to paint. [...] A rivalry developed between the Franconia artists and the North Conway artists. [...] Each faction believed that their location had the most beautiful view of the mountains. [...] Those who preferred Franconia felt that North Conway, as early as 1857, had been overrun by tourists. [...] Barbara J. MacAdam, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "A Proper Distance from the Hills," [...] stated: [...] "To meet this growing demand , railroad lines were extended and new hotels constructed on a grand scale. [...] In the process, those qualities that had drawn artists to North Conway {{in the first place}} became endangered."

5000|$|More recently, {{some critics}} accused Alice Walker of unfairly attacking black men <b>in</b> <b>her</b> novel The Color Purple (1982). In his updated 1995 {{introduction}} to his novel Oxherding Tale, Charles Johnson criticized Walker's novel for its negative portrayal of African-American males: [...] "I {{leave it to}} readers to decide which book pushes harder at the boundaries of convention, and inhabits most confidently the space where fiction and philosophy meet." [...] Walker responded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>essays</b> The Same River Twice: Honoring the Difficult (1998).|$|R
500|$|Donaldson, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "The Last Temptation of Mulder", {{writes that}} in Kazantzakis' novel Jesus [...] "represents {{what is the}} utmost human challenge, that of {{releasing}} the divinity within from its earthly confines." [...] In this way, the Jesus of The Last Temptation of Christ represents [...] "utter humanity" [...] and the [...] "struggle between {{the spirit and the}} flesh". Mulder is similarly challenged when he is enticed by The Smoking Man, and overcomes temptation by giving up his dream life and embracing his destiny to stop the alien invasion. Several characters in the episode resemble those in the novel. For instance, Fowley is similar to Kazantzakis' version of Mary Magdalene—both characters [...] "thwart the mission" [...] of the hero. Scully parallels Kazantzakis' version of Judas Iscariot, as they both call the heroes out of their respective trances.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "The Audience as Auteur. Women, Star Trek and 'Vidding'" [...] in {{the book}} Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek: The Original Cast Adventures, Francesca Coppa said that she saw the switch from Number One to Chapel for Barrett as [...] "degradation on every level: role, status and image". The role was {{described}} as [...] "consolation" [...] in Cary O'Dell's book June Cleaver Was a Feminist!: Reconsidering the Female Characters of Early Television, but {{it was felt that}} Barrett [...] "made the most of it". The position of a nurse was described by O'Dell as a traditional female role, but that Chapel would stand up to McCoy's orders when required. Her promotion to Doctor in The Motion Picture was praised by author Gladys L. Knight in her book Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television.|$|E

While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album.

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "The Structure of the Moral Dilemma in Shiloh" [...] for Children's Literature, Claudia Mills {{wrote that}} Shiloh deals with [...] "consequentialism pitted against deontological respect for moral duty". Taught from his youth to be respectful {{to others and}} worship God, Marty is confounded by the {{injustice}} of Shiloh's being abused. He seeks to justify his unethical actions by thinking that [...] " [...] lie don't seem a lie anymore when it's meant to save a dog." [...] Consequentionalists base the worthiness of a person's act on its result. Marty's act of saving Shiloh is worse for Shiloh's well-being. After Shiloh is concealed in the woods, a German shepherd attacks the beagle, causing to become permanently lame. Marty laments: [...] "Worst of all, I'd brought Shiloh here {{to keep him from}} being hurt, and what that German shepherd done to him was probably worse than anything Judd Travers would have brought himself to do, short of shootin' him, anyways." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix" [...] {{professor}} of English Katherine Chandler {{points out that}} Potter, unlike most Victorian writers of children's books, wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour. Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales, making Miss Moppet {{nothing more than a}} story describing the natural behaviour of kittens. Potter's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty, yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the moral of the tale. At the end of Miss Moppet, the kitten is not punished and the mouse dances on the cupboard. This leads Chandler to quote literary scholar of modernism Humphrey Carpenter, [...] "there is nothing in [...] work that resembles the moral tale. In fact if might be argued that she is writing something pretty close to a series of immoral tales". In addition Chandler notes that Potter's economic use of prose presages modernism, comparing her writing to that of Ernest Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called Burger's Daughter a Bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story, {{although}} not the traditional ones which, according to Susan Gardner <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "Still Waiting for the Great Feminist Novel", {{are dominated by}} male protagonists. While Gordimer was not a feminist author and Burger's Daughter is not a feminist novel, Gardner suggests that the book has [...] "a discernible woman-concerned subtext", making it [...] "impossible for feminists to dismiss or ignore". She says it has [...] "a potential feminist awareness" [...] that is [...] "obscured by more conventional patriarchal writing codes". Yelin writes that {{after the death of}} Rosa's mother, the statement [...] "Already she had taken on her mother's role in the household, giving loving support to her father" [...] illustrates [...] "the continuing hegemony of bourgeois-patriarchal ideology" [...] in the novel. Yelin suggests that this inconsistency is responsible for Rosa's struggle, the [...] "contradiction between feminism (Rosa's liberation as a woman) and the struggle for justice in South Africa".|$|E
