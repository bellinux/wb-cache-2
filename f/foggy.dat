5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between <b>Foggy</b> Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers were unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in jigging) are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to illumination. They are especially abundant during the full moon and in <b>foggy</b> weather. Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal, {{and they can be}} fished throughout the year. They are also used as fish bait in hook and line fishing.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004 Kelly {{performed}} across North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. This {{was followed}} by a more extensive series of shows between July and September throughout North America and Europe. In December, in Melbourne, Kelly performed 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over two nights. A similar set of shows were performed in a studio at Sydney Opera House in December 2006, these and similar sets became known as his A to Z shows. <b>Foggy</b> Highway was a second bluegrass-oriented album for Kelly, credited to Paul Kelly and the Stormwater Boys and issued in 2005. It peaked at No.23 on the ARIA albums charts. The line-up {{for the majority of the}} tracks was Kelly, Mick Albeck (fiddle), James Gillard (bass guitar), Rod McCormack (guitar), Ian Simpson (banjo), and Trev Warner (mandolin). As with Smoke (his previous bluegrass release), <b>Foggy</b> Highway consisted of a mix of new compositions and rearranged Kelly classics. The Canadian edition of the release included a four-song bonus EP of out-takes.|$|E

5|$|Last of the Summer Wine {{focused on}} a trio of older men and their {{youthful}} antics. The original trio consisted of Compo Simmonite, Norman Clegg, and Cyril Blamire. Blamire left in 1976, when Michael Bates fell ill shortly before filming of the third series, requiring Clarke to hastily rewrite the series with a new third man. The third member of the trio would be recast four times {{over the next three}} decades: <b>Foggy</b> Dewhurst in 1976, Seymour Utterthwaite in 1986, <b>Foggy</b> again in 1990, and Truly Truelove in 1997. After Compo died in 1999, his son, Tom Simmonite, filled the gap for the rest of that series, and Billy Hardcastle joined the cast as the third lead character in 2001. The trio became a quartet between 2003 and 2006 when Alvin Smedley moved in next door to Nora Batty, but returned to the usual threesome in 2006 when Billy Hardcastle left the show. The role of supporting character Entwistle steadily grew until the beginning of the 30th series, when he and Alvin were recruited by Hobbo Hobdyke, a former milkman with ties to MI5, to form a new trio of volunteers who respond to any emergency.|$|E
5|$|Persona 4 {{takes place}} in a fictional Japanese {{countryside}} and is indirectly related to earlier Persona games. The player-named protagonist is a high-school student who moved into the countryside from the city for a year. During his year-long stay, he becomes involved in investigating mysterious murders while harnessing the power of summoning Persona. The game features a weather forecast system with events happening on <b>foggy</b> days to replace the moon phase system implemented in the previous games.|$|E
5|$|The <b>foggy</b> weather made it {{difficult}} to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, at least for a while.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, {{it is not uncommon}} to find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and <b>foggy</b> between yet another.

5|$|With leading paceman Ray Lindwall injured, Australiaâ€™s bowling {{stocks were}} {{stretched}} and Barnes was brought on during England's second innings {{and as the}} fifth bowler to give the others some time to rest. Barnes delivered five overs and conceded 11 runs. In <b>foggy</b> and misty conditions, Joe Hardstaff junior brought up England's 200 with a firmly-struck hook that almost hit Barnes, who was standing at point-blank range at short leg and could not duck before the ball went past.|$|E
5|$|A {{new stage}} {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and <b>Foggy,</b> the play featured the trio as they attempted {{to get to the}} bottom of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E
50|$|Although 34 km {{from the}} island capital, the airport was located here to avoid {{disturbing}} the Garajonay National Park and avoid the cloudier and <b>foggier</b> climate to the North of the island, whilst the volcanic terrain gives few suitable sites anywhere on La Gomera, although even this site required extensive embankments {{at both ends of}} the runway.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} couple years of Daredevil, <b>Foggy's</b> {{appearance}} greatly varied from issue to issue, though he was most commonly drawn as a trim, handsome, and neatly groomed young man. Since his first portrayal by Gene Colan, in Daredevil #20, he has consistently been drawn as a short, slightly pudgy man with a generally relaxed appearance.|$|R
50|$|The Arcata-Eureka Airport is a {{full service}} airport located in McKinleyville. The name of the airport comes from {{the names of the}} primary {{population}} centers that it serves. The location of this airport was chosen to serve as an experimental field to test landing during heavy fog conditions. Due to weather patterns and geographic conditions the area is one of the <b>foggiest</b> in Northern California.|$|R
5|$|At kickoff, a {{light breeze}} was blowing from the {{northeast}} at , the air temperature was , and the weather was <b>foggy</b> with a light rain. Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a <b>foggy</b> setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E
5|$|London {{has been}} the setting for many works of literature. The {{literary}} centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers {{closely associated with the}} city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a <b>foggy,</b> snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, {{regarded as one of the}} foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air speed indicator and altimeter failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by <b>foggy</b> weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety. Debris from the crash covered a quarter-mile of densely wooded swampland.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Sandra produced unseasonably heavy rains across parts of Central America, leading to flooding. In Nicaragua, flooding affected 55homes and destroyed 1, primarily in Managua. A total of 56families required evacuation. Local officials blamed the flooding on trash-clogged drains. Five {{people were injured}} in the Nueva Segovia Department when an ambulance crashed on a <b>foggy,</b> rain-slicked road. A landslide in Cucuyagua, Honduras, destroyed a home killing a 25-day-old baby and injuring four others.

5|$|According to legend, Boyce {{was lost}} on a <b>foggy</b> street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout {{came to his}} aid, guiding {{him back to his}} destination. The boy then refused Boyce's tip, {{explaining}} that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with Robert Baden-Powell, who {{was the head of the}} Boy Scout Association at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around American Indian lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.|$|E

For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently <b>foggy,</b> affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E
50|$|Although Nora often gives Compo {{the hard}} {{end of her}} broomstick, she does often display concern or {{kindness}} towards him.
