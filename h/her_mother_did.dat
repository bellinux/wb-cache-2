5|$|By 1994, Copeland's {{mother had}} {{separated}} from Robert. After living with various friends and boyfriends, DelaCerna moved {{with all of}} her children into two small rooms at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, California. In early 1996, Cantine convinced Copeland to attend a ballet class at her local Boys & Girls Club. Cynthia Bradley, a friend of Cantine's, taught a free ballet class at the club once a week. Copeland attended several classes as a spectator before participating. DelaCerna allowed Copeland {{to go to the}} club after school until the workday ended. Bradley invited Copeland to attend class at her small local ballet school, San Pedro Dance Center. Copeland initially declined the offer, however, because <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not have a car, was working 12–14 hours a day, and her oldest sister Erica was working two jobs. Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. After three months of study, Copeland was en pointe.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not care what they think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

According to some later accounts, she attended a masked ball in Brussels where she met the young Prince de Ligne, a young Belgian aristocrat, and had an affair with him. Other accounts say that they met in Paris, where the Prince came often to attend the theater. The affair was cut short when she learned that her mother had suffered a heart attack. She returned to Paris, where she found that her mother was better, but that she herself was pregnant from her affair with the Prince. She did not notify the Prince. <b>Her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not want the fatherless child born under her roof, so she moved to a small apartment on rue Duphot, and on 22 December 1864, the 20-year-old actress gave birth to her only child, Maurice Bernhardt.|$|E

She was married {{at the age of}} 14 to Agribrahmi, a nephew of Emperor Ashoka, who was also an Arhant. She had a son, Saamanera Sumana who also later became an Arhant and went along with his uncle Mahindra to Sri Lanka to preach Buddhism. Her teacher was Ayupala. She was ordained at the age of 18 into Theravada Buddhism Order by their preceptor Dhammapala. Her brother was also ordained at the same time. With her dedicated perseverance to Dhamma she became an Arhant Theri and resided in Pataliputra (now known as Patna).|$|E

He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo.

500|$|Enid Blyton {{was born}} on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ( [...] Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth Enid almost died from {{whooping}} cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he [...] "loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated {{when he left the}} family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics were}} {{dissatisfied}} with {{the scope of the}} novel. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Times Book Review wrote that thematically, there was no reason that a Greek should be an intersex or vice versa and that Eugenides had two disconnected stories to tell. Caly Risen of Flak Magazine believed that the immigrant experience was the [...] "heart of the novel", lamenting that it minimized the story of Callie/Cal who is such a [...] "fascinating character that the reader feels short-changed by his failure to take her/him further." [...] Risen wished to read more about the events between Cal's adolescence and adulthood, such as Cal's experience in college as an intersex person as well as the relationships he had. The Washington Posts Lisa Zeidner opined that Eugenides purposefully devised this asymmetry. Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic also felt that the brief description of Callie's childhood was lacking; the book [...] "gloss over" [...] how <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not recognize that Callie had male genitalia when she was washing or clothing Callie. Further, O'Nan characterized Cal's relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie as [...] "underdeveloped", causing the reader not to experience its entirety. Michelle Vellucci of People had the same view about the novel's end, writing that the conclusion felt [...] "rushed".|$|E
500|$|Whereas most of {{the other}} female {{characters}} in EastEnders were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working class way, Pauline Fowler was the exception to the rule, being the sole character to represent the [...] "homely and domestic" [...] side of the Beale family. As the serial progressed, the character altered from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre battle-axe, hardened by a life of misery in Albert Square. Other characters refer to her as [...] "Fowler the growler", and in the Evening Gazette she was described as [...] "the Boadicea of battle-axes." [...] The initial change in her demeanour is traced back to the death of her mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a [...] "rod of iron". Following Lou's screen funeral in July 1988, Pauline retorts, [...] "Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow," [...] a line that was used similarly by Lou in the episode that preceded her own death. This parallel symbolised the transference of the family's matriarchal role from Lou to Pauline. Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother, and former EastEnders executive producer John Yorke has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: [...] " [...] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death." ...|$|E

500|$|Eberhardt {{relocated}} to Bône {{with her mother}} in May 1897. They initially lived with David and his wife, who both disapproved {{of the amount of}} time Eberhardt and her mother spent with Arabs. Eberhardt and <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not like the Davids' attitude, which was typical of European settlers in the area, and later avoided the country's French residents, renting an Arabic-style house far from the European quarter. Eberhardt, aware that a Muslim woman could go out neither alone nor unveiled, dressed as a man in a burnous and turban. She expanded on her previous studies of Arabic, and became fluent within a few months. She and her mother converted to Islam. Mackworth writes that while Eberhardt was a [...] "natural mystic", her conversion appeared to be largely for practical reasons, as it gave her greater acceptance among the Arabs. Eberhardt found it easy to accept Islam; Trophimowsky had brought her up as a fatalist and Islam gave her fatalism a meaning. She embraced the Islamic concept that everything is predestined and the will of God. Although Eberhardt largely devoted herself to the Muslim way of life, she frequently partook of marijuana and alcohol and had many lovers. According to a friend, Eberhardt [...] "drank more than a Legionnaire, smoked more kief than a hashish addict and made love for the love of making love". She was considered heterosexual, though approached sexual intercourse with a traditionally masculine attitude, often treating it as impersonal. The reason for her Arabic companions' tolerance of her lifestyle has been debated by biographers. According to Mackworth, the [...] "delicate courtesy of the Arabs" [...] led them to treat Eberhardt as a man because she wished to live as one. Eberhardt's behaviour made her an outcast with the French settlers and the colonial administration, who watched her closely. Seeing no reason as to why a woman would choose the company of impoverished Arabs over her fellow Europeans, they eventually concluded she must be an English agent, sent to stir up resentment towards the French.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 it was {{claimed that}} the sheriff's office failed to {{properly}} investigate serious crimes, including the rape of a 14-year-old girl by classmates, and the rape of a 15-year-old girl by two strangers. These cases were reported as [...] "exceptionally cleared" [...] (solved) by the MCSO without investigation or, in one instance, without even identifying a suspect – in contravention of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standards for exceptional clearance. In {{the case of the}} 15-year-old girl, the case was closed within one month and before DNA testing was even complete, a 13-year-old's because <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not want to [...] "pursue this investigation," [...] and the 14-year-old's because a suspect declined to appear for questioning. In a statement to ABC15, the sheriff's office claimed [...] "The Goldwater Institute’s report cites the FBI’s Uniform Code [...] Reporting handbook, which is a voluntary crime-reporting program to compile statistical information and reports. The UCR is not intended for oversight on how law enforcement agencies clear cases... The Sheriff’s Office has its own criteria for clearing cases." [...] The Arizona Department of Public Safety, which serves as the repository for Arizona case clearance statistics, told 12 News that the guidelines in the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook are mandatory for all Arizona law enforcement agencies. Those guidelines specify that a case can be cleared by exception only when a perpetrator's identity and location is known and there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, but, due to special circumstances (such as the suspect dying, or extradition not being possible), an arrest cannot be made.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Bovis (Paul Shane) Camp Host – Ted was {{the camp}} host {{and was very}} popular with the campers. He ran every event – the {{entertainment}} manager just introduced the events. He was born in November 1916 {{and grew up in}} an orphanage. Little is known about his early life except {{that he was one of}} the four Mississippi Minstrels performing at [...] "The Palace" [...] at Attercliffe and had served in the army during World War II. He joined Maplins upon demobilisation in 1945, and has returned every season since. He spent the winter months performing at the Ideal Home Exhibition and the Motor Show. He married Hilary (Rikki Lee) in 1951 but they separated soon afterwards and later divorced. He was always running scams to cheat the campers out of money: these included fake birthdays, raffles, fund-raisers and rigged bingo. One of his most memorable schemes was selling tickets for male campers to view a pornographic film in the middle of the night. Jeffrey Fairbrother tried his best to put a stop to these schemes, but Clive Dempster supported them and often got involved. Ted was the longest-serving employee at Maplins. Ted shared his chalet with Spike throughout the entire sitcom, and briefly with Barry when Yvonne threw him out, and later with Julian Dalrymple-Sykes. Both Barry and Julian hated their time in Ted's chalet because of his disgusting habits. In a later episode, Ted fell in love with Betty Barlow (Caroline Dennis), a young female camper. He planned to marry her, leave Maplins and form an act with her, but he called it off after he discovered that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> <b>did</b> not approve, and that she had been offered a scholarship, which she hadn't told him about, and he didn't want to hold her back. Throughout the series, Ted often said that he hated his job at Maplins, as he believed his talents were wasted on the lower classes who holidayed there. He often tried to better himself by performing as a comedian at upper-class functions, most of which were unsuccessful. When Maplins modernised after the 1960 season, they no longer required a camp host – what the future held for Ted was left unknown. He revealed that over the winter he had secured a job demonstrating a new potato peeler in supermarkets, and was going to play a Chinese policeman in a pantomime over Christmas. Despite his regular claims that he hated his job as Camp Host, Ted was genuinely upset to leave Maplins.|$|E
