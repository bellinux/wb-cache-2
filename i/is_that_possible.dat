25|$|Both Conway's and Jensen's {{versions}} of the transfer-matrix method involve {{counting the number of}} polyominoes that have a certain width. Computing the number for all widths gives the total number of polyominoes. The basic idea behind the method <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>possible</b> beginning rows are considered, and then to determine the minimum number of squares needed to complete the polyomino of the given width. Combined with the use of generating functions, this technique is able to count many polyominoes at once, thus enabling it to run many times faster than methods that have to generate every polyomino.|$|E

[...] "Surely - he writes - we cannot attribute to {{one and the same}} subject the attributes of being simultaneously finite (as a human being) and infinite (as Son of God)?" [...] The author proposes that one should envisage Jesus' revealing and redeeming 'work' as having an impact not only on all men and women of all times and places, but also on the whole created cosmos. Recognising the difficulty in describing or even minimally explaining Christ's salvific 'work', the book is built around the resurrection of the crucified Jesus, highlights love as the key to redemption, and proposes a synthesis of the divine presence through Jesus.|$|E
50|$|Season 3 {{which was}} known as Happy Together: Let's Go To School (해피투게더 학교가자), where the 4 MC's dressed as females (except for Shin Bong-sun, who is a female), and participated in school-themed games, and the corner from Season 1, where the MC's would play against {{students}} in a quiz for a scholarship. This began on July 5, 2007. These proved to be unpopular and were all scrapped in 3 weeks. Now, the show is simply known as Happy Together Season 3 which the corners are Challenge! Memorize Song, and That's You! (그건 너!). These 2 corners proved to be popular, and ratings {{have gone back to}} the usual norm. That's You! has been replaced by What is that! (이건 뭐!), where guests bring an item they cherish, and Don't Laugh in the Sauna!, joined the 2 remaining corners that take place in a sauna. In early 2009, Challenge! Memorize Song was removed to save time. Only Don't Laugh in the Sauna! remains, and follows Star Quiz How <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Possible!</b> (스타퀴즈 세상에이럴수가!) which is a quiz about the guests for daily products. On April 25, 2017, the show will undergo a revamp, one significant change is the show will be {{in the form of a}} 2-part series because most recordings go overtime.|$|E
5000|$|The king issued another proclamation, that {{he would}} give a measure of gold to whoever would bring him the ogre's bolster.

At midnight he {{stretched}} out his hand very softly, but the little bells all sounded. [...] "What is that?" [...] said the ogre. [...] "Nothing," [...] replied the ogress; [...] "perhaps it is the wind that makes them ring." [...] But the ogre, who was suspicious, pretended to sleep, but kept his ears open. Thirteenth stretched out his hand again. Alack! The ogre put out his arm and seized him. [...] "Now you are caught! Just wait; I will make you cry for your first trick, for your second, and for your third." [...] After this he put Thirteenth in a barrel, and began to feed him on raisins and figs. After a time he said: [...] "Stick out your finger little Thirteenth, so that I can see whether you are fat." [...] Thirteenth saw there a mouse's tail, and stuck that out. [...] "Ah, how thin you are!" [...] said the ogre; [...] "and besides, you don't smell good! Eat, my son; take the raisins and figs, and get fat soon!"
