2500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{expressed concern}} about Semenya's testosterone levels, following her win. Eric Vilain, a medical geneticist, said in an interview, [...] "if we push this argument, anyone declaring a female gender can compete as a woman... We’re moving toward one big competition, and the very predictable result of that competition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no women winners." [...] Other commentators, such as bioethicist Katrina Karkazis, point to statements by losing competitors as evidence of discriminatory treatment.|$|E
2500|$|... "We're {{preparing}} for war, and it's {{hard to know}} what to expect. What I'm positive of <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a next round, and others after that. But I would rather opt for living here in continual battle than for becoming part of the wandering Jewish people. Any compromise will simply hasten the end. As I don't intend to tell my grandchildren about the Jewish State in the twentieth century as a mere brief and transient episode in thousands of years of wandering, I intend to hold on here with all my might." ...|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "Pyle stop" [...] {{is a deep}} stop {{named after}} Richard Pyle, an early {{advocate}} of deep stops, at the depths halfway between the bottom and the first conventional decompression stop, and halfway between the previous Pyle stop and the deepest conventional stop, provided the conventional stop is more than 9m shallower. A Pyle stop is about 2 minutes long. The additional ascent time required for Pyle stops {{is included in the}} dive profile before finalising the decompression schedule. Pyle found that on dives where he stopped periodically to vent the swim-bladders of his fish specimens, he felt better after the dive, and based the deep stop procedure on the depths and duration of these pauses. The hypothesis is that these stops provide an opportunity to eliminate gas while still dissolved, or at least while the bubbles are still small enough to be easily eliminated, and the result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be considerably fewer or smaller venous bubbles to eliminate at the shallower stops as predicted by the thermodynamic model of Hills.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, I've worried {{openly about}} NATO {{turning into a}} two-tiered alliance: Between members who {{specialize}} in [...] "soft" [...] humanitarian, development, peacekeeping and talking tasks, and those conducting the [...] "hard" [...] combat missions. [...] Between those {{willing and able to}} pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but don't want to share the risks and the costs. [...] This is no longer a hypothetical worry. [...] We are there today. [...] And it is unacceptable. The blunt reality <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress—and in the American body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense. [...] Nations apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets. Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders—those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on America's investment in NATO worth the cost.|$|E

50|$|At New York Comic Con 2014 panel, it <b>was</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> after 10 {{years of}} live monthly Thrilling Adventure Hour stage performances, the last such performance will be April 11, 2015.

60|$|The {{only thing}} that is at present certain about the matter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be bloodshed, and that before long.

6000|$|... 'Everything is wearisome; {{but here}} I have a proud feeling of having paid my way. To have settled {{in advance for}} your dinner for six weeks to come is a {{magnificent}} thing.

The only horror to me here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> so soon be an end to it.' ...|$|E
60|$|When {{you have}} to surrender, it is well to do so gracefully. Frank stooped down and kissed his wife's hand, and apologised. 'The wisdom of the heart {{is greater than the}} wisdom of the brain,' said he. But the love of man comes from the brain, far more than the love of woman, and so it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> always be some points upon which they will never quite see alike.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{were just}} talking over the time it will take Millicent to get ready," [...] he said, [...] "and I shall be glad of your opinion. I have been telling her that I am going away for a fortnight, and have {{proposed}} that the marriage should come off a fortnight later. I cannot see any use in delay, and she does not either; at least, I suppose not, for the only objection she has advanced <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be but a short time in which to get her things ready. That strikes me as being all nonsense. I could get things ready for ten weddings in that time. What do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Frank came among them. He had {{intended}} staying some weeks,--perhaps for a month, and great preparations {{were made for}} him; but immediately on his arrival he announced the necessity that was incumbent on him of going down again to Scotland in ten days. [...] "You've heard about Lizzie, of course?" [...] he said. They had heard that Lizzie was to become Lady Fawn, but beyond that they had heard nothing. [...] "You know about the necklace?" [...] asked Frank. Something of a tale of a necklace had made its way even down to quiet Bobsborough. They had been informed {{that there was a}} dispute between the widow and the executors of the late Sir Florian about some diamonds. [...] "Lord Fawn is behaving about it in the most atrocious manner," [...] continued Frank, [...] "and the long and the short of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no marriage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You, {{who have}} been so long at Poona, and {{understand}} the shifty nature of Scindia, Holkar, and indeed of all the native princes, must know well that these orders are much more easily given than carried out. If our restraining hand is removed, we shall have Scindia, and Holkar, the Peishwa, the Rajahs of Berar, Kolapoore, and Bhurtpoor at each other's throats again. They will treat our declarations, that we desire peace, only as a proof of weakness; and may, at any moment, lay aside their private quarrels to unite against us; and, unlikely {{as it may seem}} at present, my conviction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> never be permanent peace in India until we are masters from Cape Comorin to the borders of Afghanistan. It may be another half century, and will certainly only be after hard fighting; but I believe that, until all India acknowledges our rule, there will not be anything like permanent peace within its borders." ...|$|E

5000|$|The ACT {{government}} has selected developers {{for the area}} as Defence Housing Australia and Canberra Investment Corporation.

The developers are expected to make $60,000,000 but have to share half that with the government. Some very small blocks will be released for low cost housing with 85% released for high cost housing. [...] Eventually the suburb will have 1500 houses on 140 hectares.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] I answered. [...] "And {{that is the}} perfectest hell of it. John Barleycorn makes toward death. That is why I {{voted for}} the {{amendment}} to-day. I read back {{in my life and}} saw how the accessibility of alcohol had given me the taste for it. You see, comparatively few alcoholics are born in a generation. And by alcoholic I mean a man whose chemistry craves alcohol and drives him resistlessly to it. The great majority of habitual drinkers are born not only without desire for alcohol, but with actual repugnance toward it. Not the first, nor the twentieth, nor the hundredth drink, succeeded in giving them the liking. But they learned, just as men learn to smoke; though it is far easier to learn to smoke than to learn to drink. They learned because alcohol was so accessible. The women know the game. They pay for it--the wives and sisters and mothers. And when they come to vote, they will vote for prohibition. And the best of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no hardship worked on the coming generation. Not having access to alcohol, not being predisposed toward alcohol, it will never miss alcohol. It will mean life more abundant for the manhood of the young boys born and growing up--ay, and life more abundant for the young girls born and growing up to share the lives of the young men." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{might be}} expected, we find that, having a common origin and like general functions, these several {{controlling}} agencies act during each era with similar degrees of vigour. Under the Chinese despotism, stringent and multitudinous in its edicts and harsh in {{the enforcement of}} them, and associated with which there is an equally stern domestic despotism exercised by the eldest surviving male of the family, there exists a system of observances alike complicated and rigid. There is a tribunal of ceremonies. Previous to presentation at court, ambassadors pass many days in practising the required forms. Social intercourse is cumbered by endless compliments and obeisances. Class distinctions are strongly marked by badges. The chief regret on losing an only son <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no one to perform the sepulchral rites. And if there wants a definite measure of the respect paid to social ordinances, we have it in the torture to which ladies submit in having their feet crushed. In India, and indeed throughout the East, there exists a like connection between the pitiless tyranny of rulers, the dread terrors of immemorial creeds, and the rigid restraint of unchangeable customs: the caste regulations continue still unalterable; the fashions of clothes and furniture have remained the same for ages; suttees are so ancient as to be mentioned by Strabo and Diodorus Siculus; justice is still administered at the palace-gates as of old; in short, [...] "every usage is a precept of religion and a maxim of jurisprudence." ...|$|E
50|$|Another change <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be 3 stages {{instead of}} one. One {{of them will}} be {{dedicated}} completely to electronic music.|$|E
