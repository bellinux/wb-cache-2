5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the <b>federal</b> <b>debt,</b> nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of {{attempting}} to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as <b>federal</b> <b>debt,</b> for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures {{in a process}} in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E

25|$|If current laws {{remained}} generally unchanged in the future, <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> held by {{the public}} would decline slightly relative to GDP {{over the next few}} years.

Moreover, debt would be on an upward path relative {{to the size of the}} economy, a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely. By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5 percent of GDP, larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> held by the public would reach 106 percent of GDP, more than in any year except 1946—even without factoring in the economic effects of growing debt.|$|E

25|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{under the}} baseline scenario that the U.S. debt {{held by the}} public would increase approximately $8.5 trillion {{between the end of}} 2014 and 2024. Under a $2 trillion deficit reduction scenario during that first decade, <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> held by the public in 2039 would stand at 75 percent of GDP, only slightly above the value of 72 percent at the end of 2013. Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for that decade, <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> held by the public would fall to 42 percent of GDP in 2039. By comparison, such debt was 35 percent of GDP in 2007 and has averaged 39 percent of GDP during the past 40 years.|$|E

25|$|Australia's net {{external}} debt exceeded $1 trillion in April 2017 {{as a result}} of Australia's structural current account deficits. Although these deficits have narrowed over the last decade due to an increase in net merchandise trade, this effect has been partly offset by the return of Australian government debt; net <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> was estimated at $326.0 billion in the 2016-17 federal budget of which 60% is owed to foreigners. The entirety of the debt has been accumulated through ten straight budget deficits as Australia had negative net government debt (i.e. The Australian government had net positive bond holdings) a decade earlier in the 2006-07 fiscal year.|$|E
25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Canada's <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> was {{estimated}} to total $566.7billion {{for the fiscal year}} 2010–11, up from $463.7billion in 2008–09. In addition, Canada's net foreign debt rose by $41 billion to $194 billion {{in the first quarter of}} 2010. However, Canada's regulated banking sector (comparatively conservative among G8 nations), the federal government's pre-crisis budgetary surpluses, and its long-term policies of lowering the national debt, resulted in a less severe recession compared to other G8 nations. , the Canadian economy has largely stabilized and has seen a modest return to growth, although the country remains troubled by volatile oil prices, sensitivity to the Eurozone crisis and higher-than-normal unemployment rates. The federal government and many Canadian industries have also started to expand trade with emerging Asian markets, in an attempt to diversify exports; Asia is now Canada's second-largest export market after the United States. Widely debated oil pipeline proposals, in particular, are hoped to increase exports of Canadian oil reserves to China.|$|E

25|$|Under Republican President Warren G. Harding, {{who called}} for normalcy {{and an end}} to high wartime taxes, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon raised the tariff, cut other taxes, and used the large surplus to reduce the <b>federal</b> <b>debt</b> by about a third from 1920 to 1930. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover worked to {{introduce}} efficiency, by regulating business practices. This period of prosperity, along with the culture of the time, was known as the Roaring Twenties. The rapid growth of the automobile industry stimulated industries such as oil, glass, and road-building. Tourism soared and consumers with cars had a much wider radius for their shopping. Small cities prospered, and large cities had their best decade ever, with a boom in construction of offices, factories and homes. The new electric power industry transformed both business and everyday life. Telephones and electricity spread to the countryside, but farmers never recovered from the wartime bubble in land prices. Millions migrated to nearby cities. However, in October 1929, the Stock market crashed and banks began to fail in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.|$|E
500|$|Coolidge {{adopted the}} {{taxation}} policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, {{the idea that}} [...] "scientific taxation", lower taxes, increase rather than decrease government receipts. Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the <b>federal</b> <b>debt.</b> Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall <b>federal</b> <b>debt.</b> By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax.
