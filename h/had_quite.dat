5|$|At {{the end of}} Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch {{telescope}} he had initiated {{finally came}} online. Gascoigne, {{looking for a new}} research project and keen to use the new telescope, took up the study of globular clusters, compact groups {{of tens of thousands of}} ancient stars of similar age. With a new design of photometer, he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and old, and <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the evolution of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> a lot of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington, D.C., on 18 September 1943, {{and they}} {{attempted}} {{to persuade him to}} join the Los Alamos Laboratory, but Oliphant felt that he would be of more use assisting Lawrence on the electromagnetic project. Accordingly, the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley, and later move on to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> different designs, and that the American one was frozen, but Lawrence, who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942, was eager for Oliphant's assistance. Oliphant secured the services of a fellow Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills, particularly physicists, chemists and engineers. He prevailed on Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to release Eric Burhop to work on the project. His requests for personnel were met, and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35, two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders.|$|E

25|$|In Finland, {{the title}} of tohtori or doktor denotes holder of a {{research}} doctorate comparable to a PhD. Until recent years it was customary to first become licentiate (after the master's degree), which meant persons becoming doctors already had <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> a long academic career. Nowadays doctorate programs are available after the master's degree in many fields and becoming doctor at young age is much more common.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} groups of workers at Cornwall Iron Furnace: Free labor, indentured {{servants}} and slaves. Slavery was legal in Pennsylvania until it was gradually abolished beginning in 1780 when the importation of slaves was prohibited. The management of the furnace <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> a bit of trouble with the staff of indentured servants. These unskilled workers were imported from Germany, England and Ireland. Many of them worked at Cornwall {{for a short time}} before eventually running away.|$|E

25|$|Though only an {{auxiliary}} ship, General Taylor {{appears to have}} <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> a colorful career. After her Seminole War service, she played a cameo role in the notorious trial and sentencing of abolitionist Jonathan Walker. In the mid-1840s, General Taylors crew included two future Engineers-in-Chief of the Navy. After being burned and rebuilt in 1846, the steamer later {{played a role in}} the foiling of a planned 1849 filibuster invasion of Cuba. General Taylor was sold by the Navy in 1852.|$|E

25|$|Lunar transits {{have been}} used to map X-ray {{emissions}} from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray observations generally <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> low angular resolution, but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula's brightness can be used to create maps of X-ray emission. When X-rays were first observed from the Crab Nebula, a lunar occultation was used to determine the exact location of their source.|$|E
25|$|Den forgyldte Krone, {{under the}} Dutchman Arent Henriksen, was sent {{in advance to}} test the waters, but {{returned}} after waiting in vain for Dyppel. Dyppel's vessel Færøe had departed on October 20, 1671 and did not arrive until May 23 the following year. This delay {{was caused by a}} leak incurred in November 1671, and subsequent docking in Bergen for 3 months, during which time Dyppel <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> a task with controlling the crew which consisted partly of indentured servants and partly of convicted felons conscripted for duty.|$|E
25|$|Although Scrope did {{not have}} a {{particularly}} active political life, his brother Charles Thomson did. With much advising behind the scenes, Charles rose to political prominence and was eventually made Lord Sydenham. As part of his new duties, he was engaged in much economic and political discourse, for which he <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> a sound mind. He was responsible for implementing the Union Act in 1840, which united Upper Canada and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada. Eventually Charles became Governor General of Canada until his death in 1841.|$|E

They concluded;In our view, the plain wording of section 5 is easy enough to understand without recourse to concepts like sustainable development that are not referred to, or the insistence that an anthropogenic reading of the section must necessarily involve weighing up everything against everything else.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all Inuit {{cultures}} have oral traditions of raids by other indigenous peoples, including fellow Inuit, and of taking vengeance {{on them in}} return, such as the Bloody Falls Massacre. Western observers often regarded these tales as generally not entirely accurate historical accounts, but more as self-serving myths. However, evidence shows that Inuit cultures <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> accurate methods of teaching historical accounts to each new generation. In northern Canada, historically there were ethnic feuds between the Dene and the Inuit, as witnessed by Samuel Hearne in 1771. In 1996, Dene and Inuit representatives participated in a healing ceremony to reconcile the centuries-old grievances.|$|E
25|$|The {{expanding}} Soviet {{presence in}} Egypt {{and the increased}} likelihood of a confrontation with Soviet forces prompted the Israeli government to call off the Priha operations. Despite inflicting considerable damage on Egypt, the bombing campaign only brought the Egyptian public together behind their government. Instead of bringing Egypt to the negotiating table, it <b>had</b> <b>quite</b> the opposite effect. Humiliated and angry, Nasser turned to Moscow for additional support and weapons, drawing the Soviet Union further into the conflict. Instead of facilitating a ceasefire, the Priha operations in fact increased tensions and led to further escalation in the War of Attrition.|$|E
