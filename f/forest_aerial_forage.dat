Nest-site {{characteristics}} (10 nests, of 9 pairs) and <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> time-budgets of the White-bellied Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster {{were studied}} on the Gold Coast and Tweed Coast (Queensland/NSW border region) of subtropical eastern Australia. White-bellied Sea-Eagle nests were situated high (> 10 m) on lateral branch-forks in tall (> 18 m), living, large-boled trees (> 1. 1 m diameter at breast height), mainly eucalypts in open forest, within ~ 1 km of waterbodies, and between 220 m and 1. 1 km (mean 460 m) from human settlements. From {{the coastal plain}} to the subcoastal foothills up to 8 km inland, nests occurred at elevations up to 75 m above sea-level, but most were at ≤ 5 m asl; nests were on flat land or on slopes, the latter commonly with a southerly aspect. Two focal pairs of Sea-Eagles each spent ~ 15 % of observation time (20 h per pair) in foraging-related searching and commuting flight, and < 1 % of <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> time in attacking prey. Hunting success averaged 45 % in 20 observed attacks on prey. There {{was no significant difference}} between the two pairs in <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> time-budgets and hunting success...|$|R

40|$|Microchiroptera {{have evolved}} a {{biological}} sonar system that enables <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> in total darkness. These echolocating bat species emit sequences of ultrasonic vocalizations {{and use the}} returning echoes to create acoustic images of the environment. Bats orient their gaze in space by adjusting their sonar vocalizations, flight dynamics, and head aim in a coordinated manner when approaching targets. Insectivorous species of echolocating bats {{have been shown to}} actively modulate the features of sonar vocalizations with changing target distance. Therefore, variations in the time–frequency structure and temporal patterning of sonar calls produced by foraging bats reflect adaptive goal directed behaviors. The bat's heavy reliance on sound production and processing is reflected in neural specializations of auditory and motor structures. The experiments described in this dissertation probe the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), a vertebrate sensorimotor nucleus mediating orienting behaviors, and they specifically explore adaptations in the SC of the insectivorous bat, Eptesicus fuscus, for acoustic orienting.

The correlated evolution of foraging mode and skeletal morphology was studied using the phylogenetically independent contrasts method {{in order to test}} a prediction of convergent evolution, and to assess the adaptive significance of morphological variation.

We demonstrate that to properly test convergent hypotheses the effect of 'common ancestry' must be taken into account, otherwise spurious relationships can be obtained. This study also shows that in spite of the ecomorphological pattern shared for aerial foragers, they are segregated in the morphological space.

40|$|Background Bones {{have been}} {{subjected}} to considerable selective pressure throughout vertebrate evolution, such as occurred during the adaptations associated with the development of powered flight. Powered flight evolved independently in two extant clades of vertebrates, birds and bats. While this trait provided advantages such as in <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> habits, escape from predators or long-distance travels, it also imposed great challenges, namely in the bone structure. Results We performed comparative genomic analyses of 89 bone-associated genes from 47 avian genomes (including 45 new), 39 mammalian, and 20 reptilian genomes, and demonstrate that birds, after correcting for multiple testing, have an almost two-fold {{increase in the number of}} bone-associated genes with evidence of positive selection (~ 52. 8 %) compared with mammals (~ 30. 3 %). Most of the positive-selected genes in birds are linked with bone regulation and remodeling and thirteen have been linked with functional pathways relevant to powered flight, including bone metabolism, bone fusion, muscle development and hyperglycemia levels. Genes encoding proteins involved in bone resorption, such as TPP 1, had a high number of sites under Darwinian selection in birds. Conclusions Patterns of positive selection observed in bird ossification genes suggest that there was a period of intense selective pressure to improve flight efficiency that was closely linked with constraints on body size...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{mountain}} pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia (BC) is unprecedented in severity and extent, and {{has created a}} landscape of beetle-killed trees through which wildfires are now burning as compound natural disturbances. We asked the question: Is there an impact of grey phase MPB kill severity on bird and beetle assemblages, and does an effect persist following wildfire in BC? We compared the bird community of central interior BC against categorical and continuous disturbance severity gradients in unburned (MPB-only) and burned (MPB+FIRE) forests. Bird abundance and diversity was higher following fires, possibly supported by foraging resources from the positive abundance of beetles, however our findings suggest intermediate severities of compound disturbances show the greatest increases. In MPB-only areas, cumulative MPB kill was generally unimportant at the stand scale, but local gradients {{played a role in}} describing guild patterns, bird community membership, and single species abundances. In comparison, both burn severity and underlying MPB kill were important predictors in MPB+FIRE stands, suggesting evidence of a compound disturbance effect. We observed tenuous patterns that suggest the MPB outbreak might have detrimental effects on avian bark insectivores post-fire, but a positive influence on <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> species. Further research is required on available resources for these guilds after compound MPB and wildfire disturbances...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{present data}} on the {{foraging}} behaviour of eucalypt forest and woodland birds at two sites on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales during the non-breeding season (winter). The winter community was {{a subset of the}} summer community, with six guilds among 23 species identified by cluster analysis compared with seven guilds among 41 species in summer. Despite this difference, birds were abundant during winter, with more than 200 individuals of 29 species recorded during July censuses on the two 10 ha plots. Although a few birds fed on nectar, nectar was not abundant in winter and the nectar-foraging guild present in summer was absent in winter. Most birds that relied on large arthropods and aerial foragers left the area after summer and an <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> guild was restricted to one species, the Grey Fantail. As in summer, species differed in foraging manoeuvres and substrates, as well as foraging heights and the plant species frequented to find food. The continued abundance and diversity of species/guilds through the winter is best explained by the variety of food resources available for birds; the complexity of foliage, bark, and ground substrates provided a wide range of foraging substrates over the entire vertical profile of the vegetation. Maintenance of this structural complexity is essential for the survival of eucalypt forest and woodland birds...|$|R

40|$|In altricial birds, {{the great}} effort {{involved}} in supplying food to nestlings can create trade-offs in {{the allocation of}} resources between the current brood and parental self-maintenance. In poor foraging conditions, parents have to adjust their energy expenditure {{in relation to the}} increased foraging costs. However, intra-specific variation in parental energy expenditure has rarely been evaluated {{in the context of the}}se trade-offs. Here, we quantified the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of parent Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica during the nestling period in relation to foraging conditions while controlling for differences in brood size and nestling age. DEE varied substantially with environmental conditions, increasing by 10 kJ/day per 5 degrees C in ambient temperature, and by 11 kJ/day per hour in day length. Parent birds did not compensate for a poor aerial insect supply on cool days, but reduced their DEE. Parents only slightly buffered a negative energy balance during chick provisioning with stored body reserves. They did not sacrifice their own energy demands to keep up a high energy flow to the brood when foraging conditions were poor. Instead they worked harder when foraging conditions allowed a surplus intake, fully compensating for their additional efforts, and made maximum use of the rich food supply, allowing the brood to accrue body reserves to compensate for low food intake on cold days. This strategy of energy management may have evolved in the context of the adaptation to the <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> mode and to the ephemeral nature of aerial food resources...|$|R

40|$|Preserving large predators is {{important}} but challenging because these species are typically wide-ranging, select multiple habitats at different scales and often present spatial or habitat {{separation between the}} breeder and floater sectors of a population. In addition, most of our knowledge on raptor floaters' habitat requirements comes from large solitary species, whose floaters often occupy temporary settlement areas spatially separate from breeding locations. Here, we examine space and habitat use by a loosely colonial, wetland-dependent raptor, the Black kite (Milvus migrans), in a population where floaters co-exist with territory holders, enabling a direct comparison of their habitat preferences. The {{study was conducted in}} Doñana National Park (South-Western Spain), a seasonally drying marshland currently surrounded by intensive agriculture and rice-fields. Intensive radio-tracking revealed that breeders and floaters selected and avoided the same habitats despite a radical, four-to-eight fold difference in their home-range dimensions: all kites over-selected open habitats suitable for their <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> modes and avoided woodland and farmland. These results suggest a continuum of raptor population structures ranging from solitary species whose floaters select different habitats than breeders and are concentrated in spatially separate settlement areas, to colonial and semi-social species whose floaters fully coexist with breeders with shared habitat preferences. Both extremes of this continuum will pose challenges for conservation management. In solitary species, special conservation efforts may be required to identify and manage temporary settlement areas, while in gregarious species, the larger ranges of floaters may expose them to different threats than breeders, whose occurrence and consequences may be subtle to identify. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A 3 D point cloud was generated from aerial photographs using the SfM approach and converted to a digital surface model (DSMP). We also created a DSM from airborne LiDAR data (DSML). From each of DSMP and DSML, we constructed digital terrain models (DTM), which are DTMP and DTML, respectively. We created four CHMs, which were calculated from (1) DSMP and DTMP (CHMPP); (2) DSMP and DTML (CHMPL); (3) DSML and DTMP (CHMLP); and (4) DSML and DTML (CHMLL). Then, we estimated AGB using these CHMs. The model using CHMLL yielded the highest accuracy in four CHMs (R 2 = 0. 94) and was comparable to the model using CHMPL (R 2 = 0. 93). The model using CHMPP yielded the lowest accuracy (R 2 = 0. 79). In conclusion, AGB can be estimated from CHM derived from aerial photographs using the SfM approach in the tropics.

40|$|The {{foraging}} {{ecology and}} habitat {{selection of the}} Yellow-plumed Honeyeater was examined using observations and vegetation surveys at Dryandra Woodland, Western Australia. Foraging ecology data was collected over three seasons (autumn, winter and spring) in 1997 at three sites within Dryandra. Habitat selection studies involved 156 sites being surveyed for {{the presence or absence}} of the Yellow-plumed Honeyeater. The vegetation characteristics of the site were measured. Yellow-plumed Honeyeaters foraged by gleaning foliage most of the time. Bark and <b>aerial</b> <b>foraging</b> were also common. Birds clearly selected for tree height, preferring to forage on larger (older) trees which may be because of the proportionality larger amount of resources available on older trees. This has major implications for management as most remnants are severely degraded and have had the larger trees removed. There was no significant trends observed in the foraging behaviour over the seasons, although birds at one of the sites demonstrated a seasonal change. Therefore, it is not possible to judge the exact preferred foraging behaviours or substrates used as they fluctuate over time and space. Habitat selection studies showed Yellow-plumed Honeyeaters have a clear preference for areas with over 70 % wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) trees. They were present at 25 of the 156 sites surveyed and did not occur in areas with over 30 % powderbark wandoo (E. accedens). The resources provided by the two areas are different, and I suggest that it is the absence of a continuous bark resource which prevents Yellow-plumed Honeyeaters residing in powderbark wandoo areas. Apart from a high abundance of wandoo trees and low abundance of powderbark wandoo trees, there were no vegetation characteristics which were significant in distinguishing areas where the bird was present from areas where they were absent. Clearly, the birds require large areas of wandoo woodland and the retention and management of areas large enough to support the Yellow-plumed Honeyeater is the best option for the conservation of the species...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in {{wind energy production}} has been relatively rapid {{and is expected to}} continue at a global scale. However, numbers of bat carcasses found at wind turbines in North America in the early 21 st century raised concern about the plight of this taxon with the growth in wind-energy generation. This led to carcass searches for bats becoming commonplace at wind farms globally. However, few large scale systematic studies have assessed the effects of wind turbines on bats, especially for species considered potentially at higher risk in Europe. In this thesis the number and species of bats killed from wind farms were estimated across Britain, and the important predictors (i. e. activity, turbine characteristics and habitat) of fatality were determined. Insect abundance, biomass and bat activity was also quantified at turbine and control locations, to assess if insects and hence bats were attracted to turbines. In addition, assessments were made of the effects of increasing temporal and spatial replication of acoustic monitoring on estimates of species composition and bat activity. This was assessed for activity monitored at ground and at the centre of the rotor sweep area (the nacelle). Carcass searches were conducted using trained search dogs and concurrently bats were surveyed acoustically at three randomly selected turbines at ground and from the nacelle at 48 wind farms throughout Britain. Bats were also monitored acoustically at paired controls (with a randomly selected turbine) at 20 of the wind farms sites. In addition, nocturnal Diptera were sampled at 18 of the sites using a paired turbine and control design. Across 139 wind turbines, 188, 335 bat passes were recorded and 2, 973 carcass searches performed.

Landscape level monitoring of forest health and tree dieback is critical for vegetation and disaster management strategies. We examined the capability of multispectral imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in detecting and explaining the impacts of the recent severe drought in Sierra Nevada forests. Remote sensing metrics were developed to represent baseline forest health conditions and drought stress using time series of MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and a water index. We used Random Forest algorithms, trained with <b>forest</b> <b>aerial</b> detection surveys data, to detect tree mortality based on the remote sensing metrics and topographical variables. Map estimates of tree mortality demonstrated that our two-stage Random Forest models were capable of detecting the spatial patterns and severity of tree mortality, with an overall producer’s accuracy of 96. 3 % for the classification Random Forest (CRF) and a RMSE of 7. 19 dead trees per acre for the regression Random Forest (RRF). The overall omission errors of the CRF ranged from 19 % for the severe mortality class to 27 % for the low mortality class. Interpretations of the models revealed that forests with higher productivity preceding the onset of drought were more vulnerable to drought stress and, consequently, more likely to experience tree mortality. This method highlights the importance of incorporating baseline forest health data and measurements of drought stress in understanding forest response to severe drought...|$|R
