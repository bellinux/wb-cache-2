40|$|SUMMARY Following 5 {{minutes of}} global ischemia, local {{cerebral}} blood flow (LCBF) was shown to have an initial reactive hyperemia that was followed, within the first hour, by persistent hypoperfusion (Part I). In-tracranial pressure (ICP) was never elevated {{during the period of}} poor reperfusion. These experiments attempted to reverse the state of subnormal LCBF by inducing <b>hypercarbia</b> or hypocarbia or maintaining nor-mocarbia. Although hypocarbia did increase LCBF at several electrode sites, neither the intracerebral steal syndrome nor the "squeeze " syndrome are a dominant consequence of <b>hypercarbia</b> in this model of global ischemia. <b>Hypercarbia</b> was consistently more effective in elevating LCBFs and in recovery of the electro-corticogram. It appears that, in the absence of raised ICP, <b>hypercarbia</b> may be preferred to normal or low Paco 2. Even though <b>hypercarbia</b> was superior to normocarbia or hypocarbia, <b>hypercarbia</b> was not a com-pletely satisfactory regimen for reversing the state of poor reperfusion.

40|$|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the {{presence}} of chronic bronchitis or emphysema, which causes a progressive airway obstruction, characterised by airway hyperactivity (Palm & Decker 2003). In New Zealand there are increasing numbers of people presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COPD. COPD exacerbation results in hypoxia and respiratory failure that can be debilitating to the patient because the normal coping mechanisms fail and the patient can end up in a spiralling illness that has a high mortality rate if left un-treated. <b>Hypercarbia</b> {{is a direct result of}} hypoventilation either from failed coping mechanisms or respiratory failure from exhaustion. The question lies with, which patients have this <b>hypercarbia</b> during an exacerbation? Treatment patterns within the ED depend largely on the diagnosis of <b>hypercarbia</b> on presentation with an exacerbation of COPD. A retrospective descriptive design was used to examine the records of all presentations to ED of patients with COPD over a 3 -month period to determine whether there is a subset group of people who present with <b>hypercarbia.</b> Data from records were extracted using a specially devised data extraction tool. Of the findings there were 114 presentations, amongst those 114 presentations there were 71 individuals, a number of them presenting more than once within the three months. 80 % of the 71 individuals have had a smoking history of which 53 % were female. Of the 114 presentations, 76 had arterial blood gases taken during their ED presentation. Of these 76 presentations 30 had <b>hypercarbia</b> and 46 were non-hypercarbia. These 76 presentations involved 58 individuals, with some individuals presenting five times over the three-month period. Three groups emerged, some who were only <b>hypercarbia</b> (n= 18), some in the non-hypercarbia group (n= 35) and 5 individuals who had presentations in both the <b>hypercarbia</b> and non-hypercarbia groups. Data showed that there was no definable subset group of <b>hypercarbia</b> patients within acute exacerbations of COPD presenting to the ED according to the variables. However the sample of presentations (with a blood gas) found within the study suffering <b>hypercarbia</b> was much higher (31. 1 %) than anticipated. Further analysis showed that the <b>hypercarbia</b> group had a significant lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and a combination diagnosis of emphysema or asthma and congestive heart failure. An implication to the clinician is that identification of <b>hypercarbia</b> within COPD exacerbation is problematically difficult until the late signs are shown with the individual. By that time effective treatment patterns may have changed from the initial presenting problem. Future areas of research within this field needs to lie within the community, when are these people starting the exacerbation and what leads them to progression presentation to the emergency department? Also we need to know whether these people are chronic sufferers of <b>hypercarbia</b> or presenting after a period of days exacerbation within their own home...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>hypercarbia,</b> asidosis and hypoxia due to pneumoperitoneum on healing of colonic anastomoses. Material and Methods: Forty Guinea pigs weighting 500 - 550 gr, were divided into four groups, each consisting of 10 Guinea pigs. Group 1 : laparotomy plus colon anastomosis (control group), Group 2 : 12 mmHg CO 2 pneumoperitoneum for 30 minutes plus colon anastomosis, Group 3 : 12 mmHg CO 2 pneumoperitoneum for 60 minutes plus colon anastomosis, Group 4 : 12 mmHg CO 2 pneumoperitoneum for 30 minutes plus subcutaneous emphysema plus colon anastomosis. After pneumoperitoneum was induced as described above, arterial blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral artery for arterial blood gase analysis. Left colon resection and end-to-end anstomosis was performed on all animals after blood samples were withdrawn. All animals were killed on the postoperative day 4 and anastomosis bursting pressures were measured. Results: <b>Hypercarbia,</b> acidosis and hypoxia were all present in the pneumoperitoneum groups and these levels were statistically different compared to the control group. The degree of <b>hypercarbia,</b> acidosis and hypoxia correlated with the volume of CO 2 absorbed which was dependent on the lenght of pneumoperitoneum and presence of subcutaneous emphysema. The highest levels of <b>hypercarbia,</b> acidosis and hypoxia were found in Group 4. The lowest anastomotic bursting pressure occurred in Group 4 and the difference was statistically significant when compared with control group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Anastomotic healing is not impaired until a critical level of <b>hypercarbia,</b> acidosis and hypoxia is reached.

Five hundred twenty-seven charts of patients with OSA based on preoperative ICD- 9 codes were reviewed for outcomes including episodes of hypoxemia and <b>hypercarbia.</b> Univariate analysis, logistic regression, and propensity analysis were performed to determine independent risk factors for hypoxemia and association with adverse outcomes.

40|$|International audienceGas {{composition}} {{is an important}} component of any micro-environment. Insects, as the vast majority of living organisms, depend on O 2 and CO 2 concentrations in the air they breathe. Low O 2 (hypoxia), and high CO 2 (<b>hypercarbia)</b> levels can have a dramatic effect. For phytophagous insects that live within plant tissues (endophagous lifestyle), gas is exchanged between ambient air and the atmosphere within the insect habitat. The insect larva contributes to the modification of this environment by expiring CO 2. Yet, knowledge on the gas exchange network in endophagous insects remains sparse. Our study identified mechanisms that modulate gas composition in the habitat of endophagous insects. Our aim was toshow that the mere position of the insect larva within plant tissues {{could be used as a}} proxy for estimating risk of occurrence of hypoxia and <b>hypercarbia,</b> despite the widely diverse life history traits of these organisms. We developed a conceptual framework for a gas diffusion network determining gas composition in endophagous insect habitats. We applied this framework to mines, galls and insect tunnels (borers) by integrating the numerous obstacles along O 2 and CO 2 pathways. The nature and the direction of gas transfers depended on the physical structure of the insect habitat, the photosynthesis activity as well as stomatal behavior in plant tissues. We identified the insect larva position within the gas diffusion network as a predictor of risk exposure to hypoxia and <b>hypercarbia.</b> We ranked endophagous insect habitats in terms of risk of exposure to hypoxia and/or <b>hypercarbia,</b> from the more to the less risky as cambium mines > borer tunnelsgalls > bark mines > mines in aquatic plants > upper and lower surface mines. Furthermore, we showed that the photosynthetically active tissues likely assimilate larval CO 2 produced. In addition, temperature of the microhabitat and atmospheric CO 2 alter gas composition in the insect habitat. We predict that (i) hypoxia indirectly favors the evolution of cold-tolerant gallers, which donot perform well at high temperatures, and (ii) normoxia (ambient O 2 level) in mines allows miners todevelop at high temperatures. Little is known, however, about physiological and morphological adaptations to hypoxia and <b>hypercarbia</b> in endophagous insects.

Gliomas were generated by unilateral implantation of U 87 MGdEGFR human glioma tumor cells into the striatum of adult female athymic rats. Relative changes in total and microvascular cerebral blood volume were determined by steady state contrast agent-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for transitions from normocarbia to <b>hypercarbia</b> and hypocarbia. Although <b>hypercarbia</b> induced {{a significant increase in}} both total and microvascular blood volume in normal brain and glioma, reactivity of glioma vasculature was significantly blunted in comparison to normal striatum; glioma total CBV increased by 0. 6 ± 0. 1 %/mm Hg CO 2 whereas normal striatum increased by 1. 5 ± 0. 2 %/mm Hg CO 2, (P <. 0001, group t-test). Reactivity of microvascular blood volume was also significantly blunted. In contrast, hypocarbia decreased both total and microvascular blood volumes more in glioma than in normal striatum. These results indicate that cerebral blood vessels derived by tumor-directed angiogenesis do retain reactivity to CO 2. Furthermore, reduced reactivity of tumor vessels to a single physiological perturbation, such as <b>hypercarbia,</b> should not be construed as a generalized reduction of functional activity of the tumor vascular bed...|$|E
