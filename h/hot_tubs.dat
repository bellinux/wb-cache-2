5|$|In {{this highly}} sexualized {{environment}} a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened {{areas of the}} establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or <b>hot</b> <b>tubs</b> (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the end of}} 2011, {{the band}} played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro <b>Hot</b> <b>Tubs)</b> whose setlists {{consisted}} almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! which would be released {{in the fall of}} 2012. The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White's induction as the fourth member of the band. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Since 1991, {{members of}} the band have {{branched}} out past Green Day, starting other projects with various musicians. Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White, The Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and {{members of the}} band Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro <b>Hot</b> <b>Tubs,</b> which the band uses to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called The Boo which recorded a one off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store.|$|E

While major <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> companies sold through independent dealers, ThermoSpas used a direct-to-consumer model and performed everything from the initial site inspection through installation of its tubs. Its best lead system was from infomercials which generated hundreds of thousands of leads for the company.|$|R

25|$|The risk of {{contracting}} 'P. aeruginosa {{can be reduced}} by avoiding pools, <b>hot</b> <b>tubs,</b> and other bodies of standing water; regularly disinfecting and/or replacing equipment that regularly encounters moisture (such as contact lens equipment and solutions); and washing one's hands often (which is protective against many other pathogens as well). However, even the best hygiene practices cannot totally protect an individual against P. aeruginosa, given how common 'P. aeruginosa is in the environment.|$|E
25|$|Ozone is used {{in homes}} and <b>hot</b> <b>tubs</b> to kill {{bacteria}} {{in the water and}} {{to reduce the amount of}} chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with halogens. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} thermal and cardiorespiratory adaptation during <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> {{bath and}} shower in healthy newborns {{in the first}} hours of life. Study design: This is a randomized blind controlled trial, registered in ReBEC (No. RBR- 4 z 26 f 3) with 184 newborns divided into <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> group (n= 84) and shower (n= 100). Newborns from intervention group were immersed in a <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> with warm water up to the neck, without exposure to air flow, and control group received traditional shower. Heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature were measured before and immediately after bath by an investigator blinded {{to the type of}} bath. Results: Groups were similar in gender, gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score at 5 th minute and hours of life, p => 0. 05. To analyze thermal and cardiorespiratory adjustments, difference between post-bath variables and pre-bath was calculated. In this analysis, it was found statistically significant difference between two types of bath regarding heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. <b>Hot</b> <b>tub</b> bath decreases heart and respiratory rates and increases temperature, whereas shower provides the opposite effect (0. 0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> baths and shower, in healthy newborns, promote thermal and cardiorespiratory adaptations, reflecting thermal, cardiac and respiratory positive reactions after <b>hot</b> <b>tub</b> bath...|$|R

25|$|RIMAC was {{originally}} planned {{to include more}} conference-room space, dining facilities, additional <b>hot</b> <b>tubs,</b> saunas, a rock-climbing center, and an outdoor resource center.

Finally, in 2008, construction began on RIMAC Annex, a 10,000-square-foot building located adjacent to RIMAC Arena. The $10 million building was completed September 2009.|$|E

25|$|Hot Creek {{has been}} a popular {{swimming}} hole for decades.

Recent geothermal instability has led to its temporary closure for swimming. Officials are unsure of when (if ever) Hot Creek will officially reopen for swimming.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} {{is found}} naturally in fresh water. It can contaminate hot water tanks, <b>hot</b> <b>tubs,</b> and cooling towers of large air conditioners. It is usually spread by breathing in mist {{that contains the}} bacteria. It can also occur when contaminated water is aspirated. It typically does not spread directly between people and most people who are exposed do not become infected. Risk factors for infection include older age, history of smoking, chronic lung disease, and poor immune function. It is recommended that those with severe pneumonia and those with pneumonia and a recent travel history be tested for the disease. Diagnosis is by a urinary antigen test and sputum culture.|$|E
