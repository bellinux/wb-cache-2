5|$|Before {{the end of}} {{the bombings}} on August 15, 1973, a legal {{challenge}} to the bombings had mounted in United States Federal Court in the case of Schlesinger v. Holtzman. Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman voted against the Case-Church amendment, as she wanted an immediate end to the bombings, and subsequently filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking an order to require such. On July 25, 1973, U.S. District Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd granted summary judgment to Holtzman and issued an injunction ordering the military to refrain from participating in military activities in Cambodia. <b>His</b> <b>order</b> would have become effective on July 27, however, on that day, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously stayed <b>his</b> <b>order.</b> Holtzman then attempted to get the Circuit Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court overseeing the Second Circuit, Justice Thurgood Marshall, to vacate the stay. Justice Marshall refused to vacate the stay, issuing an in-chambers opinion. Holtzman then turned to Justice William O. Douglas who granted Holtzman's motion to vacate the stay on August 4, 1973, and he ordered the U.S. Military to cease all bombing in Cambodia. The military ignored <b>his</b> <b>order,</b> and six hours later, the other eight Justices of the Supreme Court voted unanimously to reverse Douglas's order.|$|E

5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian and by <b>his</b> <b>order</b> all the Zoroastrians {{were forced to}} bring their religious books to be thrown in the fire. As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing it with a mosque.|$|E

5|$|According to Tischendorf, Codex Sinaiticus {{was one of}} {{the fifty}} copies of the Bible {{commissioned}} from Eusebius by Roman Emperor Constantine after his conversion to Christianity (De vita Constantini, IV, 37).

5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} <b>his</b> <b>order</b> to re-arm {{the bombers}} with general purpose bombs {{and demanded that}} the scout plane ascertain {{the composition of the}} American force. Another 20–40 minutes elapsed before Tones scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from Task Force 16. The other carrier was not sighted.|$|E
5|$|The 1841 Alitao {{massacre}} {{became a}} controversial issue in Manila, where flyers criticizing the government's actions were circulated.

5|$|According to Matteo Villani, Louis {{launched}} an expedition against the Golden Horde {{at the head}} of an army of 200,000 horsemen in April 1354. The young Tatar ruler, whom historian Iván Bertényi identified as Jani Beg, did not want to wage war against Hungary and agreed to sign a peace treaty. Although no other primary source mentioned that campaign and treaty, the Tatars made no plundering raids in Transylvania after 1354, which suggests that Villani's report is reliable. In the same year, Louis invaded Serbia, forcing Stefan Dušan to withdraw from the region along the river Sava. Under duress, Dušan initiated negotiations with the Holy See for acknowledgement of the popes' primacy. The following year, Louis sent reinforcements to Casimir III to fight against the Lithuanians, and Hungarian troops supported Albert II, Duke of Austria, against Zürich. The Venetian delegates offered Louis 6–7,000 golden ducats as a compensation for Dalmatia, but Louis refused to give up his plan to reconquer the province. He signed an alliance with Albert II of Austria and Nicolaus of Luxemburg, Patriarch of Aquileia, against Venice. Upon <b>his</b> <b>order,</b> Croatian lords besieged and captured Klis, a Dalmatian fortress that Stefan Dušan's sister, Jelena, had inherited from her husband, Mladen Šubić.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at <b>his</b> <b>order</b> the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but also {{had to deal with}} USAF headquarters and the Strategic Air Command. He was also designated the point of contact for dealing with the British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold his own in dealings with more senior British officers, and with senior British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his Strategic Air Command colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by <b>his</b> <b>order</b> that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed <b>his</b> <b>order</b> when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E

Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft.

5|$|Congress {{considered}} {{raising the}} five-dollar legal tender limit on trade dollars, but instead {{passed a bill}} that officially demonetized the trade dollar on July 22, 1876; the Secretary of the Treasury was directed by the act to strike no more of the coins than necessary for use in trade. Despite the demonetization of the trade dollar, bullion producers continued to place the coins into the American market, resulting in an estimated seven million coins circulating within the United States, of which more than four million were placed in circulation in 1877. Despite the 1876 act, {{it was not until}} October 15, 1877 that Sherman (now Secretary of the Treasury) finally ordered that the mints not accept orders for trade dollars. On November 5, apparently believing a false report that additional supplies were needed for the Chinese New Year, he rescinded <b>his</b> <b>order,</b> finally ending orders for trade dollars on February 22, 1878.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 May, most of the {{remnants}} of the Berlin garrison attempted {{to break out of the}} city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the Charlottenbrücke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in breaching Soviet lines. Only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies—most were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer encirclement forces west of the city. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. The military historian Antony Beevor points out that as most of the German combat troops had left the area in the breakouts the night before, the resistance must have been far less than it had been inside the Reichstag. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23. Weidling agreed to order the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. Under General Chuikov's and Vasily Sokolovsky's direction, Weidling put <b>his</b> <b>order</b> to surrender in writing.|$|E

5|$|The French tanks had heavier armour and {{armament}} {{than the}} Panzers. The Panzer IV had 30mm of armour, while the Hotchkiss had 45mm, and the Char B1 had 60mm of protection. Moreover, its main armament, one 47mm and one 75mm gun, outmatched all the German tanks. In {{an open field}} engagement, Guderian's armour stood little chance. Two-thirds of his units were equipped with Panzer I and IIs. Just 30 of the Panzer IVs were on <b>his</b> <b>order</b> of battle. However, one crucial disadvantage of the French tanks, considered as a very broad whole, was their low endurance. They needed refuelling after just two hours. They were also slow in speed, complicating high tempo operations.|$|E

Impressed by Garrett's ability to see him, he offers him the chance to join <b>his</b> <b>order.</b> Garrett accepts, but later leaves the order to pursue a life of thievery. Years later, Garrett works as a thief, and is under pressure to join a crime ring. As punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee, he is targeted for assassination by the crime lord Ramirez. Garrett evades the assassins, and robs Ramirez's mansion in retaliation. Following this, he is approached by a woman named Viktoria—the representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by Garrett's theft from Ramirez. He is contracted to steal a sword from Constantine, an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in the City. After Garrett completes the mission, Viktoria takes him to Constantine, who explains that he hired Garrett to steal his own sword as a test. Constantine offers him a fortune to steal The Eye—a gem kept within a sealed and deserted Hammerite cathedral.|$|E
