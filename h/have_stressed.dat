5|$|Historians {{debate the}} extent to which Geneva was a theocracy. On the one hand, Calvin's {{theology}} clearly called for separation between church and state. Other historians <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the enormous political power wielded on a daily basis by the clerics.|$|E
5|$|Many traditions <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> {{the grief}} of mothers over {{deprivation}} {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the large}} numbers of {{pamphlets}} and broadsheets in circulation, literacy rates were still poor. Thus, some modern historians <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the critical and incendiary role that militant preachers played in shaping ordinary lay beliefs, both Catholic and Protestant.|$|E
25|$|Associated with Romanticism, a {{philosophy}} defining aesthetic value {{as the primary}} goal in understanding literature. This includes both literary critics {{who have tried to}} understand and/or identify aesthetic values and those like Oscar Wilde who <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> art for art's sake.|$|E
25|$|This {{interpretation}} is not universally accepted, however. Other authors and even these same investigators <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the economic links between Puntal dels Llops (with its access to mountain and forest resources), and the agricultural villages and specialist artisans {{living on the}} plain.|$|E

25|$|The first {{attestations}} {{of sculpture}} in Sardinia {{are much more}} ancient than the statues of Mont'e Prama. The most remote example is the so-called Venus of Macomer, in non finito technique, dated to 3750-3300 BC by the archaeologist Giovanni Lilliu, whereas for the archaeologist Enrico Atzeni the statuette should date back to Early Neolithic (6000-4000 BC). More recent studies <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the similarities to the Venus figurines, already noticed by Giovanni Lilliu, and hypothesized a retro-dating to Upper Palaeolithic or Mesolithic Age.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1996, a civic protest {{movement}} {{made up of}} {{an estimated}} 200,000 coca growers from Putumayo and part of Cauca began marching against the Colombian government to reject its drug war policies, including fumigations and the declaration of special security zones in some departments. Different analysts <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> that the movement itself fundamentally originated on its own, {{but at the same}} time, FARC heavily encouraged the marchers and actively promoted their demands both peacefully and through the threat of force.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} {{the start of the}} Industrial Revolution also {{concerns}} the massive lead that Great Britain had over other countries. Some <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. However, it has been pointed out that slave trade and West Indian plantations provided only 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution. Even though slavery accounted for so little, Caribbean-based demand accounted for 12% of Britain's industrial output.|$|E
50|$|Most lexical words <b>have</b> lexical <b>stress</b> {{on one of}} {{the last}} two {{syllable}}s, of which the last syllable is the more frequent in formal speech. Loanwords may <b>have</b> <b>stress</b> on the antepenultimate syllable or even further back.|$|R

25|$|Hungary and Israel {{established}} full {{diplomatic relations}} in 1948 and severed during the Six-Day War in 1967. Relations were restored in 1989 with improved relations {{as well as}} the opening of embassies and consulates with Hungary having an embassy in Tel Aviv and 4 honorary consulates (in Eilat, Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv) and Israel has an embassy in Budapest and an honorary consulate in Szeged. Both countries <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the increasing of trade and tourism between one another and an estimated 30,000 Hungarian Jews emigrated to Israel in 1948. Both nations are also members of the Union for the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Islam is {{the largest}} and state {{religion}} of Malaysia, although Malaysia is a multi-religious society and the Malaysian constitution guarantees religious freedom. Despite the recognition of Islam as the state religion, the first 4 prime ministers <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> that Malaysia could function as a secular state. According to the Population and Housing Census 2000 figures, approximately 60.4 {{percent of the population}} practised Islam; 19.2 percent Buddhism; 9.1 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; and 2.6 percent practise Confucianism, Taoism and other traditional Chinese religions. The remainder was accounted for by other faiths, including animism, folk religion, and Sikhism while 0.9% either reported having no religion or did not provide any information.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{scholars}} have posited various mechanisms other than massive demographic change by which pre-migration Celtic place-names {{could have been}} lost. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> that Welsh and Cornish place-names from the Roman period seem {{no more likely to}} survive than English ones: 'clearly name loss was a Romano-British phenomenon, not just one associated with Anglo-Saxon incomers'. Other explanations for the replacement of Roman period place-names include adaptation of Celtic names such that they now seem to come from Old English; a more gradual loss of Celtic names than was once assumed; and new names being coined (in the newly dominant English language) because instability of settlements and land-tenure.|$|E
5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects <b>have</b> <b>stress</b> on the {{penultimate}} syllable of a word. In Mexicanero from Durango, many unstressed syllables {{have disappeared}} from words, and {{the placement of}} syllable <b>stress</b> <b>has</b> become phonemic.|$|R

25|$|Marino {{remained}} in his birthplace Naples until 1600, leading {{a life of}} pleasure after breaking off relations with his father who wanted his son to follow a career in law. These formative years in Naples were {{very important for the}} development of his poetry, even though most of his career took place in the north of Italy and France. Regarding this subject, some critics (including Giovanni Pozzi) <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the great influence on him exerted by northern Italian cultural circles; others (such as Marzio Pieri) have emphasised the fact that the Naples of the time, though partly in decline and oppressed by Spanish rule, was far from having lost its eminent position among the capitals of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Schlessinger was non-religious {{until she}} and her son began {{practicing}} Conservative Judaism in 1996. In 1998, Schlessinger, Bishop, and their son converted to Orthodox Judaism, and began instruction under Rabbi Reuven P. Bulka of Ottawa, Canada. During this time, Schlessinger sometimes used Jewish law and examples to advise her callers about their moral dilemmas. She occasionally clarified ethical and moral issues with her local Orthodox Rabbi Moshe D. Bryski, before mentioning them on the air. She was embraced {{by many in the}} politically conservative segment of Orthodox Judaism for bringing more awareness of Orthodoxy to her radio show. Some of her expressed views were explicitly religious and are referenced her 1999 book The Ten Commandments: The Significance of God's Laws in Everyday Life. Although her other books <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the importance of morality, they are more secular in nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{caves in}} the Rock of Gibraltar that the Neanderthals {{inhabited}} have been excavated and have revealed {{a wealth of}} information about their lifestyle and the prehistoric landscape of the area. The peninsula stood {{on the edge of a}} fertile coastal plain, now submerged, that supported a wide variety of animals and plants which the Neanderthals exploited to provide a highly varied diet. Unlike northern Europe, which underwent massive swings in its climate and was largely uninhabitable for long periods, the far south of Iberia enjoyed a stable and mild climate for over 125,000 years. It became a refuge from the ice ages for animals, plants and Neanderthals, who survived there for possibly several thousand years longer than anywhere else. Around 24,000 years ago, however, the climate underwent abrupt changes which would have greatly disrupted the Gibraltar Neanderthals' food supply and may <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> their population beyond recovery, leading to their final extinction.|$|E
2500|$|All diphthongs {{can occur}} as both long and short, {{although}} this is not indicated in spelling. Short diphthongs are distinguished from long ones by both length and stress placement: short diphthongs <b>have</b> a <b>stressed</b> second component, whereas long diphthongs <b>have</b> <b>stress</b> on the first component.|$|R
5000|$|Tennekes <b>has</b> <b>stressed</b> {{the limited}} {{predictability}} of complex {{systems and the}} limited value of predictions based on scientific modeling.|$|R
50|$|Other {{languages}} <b>have</b> <b>stress</b> {{placed on}} different syllables {{but in a}} predictable way, as in Classical Arabic and Latin (whose stress is conditioned by {{the structure of the}} penult). They are said to <b>have</b> a regular <b>stress</b> rule.|$|R
25|$|For a given {{species in}} a given environment, {{available}} resources will {{limit the number of}} individuals that can survive indefinitely. This is the carrying capacity. Upon reaching this threshold, individuals may find it easier to gather resources in the poorer yet less exploited peripheral environment than in the preferred habitat. Homo habilis could have developed some baseline behavioural flexibility prior to its expansion into the peripheries (such as encroaching into the predatory guild). This flexibility could then have been positively selected and amplified, leading to Homo erectus adaptation to the peripheral open habitats. A new and environmentally flexible hominin population could have come back to the old niche and replace the ancestral population. Moreover, some step-wise shrinking of the woodland and the associated reduction of hominin carrying capacity in the woods around 1.8 Ma, 1.2 Ma, and 0.6 Ma would <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the carrying capacity's pressure for adapting to the open grounds.|$|E
25|$|This {{mesophile}} {{forest is}} found in the wettest part of the Sierra Gorda, where the moisture can reach the east facing slopes. Most of the area is classed as moist and semi hot. (A) C (fm) by the Koppen classification, or moist and semi hot, with most rain falling in the summer rainy season but rain and fog can be found at other times too, especially in the highest elevations. The average annual rainfall is 920mm although this has varied significantly in recent years. Temperatures vary widely depending on altitude. The high mountains areas are the coldest, experiencing freezing temperatures regularly, with the lower flatter lands having more tropical or arid land characteristics. The average annual temperature is 22C, with May as the hottest month, with temperatures rising as high as 43C. In January, there can be temperatures as low as -2C. In the 2000s, areas of the state have experienced hard freezes on several occasions, with temperatures as low as -10C. These freezing temperatures are due to cold fronts coming from the north and west. These usually only produce fog and light rain, with stronger ones causing freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have caused emergency conditions requiring interventions by civil authorities and have also led to loss of pasture for cattle. During the rainy season, large storms can cause severe flooding along rivers such as the Moctezuma and Tancuilín. In 2010, flooding damaged crops in El Naranjo and El Lobo, with dozens of hecatares of corn damaged. The rugged geography makes roads vulnerable to landslides, with rocks up to 1.5 tons falling onto Highway 120. Recent years of drought <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the trees of the area and have made them vulnerable to insects.|$|E
500|$|Many 20th-century historians <b>have</b> <b>stressed</b> the {{potential}} military strength of Castle Rising; R. Allen Brown, for example, concluded that [...] "defence... was the overwhelming consideration in [...] design and construction", {{and argued that}} the keep would {{have been used as}} a final refuge in the case of attack during a siege. Beric Morley and David Gurney believe that the military strength of the castle could not have failed to impress contemporaries. Sidney Toy suggested that the forebuilding would have made an effective defensive feature, enabling the defenders to attack intruders {{as they made their way}} up the stairs, with Morley and Gurney describing it as [...] "a deadly and near impregnable approach to the castle's interior".|$|E
