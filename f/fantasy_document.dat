5000|$|Sol Gareth [...] "Garry" [...] Davis (July 27, 1921 - July 24, 2013) was an {{international}} peace activist {{who created the}} World Passport, a <b>fantasy</b> travel <b>document</b> based on his interpretation of Article 13(2), Universal Declaration of Human Rights and {{on the concept of}} world citizenship. Previously Davis had worked as a Broadway stage actor and served as an American bomber pilot in World War II. He was a devoted World Federalist, although a consistent critic of the World Federalist Movement.|$|R
50|$|In Malaysia in 1994, a Nigerian man {{was arrested}} at the Central Market, Kuala Lumpur by tourist police during an {{identity}} check, after he showed a World Passport. A search of his belongings showed that he carried {{a total of five}} World Passports, as well as a real Nigerian passport that had been used by another person to travel to Malaysia and Hong Kong. Authorities suspected he might have been trying to sell the <b>fantasy</b> travel <b>documents</b> to other foreign nationals lacking valid travel documents.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its limited}} acceptance, other {{entities}} have {{also sought to}} manufacture and sell the <b>fantasy</b> travel <b>document,</b> {{without the consent of}} the WSA. The Isle of Man's Financial Supervision Commission reports that they have identified counterfeit World Passports. Also, the first cross-jurisdictional fake passport case ever found in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China involved counterfeit World Passports. In February 1981, the local Public Security Bureau identified some Hong Kong criminals who were charging World Passport customers more than ¥18,000 (more than US$10,000 at the official exchange rate at that time) in processing fees, and misrepresenting to them that World Passport customers could settle in any country in the world.|$|R
500|$|In 1997, the game's {{designers}} {{produced a}} 47-page document that outlined the game's premise and vision statement, {{and was used}} to pitch the idea to management at Interplay. Initially, the game was to be called Last Rites, and they described the game as [...] "avant-garde" [...] fantasy to distinguish it from high <b>fantasy.</b> The <b>document</b> also contained concept artwork for characters and areas of the game. It {{was one of three}} Planescape games being developed by Black Isle at the time, along with a PlayStation game by Colin McComb based on FromSoftware's King's Field, and a PC game by Planescape creator Zeb Cook; the other two were cancelled, and only Last Rites was released, as Torment.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} a few spinoffs from the main comic that have gained {{independent}} existences. An example is Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga (ELotH:TES), a parody of the written-by-committee fantasy fiction used as back-story {{for a wide variety}} of games: originally a one-off gag in the Penny Arcade comic, in late 2005 this was expanded into a complete <b>fantasy</b> universe, <b>documented</b> on a hoax [...] "fan-wiki". ELotH:TES first appeared in the webcomic of February 7, 2005, and has subsequently been featured in the comics of November 7, 2005 and November 30, 2005. Several elements of the ELotH:TES universe are featured on the cover of their second comics collection, Epic Legends of the Magic Sword Kings.|$|R
5000|$|Fiore also {{associate}} {{produced and}} wrote three episodes of Dead Tenants for the Learning Channel, which chronicled {{the adventures of}} the Preternatural Research Society. Other television work includes [...] "The Takeover", a reality pilot based on the day-to-day life of hip hop mogul Damon Dash which Fiore produced and co-directed with Dash for Roc-a-fella Films. Bizarre World co-produced with Ted Haimes for Rocket Science Labs, ran as two prime time specials for the Fox Network. He also directed Victoria's Secret: Christmas Dreams and <b>Fantasies,</b> which <b>documented</b> {{the creation of the}} household name’s holiday catalog. Fiore has also worked with Timothy Leary, Ted Nelson, Rudy Rucker and others on the Hypertour 89 project, his documentary on the then nascent media revolution focusing on CD-ROM, information networks, and virtual reality.|$|R
50|$|Hellen van Meene has {{admitted}} in interviews that she pre-plans her photographs and carefully chooses the pose, garment and location for each photograph. She {{has stated that}} she chooses the location of older homes {{as a way of}} immortalizing them. Van Meene’s work is recognizable not only by the consistent subject matter and lighting she uses, but also by the artist’s consistent use of a square format and shots that are set up from a medium focal range. Some articles have also noted the painterly influence in van Meene’s work, referencing the dream-like quality of the photographs and the softly-lit rooms in which her subjects are photographed. Van Meene’s portraits are distinguishable by the detached appearance of her subjects and her style that straddles the border between creating a <b>fantasy</b> world and <b>documenting</b> contemporary youth.|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{so-called}} black wave {{as a group}} of original achievements of the Yugoslav cinema, I set aside its dominant themes. As most important I have marked: 1. The post-war chaos and the inversion of values; 2. The forms of alienation In socialist society; 3. The sexual revolution; 4. Assumptions about the possibility of the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; 5. The representations of marginalized groups. These topics are mentioned as forms of critique of real socialism at the time that reveals dissatisfaction with inconsistent application of Marxist thought in social practice. Today, when one can notice exoticism of the past and as its consequence the so called yugonostalgia the post-Yugoslav societies,  these films can serve as a basis for questioning the value system of the Yugoslav socialist society to reveal the cracks in its idealized picture. Although the film, as a cultural product remains on the border between <b>fantasy</b> and the <b>document,</b> it reflects social relations. Like other forms of art film can be read like a text, and its semantics reveal consistency of defects, latent and manifest social criticism...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{novels that}} depict an imaginary invasion of Australia by an Asian country. It argues that novels of Asian invasion constitute a distinct body of formulaic literature - a subgenre - {{within the field}} of Australian popular fiction. This study undertakes a formative mapping of the subgenre of Asian invasion novels in three ways. It assembles the corpus of texts and provides an annotated bibliography. It delineates the generic form and content of the novels and monitors the resilience and evolution of the subgenre through changing historical and cultural contexts. It considers the ideological implications of the Asian invasion narrative through readings of race, nation and gender. The first novels of Asian invasion, which established the conventions of the subgenre, were produced during the period of intense nation building immediately before and after the federation of Australia in 1901. The explicit ideological project of these novels was to awaken white Australia to the threat Asia posed to its fledgling nationhood. This initial anxious literary production activated a detailed set of discourses centring on Australian vulnerability and Asian menace that endure to the present day. Generic invasion novels are alarmist, didactic texts that call for a massive strengthening of national defence by illustrating the ease with which Australia could be invaded under the present circumstances. In order to fulfil this pedagogic agenda the texts are often meticulously realist, but are at the same time complete <b>fantasy,</b> for they <b>document</b> not an actual but an imaginary war. This study contends that invasion novels bring together science fiction narrative structures, adventurous plots and realist literary strategies to construct a vehicle for the political ideology of Asian threat. The thesis charts the development of the subgenre from its inception in 1888 to the present time and locates thirty novels in all. A survey of the subgenre as a whole complements the detailed analysis of specific novels. It argues that these novels are primarily the same dystopian tale of the loss of white Australia told time and time again. On a subtextual level, Australia's very fixation with the fiction of Asian invasion generates a cultural significance of its own. This study explores how the compulsive retelling of the generic prophesy of Asian invasion implicitly suggests specifically white cultural anxieties stemming from Australia's status as a relatively new settler society, itself born of invasion...|$|R
