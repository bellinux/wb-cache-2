For this purpose, {{the model was}} implemented in a commercial finite element code and was used to simulate the cross-die deep drawing test. Deep drawing experiments and numerical simulations were conducted for five <b>interstitial-free</b> <b>steels</b> and seven dual-phase steels, each of them having a different thickness and strength. The main interest of the adopted model is a very efficient parameter identification procedure, due to the physical background of the model and the physical significance {{of some of its}} parameters and state variables. Indeed, the dislocation density, grain size, and martensite volume fraction explicitly enter the model’s formulation, although the overall approach is macroscopic. For the dual-phase steels, only the chemical composition and the average grain sizes were measured for the martensite and ferrite grains, as well as the martensite volume fraction. The mild steels required three additional tensile tests along three directions, in order to describe the plastic anisotropy. Information concerning the transient mechanical behavior after strain-path changes (reverse and orthogonal) was not collected for each material, but for only one material of each family of steels (IF, DP), based on previous works available in the literature. This minimalistic experimental base was used to feed the numerical simulations for the twelve materials that were confronted to deep drawing experiments in terms of thickness distributions. The results suggested that the accuracy of the numerical simulations is very satisfactory in spite of the scarce experimental input data. Additional investigations indicated that the modeling of the transient behavior due to strain-path changes may {{have a significant impact on}} the simulation results, and that the adopted approach provides a simple and efficient alternative in this regard.

Nominal reductions of 50 % per pass and an intermediate annealing treatment of 5 min. at 520 °C were employed. A total true strain of εvM = 8. 00 was applied, which corresponds to an accumulated reduction of 99. 9 %. The evolution of texture and microstructure was monitored {{by means of}} orientation imaging microscopy. A lamellar microstructure, characteristic of severely rolled sheet materials, was observed even after the highest strains. The average lamellar width was determined {{as a function of}} rolling strain. Under the experimental limitations in terms of spatial resolution, no significant difference was observed between the average lamellar width in the mid-section and near the surface of the sheet. Texture analysis revealed a conventional cross-sectional gradient with plane strain rolling components in the mid-layers and shear components in the subsurface regions. Although these different strain modes did not affect the microstructure in terms of the average lamellar spacing, an effect was observed on the average aspect ratio of the grains. This was much higher in the sheared (surface) layers than in the plane strain compressed (centre) areas.

40|$|AbstractExperiments {{have shown}} that a {{gradient}} design, in which grain size spans over four orders of magnitude, can make strong nanomaterials ductile. The enhanced ductility is attributed to the considerable strain hardening capability obtained in the gradient metals. A non-uniform deformation on the lateral sample surface is also observed. This might inject geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) into the sample. However, no direct evidence has been provided. Therefore the issues remain: why can the gradient structure generate high strain hardening, {{and how does it}} reconcile the strength-ductility synergy of gradient nanostructures? Here {{for the first time we}} quantitatively investigate the strain hardening of a gradient <b>interstitial-free</b> <b>steel</b> by developing a dislocation density-based continuum plasticity model, in which the interaction of the component layers in the gradient structure is represented by incorporating GNDs and back stress. It is demonstrated that both the surface non-uniform deformation and the strain-hardening rate up-turn can be quantitatively well predicted. The results also show that the strain hardening rate of the gradient sample can reach as high as that of the coarse-grained counterpart. A strength-ductility map is then plotted, which clearly show that the gradient samples perform much more superior to their homogeneous counterparts in strength-ductility synergy. The predicted map has been verified by a series of experimental data. A detailed analysis on GNDs distribution and back stress evolution at the end further substantiates our view that the good strain hardening capability results from the generation of abundant GNDs by the surface non-uniform deformation into the nano-grained layers of the gradient sample...|$|E
