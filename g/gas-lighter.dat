60|$|Mrs. Simpson, after {{a little}} hesitation, handed him the key, and the next moment her husband stepped out and stood {{blinking}} in the <b>gas-light.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bardell, not yet {{thoroughly}} awake, complied. It was {{a curious}} place: a large wall, with a gate in the middle, and a <b>gas-light</b> burning inside.|$|R
60|$|In a subdued tone, as he sauntered {{along the}} crowded street, which {{by that time}} was blazing with <b>gas-light</b> in the shop-windows and oil-lamps on the hucksters' barrows.|$|R
60|$|As he {{approached}} Cleopatra's Needle {{he saw a}} man leaning over the parapet, and as he came nearer the man looked up, the <b>gas-light</b> falling full upon his face.|$|R

6000|$|In my neighbor's windows the <b>gas-lights</b> flare, [...] As {{the dancers}} swing in a waltz of Strauss; [...] And I wonder now could I fit that air [...] To {{the song of}} this sad old house.|$|R
6000|$|Awed, silent, and {{dazzled by}} the sudden <b>gas-light,</b> she clung to his hand, but evidently {{distinguished}} no one else; and he placed her close to the magistrate saying, [...] "This is Mr. Grey, Rose, tell him your name." ...|$|R
60|$|Densham drew {{a square}} card from his pocket, {{and held it}} out under the <b>gas-light.</b> From it, it {{appeared}} that the Princess Lobenski desired the honour of his company at any time that evening between twelve and two.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} I {{went to the}} {{promenade}} in the Exhibition of Pictures, which was splendidly lighted up and filled with fashionable company. I {{think there was a}} want of beauty,--or perhaps the <b>gas-lights</b> were unfavourable to the ladies' looks.|$|R
6000|$|... "They went that way, but I {{suppose you}} didn’t see them," [...] {{continued}} the householder. [...] "Halloa!" [...] he added, as somebody opened the hall {{door and the}} constable’s damaged condition became visible in the <b>gas-light.</b> [...] "Are you hurt?" ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed softly, {{and they}} looked around {{together}} at the dimly burning <b>gas-lights,</b> the creaking scenery being drawn back from the stage, the woman with a brush and mop sweeping, and at that dismal perspective of holland-shrouded auditorium beyond, now quite deserted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{descriptions}} of child poverty are evocative of the novels by Charles Dickens. Dickens himself visited New York {{in the early}} forties and wrote the Book [...] "American Notes". Another possible source is George G. Foster's New York by <b>Gas-light</b> and Other Urban Sketches (1850).|$|R
60|$|In {{the back}} slums {{of this region}} there were no bright <b>gas-lights.</b> The shops were ill-lighted and miserable, like the population, except a few {{at the corners of}} streets, where rough men and ragged women, and even children, went to poison {{themselves}} with gin.|$|R
50|$|Inventor {{but also}} entrepreneur, teaming with his brothers, Camille, Jules, Paul and Charles, {{as well as}} his brother in law Vincent Mignot he {{continued}} his father's successful business in textiles, paper, <b>gas-lighting,</b> coal mines, construction and added to it a railroad company and a bridge construction business.|$|R
6000|$|Said Mr. Datchery {{to himself}} that night, {{as he looked at}} his white hair in the <b>gas-lighted</b> looking-glass over the coffee-room chimneypiece at the Crozier, and shook it out: ‘For a single buffer, of an easy temper, living idly on his means, I have had a rather busy afternoon!’ ...|$|R
60|$|The Mohill resort of the wicked, the desperate, and the drunken, was not {{certainly}} so grand, nor so conspicuous, as the <b>gas-lighted,</b> mahogany fitted, pilastered gin palaces of London; but {{the freedom}} from decent restraint, {{and the power}} of inebriety at a cheap rate, were the same in each.|$|R
60|$|She {{threw back}} her shawl from her head, {{and under the}} low-burning <b>gas-light</b> held aloft by the spelter {{statuette}} in the newel post, she confronted Mr. Dickerson. He had his hat on, and had the air of just having let himself in; his gripsack stood at his feet.|$|R

6000|$|Thro' many an hour {{of summer}} suns [...] By many {{pleasant}} ways, [...] Against its fountain upward runs [...] The current of my days: [2] [...] I kiss the lips I once have kiss'd; [...] The <b>gas-light</b> wavers dimmer; [...] And softly, thro' a vinous mist, [...] My college friendships glimmer.|$|R
60|$|Once in the street, Mopsey stopped {{under the}} nearest <b>gas-light</b> and asked Ben {{to see how}} much money Mr. Weston had given them. Ben {{unfolded}} the bills, which he held crumpled up in his hand, and the surprise of all four may be imagined when he unrolled five twenty-dollar notes.|$|R
60|$|We {{stopped there}} that night, and next day were off, whirled along through {{boundless}} landscapes of villages, and meadows, and parks: and over arching viaducts, and through wonderful tunnels; till, half delirious with excitement, I found myself dropped {{down in the}} evening among <b>gas-lights,</b> under a great roof in Euston Square.|$|R
50|$|During Easter and for {{the three}} weeks around Christmas and New Year's, the G cars were {{withdrawn}} from suburban service and used to boost the country rail network's capacity. This was justified by the fewer commuters at the time. The carriages had been specially fitted with alternate <b>gas-lighting</b> equipment (hence the G code).|$|R
6000|$|It {{happened}} {{well that}} I had seen, {{on a wild}} day at Tynemouth, a remarkable sea-effect, of which I wrote a description to him, and he had kept it under his pillow. This place is looking very pretty. The freshness and repose of it, after all those thousands of <b>gas-lighted</b> faces, sink into the soul.[84] ...|$|R
50|$|He was {{a trustee}} in 1845 of the then village of Racine, then in 1850 was an {{alderman}} {{of the now}} City of Racine. When the city created a school board, he was among those elected to it. When in 1855 a Racine <b>Gas-light</b> and Coke Company was organized, he was among those elected to its initial board of directors.|$|R
6000|$|What did I {{read in the}} London daily papers, in {{the early}} days of this last September? That the Police had 'AT LENGTH SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING TWO OF THE NOTORIOUS GANG THAT HAVE SO LONG INVESTED THE WATERLOO ROAD.' Is it possible? What a {{wonderful}} Police! Here is a straight, broad, public thoroughfare of immense resort; half a mile long; <b>gas-lighted</b> by night; with a great <b>gas-lighted</b> railway station in it, extra the street lamps; full of shops; traversed by two popular cross thoroughfares of considerable traffic; itself the main road to the South of London; and the admirable Police have, after long infestment of this dark and lonely spot by a gang of Ruffians, actually got hold of two of them. Why, can it be doubted that any man of fair London knowledge and common resolution, armed with the powers of the Law, could have captured the whole confederacy in a week? ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1871 Imray joined Charles Denton Abel, {{brother of}} the late Sir Frederick Abel, in {{partnership}} as Consulting Engineers and Patent Agents, under the name Abel & Imray. He was frequently employed as an expert in cases of patent litigation, including notable cases such as the [...] "Telephone actions", the [...] "Otto gas-engine actions", the [...] "Westinghouse air-brake actions", and the [...] "Welsbach <b>gas-lighting</b> actions".|$|R
5000|$|The {{completed}} six-story {{building was}} built of brick and painted yellow with brown trim. It had a four-story open-air lobby filed with plants, flowers, and a 12 ft fountain. [...] The house also boasted <b>gas-light</b> chandeliers, a central heating plant, a laundry, billiard hall, and 500 hotel rooms. It also had sixteen stores. It {{was the first}} building in Atlanta to have elevators and central heating.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps, if {{they had}} not planned to go to the theatre, they would have staid where they were, for they were tired, and it was very cosey. But when they were once in the street, they were glad they had come out. Bowdoin Square and Court Street and Tremont Row were a glitter of <b>gas-lights,</b> and those shops, with their {{placarded}} bargains, dazzled Marcia.|$|R
