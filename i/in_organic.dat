40|$|Magnetic and spin-based {{technologies}} for data {{storage and processing}} pose unique challenges for information transduction to light because of magnetic metals' optical loss, and the inefficiency and resistivity of semiconductor spin-based emitters at room temperature. Transduction between magnetic and optical information <b>in</b> typical <b>organic</b> semiconductors poses additional challenges as the Faraday and Kerr magnetooptical effects rely on the electronic spin-orbit interaction, and the spin-orbit interaction <b>in</b> <b>organics</b> is weak. Other methods of coupling light and spin have emerged <b>in</b> <b>organics,</b> however, as the spin-dependent character of exciton recombination, with spin injection from magnetic electrodes, provides magnetization-sensitive light emission, although such approaches have been limited to low temperature and low polarization efficiency. Here we demonstrate room temperature information transduction between a magnet and an {{organic light emitting diode}} that does not require electrical current, based on control via the magnet's remanent field of the exciton recombination process <b>in</b> the <b>organic</b> semiconductor.

40|$|Trust and {{knowledge}} are two concepts {{that are considered}} important for understanding consumers’ engagement with organic products, but the concepts are often used at random. This article explores the configuration and generation of consumer trust <b>in</b> <b>organics</b> and investigates the relationship between knowledge and trust. The {{article is based on}} a multi-method study of Danish consumers’ perceptions of organics that included a consumer survey, a focus group, and individual interviews. The inquiry documents that Danish consumers’ display a high degree of trust <b>in</b> <b>organics,</b> and have overly positive expectations regarding organics, but know little about the difference between organic and non-organic products. Many respondents express no interest in acquiring additional knowledge, indicating that Danish consumers embody a blind trust of organics, but one that is also fragile because it might easily turn into distrust. Our results indicate that once consumers have decided to trust organics, they tend to seek confirmation of their belief and avoid conflicting knowledge that might challenge their decision. Our findings suggest that the general trust <b>in</b> <b>organics</b> is trumped by personal experiences and pragmatic concerns such as price, taste and appearance...|$|R

Contrary to {{the assumption that}} SOC <b>in</b> <b>organics</b> is negligible due to light C, S, H atoms, we show the relevance of such an interaction in a few representative cases. In the weakly correlated regime, SOC manifests primarily in the opening of energy gaps at degenerate band touching points. This effect becomes especially important for Dirac semimetals such as α-(ET) _ 2 I_ 3. Furthermore, in the magnetic insulating phase, SOC results in additional anisotropic exchange interactions, which provide a compelling explanation for the controversial field-induced behaviour of the quantum spin-liquid candidate κ-(ET) _ 2 Cu_ 2 (CN) _ 3.
