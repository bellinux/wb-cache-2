40|$|The {{rotating}} disc {{method was}} used to study the dissolution kinetics of <b>ketanserin</b> <b>tartrate,</b> the salt of a weakly basic drug. Both solubility and dissolution rate decrease exponentially with increasing pH of the dissolution medium. A plot of the logarithm of the ratio of dissolution rate to solubility vs the bulk solution pH shows increasing ratios with increasing pH. This phenomenon is attributed to a self-buffering action of the drug within the diffusion layer at the solid-solvent interface...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{shows the}} {{extension}} of the applicability of the megaloporous system for drugs with different physico-chemical properties, like solubility and pK [...] Procaine HC 1, a highly soluble drug, can successfully be formulated in the programmed release megaloporous system, by using Carnauba wax, stearyl alcohol and carboxyvinyl polymer to constitute the restraining matrix granules. Megaloporous systems with salts of weakly basic drugs, like <b>ketanserin</b> <b>tartrate</b> and mianserin hydrochloride, show the achievement of almost pH-independent release profiles by incorporation of a proper acidic excipient in the programmed release system. ...|$|E
