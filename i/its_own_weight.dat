5|$|Normally a {{sluggish}} species, {{it relies on}} camouflage for protection. Locomotion is primarily rectilinear, using the broad ventral scales in a caterpillar fashion and aided by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight</b> for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with surprising speed.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight,</b> which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are usually}} {{continuously}} regenerated and their concentrations maintained {{at a steady}} level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight</b> in ATP each day.|$|E

30|$|The {{weighting}} factors (b 1 and b 2 in (1)) for each image representation are applied equally {{to all of}} the ‘channels’. Since some of the channels are more robust than others, like in the case of HSV for example, each channel should have <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weighting</b> factor. Since this study allows us to cut down the number of useful representations, we propose to study the best behaving ones in more detail with separate {{weighting factors}} where needed.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight.</b> Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight,</b> it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight</b> in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of time, a snowpack may settle under <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight</b> until its density is {{approximately}} 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum density of , which is roughly half of the density of liquid water.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings can eat {{huge numbers}} of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight.</b> One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|The statue has {{required}} repair work {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight</b> on the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems.|$|E
50|$|To {{recognise}} faces, gallery images, those {{seen by the}} system, {{are saved}} as collections of weights describing the contribution each eigenface has to that image. When a new face is presented to the system for classification, <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weights</b> are found by projecting the image onto the collection of eigenfaces. This provides a set of weights describing the probe face. These weights are then classified against all weights in the gallery set to find the closest match. A nearest neighbour method is a simple approach for finding the Euclidean distance between two vectors, where the minimum can be classified as the closest subject.|$|R
50|$|Metabolic {{processes}} that use ATP as an energy source convert {{it back into}} its precursors.

40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{system identification}} {{have been widely}} used for estimate the nonlinear model of system. In this paper, multilayer perceptron neural network is used for identifying the Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (NARX) model of a quarter car passive suspension system. Input output data are acquired by driving a car on a special road event. The networks structure is developed based on system model. The Networks learning algorithm is derived using Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s scoring method. Then the Fisher information is given as a weighted covariance matrix of inputs and outputs the network hidden layer. Unitwise Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s scoring method reduces to the algorithm in which each unit estimate <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weights</b> by a weighted least square method. The results show that the method uses suitable for modeling a quarter car passive suspension systems...|$|R
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess a mechanism to mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. Eryops, an example of an animal that made such adaptations, refined many of the traits found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight.</b> Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing Eryops to amplify, and so better sense, airborne sound.|$|E
5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight</b> in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected {{the candle}} each year. The firm {{originally}} did {{the project for}} free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over {{had it not been}} leaning against the candle structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight,</b> was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged {{from the top of the}} statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The candle suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee.|$|E

25|$|The venom of Portia {{is unusually}} {{powerful}} against spiders. When a Portia stabs a small to medium spider (up to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight),</b> including another Portia, the prey usually rans away for about 100 to 200millimetres, enters convulsions, becomes paralysed after 10 to 30seconds, and continues convulsing for 10seconds to 4minutes. Portia slowly approaches the prey and takes it. Portia usually needs to inflict up to 15stabbings to completely immobilise a larger spider (1.5 to 2times <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weight),</b> {{and then the}} Portia may wait about 20 to 200millimetres away for 15 to 30minutes from seizing the prey. Insects are usually not immobilised so quickly but continue to struggle, sometimes for several minutes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} learning algorithms of layered {{neural networks}} {{from the standpoint}} of maximum likelihood estimation. Fisher information is explicitly calculated for the network with only one neuron. It can be interpreted as a weighted covariance matrix of input vectors. A learning algorithm is presented on the basis of Fisher's scoring method. It is shown that the algorithm can be interpreted as iterations of weighted least square method. Then those results are extended to the layered network with one hidden layer. It is also shown that Fisher information is given as a weighted covariance matrix of inputs and outputs of hidden units for this network. Tow new algorithms are proposed by utilizing this information. It is experimentally shown that the algorithms converge with fewer iterations than usual BP algorithm. Especially UFS (unitwise Fisher's scoring) method reduces to the algorithm in which each unit estimates <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weights</b> byaweighted least squares method...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{computational}} models {{have become more}} and more important in testing processing mechanisms assumed to underlie human spoken-word recognition. Models like TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986) and Shortlist (Norris, 1994) have given us much insight in the effects of, for instance, competition between words in the mental lexicon and the use of lexical information during word recognition. However, these models neglect the effects of coarticulation and variability over time by using mock speech instead of real speech input. Here we describe a new connectionist model for spoken-word recognition which differs on a number of points from other models, in that it takes real speech as input, is based on a new architecture for the representation of time, and can adapt <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>weights.</b> Simulations with the model accurately reproduce some important effects found in human word recognition. However, the representations of words in the model and the implementation of the frequency effect should be investigated more thoroughly...|$|R

The episcopal fiefholders Viztum and Meier built the Bishop's Castle (the seat of Meier) and the Viztumsturm (Viztum's tower). In the 14th century the castle ruled over three surrounding areas; Loye (Lobio), Tschablen (Cabulo) and Galdinen (Caldana). All three of those areas grew into independent municipalities. In 1458, Leuk codified the customary rights of the citizens into law. This [...] "old castle law" [...] was updated in 1563.|$|R
