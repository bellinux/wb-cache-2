5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

Her death was caused by heart disease stemming from rheumatic fever, {{as well as a}} lung infection. Edward and Carrie's marriage was fragile, owing mostly to the <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of mining life and their many financial problems. Eileen's death further strained the marriage. Nearly a year after Eileen's death, on November 6, 1893, Carrie gave birth to their only son Edward Jr., known as Ned.|$|E

500|$|Guest {{stars in}} the episode include Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator. Scully thought Robbins [...] "did a great job" [...] because the Simpsons staff wanted the {{character}} of Jim Hope to be [...] "fun and upbeat and somebody the kids would love." [...] Clemons narrates a few scenes {{at the end of}} the episode, telling the viewers how the story ends. When Coleman agrees to spend Christmas with the Simpsons, Clemons says, for example: [...] "And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants." [...] Shortly after Coleman's death in 2010, an article appeared in the newspaper El Comercio that noted that [...] "the nod to the <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of Gary Coleman in [...] is given: in real life a few years ago Gary had to make a living as a shop security guard." ...|$|E
500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E

[...] The Atlantic Patrick Burns agreed: Jones's [...] "performance as the Santa Claus bearer of <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> was quite moving.

[...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of}} the absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] A similar sentiment was expressed by VanDerWerff in his review of the following episode, [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle": [...] "I also like Coach Beiste because she’s one of the few characters who seems to grasp how insane some of this is. I always like when a show that frequently goes over the top introduces someone who’s able to undercut some of that ridiculousness." ...|$|E
500|$|Rothbard's The Libertarian Forum {{blamed the}} Middle East {{conflict}} on Israeli aggression [...] "fueled by American arms and money." [...] Rothbard {{warned that the}} mid-East conflict would draw the U.S. into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and [...] opposed U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard criticized the Camp David Accords for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In his essay, [...] "War Guilt in the Middle East," [...] Rothbard states that Israel refused [...] "to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them." [...] He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying: On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who {{come from all over}} the world, and who claim the entire land area as [...] "given" [...] to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no [...] "peace" [...] in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one. That is the <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of the Middle East.|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOL TV {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{linchpin}} {{of the hour}} was Brittany's belief in Santa Claus." [...] The New York Post Jarett Wieselman called it [...] "adorably realized by actress Heather Morris", and Canning said she [...] "perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa". Brown was less enthusiastic, and wrote that she was tiring of the [...] "look how dumb yet kind-hearted Brittany is" [...] plots. Keller approved of the Artie and Brittany coupling, {{and said it was}} [...] "way more fun to watch than Rachel and Finn and all their angst", and Canning felt that the episode's heart was Artie working to keep Brittany from becoming disillusioned about Santa. He also wrote, [...] "shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] Burns agreed: [...] "Coach Bieste's performance as the Santa Claus bearer of <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of the}} absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] However, he was disappointed by how the storyline played out: [...] "it didn't feel right that after the story the episode built around Brittany, it then felt that we needed to see Artie on his feet for it to be a truly happy ending." ...|$|E

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

2500|$|When Cosmopolitan folded, Davies {{left the}} film {{business}} and retreated to San Simeon.

Decades after Davies' retirement and death, however, the consensus among some critics is more appreciative of her efforts, particularly in the field of comedy.|$|E
2500|$|In the early- to-mid 1980s, {{there was}} no {{established}} hip hop music industry, as exists in the 2010s, with record labels, record producers, managers and Artists and Repertoire staff.

However, in the late 1980s, music industry executives realized that they could capitalize {{on the success of}} [...] "gangsta rap." [...] They made a formula that created [...] "a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence." [...] This type of rap was marketed to the new fanbase: white males.

By the time he concluded his traditional education in Paris in 1928, the focus of his studies in figurative art had been eclipsed by Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism and other nontraditional movements, all of which made his art appear passé, {{out of step with}} new trends and public tastes. This <b>harsh</b> <b>reality</b> and the economic shock waves of the Great Depression dimmed any prospects of his making a living from his art.
