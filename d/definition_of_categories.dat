By revealing the processes leading to the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> and the interpretation of identities, and by giving ‘faces’ to decisions made, the ‘reflexive museum’ can become an embodiment of democracy, which does not silence controversies but gives diversity public voices. The ‘reflexive museum’ as I envisage it, by referring to Beck and Bonss’ ‘reflexive modernity’ (2001) is not only self-aware, but confronts, critiques, questions and ultimately transforms itself and invites the visitor to democratically participate in this process. First, I sketch out recent academic musings on museological approaches. Then I present some examples of exhibitions in Germany in which these theories have been put into practice. I conclude by arguing for a symbiotic relationship between museum theory and practice, enabling the museum to realise its unique potential as a dynamic ‘playground’ located between scholarly thinking and the public...|$|E

30|$|In general, a {{category}} consists {{of objects and}} morphisms between objects. It is subject to a few axioms but we leave the details such as the rigorous <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> and their basic properties to introductory textbooks (Awodey 2010; Spivak 2014). Objects represent things of interest and a morphism between two objects represents an allowed process {{from one to the}} other. For example, in the category of sets, objects are sets and morphisms are maps. A map f from a set A to another set B (we write f:A→B) specifies an element of B to which each element of A is transformed. As the map f has its domain A and codomain B, each morphism in {{a category}} has its domain and codomain. The domain and codomain of a morphism can be seen as input and output to the process represented by the morphism, respectively. We denote a morphism m with domain D and codomain E in a category by m:D→E {{as in the case of}} maps. As two maps f:A→B and g:B→C can be composed and yield a new map g∘f:A→C, two morphisms m:D→E and n:E→F can be composed. The obtained morphism is denoted by n∘m:D→F.|$|E
40|$|In {{social and}} {{economic}} studies many of the collected variables are measured on a nominal scale, often {{with a large number}} of categories. The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> is usually not unambiguous and different classification schemes using either a finer or a coarser grid are possible. Categorisation has an impact when such a variable is included as covariate in a regression model: a too fine grid will result in imprecise estimates of the corresponding effects, whereas with a too coarse grid important effects will be missed, resulting in biased effect estimates and poor predictive performance. To achieve automatic grouping of levels with essentially the same effect, we adopt a Bayesian approach and specify the prior on the level effects as a location mixture of spiky normal components. Fusion of level effects is induced by a prior on the mixture weights which encourages empty components. Model-based clustering of the effects during MCMC sampling allows to simultaneously detect categories which have essentially the same effect size and identify variables with no effect at all. The properties of this approach are investigated in simulation studies. Finally, the method is applied to analyse effects of high-dimensional categorical predictors on income in Austria...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates a {{comprehensive}} classification system for mandibular fractures based on imaging analysis. The AO/ASIF scheme, defining three fracture types (A, B, C), three groups within each type (e. g. A 1, A 2, A 3) and three subgroups within each group (e. g. A 1. 1, A 1. 2, A 1. 3) with increasing severity from A 1. 1 (lowest) to C 3. 3 (highest) was used. The mandible {{is divided into}} two vertical units (I and V), two lateral horizontal units (II and IV) and one central unit (III) comprising the symphyseal and parasymphyseal region. Type A fractures are non-displaced, type B are displaced and type C are multifragmentary/defect injuries. Groups and subgroups are further defined in the classification system. Two classification sessions using semi-automatic software with 7 and 9 surgeons were performed to evaluate 100 fracture cases in the first session and 50 in the second. Inter-observer reliability and individual rater's accuracy were evaluated by kappa coefficient and latent class analysis, respectively. The analysis of inter-observer agreement for the detailed coding showed kappa coefficients around 0. 50 with higher agreement among raters in the vertical units. This system allows standardization of documentation of mandibular fractures, although improvement in the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> and their application is required...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{integrating}} geospatial information (GI) data from various heterogeneous sources has seen increased importance for {{geographic information system}} (GIS) interoperability. Using domain ontologies to clarify and integrate the semantics of data is considered as a crucial step for successful semantic integration in the GI domain. Nevertheless, mechanisms are still needed to facilitate semantic mapping between GI ontologies described in different natural languages. This research establishes a formal ontology model for cross-lingual geospatial information ontology mapping. By first extracting semantic primitives from a free-text <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> in two GI classification standards with different natural languages, an ontology-driven approach is used, and a formal ontology model is established to formally represent these semantic primitives into semantic statements, in which the spatial-related properties and relations are considered as crucial statements for the representation and identification of the semantics of the GI categories. Then, an algorithm is proposed to compare these semantic statements in a cross-lingual environment. We further design a similarity calculation algorithm based on the proposed formal ontology model to distance the semantic similarities and identify the mapping relationships between categories. In particular, we work with two GI classification standards for Chinese and American topographic maps. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed model for cross-lingual geospatial information ontology mapping...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although general {{categories}} {{are an important}} feature of many KOSs, they are difficult to define. If we are to understand the factors that render category definition difficult, we should consider how designers of past KOSs have defined the categories in their systems. This paper presents, as a case study, {{an analysis of the}} formulation of categories in J. Kaiser’s theory of systematic indexing, which was designed for the indexing of commercial literature. Kaiser’s theory posited three categories: concretes, countries, and processes. Close examination of his writings reveals semantic tensions in the definition of each category. Concretes were defined both in general terms as things-in-the-world and in domain-specific terms as commodities; Countries were defined as political units but included geographical regions that were not politically unified; and Processes were defined alternately as conditions of concretes or actions associated with them. Tensions also appear in the categorial scheme comprising these categories, of which there were dyadic (Concrete-Process) and triadic (Concrete-Country-Process), the former of which was grounded on a theoretical model and the latter, on pragmatic, domain-specific considerations. Kaiser’s attempts to harmonize these models by deriving countries from concretes faltered because of his narrow construal of concretes. The tensions in Kaiser’s <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> are due to semantic overdetermination, while those associated with his categorial scheme are ascribable to the general tension between theory and practice...|$|E

Also, measures of economic incentives of migratory inflow (outflow) of the population in the necessary scales and directions for an increase in a contribution of external migrations in the demographic and labor capacity of the country, and the changing of the direction of internal migration flows according to the socioeconomic and national interests of Russia and its regions are presented. Mathematical and economic-mathematical modelling in the management of labor migration are considered as a component of the mechanism of region's labor market stabilization. In this regard, the system of indicators allowing most adequately to estimate a migratory situation and its influence on the formation of labor potential and development of regional labor market is analyzed.

By using recent developments in data mining, {{it is a question}} of the classification of heterogeneous data in order to sort hedge funds by risk class. In practical terms, risk levels relative to measures of histogram-valued data on VaR are calculated as an aid to decision-making. The empirical study was carried out on 1023 HFR-based hedge funds, where we had estimated monthly ARMA-GARCH or asymmetric GARCH VaR and CVaR measures between 01 January 2003 and 31 December 2008. We identify two sub-periods: from 2003 to 2005, and from 2006 to 2008 in order to identify a recovery period after the 2001 – 2002 crisis and the impact of the 2007 – 2008 crisis. First, the symbolic approach allows us to construct the measures of histogram-valued data on VaR by optimizing the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories.</b> A symbolic principal component analysis shows that the indices coming from the VaR of the GARCH and asymmetrical GARCH are the most pertinent. Second, we apply a criterion of inter-class inertia and retain a partitioning of hedge funds into three classes by dynamic K-means cluster analysis. For each of our sub-periods and for each class, a risk level is defined on the basis of the categories of the most discriminating variable...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{introduces}} the new concept of dendroidal set. Dendroidal sets are a generalization of simplicial sets that are particularly {{suited to the}} study of operads in the context of homotopy theory. The relation between operads and dendroidal sets is established via the dendroidal nerve functor which assigns to each operad a dendroidal set. This is done {{in such a way as}} to generalize the nerve construction of a category as introduced by Grothendieck. The main concept introduced and studied within the theory of dendroidal sets is that of an inner Kan complex. This is a dendroidal set satisfying certain filling conditions that endow the dendroidal set with a very rich structure. This concept can be seen as a generalization of quasi-categories, which are recently beeing studied by Joyal. It is shown that the theory of dendroidal sets lends itself very naturally {{to the study of}} up-to-homotopy algebras in the context of monoidal model categories. Our approach provides for a very natural <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> enriched in a dendroidal set, and this definition can be iterated. This results, among other things, in a definition of weak n-categories. There is a close relation between dendroidal sets and simplicial sets, foremost when considering Joyal's model structure on simplicial sets. In that context we provide a proof that the inner Kan dendroidal sets form an exponential ideal with respect to certain normal dendroidal sets. This result, when restricted to simplicial sets, provides a new proof for the result of Joyal that quasi-categories form an exponential ideal in simpclicial sets. The general theory of dendroidal sets seems to be of relevance in whenever up-to-homotopy algebras are being studies (thus A_∞-spaces and A_∞-categories), as well as in the general theory of operads...|$|E
40|$|Discussion of nominalization (NZN) is {{possible}} only within a general theory of grammatical categories and processes. For a cross-linguistic analysis, it is preferable to adopt a function-based <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories,</b> in which nominals are considered arguments of predications and verbals as predications. In such a view, nouns are lexical items specialized for nominal usage. NZNs may be divided into four types: Act(ion), Participant, Adverbial, and Expression. Participant NZNs are a superset of Argument NZNs, while Expression NZNs are hypostases. Nominalization processes may be considered in terms of formation strategies and differentiation strategies. Formation of NZNs may be accomplished {{by a number of}} methods. An overt marker may be used (direct encoding strategy), or the mechanisms used for forming complex modifiers may be used with generic heads to form 'names for things' (modification strategy). Transfer nominalization may be considered an additional strategy, although transfer in the framework used represents occurrence of a dual-class form and is not strictly nominalization. Differentiation of NZNs may also be accomplished via direct encoding. However, a number of other differentiation strategies exist, including the use of voice and aspect markers and noun classifiers. Typically, Participant NZNs in a given language will represent conflations of participant roles kept separate in main clause morphosyntax; these conflations follow identifiable trends. In a study of 58 languages, it was found that Instrumental NZNs significantly correlate with Agentives, and Factives with Act (ion) NZNs. The Agentive/Instrumental and Act(ion) /Factive groupings remain separate from each other. Comparison of languages in the sample also shows that certain marking categories, such as voice, appear to be related to nominalization in general. That is, transitivity downshifters are associated with nominalization while upshifters are not. The factors underlying this association are related to those involved in the formation of object concepts in child language. The nominal concept develops from the object concept, and inherits a number of prototype characteristics from it without being, in adult language, directly isomorphic to it. This relationship accounts for a number of the observed characteristics of nominalizations...|$|E
