Our mass spectrometry analysis revealed a novel N-terminal phosphorylation of the major H 1 variant <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> at serine 35 (<b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 35 ph), which accumulates at mitosis immediately after H 3 phosphorylation at serine 10.

Moreover, <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 35 A substitution mutant cannot efficiently rescue the mitotic defect following <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> depletion, and inhibition of PKA activity increases the mitotic chromatin compaction depending on <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4.</b> Our results not only indicate that PKA-mediated <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 35 phosphorylation dissociates <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> from mitotic chromatin but also suggest that this phosphorylation is necessary for specific mitotic functions...|$|E
40|$|The linker histone H 1 {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in maintaining and establishing higher-order chromatin structure. As with core histones, histone H 1 is also extensively covalently modified. We showed previously that phosphorylation of S 27 in human histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> (<b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 27 -P), prevents binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) family members (officially known as chromobox protein homologs) to the neighboring dimethylated K 26. Here, we present the first functional characterization of <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 27 -P in vivo and in vitro. We show that <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 27 phosphorylation is cell-cycle-regulated and its levels peak on metaphase chromosomes. We identify further Aurora B as the kinase phosphorylating <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> S 27. We demonstrate that histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is the only somatic linker histone variant targeted by Aurora B and that Aurora B exclusively phosphorylates S 27. Adjacent K 26 dimethylation can regulate Aurora B activity towards S 27, uncovering a crosstalk between these modifications. Finally, our fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis on histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> mutants suggests a role of S 27 phosphorylation in the regulation of histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> mobility and chromatin binding in mitosis...|$|E

M 109. 061275 Histone H 1 phosphorylation {{is important for the}} regulation of high order chromosome organisation during mitosis. One of these phosphorylation sites in the linker histone subtype <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is shown here to be phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase, a master regulator of mitosis. Altered phosphorylation of <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> on this phosphorylation site at serine 27 illustrated the significance of the timing of this phosphorylation. When serine 27 of <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is mutated to prevent this phosphorylation chromosome congression to the equatorial plate during metaphase is hindered. In contrast, {{in the presence of the}} constitutive <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> serine 27 phosphorylation mimic, bridging and lagging chromosomes occurred, leading to a corresponding increase in the proportion of cells with a micronucleus. These phenotypes could be brought about through disruption of the Heterochromatin protein 1 family members bound to the adjacent methylated lysine. Such aberrations during mitosis can lead to genetic instability and ultimately aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer. With the frequently reported over-expression of Aurora B in cancer this shows another mechanism in which this kinase, via histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> phosphorylation, can push a cell toward malignancy. Another important mitotic kinase, Cyclin dependent kinase 1 together with cyclin B, is responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> during mitosis; which is required for condensing the cells genetic information into highly compact metaphase chromosomes. This vital mitotic event ensures the faithful transmission of the duplicated DNA into the dividing daughter cells. The mechanisms through which histone H 1 hyperphosphorylation contribute to chromosome condensation are poorly understood. One mechanism through which this may occur is via the recruitment of condensation factors such as the condensins or Topoisomerase II. Here the interaction between the Condensin I subunit, CAPD 2, and histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is explored. CAPD 2 interacts with the two most prominent linker histone subtypes, <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> and H 1. 2, through their C-terminal tails. <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> and CAPD 2 can interact in vitro whilst each is phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinase as they are during mitosis, in a manner dependent on RNA. Overall, these results indicate that histone <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is a vital component of higher order chromatin and its phosphorylation is essential for the normal progression through mitosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: The linker histone H 1 has a {{key role}} in {{establishing}} and maintaining higher order chromatin structure and in regulating gene expression. Mammals express up to 11 different H 1 variants, with H 1. 2 and <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> being the predominant ones in most somatic cells. Like core histones, H 1 has high levels of covalent modifications; however, the full set of modifications and their biological role are largely unknown. Results: In this study, we used a candidate screen to identify enzymes that methylate H 1 and to map their corresponding methylation sites. We found that the histone lysine methyltransferases G 9 a/KMT 1 C and Glp 1 /KMT 1 D methylate H 1. 2 in vitro and in vivo, and we mapped this novel site to lysine 187 (H 1. 2 K 187) in the C-terminus of H 1. This H 1. 2 K 187 methylation is variant-specific. The main target for methylation by G 9 a in H 1. 2, H 1. 3, H 1. 5 and H 1. 0 is in the C-terminus, whereas <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is preferentially methylated at K 26 (<b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> K 26 me) in the N-terminus.

40|$|Although ubiquitously {{present in}} chromatin, the {{function}} of the linker histone subtypes is partly unknown and contradictory studies on their properties have been published. To explore whether the various H 1 subtypes have a differential role in the organization and dynamics of chromatin we have incorporated all of the somatic human H 1 subtypes into minichromosomes and compared their influence on nucleosome spacing, chromatin compaction and ATP-dependent remodeling. H 1 subtypes exhibit different affinities for chromatin and different abilities to promote chromatin condensation, as studied with the Atomic Force Microscope. According to this criterion, H 1 subtypes can be classified as weak condensers (H 1. 1 and H 1. 2), intermediate condensers (H 1. 3) and strong condensers (H 1. 0, <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4,</b> H 1. 5 and H 1 x). The variable C-terminal domain is required for nucleosome spacing by <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> and is likely responsible for the chromatin condensation properties of the various subtypes, as shown using chimeras between <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> and H 1. 2. In contrast to previous reports with isolated nucleosomes or linear nucleosomal arrays, linker histones at a ratio of one per nucleosome do not preclude remodeling of minichromosomes by yeast SWI/SNF or Drosophila NURF.

Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of <b>h</b> HK- <b>1</b> (0. 3, 1, 3 and 6 nmol/mouse) produced a dose- and time-related antinociceptive effect. This effect was significantly antagonized by the NK 1 receptor antagonist SR 140333, but not by the NK 2 receptor antagonist SR 48968, indicating that the analgesic effect induced by i. c. v. <b>h</b> HK- <b>1</b> is mediated through the activation of NK 1 receptors. Interestingly, naloxone, β-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine, but not naltrindole and nor-binaltorphimine, could also block the analgesic effect markedly, suggesting that this effect is related to descending μ opioidergic neurons (primary μ 1 subtype). Human HK- <b>1</b> (<b>4</b> - 11) could also induce a dose- and time-dependent analgesic effect after i. c. v. administration, however, the potency of analgesia was less than <b>h</b> HK- <b>1.</b> Surprisingly, SR 140333 could not modify this analgesic effect, suggesting that this effect is not mediated through the NK <b>1</b> receptors like <b>h</b> HK- <b>1.</b> SR 48968 could modestly enhance the analgesic effect induced by <b>h</b> HK- <b>1</b> (<b>4</b> - 11), indicating that a small amount of <b>h</b> HK- <b>1</b> (<b>4</b> - 11) may bind to NK 2 receptors. Furthermore, none of the opioid receptor (OR) antagonists could markedly block the analgesia of <b>h</b> HK- <b>1</b> (<b>4</b> - 11), suggesting that the analgesic effect is not mediated through the descending opioidergic neurons. Blocking of δ ORs significantly enhanced the analgesia, indicating that δ OR is a negatively modulatory factor in the analgesic effect of <b>h</b> HK- <b>1</b> (<b>4</b> - 11).

We demonstrate that the Chromo domain of HP 1 is mediating this binding and that phosphorylation of Ser 27 on <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> (S 27 /H 1. 4) prevents HP 1 from binding. We suggest that methylation of K 26 /H 1. 4 could have a role in tethering HP 1 to chromatin and that this could also explain how HP 1 is targeted to those regions of chromatin where it does not colocalize with methylated K 9 /H 3. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for a "phospho switch" model in which neighboring phosphorylation reverts the effect of histone lysine methylation...|$|E

H 1 tails undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs) that can be detected by mass spectrometry. We developed antibodies to analyze several of these as yet unexplored PTMs including the combination of <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> K 26 acetylation or trimethylation and S 27 phosphorylation. H 1. 2 -T 165 phosphorylation was detected at S and G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle and was dispensable for chromatin binding and cell proliferation; while the <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> -K 26 residue was essential for proper cell cycle progression. We conclude that histone H 1 PTMs are dynamic over the cell cycle and that the recognition of modified lysines may be affected by phosphorylation of adjacent residues. © 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different histone post-translational {{modifications}} (PTMs) fine-tune {{and integrate}} different cellular signaling pathways at the chromatin level. ADP-ribose modification of histones by cellular ADP-ribosyltransferases such as ARTD 1 (PARP 1) {{is one of}} the many elements of the histone code. All 5 histone proteins were described to be ADP-ribosylated in vitro and in vivo. However, the crosstalk between ADP-ribosylation and other modifications is little understood. RESULTS: In experiments with isolated histones, it was found that ADP-ribosylation of H 3 by ARTD 1 prevents H 3 methylation by SET 7 / 9. However, poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation (PARylation) of histone H 3 surprisingly allowed subsequent methylation of H 1 by SET 7 / 9. Histone H 1 was thus identified as a new target for SET 7 / 9. The SET 7 / 9 methylation sites in <b>H</b> <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> were pinpointed to the last lysine residues of the six KAK motifs in the C-terminal domain (K 121, K 129, K 159, K 171, K 177 and K 192). Interestingly, H 1 and the known SET 7 / 9 target protein H 3 competed with each other for SET 7 / 9 -dependent methylation.

The result for KdV relies on a new method for constructing almost conserved quantities using multilinear harmonic analysis and the available local-in-time theory.

We use the Euler scheme approach of [4, 29]. When the domain is piecewise smooth and under a non-characteristic boundary condition, we show that the associated strong error is at most of order <b>h</b> <b>1</b> <b>4</b> −ε where h denotes the time step and ε is any positive parameter. This rate corresponds to the strong exit time approximation. It is improved to h 1 2 −ε when the exit time can be exactly simulated or for a weaker form of the approximation error.

Theoretical and experimental studies Of (3, 4) J(CH) couplings were carried out in 3 -endo- and 3 -exo-X- 2 -norbornanone derivatives (X = Cl, Br) and in exo- and endo- 2 -noborneol compounds. Hyperconjugative interactions were studied with the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. Hyperconjugative interactions involving the carbonyl pi*c(2) =o and sigma*c(2) =o antibonding orbitals produce a decrease of three-bond contribution to both (3, <b>4)</b> J(C <b>4</b> <b>H</b> <b>1)</b> and (3, <b>4)</b> J(C <b>1</b> <b>H</b> <b>4)</b> couplings. However, the latter antibonding orbital also undergoes a strong sigma c(3) -c(4) ->sigma*c(2) =o interaction, which defines an additional coupling pathway for (3, <b>4)</b> J(C <b>4</b> <b>H</b> <b>1)</b> but not for (3, <b>4)</b> J(C <b>1</b> <b>H</b> <b>4).</b> This pathway is similar to that known for homoallylic couplings, the only difference being the nature of the intermediate antibonding orbital; i. e. for (3, <b>4)</b> J(C <b>4</b> <b>H</b> <b>1)</b> it is of sigma*-type, while in homoallylic couplings it is of pi*-type.

Salar de Huasco is a high altitude (3800 m altitude) saline wetland located in the Chilean Altiplano. We analyzed samples from a tributary stream (H 0) and three shallow lagoons (<b>H</b> <b>1,</b> <b>H</b> <b>4,</b> H 6) that contrasted in their physicochemical conditions and associated biota. Seventy-eight phylotypes were identified in a total of 268 clonal sequences deriving from seven clone libraries of water and sediment samples.
