5|$|Geologically, Plymouth has {{a mixture}} of limestone, <b>Devonian</b> slate, granite and Middle <b>Devonian</b> limestone. Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because of its geology. The bulk {{of the city is}} built upon Upper <b>Devonian</b> slates and shales and the {{headlands}} at the entrance to Plymouth Sound are formed of Lower <b>Devonian</b> slates, which can withstand the power of the sea.|$|E
5|$|On the {{geological}} timescale, the Marcellus {{occurs in the}} Middle <b>Devonian</b> epoch, of the <b>Devonian</b> period, in the Paleozoic era, of the Phanerozoic eon. Radiometric dating of a Marcellus sample from Pennsylvania placed its age at 384 million years old, and a sample from the bentonite {{at the top of}} the Onondaga at 390 ± 0.5 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Devonian</b> {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} as the Late <b>Devonian</b> extinction; one at the end of the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the <b>Devonian</b> extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} is underlain by the St Maughan's Formation of the Lower <b>Devonian</b> age. Glacial till {{deposits of}} the <b>Devonian</b> age {{form part of}} the northern shore of the reservoir. The reservoir {{may be on the}} northern limb of the Cowbridge anticline.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock in the}} {{southern}} part of the watershed of West Creek is of the Trimmers Rock Formation. This consists of siltstone and shale and comes from the <b>Devonian</b> period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the Catskill Formation, which consists of sandstone and siltstone and also comes from the <b>Devonian.</b> The Huntley Mountain Formation can be found at the headwaters of the creek. This formation consists of sandstone and siltstone and comes from the Mississippian and <b>Devonian</b> periods.|$|E
5|$|A band of Middle <b>Devonian</b> {{limestone}} runs west to {{east from}} Cremyll to Plymstock including the Hoe. Local limestone {{may be seen in}} numerous buildings, walls and pavements throughout Plymouth. To the north and north east of the city is the granite mass of Dartmoor; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle <b>Devonian</b> limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the rock}} {{formations}} found in Juniata County come from def Ordovician Period, seven come from the Silurian Period, and seven come from the <b>Devonian</b> Period.|$|E
5|$|Further south {{there are}} newer Middle and Late <b>Devonian</b> rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{which have been}} quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, is the only limestone cave in the <b>Devonian</b> limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger New Red Sandstone rocks of the Triassic period. These rocks were laid down in a shallow sea and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was mined on the foreshore at Watchet.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is {{approximately}} 400 million years old and was laid down in the <b>Devonian</b> period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle <b>Devonian,</b> with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper <b>Devonian.</b> The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase. The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} applied to microfossils of <b>Devonian</b> age with fungal affinities, though these taxa have since been {{recognized}} as an early growth form of Tortotubus.|$|E
5|$|It was {{dispersed}} {{across the}} Appalachian, Michigan, and Illinois Basins {{by the southern}} trade winds, because this area was in the southern hemisphere during the <b>Devonian</b> period.|$|E
5|$|Rocks {{from the}} <b>Devonian</b> (419–359 million years ago) are found {{across much of}} Exmoor, the Quantocks (including Hangman Sandstone and Cockercombe tuff), and in the cores of the folded masses of the Mendip Hills.|$|E
5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the <b>Devonian</b> Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early <b>Devonian</b> rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late <b>Devonian</b> rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the <b>Devonian</b> limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} <b>Devonian</b> (400 million years ago) are all wingless, {{but by the}} Carboniferous (320 million years ago), more than 10 {{different}} genera of insects had fully functional wings. There is little preservation of transitional forms between the two periods. The earliest winged insects are from this time period (Pterygota), including the Blattoptera, Caloneurodea, primitive stem-group Ephemeropterans, Orthoptera and Palaeodictyopteroidea. Very early Blattopterans (during the Carboniferous) had a very large discoid pronotum and coriaceous forewings with a distinct CuP vein (an unbranched wing vein, lying near the claval fold and reaching the wing posterior margin). Even though the oldest definitive insect fossil is the <b>Devonian</b> Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at 396–407 million years old, it possessed dicondylic mandibles, a feature associated with winged insects.|$|E
5|$|In the {{far west}} of the county, running into Devon, is Exmoor, a high <b>Devonian</b> {{sandstone}} moor, which was designated as a national park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act.|$|E
5|$|Middle <b>Devonian</b> basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{landscape}} falls into types determined by the underlying geology. These landscapes are the limestone karst and lias of the north, the central clay vales and wetlands, the oolites of the east and south, and the <b>Devonian</b> sandstone of the west.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus shale is {{typically}} found deposited on the limestone of the Onondaga Formation(Don), which extends {{down to the}} end of the Early <b>Devonian</b> period. The contact between them may be sharp, gradational, or erosional. In southwestern Ontario, Canada, north of Lake Erie, the Marcellus overlies the Dundee Formation, a lateral equivalent of the Onondaga.|$|E
5|$|The Middle <b>Devonian</b> {{is divided}} into three main groups. The lower part of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} <b>Devonian</b> period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the <b>Devonian</b> swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} volcanic and sedimentary rock formations from the <b>Devonian</b> period. At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of ashes and lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} <b>Devonian</b> fish bed at Lamba Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation.|$|E
5|$|The main rock {{formations}} {{in the area}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. These formations are all primarily made of sandstone, but also contain conglomerate, shale, and siltstone. They were formed during the <b>Devonian,</b> Mississippian and <b>Devonian,</b> and the Mississippian, respectively. The Catskill Formation is mostly found in the lower and middle reaches of the watershed, along the creek and its tributaries. The Huntley Mountain Formation is found in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed and on some of the streams in that part of the watershed. The Burgoon Sandstone is found in the watershed, but not on many of its streams.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is in the}} West Branch Pine Creek {{drainage}} basin, {{where the}} underlying rocks are primarily conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. Two major rock formations are present in Cherry Springs State Park, both at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The lower formation is the late <b>Devonian</b> and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. Outside the park the creek has cut down into the <b>Devonian</b> Catskill Formation, a reddish sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The park's waterfalls expose two {{distinct}} rock formations from the <b>Devonian</b> and Carboniferous periods. The higher and more recent {{of these is}} the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late <b>Devonian</b> and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The lower and older layer is the Catskill Formation, which is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370million years old. The harder Huntley Mountain Formation caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation to the south. The portions of the Allegheny Front within the park are named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487.|$|E
5|$|The site {{consists}} of an old quarry of sandstone dated to the Famennian stage in the Late <b>Devonian</b> epoch. It was backfilled in the 1970s with marl. The new soil was re-colonized by pioneer species, which coexist alongside an established afforestation, forming a mosaic of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has <b>Devonian</b> slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the <b>Devonian</b> and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations {{are found in the}} valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of these is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late <b>Devonian</b> and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis is {{all that}} remains of a <b>Devonian</b> volcano that met a cataclysmic end in the Carboniferous period around 350 million years ago. Evidence near the summit shows light-coloured granite (which had cooled in {{subterranean}} chambers several kilometres beneath the surface) lies among dark basaltic lavas (that only form on the surface). The two lying side-by-side is evidence the huge volcano collapsed in on itself creating an explosion comparable to Thera (2nd millennium BC) or Krakatoa (1883).|$|E
5|$|Chitinozoa (singular: chitinozoan, plural: chitinozoans) are a taxon of flask-shaped, organic walled marine microfossils {{produced}} by an as yet unknown animal. Common from the Ordovician to <b>Devonian</b> periods (i.e. the mid-Paleozoic), the millimetre-scale organisms are abundant {{in almost all}} types of marine sediment across the globe. This wide distribution, and their rapid pace of evolution, makes them valuable biostratigraphic markers.|$|E
5|$|During the Cambrian period, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was {{partially}} in the Northern Hemisphere, and {{during this period}} large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. By {{the start of the}} <b>Devonian</b> period (416Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began {{at the end of the}} <b>Devonian</b> period (360Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion years ago. It is {{composed}} of a metamorphic and igneous platform which {{is the basis of}} the continental shield. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as sandstones, limestones and shales laid down during the <b>Devonian</b> and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} <b>Devonian</b> and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle <b>Devonian</b> sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate {{led to the creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late <b>Devonian</b> and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E
5|$|In current practice, the Marcellus Formation(abbr. Dm or Dms) is {{classified}} as the basal unit of the Hamilton Group(Dh), lying beneath the Mahantango Formation(Dmh) member of this group in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In New York, the Mahantango, also of Middle <b>Devonian</b> age, is further divided. There the Marcellus is separated from the overlying Skaneateles Formation, a more clastic and fossiliferous dark shale, by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed.|$|E
5|$|Most insects, except {{some species}} of cave crickets, {{are able to}} {{perceive}} light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the <b>Devonian</b> period between 416 and 359 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Mountains in Juniata County include Tuscarora Mountain and Shade Mountain. Agricultural {{land and}} forested land make {{up most of}} the county's area. Major rivers and creeks in the county include the Susquehanna River, the Juniata River, Tuscarora Creek, and West Branch Mahantango Creek. It borders seven other counties. The county lies over 16 {{different}} rock formations (which are from the Ordovician, Silurian, and <b>Devonian)</b> and 51 different soils.|$|E
