Some fans stay with their brand through thick and thin (even being relegated four divisions in the case of football club Glasgow Rangers), whilst others show only little brand loyalty. If it is a simple repeat purchase, fine – but if they have to make an effort such as travelling 35 miles for home games – that is a different matter.

The flow characteristics of both vane-axial and propeller fans were investigated and tested at four large-opening mines to assess the effects of fan location on recirculation and entrainment. Each fan type has its own airflow, entrainment and penetrating air-flow characteristics, and operating costs that are advantageous for specific applications.

40|$|Limited {{time frames}} caused by {{infection}} threat and weather demand for efficient pesticide application techniques in modern integrated and organic fruit farming. This demand is best complied by low volume spraying, since it minimizes traveling time {{and number of}} fillings per spray treatment, but also minimizes {{the probability of a}} contamination of the operator with concentrated pesticides. To obtain good spray deposition, low volume spray application demands small droplets which offer numerous benefits, but also carry a high drift potential. This feature threatened the technique, because no method for spray drift reduction has been available in order to make use of reduced buffer zones to water courses and non-target areas. A new method based on cross flow characteristics of the sprayer fan, canopy adapted forward speed and fan speed and a mixed set of hollow cone nozzles and air induction nozzles resulted in an approx. 85 % reduction of particle drift deposits, so that the method has been registered in the official German list of drift reducing devices in the 75 % drift reduction class. Besides drift reduction a canopy adapted fan speed also results in an enormous reduction of fuel consumption and noise emission as further environmental benefits of small droplets. An assessment of the influence of a canopy adapted forward speed and fan speed on spray deposit, relative spray coverage and droplet deposit density revealed a significant increase of the application efficiency, rising with decreasing canopy width and compensating a reduction of water volume and dose rate from canopy related dosing models. Testing a tower sprayer in orchards for use with reduced fan speed unexpectedly showed an unusable vertical air distribution. Alarmed by this finding, a subsequent testing of various <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> on a test bench disclosed a very unsatisfying vertical air distribution of many <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> and even within a production series the air distribution differed enormously. Especially an uneven horizontal reach of the air stream over working height is a major obstacle for a successful use of canopy adapted fan speed with all its benefits. Since a uniform vertical air distribution is the basic requirement for a highly efficient and environmentally safer spray application {{not only in terms of}} the potential to reduce pesticide consumption, but also for reducing fuel consumption and noise emissions, testing and adjusting fans of orchard sprayers on a test bench is urgently needed. Because of the importance of the topic, three fruit growers associations in Austria, Italy and Germany together initiated the development of a new test bench to measure vertical air distribution of orchard sprayers...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{test system}} for acoustical rating of air-movement devices was installed and evaluated at the Riverside Energy Efficiency Laboratory at Texas A&M University where measurements of sound pressure levels {{were carried out}} using an array of six microphones instead of the existing rotating boom- microphone setup. The new array setup did not generate any inherent transient noise peaks, which provided adequate signal-to-noise ratios suitable for low sone fan testing. The reverberation chamber was qualified for broad-band testing in the frequency range 50 Hz to 10 kHz. Important acoustical parameters, namely, reverberation time and natural modes of the chamber, were determined. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify potential background noise sources by computing the coherence functions between microphones placed outside the chamber and a microphone placed within the chamber. No strong coherence was observed, thus indicating adequate sound attenuation characteristics of the chamber walls. The effect of background noise levels on the loudness rating of fans was evaluated. A low sone fan and a louder fan (loudness greater than one sone) were tested during night time when the background noise is the least and during daytime and with the air conditioners running (high background noise level). While both <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> showed no significant change in loudness when tested during daytime and during the night, accurate ratings were not obtained with the air-conditioners running due to inconsistent spectrum. Finally, it was observed that with the six decibels separation requirement between the fan and background noise spectra for a low sone fan, at very low frequencies (below 63 Hz), despite inadequate fan- background separation, the loudness rating of the fan does not change as the minimum perceived loudness at these frequencies is very high. At very high frequencies (greater than 5 kHz), the fan does not generate any noise and hence the fan and the background noise sound pressure levels are very close to each other...|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} an {{abundance}} of research available on consumption behaviours and fan behaviours there is a limited amount specifically about rugby fans in New Zealand. This thesis aims to contribute a study on this topic, to add knowledge and insight on these types of sports fans. This study seeks to understand the prominent factors that influence consumption behaviours of rugby fans. Drawing on the research results {{the creation of a}} conceptual model is proposed for sports organisations to use in their relative areas of the industry. The research method used is qualitative within an interpretive paradigm and uses 22 one to one interviews for data – collection. To analyse the data a theoretical framework was applied and the decision to use this method was to accommodate the exploratory nature of the research question. Because consumption behaviours involve social behaviours {{there is a need to}} explore self-concept and self-identity in relation to group affiliation as a sports fan. The structure of this thesis has adopted the seminal work of Holt’s (1995) on consumer behaviours. The Holt (1995) work has four key components that transfer into the four major themes of this study these are; consuming as experience, consuming as integration, consuming as classification and consuming as play. This framework (Holt, 1995) has been used to provide a methodical structure through-out all the chapters of this work. The emerging sub-themes of this work are rugby consumption motives of family and group affiliation; Self-identity and self-concept that is created through family identity and the strong presence of rugby that shapes New Zealand cultural identity, three <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> are identified and their consumption behaviours explored, and finally the physical attributes of being a sports fan of affiliation, expressions and child’s play that connect fans and sports brands together. This work developed two conceptual models. The overarching model is called the Sport Circle Consumption Model, which incorporates the major themes and sub-themes from the research results. The second model is called the Inner Fan Model which focusses more specifically as the internal motives and influences towards being a sports fan. This study has been conducted to compile information and to share it with people and organisations in the sport and recreation industry. The aim is to create a conceptual model of some value to help industry organisations develop and grow, by creating more opportunities to connect with a variety of consumers...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the Finnish football fans and their motives to travel and follow sports. The reason for studying this area is to increase information and knowledge about the consumer behaviour of sport fans. Special {{attention is paid to}} the question of why fans behave the way they do. What factors affect fans’ decision making processes when they travel? Does sport have an influence on the travelling process? Are there any similarities between the reasons of travelling and attending sport events? In this study sport fans are divided into different <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> according to their motives to attend sport events as spectators and in different traveller typologies according their motives to travel abroad. The research was conducted as an online survey. The survey was posted to the active Finnish online football discussion forums, Futisforum and Futisforum 2 and e-mail posted to the ELK (Finnish association of English league supporters) and SMJK (Official supporters club of Finnish national football team). The results were analysed using the quantitative methods, such as factor analysis and cross tabulation. The results of the research show that football fans are rather active travellers. For many fans attending a sport event is a reason to travel abroad. In addition, merely the possibility to attend a sport event had a definite influence in planning a trip abroad. The results also reveal that for the most Finnish football fans attending a sport event is a social activity. In fact it seems that the whole idea of being a fan is heavily based on its social nature. For most fans travelling seemed to be a good way of spending time with the family and friends. The reasons for travelling and attending sport events were strikingly similar. Besides gaining social experiences the main reasons for participating in sport events were entertainment value and new experiences. Based on this study it can be concluded that sport has an influence on fans’ decision making process when the decisions of the travel destination are being made. The study also indicates that reasons to travel and reasons to attend sport events are very similar to the fans. However, Finnish football fans can not be seen as a homogeneous group as they have multiple traveller and fan identities. The clear majority of the fans is, however motivated about new experiences, socialising and entertainment when travelling or attending sport events as spectators...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Data center energy {{efficiency}} {{is becoming a}} huge topic of research as more IT infrastructure moves from local resources into the cloud. New data centers designed with {{energy efficiency}} in mind have achieved impressive results, but legacy datacenters (10 - 20 years old) make up {{a significant portion of}} the total data center space in the U. S. These sites can benefit the most from having an independent energy audit done with the focus on using new technologies to save substantial energy while maintaining reliability. One of these new technologies is wireless mesh sensor networks. Wireless mesh sensor networks allow large amounts of sensors to be deployed without running expensive power and communication cabling to the sensors. This technology allows a very granular view of the pressure and temperature conditions in real time on the data center floor. This large amount of real time data also provides a factor of safety when changes are made to the cooling system in the quest for energy savings. Because IT loads in data centers change frequently, it is difficult to match cooling capacity with the heat load in the room and as a result, there is usually too much or too little cooling in the data center. Estimating how much energy may be saved depends on determining the factors that affect the cooling efficiency of the data center. This study seeks to determine how physical variables such as floor depth, CRAH arrangement, <b>fan</b> <b>types,</b> fan speed, perforated tile placement and IT equipment layout impact sub-floor pressure distribution. If the subfloor pressure is evenly distributed the fan speeds can be run lower, resulting in increased data center cooling efficiency. In the study thousands of wireless sensors are installed throughout a data center as part of an environmental monitoring and control solution for a large telecommunications company. These wireless devices are capable of monitoring the sub-floor pressure, subfloor temperature, CRAH supply and return temperatures and server rack inlet temperatures at three different heights. When changes are made to the fan speed settings, or supply air temperature, the wireless sensors will capture the changes to the sub-floor pressure and server rack inlet temperatures. The data from the wireless sensors is time stamped and sent wirelessly every 5 minutes back to a central server. This server uses a MySQL database to organize and store all the sensor data. This data can then be accessed and exported for analysis. Once the impacts of these variables have been established, optimal energy savings improvements can be made and are provided in the study.

40|$|Ziel dieser Magisterarbeit war eine aktuelle Darstellung des Phänomens der internetbasierten medialen Fankultur, die ihr prominentestes Forum mittlerweile auf dem 2007 gegründeten Social-Blogging-Dienst www. tumblr. com gefunden hat. Diese durch eine besonders junge Nutzerbasis gekennzeichnete Plattform ist allmählich zum zentralen Treffpunkt einer praktisch unbegrenzten Menge von Fandoms geworden, in denen diverse Fernsehserien und Filme, Romane, Filmfiguren, aber auch Celebrities oder Musikbands gemeinsam verehrt werden. Wie verwenden Fans Tumblr zur Vernetzung und Kommunikation, welche Rolle spielen dabei die Beziehungen zwischen den Usern und welchen Nutzen hat die Zugehörigkeit zu einem Fandom für Fans und ihre persönliche Identität? Ausgehend von bisherigen Erkenntnissen der Fan Studies konkretisierte die vorliegende Studie diese breite Fragestellung in drei Forschungsfragen und beantwortete sie entlang der wichtigsten Einflussfaktoren Geschlecht, Alter und Nationalität der Fans sowie des Grades ihrer Partizipation auf der Plattform. In einer Abkehr vom charakteristisch engen und qualitativ orientierten Fokus früherer Fanforschung und mit dem Ziel, ein möglichst ganzheitliches Bild von der vielfältigen millionenstarken globalen Fancommunity zu geben, wurden mithilfe eines quantitativen Onlinefragebogens 4999 Tumblr-Fans befragt. Auf Basis der erhobenen Daten wurden schließlich nicht nur die sieben aufgestellten Hypothesen geprüft. In Bezug auf die primäre Nutzungsmotivation der User, ihr Erleben der Community und der eigenen Fanidentität sowie ihre Partizipation auf Tumblr konnten zudem auch fünf distinkte Fan-Typen identifiziert werden: die contentorientierten Individualisten, die communityorientierten Fans, die Fangirls, die Kreatoren und die Inspirationssuchenden. The {{aim of this}} master thesis was {{to provide}} a current {{portrayal}} of the phenomenon of Internet-based media fan culture, which has most recently found its largest hotspot on the social blogging portal www. tumblr. com. Characterized mainly by its very young user base, this platform has gradually become a central meeting place for a virtually unlimited amount of fandoms within which various TV-series and movies, novels, movie characters, as well as celebrities or bands are being adored in a collective manner. How do the fans use tumblr for networking and communication, which role do the relationships between the users play in this and what benefits are associated with the memebership in the fandoms for the fans and their personal identities? Based on previous findings in the field of Fan Studies, this paper specified these broadly aimed leading questions into three more focused research questions and provided answers {{in the context of the}} main influencing factors – gender, age and nationality of the fans, as well as their level of participation on the platform. In a methodological departure from the characteristically narrow and qualitatively-oriented focus of the previous research, together with the aim to provide as exhaustive view of the diverse, global fan community as possible, 4999 tumblr-fans were interviewed by means of a quantitative online questionnaire. Ultimately, based on the collected data, not only the seven posed hypotheses have been tested, but also five distinct <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> could have been identified concerning their primary motivation for use of tumblr, their experience of the community and their own fan identity, as well as their participation on the platform: the content-oriented individualists, the community-oriented fans, the fangirls, the creators and the inspiration seekers...|$|E
