40|$|Objective: To analyse the {{circumstances}} surrounding farm and tractor-related childhood fatalities in South Australia, to identify potentially dangerous situations and to delineate prevention strategies. Methods: A retrospective search of files was conducted at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital Department of Histopathology from 1981 to 1996, and the State Coroner’s Office from 1988 to 1996. Results: Fifteen fatalities were identified comprising 11 boys and four girls (age range, 2 years 11 months to 13 years; average, 6 years). Activities prior to death included riding on a tractor/trailer (n= 8); playing near a field <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> (n= 2); playing near machinery (n= 2); sleeping in a car near a burn off (n= 1); walking around a dam (n= 1) and riding as a passenger on a motorbike (n= 1). Causes of death included multiple skull fractures and cerebral damage (n= 11), asphyxia (n= 2), drowning (n= 1) and incineration (n= 1). Conclusions: The most dangerous activity involved children riding unrestrained on tractors; falls resulted in extensive injuries from tractor rear wheels or towed machinery. Allowing children on farms to ride on tractors or machinery only {{if there is a}} safe seat with a restraining harness would substantially reduce the number of fatal farm-related childhood injuries in South Australia.

A 6 meter long, 4 meter wide and 0. 3 meter thick solar thermal collector was constructed in which a V-corrugated steel sheet was used as absorber and a 6 mm thick glass used as glazing. The collector body was fabricated from plywood. The solar thermal collector is linked with a 4 meter high <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> <b>bin</b> having a diameter of 2 meter. Performance of this collector was evaluated from November 2011 to January 2012 at seven different convective flow rates of air (7. 5, 14. 16, 28. 30, 56. 6, 112. 2, 168. 5 and 224. 4 kg. h). The statistical analysis showed that increase in mass flow rate significantly 1 (P> 0. 003) increases {{the performance of the}} solar collector.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was {{to address the problem of}} engulfments in flowing grain that occur in on-farm metal <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> <b>bins.</b> This was accomplished by utilizing a systems approach to identify contributing factors to engulfment which were used to develop a 28 -question hazard assessment tool. A numerically weighted high- and low-risk response accompanied each question, the sum of which resulted in a potential-risk-of-engulfment score for on-farm <b>grain</b> handling and <b>storage</b> systems. ^ The assessment tool was pilot tested using nine farms where previous engulfment incidents had been reported and nine farms with no history of engulfment. A revised version was used to score an additional 26 farms with unknown histories of engulfment and by three individuals personally familiar with prior engulfment incidents. It was found that the difference between the mean of the assessment tool scores of farms with a history of engulfment and the mean of the scores of farms with no prior reported engulfment incident was significant (p = 0. 001). ^ It was found that the management of <b>grain</b> during <b>storage</b> and an individual 2 ̆ 7 s perception of risk and willingness to avoid flowing grain hazards had the most impact on reducing the potential for an engulfment. In contrast, a history of plugging problems resulting from out-of-condition grain was not found to make a considerable difference in scores between the two groups of farms. The presence of stirring devices in bins, accommodation for lockout devices on electrical controls, and utilizing <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> smaller than 20, 000 -bushel capacity also had little impact on the difference in scores. Based upon the level of significance of each of the 28 questions 2 ̆ 7 ability to predict an increased risk of engulfment, it was concluded that a valid response could be obtained with as few as seven questions. ^ Recommendations concerning continued study and application of the tool were formulated including the need for additional research to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool to change the behavior of farmers who own and operate <b>grain</b> handling and <b>storage</b> equipment.

While some pestassociated losses occur when the crops are standing in the farms or greenhouses, others are caused during <b>storage</b> in <b>grain</b> elevators, <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> and granaries. These plant secondary metabolites may serve as repellents, antifeedants, phagostimulants or toxins against the insect pests.

Studies of the use of secondary metabolites have been on the increase.

40|$|The {{most common}} on-the-farm <b>grain</b> <b>storage</b> <b>bins</b> are built of shallow {{cylindrical}} shells made of cold-formed sheet steel. They constitute a major {{section of the}} farm building industry. However, little reliable data is available regarding the resultant loads applied to the walls by the material stored. The present study is directed to develop additional information regarding the pressures and the pressure-inducing characteristics of the grain stored taking into consideration {{the interaction between the}} grain pressure and the deformation of the wall of the bin. The finite element method is applied considering a composite slice of the grain and the surrounding wall of the bin. It accounts for the flexibility of the wall, the non-linearity of the grain material, and for the variation of grain properties due to the confining pressure and strain level. A test was conducted on a model of a cylindrical bin filled with sand. The properties of the sand are obtained from a triaxial test. The experimentally measured pressures of the sand are found to be in close agreement with those obtained analytically. The understanding of interaction between the grain pressures and wall deformations lead to suggesting a new shape for the bin walls. Herein, the wall is curved in the vertical direction towards the grain in order to increase the strength of the wall through its interaction with the grain pressure.
