40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of ordinal patterns in time series {{has been found}} to reflect important qualitative features of the underlying system dynamics. Abrupt changes in the dynamics typically result in clearly visible differences between the distributions before and after the break. Recurring dynamical regimes can be discovered by classifying the distributions in <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> series. This paper discusses two algorithms which exploit the relation between ordinal pattern distributions and system dynamics for the segmentation and classification <b>of</b> <b>time</b> series. The first algorithm employs a kernel-based statistic, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy of ordinal pattern distributions, to detect and locate change points in the time series. The second algorithm uses clustering of the ordinal pattern distributions to classify time series segments with similar dynamics. The methodology is applied to various real-life time series from physiology and economics. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} of overall similarity sorting were investigated in 5 free classification experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that increasing time pressure {{can reduce the}} likelihood of overall similarity categorization. Experiment 3 showed that a concurrent load also reduced overall similarity sorting. These findings suggest that overall similarity sorting can be a time-consuming analytic process. Such results appear contrary to the idea that overall similarity is a nonanalytic process (e. g., T. B. Ward, 1983) but are in line with F. N. Milton and A. J. Wills’s (2004) dimensional summation hypothesis and with the stochastic sampling assumptions of the extended generalized context model (K. Lamberts, 2000).

Then, the bispectrum will have the same magnitude (assuming that the magnitude of the frequency components is the same) but the phase will be randomly oriented. Adding together all of the bispectra will result in cancellation, because of the random phase orientation, and so the sum of the bispectra will have a small magnitude. Detecting phase coupling requires summation over a number of independent samples- this is the first motivation for defining the bicoherence. Secondly, the bispectrum is not normalized, because it still depends on the magnitudes of each of the frequency components. The bicoherence includes a normalization factor that removes the magnitude dependence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spreading on {{networks}} {{is influenced}} by a number <b>of</b> factors including <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the inter-event <b>time</b> distribution (IETD), the topology of the network and non-stationarity. In {{order to understand the}} role of these factors we study the SI model on temporal networks with different aggregated topologies and different IETD-s. Based on analytic calculations and numerical simulations, we show that if the stationary bursty process is governed by power-law IETD, the spreading can be slowed down or accelerated as compared to a Poisson process; the speed is determined by the short time behaviour, which in our model is controlled by the exponent. We demonstrate that finite, so called "locally tree-like" networks, like the Barabási-Albert networks behave very differently from real tree graphs if the IETD is strongly fat-tailed, as the lack or presence of rare alternative paths modifies the spreading. A further important result is that the non-stationarity of the dynamics has a significant effect on the spreading speed for strongly fat-tailed power-law IETD-s, thus bursty processes characterized by small power-law exponents can cause slow spreading in the stationary state but also very rapid spreading heavily depending on the age of the processes. 1...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{dynamics}} by NMR {{has been}} reviewed extensively in recent years. These surveys show decisively that information on structure should be complemented by information on motion both to properly characterize the protein, {{and to understand}} its function. The time scale accessible by NMR extends from picoseconds to days, with different methods accessing <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> this <b>time</b> axis. Here we focus on heteronuclear NMR spin relaxation used to study ps to ns protein dynamics. The slow limit <b>of</b> this <b>time</b> regime {{is determined by the}} global tumbling of the protein, with the rates for internal motion of the probe being typically faster. Based on experience gained over nearly a decade we {{came to the conclusion that}} the traditional method of NMR spin relaxation analysis in proteins and nucleic acids, called “model-free” (MF), does not extract adequately and fully the information inherent in the experimental data largely because it is oversimplified. We have developed an approach that overcomes many of the MF deficiencies. This method, called the slowly relaxing local structure (SRLS) may be regarded as a generalization of MF. SRLS predates the MF approach, and even provided derivations of the exact equivalents of the MF equations. The issues brought up above will be addressed in detail in this review. It will be shown that analogous, but physically distinct, SRLS and MF analyses often yield substantially different results, indicating that the oversimplifications inherent in MF have unfavorable practical implications. Within a broader perspective, we illustrate the disadvantages of applying parameterization instead of setting forth models, using mathematical instead of physical parameter definitions, and not abiding by the assumptions underlying the various equations used. We offer the concepts that underlie SRLS as an alternative to the model-free point-of-view, and we describe and illustrate how SRLS can be implemented in a practical fashion. We also indicate how improvements to the current SRLS approach can be introduced...|$|R

Tectonic overlays summarize Caledonian and Variscan tectonic units, Permo-Carboniferous fault systems and magmatic provinces, Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift-wrench systems, areas of intraplate compression, the outlines of Alpine orogens {{and the distribution of}} oceanic crust. Based on a comparison of these overlays with the Moho depth map we assess processes that controlled the evolution of the crust in the <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Europe through <b>time.</b> The present-day crustal configuration of Western and Central Europe results from polyphase Late Palaeozoic to recent lithospheric deformation that overprinted the margin of the Proterozoic East-European Craton and particularly the Caledonian and Variscan crustal domains. Following consolidation of the Caledonides, their crustal roots were destroyed in conjunction with Devonian wrench tectonics and back-arc rifting. During the Permo-Carboniferous tectono-magmatic cycle, wrench faulting disrupted the crust of the Variscan Orogen and its foreland and their lithosphere was thermally destabilized. Late Permian and Mesozoic re-equilibration of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system was interrupted by the development of the Arctic-North Atlantic, Tethyan and associated rift systems. During the Alpine orogenic cycle, intraplate compressional stresses controlled basin inversion-related crustal thickening and lithospheric folding, as well as the evolution of the Rhine-Rhône rift system. Variably deep crustal roots characterize the Alpine orogenic chains. Neogene back-arc extension disrupted the eastern Pyrenees, Betic-Balearic, Apennine and Dinarides orogens. Submitted t...|$|R

The dataconsists of the scheduled timetable, data about the design of the infrastructureand operational data such as recorded delays, train weights and train lengths. To perform the calculations, the railway network has been divided into 123 sections. The division has been made according to traffic patterns and type ofinfrastructure (single-track, double-track).

A topology-independent algorithm is presented which is complementary to that of Lehoucq et al. 1996 and which searches for evidence of multi-connectedness using catalogues of astrophysically observed objects. The basis of this algorithm is simply {{to search for a}} quintuplet of quasars (over a region of a few hundred comoving Mpc) which can be seen in two <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> our past <b>time</b> cone, allowing for a translation, an arbitrary rotation and possibly a reflection. This algorithm is demonstrated by application to the distribution of quasars between redshifts of z= 1 and z≈ 4, i. e., at a comoving distance from the observer 1700 h^- 1 Mpc d 3300 h^- 1 Mpc. Two pairs of isometric quintuplets separated by more than 300 are found. This is consistent with the number expected from Monte Carlo simulations in a simply connected Universe if the detailed anisotropy of sky coverage by the individual quasar surveys is taken into account. The linear transformation in (flat) comoving space from one quintuplet to another requires translations of 353 and 4922 respectively, plus a reflection in the former case, and plus both a rotation and a reflection in the latter. Since reflections are required, if these two matches were due to multi-connectedness, then the Universe would be non-orientable.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question as}} to why employees participate (or not) in their company's Sharesave scheme. A model of the factors which influence participation is developed based on the financial participation literature and pilot study interviews with a selection of company Sharesave scheme managers. Using a case study approach with three companies in the retail sector, quantitative and qualitative methods are applied to determine which aspects of the model influence participation by employees. Particular importance in the methodology is placed on understanding the employee's perspective in relation to Sharesave schemes by interviewing both participants and non-participants. The thesis argues that employees participate (or not) in the Sharesave scheme on what they see as their best interests. The findings suggest that participation in Sharesave schemes do not generate either a greater commitment to the company or come from a desire for ownership. However, the thesis did find that the changing nature of employment (in particular the growth <b>of</b> <b>part</b> <b>time</b> work and <b>different</b> types <b>of</b> <b>part</b> <b>time</b> workers) was an important factor influencing participation rates. Finally, this research concludes that financial participation schemes could not be properly evaluated without talking to employees. It is only by understanding the meaning that such schemes have for the individual in terms of the actions that the employee takes and why, that one can truly understand the impact of financial participation schemes.

40|$|During {{the last}} 20 to 30 years, the {{development}} and application of time-resolved experimental techniques with a femtosecond temporal resolution have brought to us much knowledge about the fundamental processes in physics, chemistry and biology. Nevertheless, standard spectroscopic methods have their limitation in {{the determination of the}} transient structures during ultrafast dynamics at the atomic level, because the spatial resolution is restricted by the wavelength of the probe pulse used. In contract, with the scheme of femtosecond optical initiation and electron probing and through the diffraction phenomenon, ultrafast electron crystallography (UEC) was recently developed as a time-resolved structure-probing technique for condensed-matter studies. The short wavelength and small pulse duration of the highly accelerated electrons used provide the atomic-scale spatiotemporal resolution. In addition, the large electron–matter interaction enables the detection of small transient changes as well as the investigation of surface and interfacial phenomena. This thesis describes the principles of UEC and its applications to a variety of systems, ranging from nanometer-scale structures to highly correlated materials and to interfacial assemblies. By using a prototype semiconducting material, we elucidated the fundamental processes at work in <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the femtosecond-to-nanosecond <b>time</b> range; this investigation led to a conceptual change from the consideration of laser-induced heating to the examination of nonequilibrium structural modifications {{as a result of the}} transient dynamical changes in, e. g., carriers, the crystal potential, and phonons. On the basis of such an understanding, we observed and understood the colossal unidirectional expansion induced by the photoexcitation of nanostructures to be a potential-driven result rather than a thermal one. For highly correlated materials, we showed the effectiveness of UEC in resolving the transient intermediate structures during phase transformations as well as identifying new phases in the nonequilibrium state. An important breakthrough made by UEC was the confirmation of the anisotropic involvement of lattice in the electron pairing mechanism for high-temperature superconductors. In interfacial assemblies, we also found a nonequilibrium phase transformation in water and the phenomenon of ultrafast annealing for a better order in a self-assembled monolayer. With these successful experiences, we expect more condensed-matter studies by UEC to come. ...|$|R
40|$|Magma {{transport}} {{through the}} Earth’s crust often ends in sedimentary basins. While it erupts at the surface, a significant <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the magma emplaces in depth {{in the basin}} forming sheet complexes dominated by horizontal sills associated with vertical dykes. Their fundamental units are saucer-shaped sills. They are typically ~ 20 - 200 m thick with a radius varying ~ 10 - 20 km. When a large igneous event occurs, the emplacement of sill complexes possibly affects the whole sedimentary basin. This can have important implications for: (i) global climate change due to large volumes of greenhouse gases released from metamorphic aureole around the sills; (ii) organic matter maturation and fluid migration, and ground-water aquifers. The main objective of my thesis consisted to characterize the geochemical architecture of a representative sill complex {{in order to give}} information about the emplacement mechanism and the magmatic differentiation associated processes. My thesis presents a detailed geochemical study of the Golden Valley Sill Complex (GVSC) {{that is one of the}} best exposures of sheet complexes exhumed by erosion in the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Eight distinct geographical intrusive-units involving saucer-shaped sills and dykes were identified. The large and dense sampling coverage allowed a statistical analysis among more than 300 whole-rock analyses to distinguish the various geochemical signatures. Analogue experiments reproducing saucer-shaped sills were conducted in order to integrate the results of the produced geochemical architecture for the GVSC. Finally, magmatic differentiation associated processes were studied from the best exposed saucer and through detailed examination of variations along 18 vertical profiles. My results show that (1) the GVSC formed itself via a mixture of two-end member hypotheses. Among the distinct geographical units, some have identical and some have distinct geochemical signatures suggesting that GVSC is intermediate between single and multi-batch emplacement model. (2) Integrated study with analogue experiments suggests that major saucer-shaped sills are centrally fed. Moreover, we conclude that the common elliptic shape of saucers is controlled by the size and orientation of vertical linear individual feeders. Finally, (3) chemical changes taking place in a saucer-shaped sill result from different fractionations processes taking place at <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> and <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the cooling history...|$|R
40|$|Lime {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{building}} materials: has been used as binder in mortars and plasters since 6 th century BC but between 1850 and 1950 lime production was heavily reduced because the development of a new, apparently better material: cement. Sites where lime had been produced for centuries were converted to the production of the new binder or completely abandoned. Consequently, in about one century, lime became a not well known, “old” material ties to the old generations: the only one who knew the “secrets of art” of making a good lime. As the last masters worked until about 1950 in few decades the knowledge of this generation is going to disappear. But this disappearance is also due the transformations in the methods of knowledge transmission. In fact, when the oral, visual and manual transmission of knowledge, used for many generations, was stopped because the diffusion of compulsory education, it was lost also the “material culture” of many materials (lime, but also wood, stones, etc.). Nowadays, without the help of those old masters it is almost impossible to reconstruct that knowledge and, consequently, it is impossible to reproduce those materials (sometimes better then the new ones) even if the most modern analytical techniques are applied. In fact, as the time goes on, lime attracts more and more interests: restorer, architects and producers mainly attracted by its compatibility with old constructions and environmental friendliness. Consequently, the interest that at the begin of last century, was only of few historians, became a common interest during the time so that currently involve discipline like archaeology, geology, restoration and materials engineering, interested in the recovery of old “secrets of arts”. Today, reconstruct the old productive technology means to use all sources of information currently available and to	 try to take out the highest number of useful information for crossings, compare and, in a second time, verify the results of researches with production tests. An example of this complex type of research has been carried out on the traditional production of lime near the city of Genoa (Italy), where both, tangible and intangible sources has been used for the redefinition of one of the most simple productive technology used in the past centuries. In this long way of research the unwritten (oral) sources have been fundamental, above all on the comprehension of some information such as the role <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> kiln, the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> different phases of production (cooking, cooling, etc.), the number of people involved in the entire cycle, the dimension of the stones placed inside the kiln, and many other aspects that were very difficult to found with other ways...|$|R
