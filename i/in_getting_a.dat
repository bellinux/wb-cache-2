5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a boycott of the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement. He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The first Royal National Lifeboat {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. The {{lifeboat}} was removed in 1930 because of the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> full crew, and because the launching arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.|$|E
5|$|Northup begins {{working on}} the {{construction}} of a gazebo with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt). Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Solomon overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving. Solomon gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom. Patsey faints as Solomon leaves.|$|E

5|$|This {{prompted}} Planché {{to begin}} campaigning for copyright {{to be extended}} to dramatic works. He gathered a group of dramatists (including John Poole, James Kenney, Joseph Lunn and Richard Brinsley Peak) who prevailed upon writer and MP George Lamb to introduce a bill in Parliament; but the bill did not pass its third reading. In 1832 Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a novelist and MP, was successful <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> select committee set up to consider dramatic copyright, as well as theatrical censorship and the monopoly of the patent theatres on drama. Planché gave evidence before the select committee; the following year the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833 (3 Will IV c. 15) was passed.|$|E
5|$|The second boom in Death Valley was tourism, {{started in}} the 1920s by Herman Eichbaum. After several {{failures}} <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> toll road approved from Lida, Nevada or over Towne Pass, he scaled back plans to include only {{the part of the}} latter route between southeast of Darwin and his resort at Stovepipe Wells. The new Eichbaum Toll Road was certified complete on May 4, 1926, and toll rates were set: $2 per motor vehicle and 50¢ per person. In 1933, the state legislature added many roads to the state highway system, including a new (unsigned) Route 127, connecting Tipton with Baker via Lone Pine and Death Valley Junction. The Death Valley National Monument was created on February 11, 1933, and in December 1934 the Division of Highways paid $25,000 for the 30.35-mile (48.84km) road, giving the 17 miles (27km) east of the park boundary at the pass to the National Park Service. The state Division of Highways and National Park Service soon paved the route from Lone Pine (on US 395) through Towne Pass and Death Valley to Baker (on US 91). The work was completed in October 1937, including the 17.5-mile (18km) Darwin cutoff that bypassed Darwin and the old toll road west of Panamint Springs. The National Park Service, using Civilian Conservation Corps labor, maintained the road through the park until August 1942, when an 11-mile (18km) stretch east of the valley was washed out by a storm. At that time, maintenance was given back to the state, which rebuilt the destroyed segment.|$|E
