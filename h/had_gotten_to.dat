5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E

He {{was in the}} company of the new Viceroy of New Spain, Diego López Pacheco, 7th Duke of Escalona, whom he <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> know during the voyage. That same ship brought an Irishman, William Lamport, known in New Spain as Don Guillén de Lombardo y Guzmán, who played a role in {{political}} turmoil during the 1640s. Palafox was also named Visitador (royal inspector, representative of the king), to investigate the two previous viceroys. He served as Bishop of Puebla from 1640 to 1655, and as interim archbishop of Mexico from 1642 to 1643.|$|E

25|$|This World Series win had {{significance}} for McCarver and Harry Kalas. Both had been Phillies broadcasters in , but neither <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> call that year's World Series. McCarver was a backup commentator for Game of the Week on NBC, {{but he was}} not part of the network's Series announcing team. For Kalas, MLB radio-broadcasting regulations forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national CBS Radio feed of the games. Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the Commissioner's Office, demanding a change to the rule. The following year, MLB amended its broadcasting contracts to allow World Series teams' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers, due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans. In 2008, both called the Phillies' World Series win.|$|E

Paley stayed for [...] "about a week" [...] in Macon with the band, partying with the group. They approached any areas about the town that appeared photogenic, such as [...] "fields, old houses, railroad tracks, [...] the cemetery." [...] The front album cover photo was taken {{at the entrance of}} the College House (now owned by Mercer University) next door at 315 College Street. The back cover photo of the album was taken at the Bond Tomb at Rose Hill Cemetery, located at 1091 Riverside Drive in Macon.|$|E
500|$|While Augusta National Golf Club has {{consistently}} chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, {{it has done}} so in successive one-year contracts. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> {{the point where they}} [...] "could do our deal in hours". Due to the lack of long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least performs some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast. Despite this, announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord, and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests.|$|E

500|$|Salon.com writer Jonah Weiner said of {{the first}} season, [...] "Each episode wound up {{more or less the}} same way, with the humiliation of Poehler's quixotic, adorably doofy bureaucrat". Some critics said the show's {{characters}} and overall tone were too mean-spirited in the early episodes. While reviewers praised various cast members in individual episodes, some said the supporting characters in general needed to be more fully developed and provided with better material. Several wrote that some of the subplots were too predictable and risked becoming stale, such as Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark and the question of whether Andy and Ann would keep dating. Others said Leslie was too unintelligent and ditzy. Schur said that was not the intention of the writers, and the feedback prompted changes to the character in the second season. Years after the first season ended, Schur said he believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers who revisited the episodes enjoyed them more because they <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> know the characters better as the series progressed.|$|E
500|$|Amy Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office. Parks and Recreation staff also felt {{part of the reason for}} the improvement was that the characters have become better developed, and viewers have come to like and care more about them. Likewise, Michael Schur believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers liked the second season better because they <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> know the characters better as the series progressed. Commentators said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season, and more distinct from Michael Scott. Several reviewers praised the decision to drop season one subplots that risked becoming stale, like whether Andy and Ann would keep dating, and Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark. Others complimented the decision to fill in the pit during the second season, which they said freed the show up for more stories and better scripts. Despite the vast change in critical reception, Parks and Recreation staff said they felt only a few minor changes were made to the show itself. Michael Schur said, [...] "I don't think magical fairy dust was sprinkled over the show. I just think we're getting better at it." [...] NBC officials compared the late rush of critical acclaim for Parks and Recreation to that of The Office, which received mixed reviews during its first season before most critics agreed it found its rhythm in the second season.|$|E

2500|$|Panizza's first {{collection}} of fiction, Dämmrungsstücke, appeared in 1890, received a modest amount of critical acclaim {{in the press}} and brought him to the attention of Germany's leading literary figures. By the end of 1890, the obscure psychiatrist <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> know most of the Munich [...] "Moderns," [...] as the young naturalists called themselves, including Frank Wedekind, Otto Julius Bierbaum and Max Halbe. The most significant of these was Michael Georg Conrad, editor of the influential journal Die Gesellschaft since 1885. The two Franconians became close friends, and from 1890 to 1896 Panizza published over forty articles in Die Gesellschaft on widely varied topics, ranging from theater reviews to theoretical considerations of prostitution.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{interviewees}} also expressed {{a level of}} disillusionment with Japanese society and its emphasis on the material, often {{at the expense of}} the spiritual or moral side of the society. One interviewee assessed the situation, saying, [...] "we've lost any sense of crisis and material things are all that matters. The idea that it's wrong to harm other has gradually disappeared." [...] Another interviewee, a subway worker, said, [...] "I already knew society <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> the point where something like Aum had to happen... It's a question of morals." [...] Several interviewees also voiced criticism of the media, namely due to the way it misrepresented and sensationalized the sarin attacks. Murakami himself expressed similar sentiments in the book's preface.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Abbott brothers, {{frontman}} Phil Anselmo began behaving strangely and distanced {{himself from}} the band {{when they returned to}} the road in 1995. The rest of the band members first thought that Pantera's perception of his fame <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> Anselmo, but Anselmo cited back pain from years of intense performances as the reason for his erratic behavior. Anselmo attempted to subdue his pain through alcohol, but this, as he admits, was affecting his performances and [...] "putting some worry into the band." [...] Doctors predicted that with surgery, Anselmo's back problem could be corrected, but that the recovery time could be a year or more. Not wanting to spend that much time away from the band, Anselmo refused, and began using heroin as a painkiller.|$|E

2500|$|However, Williams’ {{films have}} also {{been the subject of}} criticism. Richard Corliss, writing in Time magazine, stated: [...] "Aesthetically, much of Williams' work vacillates between inert and abysmal. The rural comedy of Juke Joint is logy, as if the heat <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> the movie; even the musical scenes, {{featuring}} North Texas jazzman Red Calhoun, move at the turtle tempo of Hollywood's favorite black of the period, Stepin Fetchit. And there were technical gaffes galore: in a late-night scene in Dirty Gertie, actress Francine Everett clicks on a bedside lamp and the screen actually darkens for a moment before full lights finally come up. Yet at least one Williams film, his debut Blood of Jesus (1941), has a naive grandeur to match its subject." [...] It should also be realized that Williams often worked on a very meager budget. [...] The Blood of Jesus was filmed for a cost of $5,000; most black films of that era had budgets of double and triple that amount.|$|E
2500|$|On November 3, Mike Garafolo {{reported}} on Fox Sports 1 that Incognito {{is alleged to}} have sent Martin threatening and racially charged messages.

La Canfora and Schefter subsequently reported statements from an unnamed source that the team and the league are now in possession of highly disturbing texts and voicemails in which Incognito used a racial slur against Martin, and disturbing text and voice exchanges including [...] "a reference to tracking down members of Martin's family and harming them" [...] and even threatening to kill Martin. According to La Canfora, Incognito's alleged harassment of Martin <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> the point that Martin actually feared for his safety, and felt that leaving the team was his only option.|$|E

On skis and shoeshoes, pulling sleds laden with gear Schwatka, Haynes and eleven other guides made their way from Mammoth to Norris in two days.

They almost perished. Once the weather cleared they made their way to Yancey's to recuperate before returning to Mammoth.
