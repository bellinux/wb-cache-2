5|$|Hunter Gordon Walker (Brown), who {{believes}} that Sam Winchester (Padalecki) will one day turn evil and become involved in a demonic war against humanity, escapes from prison. He tracks down Bela Talbot (Cohan)—a thief and frequent thorn in the Winchesters' sides—and threatens to kill her unless she reveals {{the location of the}} brothers. She refuses at first, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean (Ackles) capture the vampire Lucy (McNab), who has previously taken two victims. They interrogate her, and discover that another vampire named Dixon spiked her drink with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> at a club, transforming her. Dixon had taken her back to his home, but she escaped to feed. Lucy, still believing that she has only been drugged, is then killed by Dean, as there is no known cure for vampirism.|$|E
5|$|The Kurma Purana goes on {{to state}} that after the {{encounter}} with the sages of the Deodar Forest, Bhikshatana continued to wander, visiting various countries of gods and demons before he finally reached the abode of the god Vishnu. Vishnu's gatekeeper Vishvaksena did not allow him to enter. Angered, Bhikshatana slew Vishvaksena and impaled the corpse on his trident, which added to his sin. This form of Shiva with a corpse on his trident is called Kankala-murti ("One with the skeleton"). Bhikshatana, now as Kankala-murti, entered Vishnu's abode and begged for food. Vishnu offered <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> as food in one version. In another version, Vishnu cut an artery on Bhikshatana's forehead; a stream of blood spurts into his begging bowl as his food. Vishnu then directed Bhikshatana to visit the sacred city of Varanasi, where his sin would be expiated. The encounter with Vishnu's gatekeeper is also retold with some variation in the Vamana Purana and the Matsya Purana.|$|E
5|$|To further {{interest}} the case, House manipulates the team, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Chase (Jesse Spencer), by swapping <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> sample, {{leading them to}} believe he too has syphilis, perhaps the cause for his misanthropic personality and unfriendliness. He then pretends to get a nicer personality, but gets less able as a doctor as he pretends to take the penicillin they prescribe him, and everyone falls for House's trick (which he has confided to Wilson). Meanwhile, Foreman believes he isn't getting the respect he deserves from Kutner, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde), {{when he tries to}} do their performance reviews, which he believes is due to House frequently humiliating him. House replies that if he did not humiliate and taunt Foreman, he would not be strong and able enough to handle the rest of the team.|$|E

60|$|I {{noticed that}} from this moment Martin {{displayed}} a swiftly increasing interest in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> yaws.

Charmian and I thought that California {{was a little bit}} of all right. Henry swore by Rapa, and Tehei staked all on Bora Bora for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood's</b> sake; while Wada and Nakata sang the sanitary paean of Japan.|$|R

5|$|Subspecies (1991) follows three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian, as {{they begin}} a study on Romanian culture and superstition {{in the small town}} Prejmer. They are befriended by Stefan, a student {{studying}} nocturnal animals. It is revealed that the nearby Castle Vladislas has been caught in a power struggle between vampire brothers Stefan and Radu. Centuries prior, King Vladislas was seduced and cursed by a sorceress who eventually gave birth to Radu. After banishing Radu's mother, the king met a mortal woman. She gave birth to Stefan, who prefers to live in the open, and loathes his vampire heritage. To gain control over the Bloodstone, a relic that is said to drip the blood of the saints, Radu kills his father. In an effort to hurt his brother, Radu turns Mara and Lillian into vampires. Stefan, having fallen in love with Michelle, helps her try and free Mara and Lillian from Radu's control. Stefan drives a stake through Radu's heart and severs his head with a sword, killing Radu. Unfortunately for Stefan, Radu bites Michelle before his brother can kill him and mingled his blood with hers, which forces Stefan to turn Michelle with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> in order to keep her from becoming like Radu. As Stefan and Michelle sleep, Radu's minions set about resurrecting their master.|$|E
25|$|Most Mesoamerican beliefs {{included}} {{cycles of}} suns. Often our current time {{was considered the}} fifth sun, the previous four having been destroyed by flood, fire and the like. Quetzalcoatl went to Mictlan, the underworld, and created fifth-world mankind from {{the bones of the}} previous races (with the help of Cihuacoatl), using <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood,</b> from a wound he inflicted on his earlobes, calves, tongue, and penis, to imbue the bones with new life.|$|E
25|$|There {{simply is}} no such thing among us as a {{doctrine}} of blood atonement that grants a remission of sins or confers any other benefit upon a person because <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> is shed for sins. Let me say categorically and unequivocally that this doctrine can only operate in a day when there is no separation of Church and State and when the power to take life is vested in the ruling theocracy {{as was the case in}} the day of Moses.|$|E

Harpagus, reluctant to spill <b>his</b> <b>own</b> royal <b>blood,</b> gave the child (Cyrus) to a shepherd named Mitradates, who raised him as <b>his</b> <b>own</b> son.|$|R
25|$|Ince won his 30th England cap in May 1997 as England beat Poland 2–0 in Chorzow {{to leave}} them with an {{opportunity}} to get through to the World Cup provided they could beat Moldova at Wembley and then not lose to Italy in Rome. Moldova were duly dispatched 4–0 and Ince, in an incident reminiscent of Terry Butcher against Sweden seven years earlier, started the Italy match with a white England shirt and ended it with a red one after <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> soaked the shirt following a deep cut to his head. The game ended goalless and England had qualified.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} rituals {{engaged in}} by the king are only rudimentarily known. The Post-Classic Kʻicheʻ king together with his dignitaries regularly visited the temples to burn offerings and pray for the prosperity of his people, while fasting and guarding sexual abstinence. As to the Classic Period king, he appears at times (often period-ending dates) to be scattering blood, incense or, perhaps, maize. At other times, the king, represented by the hero Hunahpu, is sacrificing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> in front of directional trees (murals of San Bartolo), or he is officiating in front of such a tree (temple sanctuaries of Palenque).|$|E
25|$|Bryant moved {{just a few}} metres {{and began}} {{shooting}} at the table where Graham Colyer, Carolyn Loughton and her daughter Sarah were seated. Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood.</b> Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton threw herself {{on top of her}} daughter. Bryant shot Carolyn Loughton in the back; her eardrum was ruptured by the muzzle blast from the gun going off beside her ear. She survived her injuries, but learned after she came out of surgery that, despite her efforts, Sarah had been fatally shot in the head.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} Hellraiser (1987), Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) escapes from the Cenobites when his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) spills <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> {{on the spot}} where Frank died opening a puzzle box that opened a gateway to the Cenobites. With the help of Larry's wife Julia (Clare Higgins), Frank begins regenerating his body {{with the blood of}} victims that Julia supplies him. Larry's daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), accidentally unleashes the Cenobites, but makes a deal to deliver Frank to them in exchange for her own life. After taking Frank, the Cenobites go back on their deal and try and take Kirsty as well. Solving the puzzle box, Kirsty sends the Cenobites back to Hell.|$|E
25|$|Mills remarked after Deshler's death:I may pause {{here and}} pay a passing tribute {{to the memory of}} our fallen chief. He was brave, generous and kind, even to a fault.

25|$|The {{most common}} paints were red ochre, red lead, soot, calcium carbonate, and other earth colours, which were bound with fat and water. It also {{appears that the}} Vikings {{imported}} white lead, green malachite and blue azurite from Continental Europe. By using an electron microscope, chemists {{have been able to}} analyse traces of colours on runestones, and in one case, they discovered bright red vermilion, which was an imported luxury colour. However, the dominating colours were white and red lead. There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in Grettis saga, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a tree root and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in Egils saga where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> to see if the drink was poisoned.|$|E

25|$|Apocalypse {{finds himself}} on a planet with its mutant {{population}} reduced to {{a fraction of what}} it had been, only a few hundred remaining out of the millions who populated earth prior to his demise at Cable's hands. Reappearing inside a Sphinx-shaped ship, Apocalypse confronts the X-Men with his newly assembled cadre of Horsemen on the front lawn of the X-Mansion. The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood,</b> provided they join his side. Bent on becoming the new messiah for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the United Nations in New York and issues an ultimatum: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive - or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.|$|E
25|$|Sacrificial rituals {{among the}} Aztecs and in Mesoamerica, in general, {{must be seen}} in the context of {{religious}} cosmology: sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise, each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and quail. But the larger the effort required of the god, the greater the sacrifice had to be. Blood-fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For {{some of the most important}} rites, a priest would offer <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood,</b> by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, or offer a human life or even a god's life. The people who were sacrificed came from many segments of society, and might be a war captive, slave, or a member of Aztec society; the sacrifice might also be man or woman, adult or child, noble or commoner.|$|E
25|$|Egil {{missed the}} wedding {{on account of}} illness, and joined Thorir's men on an errand in Atloy, where he was slighted by the king's steward Bard (Bárðr), and wound up killing him. When Bard {{received}} Egil's party, he would only serve curd (skyr) to drink, pretending ale had run out. But later that night when king and queen arrived for the feast to the dísir, ale was served plentifully. Egil relentlessly jibed Bard about the deceit with sarcastic poetry, and his unquenchable thirst embarrassed the host. Bard and the queen sent Egil a poisoned drink, but the attempt was foiled by Egil, who inscribed runes on the horn and besmeared it with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood,</b> causing the horn to shatter. Egil then went up to Bard and stabbed him to death with his sword. Discovering Egil had fled, Eirik ordered an unsuccessful manhunt to have Egil killed, and lost several men. Despite the affront, Eirik was persuaded by Thorir (his foster-father) to settle this by compensation.|$|E

25|$|William Stewart Halsted, M.D. (September 23, 1852 – September 7, 1922) was an American {{surgeon who}} {{emphasized}} strict aseptic technique during surgical procedures, {{was an early}} champion of newly discovered anesthetics, and introduced several new operations, including the radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Halsted returned to New York in 1880 {{and for the next}} six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. He operated at multiple hospitals, including Roosevelt Hospital, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Charity Hospital, Emigrant Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and Chambers Street Hospital. He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher. In 1882 he performed one of the first gallbladder operations in the United States (a cholecystotomy performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2am). Halsted also performed one of the first blood transfusions in the United States. He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth. He found her moribund from blood loss, and in a bold move withdrew <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood,</b> transfused his blood into his sister, and then operated on her to save her life.|$|E
25|$|Alexandros Panagoulis {{was brutally}} {{tortured}} during his incarceration by the junta. Many {{believe that he}} maintained his faculties thanks to his will, determination to defend his beliefs, {{as well as his}} keen sense of humour. While imprisoned at Bogiati, Panagoulis is said to have written his poetry on the walls of his cell or on small papers, often using <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>blood</b> as ink (as told in the poem 'The Paint'). Many of his poems have not survived. However, he managed to smuggle some to friends while in prison, or to recall and rewrite them later. While in prison his first collection in Italian titled Altri seguiranno: poesie e documenti dal carcere di Boyati (Others will Follow: Poetry and Documents of the Prison of Boyati) was published in Palermo in 1972 with an introduction of the Italian politician Ferruccio Parri and the Italian film director and intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini. For this collection Panagoulis was awarded the Viareggio International Prize of Poetry (Premio Viareggio Internazionale) the following year. After his liberation he published his second collection in Milan under the title Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia (I write you from a prison in Greece) with an introduction by Pasolini. He had previously published several collections in Greek, including The Paint (I Bogia).|$|E
