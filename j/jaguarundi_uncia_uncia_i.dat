5000|$|The [...] "roaring cats" [...] (lion, Panthera leo; tiger, P. tigris; jaguar, P. onca; leopard, P. pardus) have an incompletely ossified hyoid, which {{according}} to this theory, enables them to roar but not to purr. However, the snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia,</b> or P. <b>uncia),</b> as the fifth felid species with an incompletely ossified hyoid, purrs (Hemmer, 1972).|$|R

50|$|The {{snow leopard}} or ounce (Panthera <b>uncia</b> syn. <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> {{is a large}} cat native to the {{mountain}} ranges of Central and South Asia. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because, as of 2003, {{the size of the}} global wild population was estimated at 4,080-6,590 adults. Fewer than 2,500 individuals may be reproducing in the wild.As of 2016, estimates for the size of the global population vary from at least 4,080 to about 8,700 individuals.|$|R
50|$|The {{snow leopard}} was {{initially}} {{seen at the}} base of Panthera, but newer molecular studies suggest that it is nestled within Panthera and is a sister species of the tiger. Many place the snow leopard within the genus Panthera, but there is currently no consensus as to whether the snow leopard should retain its own genus <b>Uncia</b> or be moved to Panthera <b>uncia.</b> Since 2008, the IUCN Red List lists it as Panthera <b>uncia</b> using <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia</b> as a synonym.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 Nardelli {{established}} a private Wild Felids Breeding Centre near Rome where he successfully bred in captivity several threatened species including the {{red-shanked douc langur}} (Pygathrix nemaeus), the snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) all first ever bred in Italy.|$|R
50|$|Taxonomically, {{the snow}} leopard has been {{classified}} as <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia</b> {{since the early}} 1930s. Based on genotyping studies, the cat has been considered {{a member of the}} genus Panthera since 2008. Two subspecies have been attributed, but genetic differences between the two have not been settled.|$|R
50|$|Large mammals {{include the}} snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> bharal or Himalayan blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), takin (Budorcas taxicolor), Himalayan musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), Himalayan goral (Nemorhaedus baileyi), and Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar). Smaller mammals include Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana), weasels, and pikas.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is home to}} over 200 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants, 23 species of large mammals and over 100 bird species. Notable wildlife species inhabiting Wangchuck Centennial include the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> wolf, takin (Budorcas taxicolor) and Himalayan black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus).|$|R
50|$|The path {{continues}} with large enclosures containing tigers (Panthera tigris), Siberian tigers, Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli). The path {{ends with the}} eastern Siberian and Mongolian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis euptilura), clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), snow leopards (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> and Pallas's cats (Otocolobus manul).|$|R
50|$|The {{divergence}} of Pantherinae from Felinae {{has been}} estimated to have occurred between six and ten million years ago. DNA analysis suggests that the snow leopard <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia</b> is basal to the entire Pantherinae and should be renamed Panthera <b>uncia.</b> There is also evidence of distinct markers for the mitochondrial genome for Felidae.|$|R
50|$|Here {{are some}} of the last {{remaining}} herds of wild ungulates: wild yak (Bos grunniens), Tibetan wild ass or kiang (Equus kiang), Himalayan blue sheep or Bharal (Pseudois nayaur), Argali (Ovis ammon), Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) and Tibetan antelope or chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii). Chiru wool is considered the finest known, and is smuggled, especially to Kashmir, India where it is woven into shahtoosh shawls. Predators include snow leopards (Panthera <b>uncia</b> or <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> Tibetan wolves (Canis lupus chanco), Turkestan lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus) and Tibetan blue bears (Ursus arctos pruinosus). At the bottom end of the food chain are large numbers of pika (Ochotona spp.).|$|R
40|$|A snow leopard, {{specifically}} irbis (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> {{is considered}} {{as the most}} endangered species. There are many causes of decreasing population in the last twenty years. The most important are mainly loss of habitat and prey, poaching, agro farming, related conflicts with the natives, and {{last but not least}} bad legislation in some countries. Although, the protection has improved in recent years, it is still necessary to increase its efficiency, especially in legislation. Breeding in human care {{is also one of the}} most significant implements in protection. For effective breeding it is essential to understand the factors affecting its success. The main aim of my bachelor thesis is to evaluate the breeding success of irbis in the zoos all over the world (except Asia) from data obtained from the International Pedigree Book for Snow leopards (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia).</b> Furthermore, my next task is to describe the conditions of breeding in the Czech Republic and specify the chief factors determining the success of rearing. The following facts based on the study of the International Pedigree Book for Snow leopards (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> were ascertained: due to the small number of zoological gardens, there are initially large fluctuations in success of rearing. With the rising natality increases at the same time the mortality. The average success rate is 56, 47 %. The percentage of deaths is still high. The breeding conditions in zoos of the Czech Republic revealed that the success of breeding is negatively affected by the high humidity and poorly prepared diet...|$|R
30|$|There {{are various}} {{environmental}} issues linked with grazing, fodder and firewood collection from the forests. Moreover, {{there is an}} increasing danger of human-wildlife conflict due to habitat fragmentation and destruction by humans, and resource competition, as the forests and alpine meadows provide habitat to many wild mountain ungulates and carnivores including bharal (Pseudois nayaur), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), leopard (Panthera pardus) and snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia).</b>|$|R

50|$|Mongolia has {{a number}} of large mammals, {{including}} gray wolves and Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica), as well as more endangered species such as the wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus), the snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> the Gobi bear, (rarest and unique to the desert region), the takhi (both wild and domestic types of horses) and the Asiatic wild ass (the largest numbers in the world are found in the Gobi desert).|$|R
50|$|The muzzle clamp is {{a method}} of killing used by large predators, usually cats such as Panthera leo, the lion, Panthera pardus, the leopard, and <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia,</b> the snow leopard. It {{requires}} the subduing of prey, usually completely {{on the ground and}} pinned by the predator, and the engulfing of the muzzle of the prey in the mouth of the predator, blocking respiration through either the mouth or nose.|$|R
50|$|So far 15 {{species of}} mammals and 150 bird {{species have been}} {{documented}} in the park (Paramanand et al. 2000). This includes some of the rare and charismatic species such as snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus), brown bear (Ursus arctos), musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster), blue sheep or bharal (Pseudois nayaur), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), Koklass (Pucrasia macrolopha) and Himalayan snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis).|$|R

40|$|From September to November 2004 we {{conducted}} surveys of snow leopard <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia</b> signs in three major valleys in Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) {{national park in}} Nepal using the Snow Leopard Information Management System, a standardized survey technique for snow leopard research. We walked 24 transects covering c. 14 km and located 33 sites with 56 snow leopard signs, and 17 signs incidentally in other areas.

40|$|The snow leopard, <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia,</b> {{has been}} co-ordinated {{at the highest}} level of {{management}} in Europe (EEP) for 20 years. During this time, the population has fluctuated from 74 animals in 1987 when snow leopards were included in the EEP-program, to a maximum of 224 animals in 1996 when the captive population reached its largest number. The following year, in 1997, the population started to decrease and with a few exceptions, has continued to do so throughout the following years. In 1. 1. 2008, the population stood at 183 (87. 96) animals, distributed over 85 institutions...|$|R
50|$|In 2005, a five-month-old {{snow leopard}} (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> in Europe was {{diagnosed}} with phaeohyphomycosis due to Cladophalophora bantiana. This fungus caused spastic paralysis {{as well as the}} inability to defecate or urinate. Because of this finding, more researchers are aware of this disease {{and the fact that it}} does not just infect the brain, as previously thought, but also other organs and other parts of the nervous system. A Purdue University study in 2011 showed a Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos) with the same fungus affected by cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. The eight-year-old animal was the first report of this disease in a camelid ruminant.|$|R
50|$|The Altai {{mountains}} {{are home to}} a diverse fauna, because of its different habitats, like steppes, northern taigas and alpine vegetation. Steep slopes are home to the Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica), whereas the rare argali (Ovis ammon) is found on more gentle slopes. Deer are represented by five species, Altai wapiti (Cervus elaphus sibiricus), moose (Alces alces), forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus valentinae), Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus). Moose and reindeer however, are restricted to the northern parts of the mountain range. The wild boar (Sus scrofa) {{is found in the}} lower foothills and surrounding lowlands. Until recently, the Mongolian gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) was found in the Russian Altai mountains, more specifically in the Chuya River steppe close to the Mongolian border. Large predators are represented by snow leopards (Panthera <b>uncia,</b> syn. <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia),</b> wolves (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and brown bears (Ursus arctos), in the northern parts also by the wolverine (Gulo gulo). The Tien Shan dhole (Cuon alpinus hesperius) (a northwestern subspecies of the Asiatic wild dog) also lives there.|$|R
25|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber {{on the basis of}} an illustration in his 1777 publication Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen. Schreber named the cat Felis <b>uncia</b> and gave its type locality as Barbary, Persia, East India, and China. In 1854, the British zoologist John Edward Gray proposed the genus <b>Uncia,</b> to which he subordinated the snow leopard under the name <b>Uncia</b> irbis. British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock corroborated this classification, but attributed the scientific name <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia.</b> He also described morphological differences between snow leopards and the then-accepted members of Panthera.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{decrease}} in livestock numbers could {{have had an impact}} on wolf populations, even if the scarce data available on wolf diet in Kyrgyzstan doesn’t show a high proportion of domestic animals (ca. 15 % in the Central Tian Shan according to Vyrypajev and Vorobjev 1983). The level of poaching and its impact on wild ungulates and marmots (Marmota baibacina, M. caudate, M. menzbieri), which are the wolf’s main wild prey in Kyrgyzstan, remains unknown. It certainly increased for highly valuable species like snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> and probably also for argali sheep (Ovis ammon) and ibex (Capra ibex) which can provide meat and valuable trophies (Koshkarev 1994).|$|R
2500|$|The libra (Latin for [...] "scales / balance") is {{an ancient}} Roman unit of mass that was {{equivalent}} to approximately 328.9 grams. It was divided into 12 <b>unciae</b> (singular: <b>uncia),</b> or ounces. The libra is {{the origin of the}} abbreviation for pound, [...] "lb".|$|R
30|$|Here, {{we use a}} multi-species {{approach}} to identify the problems of conserving wildlife in Nepal. Although the use of surrogate information for certain species is questioned (Bonn and Gaston 2005), but recommended {{in the absence of}} other assessment options (Landres et al. 1988), we chose three particular species because they occupy a range of habitats that include those of many other species of wildlife. An extensive survey of the occurrence of carnivores such as leopards (Panthera pardus, <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> and Himalayan musk deer in the study area is not possible because they are rare and the topography of the region is highly rugged. Hence, the habitat suitability maps of the species studied can be an effective tool for evaluating their conservation needs and designating areas for conservation.|$|R
40|$|Closely {{monitoring}} {{snow leopard}} (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia)</b> fetal developments via transabdominal ultrasound, with minimal stress to the animal, was {{the goal of}} this project. The staff at Potter Park Zoo has used the principles of habituation, desensitization, and positive reinforcement to train a female snow leopard (U. <b>uncia).</b> Ultrasound examinations were preformed on an unanesthetized feline at 63 and 84 days. The animal remained calm and compliant throughout both procedures. Fetuses were observed and measured on both occasions. The absence of anesthesia eliminated components of psychologic and physiologic stress associated with sedation. This was the first recorded instance of transabdominal ultrasound being carried out on an unanesthetized snow leopard. It documents the feasibility of detecting pregnancy and monitoring fetal development vi...|$|R
5000|$|The Spanish name onza {{derives from}} the Latin lynx, lyncis, and is {{equivalent}} to the English word [...] "ounce", originally applied to the lynx but now more commonly to the snow leopard (<b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia).</b> [...] There are old texts written by Spanish conquistadors about the onza, but they might refer to the jaguarundi, which is known as onza in many Mexican states. [...] Onça is the Brazilian Portuguese word for jaguar, Panthera onca, where a spotted jaguar is known as onça-pintada and a melanistic one as onça-preta. These are real animals, occurring as far north as Mexico and possibly into the southwest of the United States. Also, a cat some call the [...] "puma" [...] Puma concolor is known most often as onça-parda in some areas of Brazil (in others, it is known by the name that predates American cougar, suçuarana).|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the last}} two decades of conflict, Afghanistan¿s Wakhan Corridor was {{considered}} an important area for conservation of the wildlife of high altitudes. We conducted an assessment of the status of large mammals in Wakhan after 22 years of conflict, and also made a preliminary assessment of wildlife trade in the markets of Kabul, Faizabad and Ishkashem. The survey confirmed the continued occurrence of at least eight species of large mammals in Wakhan, of which the snow leopard <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia</b> and Marco Polo sheep Ovis ammon are globally threatened. We found evidence of human-wildlife conflict in Wakhan due to livestock depredation by snow leopard and wolf Canis lupus. Large mammals are hunted for meat, sport, fur, and in retaliation against livestock depredation. The fur trade in Kabul is a threat to the snow leopard, wolf, lynx Lynx lynx and common leopard Panthera pardus...|$|R
30|$|Leopard cat hairs {{were found}} in large numbers in stomach and scat samples from the visual {{analysis}} and sequencing results (8 of 56 samples analyzed were confirmed as leopard cat hair). Hairs in stomach and scat samples are most likely {{a result of their}} own grooming rather than cannibalism (Grassman et al. 2005). Plants comprised 9.1 % of the stomach contents. Given that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Alaskan brown bears (Ursus arctos) consume high-fiber items to control parasites (Huffman 1997), it is possible that this is the same reason for plant consumption among leopard cats. In addition, a few studies suggested that this phenomenon is an unintentional consequence of feeding on animal prey, and that consumption of plants by the snow leopard <b>Uncia</b> <b>uncia</b> and leopard cat P. bengalensis is likely to provide mineral or vitamin supplements, which cannot easily be obtained from animal prey (Shehzad et al. 2012). However, it remains unclear whether the plants were accidentally or intentionally eaten.|$|R
