5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not <b>in</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument {{that may have been}} invented in Europe until this period. Stringed instruments were prominent <b>in</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Age</b> Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E

By this time, he had ceased to be {{regarded}} as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.|$|E

25|$|Decorative kufic {{inscriptions}} {{are often}} imitated into pseudo-kufics <b>in</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>age</b> and Renaissance Europe.

It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13–14th century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during Jesus's time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them.|$|E

25|$|About 100million {{bacteria}} must typically be ingested {{to cause}} cholera {{in a normal}} healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors). Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having {{the highest rates of}} infection. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or children who are malnourished, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult <b>in</b> <b>middle</b> <b>age,</b> can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.|$|E
