5|$|EPA {{published}} in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009. The new rule limits radiation doses from Yucca Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, the <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> two dose standards that would apply {{based on the number}} of years from the time the facility is closed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{initiated}} several {{air quality}} requirements that help reduce ground-level ozone {{that leads to}} urban heat islands. In the Clean Air Act, one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that are {{put in place to}} ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the Clean Air Act, all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.|$|E
5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>has</b> designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|The EPA-derived prostanoids {{have three}} double bonds (e.g. PGG3 or PGG3) while leukotrienes derived from <b>EPA</b> <b>have</b> five double bonds (e.g. LTB5 or LTB5).|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, state {{regulators}} {{from across the}} country stated that they had seen no evidence of hydraulic fracturing contaminating water in their respective jurisdictions. [...] In May 2011 the EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson testified in a Senate Hearing Committee stating that the <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> never made a definitive determination of contamination where the hydraulic fracturing process itself has contaminated water. [...] However, by 2013, Dr. Robin Ikeda, Deputy Director of Noncommunicable Diseases, Injury and Environmental Health at the CDC testified to congress that <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> documented contamination at several sites.|$|R

5000|$|On March 17, 2016, McCarthy and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder {{testified before}} the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform {{regarding}} the Flint water crisis. Snyder apologized for the state's mistakes. McCarthy, however, insisted the <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> done nothing wrong and that [...] "there is no way my agency created this problem", causing her to at times be shouted down by outraged members of Congress. In October 2016, the EPA's inspector general concluded that the <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> wrongfully delayed issuing an emergency order regarding Flint, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|By 1970, <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> {{started to}} {{resemble}} a modern airline. That year, EPA's bush operations were sold to some senior staff as a separate airline - Labrador Airways, now Air Labrador.|$|R
50|$|The <b>EPA</b> <b>have</b> some {{regulations}} and guidelines for monitoring nitrogen dioxide levels. Historically, some {{states in the}} U.S including Chicago, Northeast corridor and L.A have had high levels of nitrogen dioxide.|$|R
25|$|The <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> officially removed {{saccharin}} and its salts {{from their}} list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a 14 December 2010 release, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 the EPA began cleanup {{efforts in}} Libby {{and now the}} area is a Superfund cleanup area. The <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{determined}} that harmful asbestos is released from the mine {{as well as through}} other activities that disturb soil in the area.|$|E
25|$|Los Angeles is {{also home}} to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells located within 1,500 feet of homes, churches, schools and {{hospitals}} in the city, a situation about which the <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> voiced serious concerns.|$|E

25|$|While the <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> {{not found}} {{significant}} {{evidence of a}} widespread, systematic impact on drinking water by hydraulic fracturing, {{this may be due}} to insufficient systematic pre- and post- hydraulic fracturing data on drinking water quality, and the presence of other agents of contamination that preclude the link between shale oil/gas extraction and its impact.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US <b>EPA)</b> <b>has</b> {{developed}} a classification scheme {{used to compare}} fuel economy among similar vehicles.

Heavy duty vehicles are not included within the EPA scheme.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, {{researchers}} have limited {{data about the}} health effects of ingestion of MTBE. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>has</b> concluded that available data are inadequate to quantify health risks of MTBE at low exposure levels in drinking water, but the data support the conclusion that MTBE is a potential human carcinogen at high doses.|$|E
50|$|EPA was {{investigated}} by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2003 following the discovery of higher-than-acceptable copper and lead levels in tap water in the District of Columbia. The GAO reported that <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> not been collecting copper and lead levels from the states, despite claims that the levels of copper and lead have decreased; data for 72 percent of water systems were missing. <b>EPA</b> may <b>have</b> been lacking data because more resources were being dedicated to lead regulation than lead reporting.|$|R

25|$|Evidence for the {{carcinogenicity}} of 1,3-dichloropropene {{in humans}} is inadequate, but results from several cancer bioassays provide adequate evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. In the US, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) {{has determined that}} 1,3-dichloropropene may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that 1,3-dichloropropene is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> classified 1,3-dichloropropene as a probable human carcinogen.|$|E
25|$|The live impact range, {{which is}} the most {{contaminated}} zone, was given the highest protected environmental status, that of a “wilderness preserve.” The Fish and Wildlife Service states that Vieques Wildlife Refuge is an ecologically diverse Caribbean wildlife refuge. The <b>EPA</b> <b>has</b> declared the refuge a superfund site. Much of the lands are now termed wildlife refuges, meaning that humans are not allowed on the land, therefore allowing the Navy to avoid cleanup. Whether or not the U.S. made the land a wildlife refuge to avoid cleaning up the island is debated.|$|E
5000|$|President Bush's {{administration}} also attempted to censor results of climate studies, [...] "nearly half of 1,600 government scientists at seven agencies ranging from NASA to the <b>EPA</b> <b>had</b> been warned against using terms like 'global warming' in reports or speeches, throughout Bush’s eight-year presidency".|$|R
