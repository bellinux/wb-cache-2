40|$|Industrial {{longline}} fisheries {{cause the}} death {{of large numbers of}} seabirds annually. Various mitigation measures have been proposed, including the use <b>of</b> <b>tori</b> <b>lines.</b> In this study the efficiency <b>of</b> a single <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> to reduce seabird bycatch was tested on pelagic longline vessels (25 - 37 m length). Thirteen fishing trips were carried out in the area and season of the highest bycatch rates recorded in the southwest Atlantic (2009 - 2011). We deployed two treatments in random order: sets with a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> and without a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> (control treatment). The use <b>of</b> a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> significantly reduced seabird bycatch rates. Forty three and seven birds were captured in the control (0. 85 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 49 sets) and in the <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> treatment (0. 13 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 51 sets), respectively. In 47 % of the latter sets the <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> broke either because of entanglement with the longline gear or by tension. This diminished the <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> effectiveness; five <b>of</b> the seven captures during sets where a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> was deployed were following ruptures. Nine additional trips were conducted with a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> that was modified to reduce entanglements (2012 - 2016). Seven entanglements were recorded in 73 longline sets. The chance of a rupture on these trips was 4 % (95 % c. l. = 1 - 18 %) of that during 2009 - 2011. This work shows that the use <b>of</b> a <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> reduces seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries and is a practice suitable for medium size vessels (~ 25 - 40 m length). Because the study area has historically very high bycatch rates at global level, this <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> design is potentially useful to reduce seabird bycatch in many medium size pelagic longline vessel fishing in the southern hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{trials were}} {{conducted}} onboard a stern trawler {{to identify the}} relative efficacy of three emerging mitigation measures (<b>tori</b> <b>lines,</b> warp scarer and Brady baffler) designed to reduce seabird mortality caused by warp cable strikes. The use of mitigation measures was clearly shown to substantially reduce seabird mortalities from collisions between seabirds and warp cables. Based on an established significant relationship between contact rate and seabird mortality, when using contact rate as an index of mortality {{there was a clear}} performance hierarchy of the three measures. <b>Tori</b> <b>lines</b> and the warp scarer were significantly more effective at reducing contacts than the Brady Baffler, whilst <b>tori</b> <b>lines</b> represent a smaller, but still significant, improvement on the warp scarer.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Seabird bycatch in {{commercial}} fisheries {{is one of}} the major factors causing decreases in many seabird populations. In trawl fisheries, high mortalities have been recorded as a result of seabirds being struck by trawl warps (the cables used to tow the trawl net). <b>Tori</b> (bird-scaring) <b>lines</b> have been used to decrease seabird mortality in some trawl fisheries by up to 90 %. However, <b>tori</b> <b>lines</b> are not effective at reducing the number of birds that drift towards the trawl warps while feeding on factory discards alongside the vessel. The Albatross Task Force (ATF) helped to develop and test a new device, the Rory Line (RL), to be used in conjunction with <b>tori</b> <b>lines,</b> and designed to reduce warp strikes by placing a physical barrier between the scupper (where factory discards are released) and the danger zone (where the trawl warps enter the water) at the stern of the vessel. This study tests the efficacy of the RL at reducing the number of birds drifting into the danger zone and the number of birds being struck by the trawl warps...|$|R

A {{historical}} review <b>of</b> <b>Tori,</b> densipiliata is given and a neotype is designated to replace Walch's type of T. densipiliata which is lost. The genus is redefined {{on the basis}} of larval, nymphal and adult characters and 2 new species of Toritrombicula {uphami and asa) are described. Womersley & Audy's subspecies Tori, densipiliata dumbletoni is given specific rank. The importance stressed about birds as efficient conveyance for the dispersal of disease vectors from one country to another has provided stimulus to taxonomists for studies of bird ectoparasites in recent years. The present work, basically a taxonomic one, is the outcome of trombiculid material amass-ed from collections in Southeast Asia. Wherever possible, the common bird names are listed along with their scientific names. The neotype (MZ 82448) and a nymph (MZ 70415) of Toritrombicula densipiliata (Walch), and the holotype <b>of</b> <b>Tori,</b> uphami n. sp. is deposited in the U. S. National Museum, Washington, D.
