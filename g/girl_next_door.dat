5|$|Cherry {{originally}} created Susan as a <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> archetype {{and intended}} for the character to provide an emotional anchor for the series. When developing the character, Cherry drew upon his personal experiences {{as well as those}} of single women in his life. The role was originally written for Mary-Louise Parker, who turned it down; as a result, Hatcher was cast in early 2004. Hatcher's portrayal of the character is both comedic and vulnerable. During the series' debut season, both the character and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series progressed, the character was received less favorably by critics and fans. Hatcher has received both a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the series.|$|E

Whenever his aunt is absent, Digory finds solace with the animals and trees, including a talking squirrel named Pattertwig. Polly enters the story as a <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> who is unable to understand the speech of non-human creatures. She wants to build a raft to explore a stream which leads to an underground world. Digory helps construct the raft, but ends up sawing a branch from a talking tree necessary to complete it, in order not to lose face with Polly. This causes him to lose his supernatural powers of speech. The following day he is visited by his godmother MrsLefay who knows that Digory has lost his abilities and gives him a card with the address of a furniture shop which she instructs him to visit.

500|$|Initially, Lana is {{characterized}} as the intelligent [...] "girl next door". She eventually becomes a tragic figure in Smallville, as the {{decisions made by}} Clark and Lex change the character {{over the course of}} the show. As Gough explains, by the end of the sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own game. Over the course of the show, Lana transitions from the <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> to a more [...] "self-reliant young woman". Kreuk has been nominated for various awards for her portrayal of Lana Lang.|$|E
500|$|Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter {{believes}} [...] "You Belong with Me"'s plot is [...] "confessional" [...] and regards scenarios themed {{with high}} school, while Swift [...] "is the <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> who's had her heart broken and takes refuge in music". Lucy Davies of the BBC noted, [...] "Swift deals in the prosaic imagery {{of high school}} boys". In one verse, Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, [...] "She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers", which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend. In the choruses, Swift attempts [...] "to persuade some boy {{to come to his}} senses and submit to her everygirl charms".|$|E
500|$|Tali has {{received}} a positive critical response. Writing for UGO, Evan Saathoff listed Tali as his fourth best video game companion, comparing her as the [...] "innocent, <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> experience" [...] to the sexiness of Halo's Cortana. GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson listed Tali as one of several video game characters she'd [...] "go gay for", noting her [...] "kind personality and air of mystery", {{as well as her}} technical genius and accent. Upon hearing news for a potential Mass Effect film, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer looked at the different characters and felt Famke Janssen would be best suited {{to play the role of}} Tali—due to having a similar body to the character and having played Xenia Onatopp, a Russian-accented soldier, in the 1995 Bond film GoldenEye.|$|E

500|$|Susan is {{primarily}} characterized as the <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door.</b> Teri Hatcher stated [...] "I’m not exactly her, but I get her. I get her insecurities, her flaws." [...] She called the character [...] "a great representation of what [...] deals with daily. Our responsibilities {{can be overwhelming}} and things often don't go as you planned, {{so you have to}} roll with it. Susan celebrates rolling with it". She is a hopeless romantic and often expresses her more openly and vulnerably than the other characters in the series. The series begins a year after Susan's first divorce, when she is still emotionally raw. Throughout the series, several other characters have confronted Susan about her inability to live happily and without drama. Susan has a close relationship with her daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), who often acts as the parent figure in the relationship.|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan as a <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] {{but had to}} be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan {{was going to be}} my anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then {{it occurred to me that}} one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E
500|$|... "Baelor" [...] {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of the German actress Sibel Kekilli, {{in the role of}} the prostitute Shae. Executive producer George R. R. Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a <b>girl</b> <b>next</b> <b>door</b> quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take every one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made you fall in love with her as well." ...|$|E
