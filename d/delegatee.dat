Moreover, by assigning these permissions to a <b>delegatee</b> role, all other users who are associated with that particular role get the delegated rights.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Green and Ateniese and Ivan and Dodis {{independently}} proposed several proxy re-encryption schemes in the identity-based cryptographic setting.

The schemes are unidirectional, namely, the re-encryption key is for one party to re-encrypt cipher-texts to another party, but not vice versa.

CPA-secure IBPRE schemes secure without random oracles were subsequently proposed by Matsuo and Mizuno and Doi.|$|E
40|$|Proxy re-encryption (PRE) is {{a highly}} useful {{cryptographic}} primitive whereby Alice and Bob can endow a proxy with the capacity to change ciphertext recipients from Alice to Bob, without the proxy itself being able to decrypt, thereby providing delegation of decryption authority.

Both schemes enjoy highly desirable properties such as uni-directionality and multi-hop delegation. Unlike (the few) prior constructions of PRE and KP-PRE that typically rely on bilinear maps under ad hoc assumptions, security of our construction is based on the hardness of the standard Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem, itself reducible from worst-case lattice hard problems that are conjectured immune to quantum cryptanalysis, or “post-quantum”. Of independent interest, we further examine the practical hardness of the LWE assumption, using Kannan’s exhaustive search algorithm coupling with pruning techniques. This leads to state-of-the-art parameters not only for our scheme, but also for a number of other primitives based on LWE published the literature. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a highly}} {{distributed}} computing environment, people frequently {{move from one}} place to another where the new system has no previous knowledge of them at all. Traditional access control mechanisms such as access matrix and RBAC depend heavily on central management. However, the identities and privileges of the users are stored and administered in different locations in distributed systems. How to establish trust between these strange entities remains a challenge. Many efforts have been made to solve this problem. In the previous work, the decentralised administration of trust is achieved through delegation which is a very rigid mechanism. The limitation of delegation is that the identities of the delegators and <b>delegatees</b> must be known in advance and the privileges must be definite. In this thesis, we present a new model for decentralised administration of trust: trust empowerment. In trust empowerment, trust is defined as a set of properties. Properties can be owned and/or controlled. Owners of the properties can perform the privileges denoted by the properties. Controllers of the properties can grant the properties to other subjects but cannot gain the privileges of the properties. Each subject has its own policy to define trust empowerment. We design the Mojoy tmst policy language that supports trust empowerment. We give the syntax, semantics and an XML implementation of the language. The Mojoy trust policy language is based on XACML, which is an OASIS standard. We develop a compliance checker for the language. The responsibility of the compliance checker is to examine the certificates and policy, and return a Boolean value to indicate whether the user's request is allowed. We apply our new model, the language and the compliance checker to a case study to show that they are capable of coping with the trust issues met in the distributed systems...|$|R
40|$|Encryption {{helps to}} ensure that {{information}} within a session is not compromised. Authentication and access control measures ensure legitimate and appropriate access to information, and prevent inappropriate access to such resources. While encryption, authentication and access control {{each has its own}} responsibility in securing a communication session, a combination of these three mechanisms can provide much better protection for information. This thesis addresses encryption, authentication and access control related problems in cloud and distributed environments, since these problems are very common in modern organization environment. The first one is a User-friendly Location-free Encryption System for Mobile Users (UFLE). It is an encryption and authentication system which provides maximum security to sensitive data in distributed environment: corporate, home and outdoors scenarios, but requires minimum user effort (i. e. no biometric entry, or possession of cryptographic tokens) to access the data. It makes users securely and easily access data any time and any place, as well as avoids data breach due to stolen/lost laptops and USB flash. The multi-factor authentication protocol provided in this scheme is also applicable to cloud storage. The second one is a Simple Privacy-Preserving Identity-Management for Cloud Environment (SPICE). It is the first digital identity management system that can satisfy “unlinkability”and “delegatable authentication” in addition to other desirable properties in cloud environment. Unlinkability ensures that none of the cloud service providers (CSPs), even if they collude, can link the transactions of the same user. On the other hand, delegatable authentication is unique to the cloud platform, in which several CSPs may join together to provide a packaged service, with one of them being the source provider which interacts with the clients and performs authentication, while the others are receiving CSPs which will be transparent to the clients. The authentication should be delegatable such that the receiving CSP can authenticate a user without a direct communication with either the user or the registrar, and without fully trusting the source CSP. The third one addresses re-encryption based access control issue in cloud and distributed storage. We propose the first non-transferable proxy re-encryption scheme [16] which successfully achieves the non-transferable property. Proxy re-encryption allows a third-party (the proxy) to re-encrypt a ciphertext which has been encrypted for one party without seeing the underlying plaintext {{so that it can be}} decrypted by another. A proxy re-encryption scheme is said to be non-transferable if the proxy and a set of colluding <b>delegatees</b> cannot re-delegate decryption rights to other parties. The scheme can be utilized for a content owner to delegate content decryption rights to users in the untrusted cloud storage. The advantages of using such scheme are: decryption keys are managed by the content owner, and plaintext is always hidden from cloud provider. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the concept}} of proxy re-encryption has been shown very useful {{in a number of}} applications, {{especially}} in enforcing access con-trol policies. In existing proxy re-encryption schemes, the <b>delegatee</b> can decrypt all ciphertexts for the delegator after re-encryption by the proxy. Consequently, in order to implement fine-grained access control policies, the delegator needs to either use multiple key pairs or trust the proxy to behave honestly. In this paper, we extend this concept and propose type-based proxy re-encryption, which enables the delegator to selec-tively delegate his decryption right to the <b>delegatee</b> while only needs one key pair. As a result, type-based proxy re-encryption enables the dele-gator to implement fine-grained policies with one key pair without any additional trust on the proxy. We provide a security model for our con-cept and provide formal definitions for semantic security and ciphertext privacy which is a valuable attribute in privacy-sensitive contexts. We propose two type-based proxy re-encryption schemes: one is CPA secure with ciphertext privacy while the other is CCA secure without ciphertext privacy. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Since their {{introduction}} in 1985, by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff, {{followed by}} Feige, Fiat and Shamir, zero-knowledge proofs {{have played a}} significant role in modern cryptography: they allow a party to convince another party of the validity of a statement (proof of membership) or of its knowledge of a secret (proof of knowledge). Cryptographers frequently use them as building blocks in complex protocols since they offer quite useful soundness features, which exclude cheating players. In most of modern telecom-munication services, the execution of these protocols involves a prover on a portable device, with limited capacities, and namely distinct trusted part and more powerful part. The former thus has to delegate some computations to the latter. However, since the latter is not fully trusted, it should not learn any secret information. This paper focuses on proofs of knowledge of discrete logarithm relations sets (DLRS), and the delegation of some prover’s computations, without leaking any critical information to the <b>delegatee.</b> We will achieve vari-ous efficient improvements ensuring perfect zero-knowledge against the verifier and partial zero-knowledge, but still reasonable in many contexts, against the <b>delegatee.</b> ...|$|E
