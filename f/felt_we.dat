500|$|During Blackadder Rides Again, Tony Robinson {{likewise}} {{recalls that}} these script meetings could be uncomfortable, {{and has been}} less reserved speaking about the script rehearsals since. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial [...] "There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers—the writers <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse. At {{end of the first}} day of rehearsals the writers would go away {{and by the time they}} came back we would have changed an awful lot of it. By the end, they <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had run away with it. There were quite a lot of emotions flashing around about that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Drummond admitted: [...] "We didn't {{listen to}} 1987 What The Fuck's Going On {{for a long}} time, and when we did we were embarrassed by {{it because it was}} so badly recorded. But I still <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> were able to get a lot out of {{ourselves}} through it." ...|$|E

No professional artist of our standing would condescend to receive such an amount. We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had been taken for a ride." ...|$|E

500|$|The Jackson family {{gathered}} around a radio to hear the song broadcast for the first time. Michael Jackson — who was 9 {{years old at the}} time — said of the experience, [...] " [...] all laughed and hugged one another. We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had arrived." [...] The single [...] "Big Boy" [...] did not appear on any of Billboards music charts but sold in excess of 10,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, I {{think it was}} a situation where we'd become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't want to repeat past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E
500|$|In a [...] "farewell message" [...] to England {{quoted in}} Wisden, Johnson {{said that the}} [...] "most lasting memory" [...] would be the team's visit to Balmoral Castle. Johnson said [...] "We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> were going into an Englishman's home and into his family heart". [...] "It was {{difficult}} to believe that we were being entertained by Royalty. My personal wish would be for everybody in the Empire to spend an hour or so with the King and Queen. It would do them a tremendous amount of good." ...|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the marked}} {{signing of the}} summer was defender Sol Campbell, who moved from rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a Bosman ruling. The player's wage demands seemed to have {{extinguished}} Arsenal's chances of signing the player at one point. Campbell was unveiled at a midday news conference on 3 July 2001, which journalists [...] "presumed had been called to announce goalkeeper Richard Wright's arrival from Ipswich." [...] Wenger described Campbell as the [...] "best", adding: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could not compete on financial basis with the top clubs but we could give him a football challenge." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} story, then titled [...] "The Shroud," [...] {{was written}} by Joseph Stefano, who had previously worked on The Outer Limits. Hannah Louise Shearer was given the task of re-writing the original take. The first draft had Yar's death occur earlier in the episode with {{the main focus of}} the episode being the Armus creature rather than her death. It was the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry who argued in favor of her sudden demise as he felt it was suitable for a security officer. Roddenberry also argued against killing Armus in retaliation. Shearer later described the decision, saying [...] "Gene <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> couldn't kill the creature, because it is not up to us as human beings to make a moral judgement on any creature that we encounter, because we are not God".|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Staten, Tor Books asked Bungie if {{they had}} someone suited to writing the next novel; Staten, having written much of the Halo series canon, was the obvious choice. The author found that the book was {{the perfect way to}} {{elaborate}} on the Halo story without stripping it down for a video game: [...] "I always <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> shortchanged [...] We don't {{have a lot of time}} to tell story while the bullets are flying." [...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo. The author also said that the work of his favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice".|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{used the}} respite {{to prepare for}} the next day. Virginia put her wounded ashore and {{underwent}} temporary repairs. Captain Buchanan was among the wounded, so command on the second day fell to his executive officer, Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones. Jones proved to be no less aggressive than the man he replaced. While Virginia was being prepared for renewal of the battle, and while Congress was still ablaze, Monitor, commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, arrived in Hampton Roads. The Union ironclad had been rushed to Hampton Roads in hopes of protecting the Union fleet and preventing Virginia from threatening Union cities. Captain Worden was informed that his primary task was to protect Minnesota, so Monitor took up a position near the grounded Minnesota and waited. [...] "All on board <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had a friend that would stand by us in our hour of trial," [...] wrote Captain Gershom Jacques Van Brunt, the vessel's commander, in his official report the day after the engagement.|$|E
500|$|The end of {{the legal}} {{disputes}} coincided with the willingness and availability of Cameron, Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton {{to participate in the}} sequel; Schwarzenegger, who portrayed the Terminator in the first film, commented: [...] "I always <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> should continue the story of The Terminator, I told Jim that right after we finished the first film." [...] He and Hamilton reprised their respective roles from the first Terminator film. After an extensive casting search, 12-year-old Edward Furlong was selected from hundreds of candidates to portray John Connor; Robert Patrick was chosen to play the T-1000 Terminator because his agility would emphasize the disparity between the advanced T-1000 and Schwarzenegger's older T-800 (Cameron characterized the two as [...] "a Porsche" [...] and [...] "a human Panzer tank" [...] respectively). Patrick had previously appeared in the action feature Die Hard 2, but Furlong had no formal acting experience. Joe Morton was picked to portray Miles Dyson, a Cyberdyne scientist who helped develop the new CPU for the T-800 Terminators.|$|E

500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat {{as hard to}} take: [...] "It felt like a defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> were going to win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher {{was going to change}} that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E
500|$|For Diệm and his family, {{the failed}} coup {{was a turning}} point in {{relations}} with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had let him down and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously though the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like Syngman Rhee, the President of the anti-communist South Korea who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed in a coup earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin [...] "We had no worry about getting continued American assistance if we were successful; we <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could count on it, just like Park did when he overthrew Rhee." [...] Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were [...] "explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, {{in the sense that we}} all <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E
5000|$|Stuart Price {{said in a}} statement, [...] "We {{recorded}} Star Climbing over {{a three-year}} period between our studios, working on songs and lyrics until <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>we</b> had found the albums direction.

5000|$|David Kershenbaum {{said that}} the album was [...] "made for the right reasons". [...] "There was a set of ideas {{that we wanted to}} communicate, and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> if <b>we</b> were truthful and loyal to those ideas, then people would pick up on the emotion and the lyrical content that was there." ...|$|R
500|$|The band {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of the War album and tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The group were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin, but according to Bono: [...] "something just didn't feel right. We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> had more dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer." [...] Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire. Clayton said, [...] "We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty." [...] The Edge admired the ambient and [...] "weird works" [...] of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. Island Records founder Chris Blackwell initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would [...] "bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense".|$|E
500|$|Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food {{division}} as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met {{used the}} proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being [...] "lax" [...] in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it had kind of lost its way. We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under-resourced their R and done {{a number of things}} to make the number, make the number. Cost reduction is a way of life, {{but you have to be}} responsible about it. You have to protect the seed today because that will be the tree that bears fruit in the future. I don't think Pillsbury had done that.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, the Canadian House of Commons debated {{changing}} {{the name of}} the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the Canadian Charter of Rights, Freedoms and Responsibilities. As Parliamentary Secretary Russell MacLellan pointed out, this would have to be done through a constitutional amendment, particularly to section 34, since section 34 [...] "establishes the charter's title. [...] The charter's title is thus part of the Constitution." [...] MacLellan believed the amending formula needed would be the one requiring the support of seven provincial governments representing at least half of Canada's population. [...] Edmonton Southwest MP Ian McClelland had suggested the change, believing it to be necessary because [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> were becoming a nation of entitlement." [...] MacLellan replied that [...] "The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic society." [...] MacLellan added that section 1 implied a need for responsibilities, so [...] "It is not necessary to change the title of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between the individual's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of society." ...|$|E
