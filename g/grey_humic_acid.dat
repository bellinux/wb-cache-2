30|$|Our study {{points out}} that a {{decrease}} in the pH of a humate solution from 5 to 3 provokes a drastic change in the aggregation of the humic molecules. This pH range has not yet been fully investigated. The average pKa of the carboxylic groups of the HA is 4.5 [55],[56]. More recent studies [57], based on the Anderson-Hasselbach interpretation, have established that the apparent pKa of a peat humic acid was 4.93. Alvarez-Puebla and Garrido [58] measured the zeta potential of a <b>grey</b> <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> against pH and observed a drop in the pH intervals 3.6 to 4.2 and 5.9 to 6.2, with a section of null slope between the two. The null slope section between these drops seems to indicate that the electrokinetic properties of the colloids do not change in this interval. The plot of the size variation against pH showed great similarity. The porosity measured through CO 2 adsorption isotherms indicated {{a decrease in the}} pore size and surface area between pH  4 and pH  5, while no relevant difference was observed between pH  2 and pH  4. The results of Alvarez-Puebla and Garrido [58] indicate that the decrease in colloidal size appears to be more influenced by the ionization of phenolic groups than by the ionization of carboxylic groups. This is because the phenolic groups and the undissociated carboxylic groups can participate in forming hydrogen bonds thus promoting the coiling of the molecules and the formation of aggregates.|$|E

The {{method for}} {{fractioning}} -various humus complexes, which isdescribed in this paper, is essentially {{based on the}} differences betweentheir physical properties. especially their degree of dispersion, theirsensibility to the action of electrolytes {{and the nature of}} their associationwith the mineral colloids It has been thus possible to separatethree main groups of complexes. The pre-humus complexes are dispersed, and the nearest to certinoriginal constituents of the vegetal tissues, and not easily decomposed. As they are soluble in the acetyl bromide, different inthat from the true <b>humic</b> <b>acids,</b> it was possible to appreciate themattantitatively. The a complexes (brown <b>humic</b> <b>acids)</b> are still lightly coloured andloosely tied to clay. They can be extracted by means of dilute soda. even when clay is flocculated. therefore in the presence of KC 1 inthe sodic solution. The b complexes (<b>grey</b> <b>humic</b> <b>acids)</b> are much darker and closelytied to clay. They can be ext-acted by dilute soda only when clayis completely dispersed, consequently in the absence of KC 1. Besides,they are only partly soluble in soda, but this solubility seems to beincreased by a preliminary treatment with acetyl bromide. These three groups of complexes are found in variable proportionthe different humus types. The pre-humus compounds characterizethe « Mor », which is slowly decomposed.

South Africa has {{a variety}} of sources for humic {{substances}} that may be utilised for the large-scale production of specialised fertilizers. Humic substances are dark coloured fully decomposed remains of plant and animal organic matter. Amongst the sources that were investigated in this study, a 5 -weeks old compost (C 5 W), a 6 -weeks old compost (C 6 W), a compost prepared by Medallion Mushroom farm for the production of mushrooms (CB 1), a compost produced as waste material after mushroom production (CB 2), recycled water used in compost (i. e. CB 1) preparation for mushroom production (“Goodie water,” GW) and black liquor from pulp industry (BL), black liquor showed the best potential for the large scale production of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> in South Africa. The quantity and quality of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> in these materials were determined by using the basic acid-precipitation method and E 6 /E 6 ratio analyses of the products. Extracting <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> from black liquor was optimised by comparing three possible variations to the standard humic acid-precipitation method (HAp), namely, lignin extraction/humic acid precipitation method (LHAp), <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> precipitation/acid treatment method (HApA) and lignin extraction/humic acid precipitation/acid treatment method (LHApA). The method of extraction had a substantial impact on {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> produced. <b>Humic</b> <b>acid</b> precipitation method followed by <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> precipitation/acid treatment method (HApA) demonstrated high quantities of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> compared to lignin extraction/humic acid precipitation method (LHAp) and lignin extraction/humic acid precipitation/acid treatment method (LHApA). Analyses such as Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy (UV-VIS), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Elemental Analysis demonstrated that the quality of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> produced from black liquor was similar to those reported previously. The type of material (e. g. softwood, hardwood and bagasse) used for black liquor production significantly affected the elemental and molecular composition of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> produced. The quality of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> produced was affected by both lignin extraction and acid treatment. However, chemical analyses indicated that the features of the <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> extracted from black liquor correlated with their lignin origin. <b>Humic</b> <b>acids</b> from hardwood and softwood black liquor had a low nitrogen and high sulphur content compared to those extracted from black liquor produced from bagasse material. Although chemical and instrumental analysis of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> was quite reasonable for all <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> produced, LHAp method was favoured for the extraction of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> from pine liquor due to the high quantity of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> produced (low S and ash contents). The <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> extracted by means of HAp method and HApA had a positive effect on plant growth, when extracted from bagasse and Eucalyptus black liquors. <b>Humic</b> <b>acids</b> extracted by HAp from pine liquor had an inhibitory effect on plant growth. A possible process flow for the large-scale production of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> from black liquor was formulated.

Crude DNA extracts (100 microliters from 5 g of soil) were contaminated with <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> at concentrations of 0. 7 to 3. 3 micrograms/microliters, {{depending on the}} type of soil extracted. The coextracted <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> fraction of a clay silt was similar to a commercially available standard <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> mixture, as determined by electrophoretic mobility in agarose gels, UV fluorescence, and inhibition assays with DNA-transforming enzymes. Restriction endonucleases were inhibited at <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations of 0. 5 to 17. 2 micrograms/ml for the commercial product and 0. 8 to 51. 7 micrograms/ml for the coextracted <b>humic</b> <b>acids.</b> DNase I was less susceptible (MIC of standard <b>humic</b> <b>acids,</b> 912 micrograms/ml), and RNase could not be inhibited at all (MIC, > 7. 6 mg/ml). High inhibitory susceptibilities for <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> were observed with Taq polymerase. For three Taq polymerases from different commercial sources, MICs were 0. 08 to 0. 64 micrograms of the standard <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> per ml and 0. 24 to 0. 48 micrograms of the coextracted <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> per ml.

40|$|For many decades, it was {{commonly}} {{believed that}} <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> were formed in soils by the microbial conversion of plant lignins. However, an experiment {{to test whether}} these <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> were formed prior to plant matter reaching the soil was never reported until the late 1980 s (and then only as a side issue), even though <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> were first isolated and reported in 1786.

40|$|Humic {{substances}} are {{the most}} abundant components of the colloidal and the dissolved fraction of natural organic matter (NOM) and they are characterized by a strong binding capacity for both metals and organic pollutants, affecting their mobility and bioavailability. The understanding of the humic acidic character is the first necessary step {{for the study of}} the mechanisms of binding of other positively charged soluble metal species by humic molecules. The present work, which constitutes part of the Ph. D. thesis of Roza Vidali, reports results on the influence of the concentration of <b>humic</b> <b>acids</b> on the binding of protons obtained through both an experimental and a modeling approach. A reference purified peat <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> (PPHA) isolated by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) and a <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> from a Greek soil (GHA) were experimentally studied at various <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations, ranging from 20 to 200 mg L- 1. The proton binding isotherms obtained at different <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations have shown that proton binding is dependent on the concentration of both <b>humic</b> <b>acids.</b> Proton binding experimental data were fitted to the NICA-Donnan model and the model parameter values were calculated for <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations of 20 and >= 100 mg L- 1. The results obtained for the NICA-Donnan parameters at <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations >= 100 mg L- 1 are in excellent agreement with those reported in the literature. However, these model parameter values cannot be used for modeling and predicting cation binding in natural aquatic systems, where <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations are much lower. Two sets of the NICA-Donnan parameters are reported: one for <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations of >= 100 ring L- 1 and one for <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration of 20 mg L- 1. The significance of the parameters values for each concentration level is also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco {{smoke is}} the main factor in the {{etiology}} of lung emphysema. Generally prolonged, substantial exposure is required to develop the disease. <b>Humic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{a major component of}} cigarette smoke that accumulates in smokers' lungs over time and induces tissue damage. Objectives: To investigate whether <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> pre-loading potentiates the development of cigarette smoke-induced lung emphysema in mice and increases IL- 8 release by human monocytes. Methods: C 57 BL/ 6 J mice received <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> or aqueous vehicle by tracheal installation on day 0 and day 7. From day 21 to day 84, the mice were exposed to cigarette smoke or clean air for 5 days/week. Twenty-four hours after the last exposure we determined leukocytes in lung lavage, heart hypertrophy and alveolar wall destruction. Human monocytes were incubated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE), <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> or the combination overnight. Results: <b>Humic</b> <b>acid</b> nor cigarette smoke caused alveolar wall destruction within two months. Interestingly, the combination did induce lung emphysema. <b>Humic</b> <b>acid,</b> cigarette smoke or the combination did not change leukocyte types and numbers in lung lavage fluid, but the combination caused peribronchiolar and perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. <b>Humic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment resulted in a high proportion of alveolar macrophages heavily loaded with intracellular granula. <b>Humic</b> <b>acid</b> also induces the release of IL- 8 from human monocytes and enhances the CSE-induced IL- 8 release. Conclusions: <b>Humic</b> <b>acid</b> deposition in the lungs potentiates the development of cigarette smoke-induced interstitial inflammation and lung emphysema. Moreover, <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> promotes IL- 8 release from human monocytes. Since <b>humic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulates steadily in the lungs of smokers, this may provide an explanation for the natural history on late onset of this disease. The model described here offers a novel way to study emphysema and may direct the search for new therapeutic approaches. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
