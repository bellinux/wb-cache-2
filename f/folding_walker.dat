40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} three types of walkers for elderly people. Four elderly patients participated in the study. The experiments were performed using three walkers: a familiar conventional <b>folding</b> <b>walker,</b> a caster walker and a power-assisted walker. We evaluated walking speed, body acceleration and an electromyogram of the gastrocnemius during use of each walker. The results indicated that walkers should be selected according to the patient’s walking ability. Comparison between Power-assisted walker and parallel bar, the walking speed in power-assited walker is higher than that in parallel bar. Power-assisted walkers are suitable for patients who are used to using a wheelchair...|$|E
50|$|Ayana D’Nay Walker (born September 10, 1979) is an American former women's {{basketball}} player. She {{played for}} the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team from 1998 to 2002. Walker {{was a member of}} gold-medal winning USA Basketball Women’s National Team in 2001 and set a USA single-game record with 19 rebounds in gold-medal game. She was also a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball World University Games Team in 2001. Walker was drafted as the 20th overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft. As a member of the Shock, she won the 2003 WNBA Championship. On July 3, 2005, Walker signed with the Charlotte Sting. After the Sting franchise <b>folded,</b> <b>Walker</b> was drafted by Los Angeles Sparks as the 12th pick in the dispersal draft on January 8, 2007. She returned to Detroit for her final season in 2007.|$|R

40|$|In Escherichia coli K- 12, the {{accumulation}} of arginine is mediated by two distinct periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems, one common to arginine and ornithine (AO system) and one for lysine, arginine, and ornithine (LAO system). Each of these systems includes a specific periplasmic binding protein, the AO-binding protein for the AO system and the LAO-binding protein for the LAO system. The two systems include a common inner membrane transport protein which is able to hydrolyze ATP and also phosphorylate the two periplasmic binding proteins. Previously, a mutant resistant to the toxic effects of canavanine, {{with low levels of}} transport activities and reduced levels of phosphorylation of the two periplasmic binding proteins, was isolated and characterized (R. T. F. Celis, J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 1787 - 1793, 1990). The gene encoding the transport ATPase enzyme (argK) has been cloned and sequenced. The gene possesses an open reading frame with the capacity to encode 268 amino acids (mass of 29. 370 Da). The amino acid sequence of the protein includes two short sequence motifs which constitute a well-defined nucleotide-binding <b>fold</b> (<b>Walker</b> sequences A and B) present in the ATP-binding subunits of many transporters. We report here the isolation of canavanine-sensitive derivatives of the previously characterized mutant. We describe the properties of these suppressor mutations in which the transport of arginine, ornithine, and lysine has been restored. In these mutants, the phosphorylation of the AO- and LAO-binding proteins remains at a low level. This information indicates that whereas hydrolysis of ATP by the transport ATPase is an obligatory requirement for {{the accumulation}} of these amino acids in E. coli K- 12, the phosphorylation of the periplasmic binding protein is not related to the function of the transport system...|$|R
40|$|A {{foldable}} walker includes upstanding legs {{arranged in}} a generally square pattern, {{each of which is}} capped by a fixed joint member and each of which has a slider member slideably disposed on it. Two forward legs are interconnected by two rigid links {{arranged in a}} scissors arrangement with the uppermost end of each link pivotally connected to a fixed joint member and the lowermost end of each link pivotally connected to a slider. Each forward leg is interconnected to its associated rearward leg in the same way. Each pair of rigid links is interconnected to one another by a pivot pin. The linkage enables the width and the depth of the walker to be reduced to a very small space and telescoping legs reduce the height dimension of the <b>walker.</b> Handles are <b>folded</b> when the <b>walker</b> is stored and pivoted into their operable position when the walker is deployed...|$|R
