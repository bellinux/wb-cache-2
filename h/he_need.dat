5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, for which <b>he</b> <b>need</b> only show {{a right to}} possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable. Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E

50|$|Interrogation is an interaction, and, {{even before}} {{considering}} the different attitudes the subject may have, the interrogator {{needs to know}} his own style, strengths and weaknesses. <b>He</b> <b>needs</b> to judge if <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> cultural advice, how to handle language issues, and if <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> specialist help.|$|R

First <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> love and to get the love <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> money.

5|$|Although John was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that <b>he</b> <b>need</b> not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} with Clarke, Billingham {{still could not}} get support for Little Athletics from VAAA; instead, they {{suggested}} he drop the junior competition {{and focus on the}} rapidly expanding senior one. One of the delegates, Jack Frewin, encouraged him to push through with his idea, so he published a notice in the Geelong Advertiser announcing that he needed to start a formation of Little Athletics clubs. There was a meeting of interested parents, and Billingham told them that he thought an organisation should be set up based on his experience from the seniors competitions but <b>he</b> <b>need</b> some parents to help him. On 27 November 1965, six clubs were formed. They were run by parents with Billingham as an overall manager. By the end of the 1965/66 season, more than 200 boys and girls were competing regularly across nine clubs, and more than 500 had tried out at least once. The first Geelong championships were held in March 1966 over the long weekend.|$|E

It is subtly implied that she {{eventually}} supplies what <b>he</b> <b>needs.</b> It is also implied that she is attracted by the [...] "tattoos" [...] on his forearms.|$|R
50|$|His first {{deliberate}} {{murder was}} Sigma, a rookie Ultra-hero.

5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him, and should seek {{to win over the}} voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, as the key to reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided <b>he</b> <b>need</b> not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E

5000|$|... "There's a Hole in My Bucket" [...] (or [...] "...in the Bucket") is a children's song, {{based on}} a {{dialogue}} between two characters, called Henry and Liza, about a leaky bucket. The song describes a deadlock situation: Henry has a leaky bucket, and Liza tells him to repair it. But to fix the leaky bucket, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> straw. To cut the straw, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> an axe. To sharpen the axe, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to wet the sharpening stone. To wet the stone, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> water. However, when Henry asks {{how to get the}} water, Liza's answer is [...] "in a bucket". It is implied that only the leaky bucket is available, which, if it could carry water, would need no repairing in the first place.|$|R
50|$|The God Box is a {{stand-alone}} fantasy novel where the unlikely protagonist finds himself {{the keeper of}} a small wooden box that provides cryptic guidance from the gods. He must stay ahead of a deadly manhunt and play his role in an ancient prophecy. The box, if asked, takes what <b>he</b> does not <b>need</b> and gives him what <b>he</b> does <b>need</b> but what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> and what <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> are usually very different which lends itself to humorous and unexpected situations.|$|R

25|$|According to Latter Day Saint scripture, {{a bishop}} {{in the church}} {{does not need to}} be a high priest nor does <b>he</b> <b>need</b> counselors if he is a Levite and a direct {{descendant}} of Aaron, the brother of Moses. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), apostle Joseph Fielding Smith taught that this provision applied only to the Presiding Bishop of the church and not to bishops of wards.|$|E

Of the nine initial candidates, six were former members of the Alberta Cabinet.

Soon after, he was running for a Missouri state assembly seat {{with the support of the}} local Democratic club against incumbent Representative Leon Jordan. Candidate Paige never gave a speech, and was never taken seriously. Jordan defeated Paige by the margin of 1,870 votes to 382 (83%–17%).|$|E
25|$|There is some {{discussion}} among the poskim (halakhic authorities) regarding whether a firstborn born through caesarean section {{is required to}} observe this fast, given {{that he is not}} obligated in the Redemption of the Firstborn. The Chok Ya'akov (470:2) suggests that such a firstborn may be required to fast, while the Kaf HaChayyim (470:3) rules that <b>he</b> <b>need</b> not fast. To circumvent this question, as well as dispute regarding a firstborn non-Jew who converts to Judaism, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (cited in HaSeder Ha'aruch, Vol. 3, p.44) suggests that such firstborns participate in a seudat mitzvah (see here and here below).|$|E

25|$|Napoleon's {{original}} plan for 16 June {{was based on}} the assumption that the Coalition forces, who had been caught napping, would not attempt a risky forward concentration; and he intended therefore to push an advance guard as far as Gembloux, for the purpose of feeling for and warding off Blücher. To assist this operation the reserve would move at first to Fleurus to reinforce Grouchy, should <b>he</b> <b>need</b> assistance in driving back Blücher's troops; but, once in possession of Sombreffe, Napoleon would swing the reserve westwards and join Ney, who, it was supposed, would have in the meantime mastered Quatre Bras.|$|E

Not only did <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to navigate through difficult terrain, but he had to link up with the Delaware Regiment and Hazen's men. During the maneuver, de Borre asked Sullivan if Hazen's regiment could rejoin his brigade, but the request was denied. De Borre was miffed because this left his brigade with only 350 men.|$|E
