The press was reduced from over 2,000 publications to a few dozen, all censored by the Germans. All pre-war newspapers were closed, and the few that were published during the occupation were new creations under the total control of the Germans. Such a thorough destruction of the press was unprecedented in contemporary history. The only officially available reading matter was the propaganda press that was disseminated by the German occupation administration. Cinemas, now {{under the control of the}} German propaganda machine, saw their programming dominated by Nazi German movies, which were preceded by propaganda newsreels. The few Polish films permitted to be shown (about 20% of the total programming) were edited to eliminate references to Polish national symbols as well as Jewish actors and producers. Several propaganda films were shot in Polish, although no Polish films were shown after 1943. As all profits from Polish cinemas were officially directed toward German war production, attendance was discouraged by the Polish underground; a famous underground slogan declared: [...] "Tylko świnie siedzą w kinie" [...] ("Only pigs attend the movies"). A similar situation faced theaters, which were forbidden by the Germans to produce [...] "serious" [...] spectacles. Indeed, a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages. Hence, theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground. In addition, actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply. Ironically, restrictions on cultural performances were eased in Jewish ghettos, given that the Germans wished to distract ghetto inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their eventual fate.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies whether {{trading in}} social {{networks}} is efficient. I use a field experiment in Odisha India to compare decentralized trade {{of a new}} technology through networks with an approach where demand was revealed via <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales.</b> The findings show that trading in networks results in significant under-adoption when compared to <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales.</b> Specifically, the rate of adoption was 83 % lower when trading occurred only in networks. Using variation across the sample in estimated returns of the technology, I show that the efficiency loss due to networked trade represents 63 % of the expected gains from adoption that were achieved in the <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales.</b> The costs of making links with farmers from different peer groups offer {{an explanation for the}} results. Sub-caste and surname association with suppliers are strong predictors of adoption in networks, but have no effect in <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales.</b> The results suggest that the costs of interacting with suppliers from different social groups make exchange in social networks inefficient...|$|R

By using the real life experiences of our clients at the Footscray Community Legal Centre (Footscray CLC), this report {{examines the}} social and legal impact of <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales.</b> This report finds that disadvantaged consumers are disproportionately affected by damaging and often illegal sales practices. Such practices have social and financial consequences for communities and individuals. The research {{was inspired by the}} specialist “Bring your Bills” Clinics (BYB Clinics) run by Footscray CLC to meet the overwhelming demand for assistance with bills. Community members were invited to bring bills they were concerned about to obtain help from representatives from dispute resolution schemes, 1 financial counsellors, lawyers and other social service providers. A high proportion of people attending BYB Clinics experienced problems as a result of <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales</b> practices by some energy companies. Problems the clients had {{as a result of a}} <b>door-to-door</b> energy <b>sale</b> included: 	confusion as to whether they had switched companies (and thus why they had received bills from a company that was not their own); 	debts incurred and legal action taken by energy companies trying to recover debts; and 	other disputes involving termination of contracts made through <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales.</b> For many Australians and particularly those who have recently arrived in the country with a refugee background, the process of selecting energy retailers can be confusing and financially stressful.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} the role of {{door-to-door}} selling in Victoria’s evolving retail energy market, the consumer detriment associated with it, and the policy approaches – both existing and potential – that may minimise detriment without compromising energy market objectives Since the introduction of Full Retail Contestability to Victoria’s retail energy market a decade ago, unsolicited door-to-door energy selling has emerged and expanded, playing {{a major role in}} the transformation of the market. Today, Victoria’s retail energy market has the highest switching rate of any in the world. Nearly all retailers operating in Victoria use door-to-door selling to drive this switching activity, and it is estimated that <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales</b> account for just over half of all customer switching. As energy door-to-door selling has grown, however, so too has concern about the ways in which this sales channel can cause consumers – particularly vulnerable consumers – financial and non-financial detriment. In terms of non-financial detriment, the time loss and the annoyance that results when uninterested consumers are interrupted by a <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales</b> call is often fairly minor, but it is also pervasive. This probably accounts, in large part, for the negative community perceptions of door-to-door selling. Should a sales agent conduct themselves poorly, or where the consumer is vulnerable, this non-financial detriment can be much greater. For consumers who agree to switch at the door, the aim is typically to save money. However, there is real cause for doubt that most consumers make a saving when they accept a <b>door-to-door</b> <b>sales</b> offer. In the UK, a 2008 study found that just under half of those switching at the door were actually made financially worse off by the change. This may be because door-to-door selling creates a ‘situational monopoly’: an environment in which the consumer is reliant on the information provided by only one supplier and cannot ‘shop around’ to find the best deal. Where the product or service offered involves complex terms and conditions, optimal decision-making may be even less likely...|$|R
