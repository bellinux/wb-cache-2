Still less popular were the poems Riley authored in his later years; most were to commemorate <b>important</b> <b>events</b> of American history and to eulogize the dead.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the <b>important</b> <b>events</b> {{of the story}} occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small {{polygonal}} creatures appear {{in the margins of}} the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E

5|$|Anniversaries of {{the most}} <b>important</b> <b>events</b> of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, {{including}} in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at Putna. This doubled as a protest against Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem Doina (written {{in the style of}} traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people. His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most <b>important</b> <b>events,</b> marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E

5|$|In 1974–75, the {{reception}} and meeting rooms were further upgraded with {{extensive use of}} imported goods from the West. However, over time, Altes Stadthaus became less important to the GDR government. <b>Important</b> <b>events,</b> celebrations and ceremonies {{took place in the}} Rotes Rathaus, the Palace of the Republic or the State Council Building. The historical high point {{in the use of the}} building under the GDR came in its final phase, when the only freely elected government of East Germany, under Lothar de Maizière relocated there. The provisions of the agreement on German reunification were therefore negotiated there.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{folk songs}} include ballads, lyrical songs, lullabies and children's songs, {{seasonal}} songs based around holidays such as Christmas, life-cycle songs that celebrate weddings, baptisms and other <b>important</b> <b>events,</b> dance songs, cattle calls and occupational songs, tied to professions such as fishermen, shepherds and soldiers. Ballads (canti epico-lirici) and lyric songs (canti lirico-monostrofici) are two important categories. Ballads are {{most common in}} northern Italy, while lyric songs prevail further south. Ballads are {{closely tied to the}} English form, with some British ballads existing in exact correspondence with an Italian song. Other Italian ballads are more closely based on French models. Lyric songs are a diverse category that consist of lullabies, serenades and work songs, and are frequently improvised though based on a traditional repertoire.|$|E
