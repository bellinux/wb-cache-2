40|$|AbstractIntroduction Treacher Collins syndrome, or mandibulofacial dysostosis, is a {{hereditary}} {{disorder and}} is manifested by craniofacial malformations. The incidence {{is close to}} one case per 40, 000 live births, without relation to gender or race. The <b>infant</b> <b>carrier</b> may present neurological development. This rare syndrome requires documentation of its main clinical and kinetic-functional consequences. Objectives The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the clinical and kinetic-functional findings for a child who has Treacher Collins syndrome and receives treatment in the Physiotherapy Department at the Pestalozzi Association in Goiania, and to present the evolution of motor function and psychomotor development during rehabilitation. Materials and methods The information was obtained through interviews with the mother, and evaluation of the child at nine and eleven months old, using the infant neurological assessment sheet, Inventory Operational Portage (IPO) and Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Results The GMFM showed that the child had a higher trend in the items for lying and rolling, sitting, crawling and kneeling and minor changes in the items for standing, walking, running and jumping. In the IPO, the child progressed in all of the assessed areas: infant stimulation, motor development, socialization, self-care, cognition and language. Conclusion The child showed progress in psychomotor development in accordance with that expected for their age and initial assessment. It is suggested that children with this syndrome be treated by multidisciplinary teams in the first years of life, preventing delays and deviations in development...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of newborn screening (NBS) is increasing {{the generation of}} incidental results, notably carrier results. Although carrier status is generally understood to be clinically benign, concerns persist that parents may misunderstand its meaning, with deleterious effects on children and their families. Expansion of the NBS panel in Ontario, Canada in 2006 to include sickle cell disorders {{drew attention to the}} policy challenge of incidental carrier results. We conducted a study of consumer and provider attitudes to inform policy on disclosure. In this paper, we report the results of (i) qualitative interviews with health-care providers, advocates and parents of carrier infants and (ii) focus groups with new parents and individuals active with the sickle cell community. Lay and provider participants generally believed that carrier results were clinically insignificant. However, some uncertainty persisted among lay consumers in the form of conjecture or doubt. In addition, consumers and advocates who were most informed about the disease articulated insistent yet dissonant claims of clinical significance. Meanwhile, providers referenced research knowledge to offer an equivocal assessment of the possibility and significance of clinically symptomatic carrier status. We conclude that many interpretations of carrier status are in circulation, failing to fit neatly into the categories of ‘clinically significant' or ‘benign. ' This creates challenges for communicating clearly with parents – challenges exacerbated by inconsistent messages from screening programs regarding the significance of sickle cell carrier status. Disclosure policy related to incidentally generated <b>infant</b> <b>carrier</b> results needs to account for these complex realities...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} acute {{alterations}} of anterior infant carriage systems {{on the ground}} reaction force experienced during over ground walking. Background: Previous research has identified the alterations in posture and gait {{associated with an increased}} anterior load (external or internal); however the forces applied to the system due to the altered posture during over ground walking have not been established. Method: Thirteen mixed gender participants completed forty-five over ground walking trials at a self-selected pace under three loaded conditions (unloaded, semi-structured carrier 9. 9 kg and structured carrier 9. 9 kg). Each trial consisted of a fifteen metre walkway, centred around a piezoelectric force platform sampling at 1200 Hz. Differences were assessed between loaded and unloaded conditions and across carriers using paired samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Additional load increased all ground reaction force parameters; however, the magnitude of force changes was influenced by carrier structure. The structured carrier displayed increased force magnitudes, a reduction in the time to vertical maximum heel contact and an increased duration of the flat foot phase in walking gait. Conclusion: Evidence suggest that the acute application of anterior <b>infant</b> <b>carriers</b> alters both kinetic and temporal measures of walking gait. Importantly these changes appear to be governed not solely by the additional mass but also by the structure of the carrier. Application: These findings indicate carrier structure should be considered by the wearer and may be used to inform policy in the recommendation of anterior infant carriage systems use by caregivers...|$|R

However, the mode of C. difficile carriage in infants remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated longitudinal changes in carriage rates, counts, and strain types of toxigenic C. difficile in infants. Stools collected from 111 healthy infants in Belgium periodically from birth until the age of 6 months were examined by quantitative PCR targeting 16 S rRNA and toxin genes. Toxigenic C. difficile was detected in 18 of 111 infants (16 %) in the period up to the age of 6 months. The carriage rate of toxigenic C. difficile remained below 5 % until the age of 3 months. The carriage rate increased to 13 % 1 week after weaning (average age, 143 days) and reached 16 % at the age of 6 months. Counts of toxigenic C. difficile bacteria ranged from 10 4 to 10 8 cells/g of stool. Notably, two infants retained > 10 8 cells/g of stool for at least several weeks. Average counts in the 18 infants hovered around 10 7 cells/g of stool from the age of 3 days until the age of 6 months, showing no age-related trend. Genotyping of toxigenic C. difficile isolates from the 18 infants revealed that 11 infants each retained a particular monophyletic strain for at least a month. The genotype most frequently identified was the same as that frequently identified in symptomatic adult CDI patients. Thus, toxigenic C. difficile strains-potential causes of CDI in adults-colonized the infants' intestines. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To pilot data {{collection}} instruments {{and to make}} a preliminary estimate of the level of incorrect use of car seat belts and child restraints in Fife, Scotland. DESIGN: Cross sectional survey of cars containing adults and children at a number of public sites across Fife in 1995 to assess use of car occupant restraints. Trained road safety officers assessed whether seat restraints were appropriate for the age of the passengers and whether restraints were used correctly. These assessments were based on standards published by the Child Accident Prevention Trust. PARTICIPANTS: The survey gathered data from 596 occupants in 180 cars: 327 adults and 269 children. Ten per cent of drivers who were approached refused to participate. Car occupant restraint was assessed in 180 drivers, 151 front seat passengers, and 265 rear seat passengers. MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty one occupants wore seat belts, 68 were restrained by a seat belt and booster cushion, 63 in toddler seats, 25 in two way seats, and 18 in rear facing <b>infant</b> <b>carriers.</b> Ninety seven per cent of drivers, 95 % of front seat passengers, and 77 % of rear seat passengers were restrained. However, in 98 (52 %) vehicles at least one passenger was restrained by a device that was used incorrectly. Seven per cent of adults and 28 % of children were secured incorrectly. The commonest errors were loose seat belts and restraint devices not adequately secured to the seat. Rates of incorrect use were highest in child seat restraints, reaching 60 % with two way seats and 44 % with rear facing infant seats. CONCLUSIONS: The incorrect use of car occupant restraints is an under-recognised problem, both by health professionals, and the general public. Incorrect use has been shown to reduce the effectiveness of restraints, can itself result in injury, and is likely to be an important factor in child passenger injuries. The correct use of car seat restraints merits greater attention in strategies aiming to reduce road traffic casualties. Areas of intervention that could be considered include raising public awareness of this problem, improving information and instruction given to those who purchase child restraints, and encouraging increased collaboration between manufacturers of cars and child restraints, in considering safety issues...|$|R

40|$|Background: Newborn {{screening}} (NBS) enables early treatment, {{and some}} {{consider it a}} natural vehicle for genetic screening. Bioethicists argue for caution since families of <b>infants</b> with <b>carrier</b> status can develop psychosocial complications. This paper describes the methods and feasibility of Wisconsin’s statewide project for quality improvement of communication and psychosocial outcomes after NBS. Methods: When NBS identifies carrier status for cystic fibrosis or sickle cell, we contact primary care providers (PCPs), answer questions, and invite them to rehearse informing the parents. Three months later, we telephone the parents, assess knowledge and psychosocial outcomes, provide counseling, and assist with self-referral to further resources. Afterward, evaluation surveys are provided to the parents, to be returned anonymously. Results: Birthing facilities provided accurate PCP names for 73 % of 817 infants meeting inclusion criteria; we identified PCPs for 21 % more. We reached 47. 3 % of PCPs in time to invite a rehearsal; 60 % of these accepted. We successfully called 50. 2 % of eligible parents; 61 % recalled a PCP explanation, and 48. 5 % evaluated the explanation favorably. Evaluations by parents with limited health literacy were less favorable. Conclusion: It is feasible to follow parents for psychosocial outcomes after NBS. Preliminary data about communication is mixed, but further data will describe psychosocial outcomes and investigate outcomes’ associations with communication...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In this study, we {{aimed to}} put forth the {{clinical}} consequences of rearrangement between chromosomes 5 and 7 observed in one fetus, one newborn infant (siblings) and their parents. Materials and Methods: We performed chromosomal analysis in one fetus, one newborn (siblings) and their parents, applying standard protocols to fetal blood, amniotic fluid and peripheral blood samples. We performed both prenatal and postnatal karyotyping in the newborn infant. Results: We described rearrangements related to chromosomes 5 and 7 in these individuals. We found that the curetted fetus and newborn <b>infant</b> were <b>carriers</b> of unbalanced and balanced rearrangements, respectively. We {{also found that the}} mother was a carrier of derivative chromosome 5 with [46,XX,der(5) t(5 : 7) (p 15 p 11) ] karyotype. The prenatal and postnatal karyotypes of the newborn infant confirmed an apparently identical nonreciprocal translocation between chromosomes 5 and 7, the same rearrangement as we found in the mother. We also found that the curetted fetus was carrier of derivative chromosome 5, [46,XY,der(5) t(5 : 7) (p 15 p 11) mat]. The der(5) contained a complete short arm of chromosome 7. Otherwise both chromosomes 7 appeared normal. The fetus had malformations consistent with trisomy 7 p as a result of familial derivative 5. However, the lung findings have not been reported before.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about {{neonatal}} Staphylococcus aureus carriage. Sites and clinical outcomes of S. aureus colonization during {{the first month of}} life were evaluated in this study. Methods: A cohort of 279 infants born at term to 277 mothers was included. Maternal S. aureus colonization status was examined before labor. Newborns were screened for nasal, auricular, umbilical, and rectal colonization, one to three times within 100 Â h after birth, and <b>infants</b> of <b>carrier</b> mothers were re-screened at 1 month. Medical data were recorded from the medical charts at discharge and at the 1 -month follow-up interview. Results: Overall 43 out of 279 (15. 4 %) infants acquired S. aureus within the first days of life. The only two predictors of S. aureus carriage in the postnatal period were maternal S. aureus carriage (odds ratio 7. 905, 95 % confidence interval 3. 182 â 19. 638) and maternal antibiotic treatment during labor (odds ratio 0. 121, 95 % confidence interval 0. 016 â 0. 949). Among colonized children, the nose (56 %) and rectum (40 %) were more frequently colonized, while ear (26 %) and umbilicus (16 %) colonization were less common. Co-colonization at two sites was rare (4 %), but always predicted carriage at 1 month of age. Maternal and neonatal characteristics, including neonatal outcomes, were similar between S. aureus <b>carrier</b> and non-carrier <b>infants</b> during the first month of life. Conclusions: Maternal carriage is the major predictor of neonatal S. aureus carriage. The nose and rectum are the main sites of neonatal carriage.

The first prediction, that males {{would be more likely to}} successfully copulate while carrying infants than while not carrying infants, was not supported in either species. In common marmosets, males were less likely to copulate while carrying infants. This relation may reflect the lower activity levels and increased vigilance required by those individuals transporting infants. The second prediction, that the overall percentage of time that males spent carrying infants would be related to overall frequency of copulations during fertile periods, was also not supported for either species. The third prediction was that, if females selected mates relative to their infant-care ‘performance’, males should be more solicitous of the breeding female's efforts to relinquish the <b>infant</b> to another <b>carrier</b> than to the efforts of other group members.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{etiology}} of germinal matrix hemorrhage–intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) is multifactorial {{and the role}} of genetic polymorphisms is unclear. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate prothrombotic genetic mutations as independent risk factors for the development of all grades of GMH-IVH in very-low-birth-weight infants. Methods—The presence of both factor V Leiden and prothrombin gain-of-function gene mutations were prospectively assessed in 106 very-low-birth-weight infants. Infants with GMH-IVH were compared to those without GMH-IVH according to genetic and clinical characteristics. Results—Twenty-two out of 106 infants had GMH-IVH develop (20. 7 %). Infants with GMH-IVH had significantly lower gestational ages and birth weights. In the multivariate Poisson regression model, the prevalence of GMH-IVH appeared to be inversely related to gestational age, with a risk ratio of 0. 83 (95 % CI, 0. 72 – 0. 97; P 0. 02) per week. Risk ratio of GMH-IVH for carriers of either prothrombotic mutation was 2. 65 (95 % CI, 1. 23 – 5. 72; P 0. 01), similar to the risk ratio associated with need for resuscitation at birth (2. 30; 95 % CI, 1. 02 – 5. 18; P 0. 04).

40|$|Abstract Background The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of liver disease and liver cancer worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Following acute HBV infection, 1 - 5 % of infected healthy adults and up to 90 % of infected <b>infants</b> become chronic <b>carriers</b> and have an increased risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between the reduction in acute hepatitis B incidence and the universal vaccination programme in preadolescents in Catalonia (Spain), taking population changes into account, and to construct a model to forecast the future incidence of cases that permits the best preventive strategy to be adopted. Methods Reported acute hepatitis B incidence in Catalonia according to age, gender, vaccination coverage, percentage of immigrants and the year of report of cases was analysed. A statistical analysis was made using three models: generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson or negative binomial distribution and a generalized additive model (GAM). Results The higher the vaccination coverage, the lower the reported incidence of hepatitis B (p [*] 70 %, the reduction in incidence was 2 -fold higher than in groups with a coverage Conclusions The results of the adjusted models in this study confirm that the global incidence of hepatitis B has declined in Catalonia after the introduction of the universal preadolescent vaccination programme, but the incidence increased in male immigrants of working age. Given the potential severity of hepatitis B for the health of individuals and for the community, universal vaccination programmes should continue and programmes in risk groups, especially immigrants, should be strengthened. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Universal newborn {{screening}} for {{early detection of}} children affected by sickle cell disorders and cystic fibrosis is currently being implemented across England. Parents of <b>infants</b> identified as <b>carriers</b> of these disorders must also be informed of their baby's result. However {{there is a lack}} of evidence for most effective practice internationally when doing so. This study describes current or proposed models for imparting this information in practice and explores associated challenges for policy. Methods Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with Child Health Coordinators from all English Health Regions. Results Diverse methods for imparting carrier results, both within and between regions, and within and between conditions, were being implemented or planned. Models ranged from result by letter to in-person communication during a home visit. Non-specialists were considered the best placed professionals to give results and a similar approach for both conditions was emphasised. While national guidance has influenced choice of models, other factors contributed such as existing service structures and lack of funding. Challenges included uncertainty about guidance specifying face to face notification; how best to balance allaying parental anxiety by using familiar non-specialist health professionals with concerns about practitioner competence; and extent of information parents should be given. Inadequate consideration of resource and service workload was seen as the main policy obstacle. Clarification of existing guidance; more specific protocols to ensure consistent countrywide practice; integration of the two programmes; and 'normalising' carrier status were suggested as improvements. Conclusion Differing models for communicating carrier results raise concerns about equity and clinical governance. However, this variation provides opportunity for evaluation. Timely and more detailed guidance on protocols with clarification of existing recommendations is needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the pregnancy-related {{cardiovascular}} risk in LQT 1 patients. BackgroundOnly 1 study addressed this issue in genotyped patients and reported that the highest risk is for LQT 2 patients. MethodsThis case-control study, performed in a cohort of patients from 22 families affected by LQT 1 and all sharing the common KCNQ 1 -A 341 V mutation, involved 36 mutation carriers and 24 of their unaffected sisters for a total of 182 pregnancies. ResultsThere were 3 (2. 6 %) cardiac events (2 cardiac arrests) in the 115 LQT 1 pregnancies. Because they occurred only among the 27 mothers with previous symptoms, all off-therapy, the risk for symptomatic patients is 11 %, but decreases to 0 in symptomatic patients treated with beta-blockers. Carriers and control subjects did not differ for the incidence of miscarriage (10 % vs. 15 %). Cesarean sections (C-sections), elective or owing to fetal distress, were performed more often in carriers than in non-carriers (27 % vs. 14 %). Beta-blocker therapy did not influence the prevalence of fetal distress. Among the <b>infants</b> born to <b>carriers,</b> all those with fetal distress were carriers of the A 341 V mutation (10 of 10, 100 %). Among the offspring of the carriers, 48 of 92 (52 %) were mutation carriers, and of those, 15 % died suddenly at age 14 ± 6 years. ConclusionsWomen affected by the common KCNQ 1 -A 341 V mutation are at low risk for cardiac events during pregnancy and without excess risk of miscarriage; their infants delivered by C-section because of fetal distress are extremely likely to also be mutation carriers. Beta-blockers remain recommended. These conclusions likely apply to most LQT 1 patients...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin 1 protein (MTM 1) are {{usually associated with}} severe neonatal X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM). However, mutations in MTM 1 have also been recognized as the underlying cause of "atypical" forms of XLMTM in newborn boys, female <b>infants,</b> female manifesting <b>carriers</b> and adult men. We reviewed systematically the biopsies of a cohort of patients with an unclassified form of centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and identified four patients presenting a peculiar histological alteration in some muscle fibers that resembled a necklace ("necklace fibers"). We analyzed further the clinical and morphological features and performed a screening of the genes involved in CNM. Muscle biopsies in all four patients demonstrated 4 - 20 % of fibers with internalized nuclei aligned in a basophilic ring (necklace) at 3 microm beneath the sarcolemma. Ultrastructurally, such necklaces consisted of myofibrils of smaller diameter, in oblique orientation, surrounded by mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum and glycogen granules. In the four patients (three women and one man), myopathy developed in early childhood but was slowly progressive. All had mutations in the MTM 1 gene. Two mutations have previously been reported (p. E 404 K and p. R 241 Q), while two are novel; a c. 205 _ 206 delinsAACT frameshift change in exon 4 and a c. 1234 A>G mutation in exon 11 leading to an abnormal splicing and the deletion of nine amino acids in the catalytic domain of MTM 1. Necklace fibers were seen neither in DNM 2 - or BIN 1 -related CNM nor in males with classical XLMTM. The presence of necklace fibers is useful as a marker to direct genetic analysis to MTM 1 in CNM. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{arterial}} calcification of infancy (GACI) is {{a life-threatening}} disorder in young infants. Cardiovascular symptoms are usually apparent {{within the first}} month of life. The symptoms are caused by calcification of large and medium-sized arteries, including the aorta, coronary arteries, and renal arteries. Most of the patients die by 6 months of age because of heart failure. Recently, homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations for the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP 1) gene were reported as causative for the disorder. ENPP 1 regulates extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a major inhibitor of extracellular matrix calcification. A newborn was diagnosed with GACI. The infant {{died at the age of}} 7 weeks of cardiac failure and the parents were referred to Molecular Biology and Cytogenetic lab for further workup. Cytogenetics analysis was performed on the parents, which showed normal karyotypes and mutational analysis for the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP 1) gene was also performed. The mutational analysis showed that both father and mother of the deceased <b>infant</b> were heterozygous <b>carriers</b> of the mutation c. 749 C>T (p. P 250 L) in exon 7 of ENPP 1 and it was likely, that the deceased child carried the same mutation homozygous on both alleles and died of GACI resulting from this ENPP 1 mutation. The couple was counseled and monitored for the second pregnancy. Amniocentesis was performed at 15 weeks of gestation for mutational analysis of the same gene in the second pregnancy. The analysis was negative for the parental mutations. One month after the birth of a healthy infant, peripheral blood was collected from the baby and sent for reconfirmation. The results again were negative for the mutation and the baby was on 6 months follow up and no major symptoms were seen. The parents of the child benefited enormously by learning about the disease much in advance and also its risk of recurrence. The main aim of this study is to emphasize on two aspects: (i) the importance of modern molecular techniques in diagnosis such a syndrome and (2) the difficulties faced by the physician to provide appropriate diagnosis and the adequate genetic counseling to the family without molecular facilities...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Health {{care costs}} {{are on the}} rise in Australia and {{rational}} decisions are necessary to prioritise interventions for the allocation of limited resources. As new vaccines are being introduced, budgetary allocations for immunisation are increasing. Economic analyses are useful in prioritising immunisation choices by determining the cost-effectiveness of various interventions. Cost-effectiveness studies on immunisation are scarce and needs updating due to changes in medical practice and vaccination costs in Australia. This thesis describes cost-effectiveness of two selected immunisation interventions in Australia: influenza and hepatitis B. The cost-effectiveness of reducing the influenza vaccination age threshold to 50 from the current 65 was analysed first. Next, the cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B infant vaccination, various high-risk vaccination strategies, their marginal costs and benefits, and cost-effectiveness of Indigenous hepatitis B infant vaccination were investigated. Methods: This study is a part of ACE-Prevention project and uses its study protocol: a 3 % discount rate, health care perspective, 2003 prices and health benefits measured in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). A decision tree model was built for influenza to compare universal influenza vaccination of people 50 - 64 years to current policy of vaccinating people over 65. Two scenario analyses were used as estimations of influenza like illness (ILI), but the primary input for the model was deemed unreliable. The results were compared to a previous study to verify the effect of model structure, assumptions on costs, vaccine uptake and vaccine efficacy using deterministic sensitivity analyses. A micro-simulation model was used to represent the natural history of hepatitis B. The model used data inputs from several Asian countries which was then fitted to Australian data. The cost- effectiveness of universal infant vaccination and targeted high-risk vaccination strategies were measured in comparison to no vaccination. The marginal costs and benefits of these strategies over each other were estimated in an expansion pathway analysis and were compared to current practice. The cost-effectiveness of Indigenous hepatitis B infant immunisation strategies in comparison to no vaccination were estimated separately. Results: Due to the absence of reliable data, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of reducing the influenza vaccination age threshold to 50 years from the current age of 65 ranged from AU$ 6, 000 to AU$ 135, 000 /DALYs, depending on input parameter assumptions used. Universal infant hepatitis B vaccination compared to no vaccination was cost-effective at the population level (ICER = $ 609 / DALY). Immunisation strategies that target high-risk infants are cost saving and produce health gains compared to no vaccination. These analyses included targeted vaccination of infants whose mothers were born in high endemic countries; maternal screening, vaccination and immunoglobulin for infants of hepatitis B carrier mothers born in high endemic countries and/or carrier mothers in the general population. The results are valid at discount rates of 0 %, 3 % and 5 %. The current hepatitis B vaccination practice of universal infant vaccination, and immunoglobulin and vaccination of infants born to hepatitis B carrier mothers in the general population compared to no vaccination is cost-effective (ICER=$ 7, 500 /DALY) as it produces large health gains at a net cost of AU$ 11 million a year. The current practice in the general population compared to the most cost-effective high-risk strategy is not cost-effective. Maternal screening, vaccination and immunoglobulin to <b>infants</b> born to <b>carrier</b> mothers in the general population saves costs with the least health loss and could be an alternative to current practice. All immunisation strategies in the Indigenous population produce health gains and a net cost saving compared to no vaccination. The current vaccination strategy produces maximum health gains (800 DALYs) and maximum net cost savings (AU$ 8 million) compared to other strategies. Implications: Data inadequacy was a challenge in constructing models to conduct cost-effectiveness studies that accurately reflect the natural history of the disease. In the absence of good data the validity of results obtained through the models depended upon the validity of assumptions and the applicability of data used in the situation at hand. The large uncertainty in model parameter inputs and the results thus obtained needed to be analysed critically. The influenza model structure, parameter assumptions and data limitations introduced huge uncertainty which is not sufficiently accounted for in existing cost-effectiveness studies. There is insufficient evidence to reliably study the cost-effectiveness of universal influenza vaccination for people aged 50 to 64. The policy implication {{is that there is a}} need to collect better data on ILI (or influenza) incidence to enable a reliable cost-effectiveness study. Australia has adopted an expensive but maximum health gain hepatitis B vaccination strategy in the general population. An alternative to the current strategy is to screen pregnant women for hepatitis B carrier state and immunise <b>infants</b> born to <b>carrier</b> mothers with vaccine and immunoglobulin. However, this alternative strategy may not be politically acceptable. The current Indigenous hepatitis B vaccination strategy is optimal and deserves continuation. The economic analysis of other existing immunisation programs is warranted...|$|R
