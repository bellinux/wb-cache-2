60|$|Two of the savages shook {{themselves}} free, and bounded {{to their}} feet nimbly as cats, but Legget and the other redskin became engaged in a terrific combat.

Legget's fury must have been awful, to judge from his hoarse screams; the Indians' fear maddening, as could be told by their shrieks. The two savages ran wildly about the combatants, one trying to level a rifle, the other to get in a blow with a tomahawk.

Never, willingly, had he touched a snake. Why, he could not say, for he would admit fear of nothing; nor was it fear, but rather an inherent repulsion bequeathed to him by many generations of civilized ancestors, and back of them, perhaps, by countless myriads of such as Teeka, in the breasts of each of which had lurked the same nameless terror of the slimy reptile.|$|E
60|$|Instantly the horny parrot-like beak, {{the size}} of a man's fist, reared itself from among the folds of the body and struck the boat a violent blow, while a pair of saucer-like eyes, fully four inches in diameter, opened and glared ferociously. This was terrifying enough, but when, a moment later, two {{tremendous}} arms shot out from the body near the eyes, flung themselves around the boat and held on tight, a yell of fear escaped from several of the men, and with good reason, for if the innumerable suckers on those slimy arms once fairly attached themselves to the boat {{there seemed to be no}} chance of escape from the <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace.</b> In that moment of danger Little Stubbs proved himself equal to the occasion. With the hatchet he deftly severed the two limbs as they lay over the gunwale of the boat, and the monster, without cry or sign of pain, fell back into the sea, and moved off, ejecting such a quantity of inky fluid, as it went, that the water was darkened for two or three hundred yards around.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life our little hero was called on to face death voluntarily.

There was no need to hold on to her. In the agony of fear the poor child clasped the boy in a <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace.</b> They were whirled violently round and hurled against a rock. Robin caught it with one hand, but it was {{instantly}} torn from his grasp. The waters overwhelmed them, and again sent them violently towards the bank. This time Robin caught a rock with both hands and held on. Slowly, while almost choked with the water that splashed up into his face, he worked his right knee into a crevice, then made a wild grasp with the left hand at a higher projection of the rock. At the same moment his left foot struck the bottom. Another effort and he was out of danger, but it was several minutes ere he succeeded in dragging Madge from the hissing water of the shallows to the green sward above, and after this was accomplished he found it almost impossible to tear himself from the grasp of the now unconscious girl.|$|E

She would have {{questioned}} him further, {{but now he}} was approaching the Tor-o-don and the latter was screaming and growling so loudly as to drown the sound of her voice. And then it did what the strange creature had said that it would do--it released its hold upon her hair as it prepared to charge. Charge it did and in those close quarters there was no room to fence for openings. Instantly the two beasts locked in <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace,</b> each seeking the other's throat. Pan-at-lee watched, taking no advantage of the opportunity to escape which their preoccupation gave her. She watched and waited, for into her savage little brain had come the resolve to pin her faith to this strange creature who had unlocked her heart with those four words--"I am Om-at's friend!" [...] And so she waited, with drawn knife, the opportunity to do her bit in the vanquishing of the Tor-o-don. That the newcomer could do it unaided she well knew to be beyond the realms of possibility, for she knew well the prowess of the beastlike man with whom it fought. There were not many of them in Pal-ul-don, but what few there were were a terror to the women of the Waz-don and the Ho-don, for the old Tor-o-don bulls roamed the mountains and the valleys of Pal-ul-don between rutting seasons and woe betide the women who fell in their paths.|$|E
60|$|Possibly my {{affection for}} spiders {{is due in}} a great measure to the {{compassion}} I have always felt for them. Pity, 'tis said, is akin to love; and who can help experiencing that tender emotion that considers the heavy affliction nature has laid on the spiders in compensation for the paltry drop of venom with which she, unasked, endowed them! And here, of course, I am alluding to the wasps. These insects, with a refinement of cruelty, prefer not to kill their victims outright, but merely maim them, then house them in cells where the grubs can vivisect them at leisure. This {{is one of those}} revolting facts the fastidious soul cannot escape from in warm climates; for in and out of open windows and doors, all day long, all the summer through, comes the busy beautiful mason-wasp. A long body, wonderfully slim at the waist, bright yellow legs and thorax, and a dark crimson abdomen,--what object can be prettier to look at? But in her life this wasp is not beautiful. At home in summer they were the pests of my life, for nothing would serve to keep them out. One day, while we were seated at dinner, a clay nest, which a wasp had succeeded in completing unobserved, detached itself from the ceiling and fell with a crash on to the table, where it was shattered to pieces, scattering a shower of green half-living spiders round it. I shall never forget the feeling of intense repugnance I experienced at the sight, coupled with detestation of the pretty but cruel little architect. There is, amongst our wasps, even a more accomplished spider-scourge than the mason-wasp, and I will here give a brief account of its habits. On the grassy pampas, dry bare spots of soil are resorted to by a class of spiders that either make or take little holes in the ground to reside in, and from which they rush forth to seize their prey. They also frequently sit inside their dens and patiently wait there for the intrusion of some bungling insect. Now, in summer, to a dry spot of ground like this, comes a small wasp, scarcely longer than a blue-bottle fly, body and wings of a deep shining purplish blue colour, with only a white mark like a collar on the thorax. It flirts its blue wings, hurrying about here and there, and is extremely active, and of a slender graceful figure--the type of an assassin. It visits and explores every crack and hole in the ground, and, if you watch it attentively, you will at length see it, on arriving at a hole, give a little start backwards. It knows that a spider lies concealed within. Presently, having apparently matured a plan of attack, it disappears into the hole and remains there for some time. Then, just when you are beginning to think that the little blue explorer has been trapped, out it rushes, flying in terror, apparently, from the spider who issues close behind in hot pursuit; but, before they are three inches away from the hole, quick as lightning the wasp turns on its follower, and the two become locked together in a <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace.</b> Looking like one insect, they spin rapidly round for a few moments, then up springs the wasp--victorious. The wretched victim is not dead; its legs move a little, but its soft body is paralyzed, and lies collapsed, flabby, and powerless as a stranded jellyfish. And this is the invariable result of every such conflict. In other classes of beings, even the weakest hunted thing occasionally succeeds in inflicting pain on its persecutor, and the small trembling mouse, unable to save itself, can sometimes make the cat shriek with paiu; but there is no weak spot in the wasp's armour, no fatal error of judgment, not even an accident, ever to save the wretched victim from its fate. And now comes the most iniquitous part of the proceeding. When the wasp has sufficiently rested after the struggle, it deliberately drags the disabled spider back into its own hole, and, having packed it away at the extremity, lays an egg alongside of it, then, coming out again, gathers dust and rubbish with which it fills up and obliterates the hole; and, having thus concluded its Machiavellian task, it flies cheerfully off in quest of another victim.|$|E

But his influence on programming is more pervasive than any glossary can possibly indicate. The precious gift that this Turing Award acknowledges is Dijkstra's style: his approach to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; his eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into correctness; and his illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of program design.

50|$|The film {{begins on}} a summer's day in Northern Canada 70 {{million years ago}} and herd of Edmontosaurus and a spiky Edmontonia are feeding on the lush {{vegetation}} that grows all around them. Scar, a young male Edmontosaurus, enjoys {{his life in the}} Arctic forests with his extended family, comes across a young immature male Troodon named Patch, who has been feasting on baby Edmontosaurus all summer, but now has to chase smaller, more difficult prey as the baby Edmontosaurus are too large to hunt. He chases after an Alphadon, but another clawed foot grabs the fleeing mammal; that of another Troodon, and Patch is becoming impatient. The plentiful food for Scar is ending as well, as the dark, cold Arctic winter is approaching. When night falls for the first time, Scar loses sign of the herd and spots a dark shape, which {{turns out to be a}} Gorgosaurus, which slices his face as he narrowly dodges the killer blow. Later, a herd of Pachyrhinosaurus arrives and starts to compete for the dwindling food supply, further pressuring the herd's search for food. Scar finds the Edmontonia feasting on insect larvae from a fallen tree branch and tries his luck with mixed success. The sun sets and the Pachyrhinosaur herd moves on somewhere else in search of food. The winter's approach causes the herbivores to start risking their safety and a young female Edmontosaurus gets killed by the Gorgosaurus as she wanders too far from the herd. The next day, the Edmontosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus herds move south for the winter, while Edmontonia stays behind. She's way too heavy and her armoured body has been storing fat to last her through the lean months. Meanwhile, Patch and the Troodons are feasting on the dead female Edmontosaurus when the Gorgosaurus appears. The tyrannosaur scares the Troodons away, but is wounded in the fight, and Patch is frustrated and must work harder to find prey. Far away, the dinosaur herd is moving on, until Scar sees a dark shadows, which turns out to be a flock of scavenging Quetzalcoatlus, the biggest pterosaurs ever, which feed on the dying herd members that could not keep pace. The blizzard arrives and Scar collapses, but an older male arrives and helps him to keep moving through the blizzard. They continue on walking and don't realize they are heading into a trap; the ground breaks apart, meaning that they walked onto a frozen sea inlet. As the herd struggles to escape the icy water, several get dragged under by mosasaurs known as Prognathodon. Scar has never swum before, but he is pushed in and starts to swim for the shore. In the Arctic, Patch picks up a bone and heads back to his nest, which he has been building in the hopes of attracting a mate. Nearby, The Gorgosaurus finds the Edmontonia outside its lair, but the bite to its leg is badly infected and it goes back into the cave to wait for easier prey to wander close. A thousand miles away, the Edmontosaurus herd moves on through a volcanic ash field. Lying in wait, a pack of Albertosaurus sleeps until the herd is close enough to ambush. The feathered carnivores wake up and start to stalk the herd. Scar runs for his life while one of the predators is hot on his heels. During the attack, an avalanche of water, rock and mud caused by the eruption that follows the attack slides down the bank. Scar climbs up the cliff, but loses his courage, and the Albertosaurus, injured in the eruption, begins to close in. Just as Scar sees the avalanche, he rushes up the cliff while the Albertosaurus is swept to its seeming death. Back in the Arctic, Patch tries to impress the female by dancing only to lose out to a more experienced male and the Edmontonia has found a last leaf. Suddenly, the log it stands on breaks apart and the Edmontonia slides down the snow on her back and crashes into a snowdrift, utterly helpless. Far away from the Troodons, Scar tries to call for his family, but the only calls are the ones that didn't make it; the old male Edmontosaurus he has been traveling with and an injured female Pachyrhinosaurus. The Albertosaurus, having survived the mudslide, rises back to its feet and starting following Scar's trail again. Scar and the old Edmontosaurus walks on, but the older animal, suffering from a brain tumor, becomes more aggressive and nervous towards Scar, eventually even biting him. Scar sees the Albertosaurus first, and flees. The old bull Edmontosaur fights the predator until they both tumble over the cliff, locked in a <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace.</b> In the frozen north, Patch learns how to finally catch Alphadon by listening for them under the snow and comes across the overturned Edmontonia. He and several other Troodons attack the ankylosaur, but the Gorgosaurus, now fully healed of its injury, arrives and pulls the herbivore away from the smaller predators. Struggling, the Edmontonia gets back up and injures the Gorgosaurus with her shoulder spikes. The Gorgosaurus heads back to the cave, fatally wounded with a broken leg. As the sun rises the next morning, Scar is becoming weaker and the Quetzalcoatlus that follows senses it. The young dinosaur hears a rustling noise, which turns to be the injured female Pachyrhinosaurus instead. The pterosaur gives up and the ceratopsian herd arrives to cross the river. As they cross the river, groups of Prognathodon arrive and pull many of them underwater. Scar dives in while the mosasaurs continue their attack on the Pachyrhinosauruses. Scar eventually reaches the far bank and reunites with the Edmontosaurus herd, finally reaching safety. The sun eventually rises again and warmth begins to spread across the Arctic Circle. The Edmontonia is feasting on the budding greens and Patch manages to find a mate, offering scavenged meat from the dead Gorgosaurus. Soon, the Edmontosaurus will travel north again once summer begins to arrive to the north.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Today’s global {{crisis is}} not just a multidimensional crisis {{extending}} from the economic to the ecological fields and from the political to the social; it is also a serious biological crisis which is expressed with the dramatic worsening of the public health, {{as a result of its}} <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace</b> by the pharmaceutical TNCs and the planetary catastrophe brought about by the intensive agricultural system that accompanied the flourishing of neoliberal globalisation and the reproduction of consumer society all over the world. Factory animal farming in particular has delivered enormous growth in global meat production over the last three decades, with consumers persuaded to buy its cheap products with the same ease as they were getting the freely-offered loans of the financial boom, without asking any questions on how such consumption could be sustained or what the eventual consequences might be. It is, therefore, not surprising at all that the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico is linked to industrialised farming methods designed to provide cheap food for consumers. The multidimensional crisis and now the biological crisis provide ample evidence that what is good for the elites who control not only our way of living but our survival itself is far from good for us. Furthermore, the elites’ actions show why it is so imperative to build a massive movement for the establishment of a genuine democracy, an Inclusive Democracy, so that it is ourselves, rather than criminal elites interested only in making more money, who decide what our needs are and how best to meet them.; CHAPTERS: The record so far; Plot theories on the swine flu; Irrationalism in medical practice and research; The systemic character of the swine flu and of the measures taken against it; Conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Intrigued by the {{observation}} that enduring, task-based water treaties have, surprisingly, emerged within protracted conflict settings that lock the riparians in a <b>deadly</b> <b>embrace,</b> I constructed an interdisciplinary theoretical framework to explain the causes of riparian conflict, and the conditions for riparian conflict resolution. Drawing on the literature from international relations, comparative politics, resource economics and public choice theory, I explain how the constraints posed by ecological forces in a conflict setting, and the political opportunities presented by a particular economic-developmental context shape the decisions of policymakers during the negotiation process that precedes regime emergence. Next, a model is developed that first illustrates the causal pathways among five independent variables, (water scarcity mode, critical environmental threshold, riparian position, state power profile and sustainable development of water resources); three contextual variables, (conflict setting, economic-developmental level, economic-developmental crisis) and the dependent variable of riparian conflict. The pathway is then extended {{with the addition of}} two more contextual variables (negotiation structure and strategy) to explain the second dependent variable of regime emergence. Eight hypotheses are then theoretically derived and tested with specifics from four cases covering both developing and developed state riparian conflicts within protracted and non-protracted settings. The Middle East, South Asian, and North American regions are thus studied. It was evident that the degree of water scarcity has either conflict enhancing or conflict mitigating properties depending upon the patterns of interaction among the variables. Both contextual variable clusters had theoretically significant effects {{on the nature of the}} regime. I inferred that the state formation dynamic influenced the economic-developmental context in which water policy is formulated and shaped the domestic configuration of water interests. It appears that the influence of rent-seeking groups opposed to a transboundary water treaty wax and wane once critical environmental thresholds, which aggravate or cause an economic-developmental crisis, are exceeded (especially in the most powerful state). This, along with other economic, international and geographic factors, ultimately, alters the preferences of the policymakers to enable compromise at the international level. A state's institutional capacity to adopt a more sustainable water usage pattern is also relevant in this regard...|$|E
