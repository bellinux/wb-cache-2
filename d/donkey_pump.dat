6000|$|... "There is no {{immediate}} danger," [...] said he. [...] "We must have struck {{some sort of}} wreckage, or lumber float. There is a small hole in the bow, just above the water line, {{and several of the}} seams have been opened. Captain Barforth is having the hole closed up and has started up the <b>donkey</b> <b>pump</b> to keep the water low in the hold. He says he thinks we can make one of the nearby ports without great trouble." ...|$|E
50|$|Baltimore has a {{rotative}} duplex <b>donkey</b> <b>pump,</b> duplex feed pump, duplex {{sanitary pump}} and a centrifugal circulating pump. The pump system provides a moderate fire fighting capability through two hose standpipes {{on top of}} the pilothouse. Piping runs to each compartment allow water to be forced out through air pressure in the event of flooding.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 an {{oil well}} was {{installed}} above the cliffs west of Gaulter Gap, overlooking Kimmeridge Bay. Comprising a nodding <b>donkey</b> <b>pump</b> that lifts crude oil from {{several hundred feet}} below the surface, {{in its early years}} it pumped more than 100,000 gallons per week, producing a total of 200,000 tonnes between 1961 and 1974.|$|E
50|$|A pumpjack (also called oil horse, oil jack, donkey pumper, nodding <b>donkey,</b> <b>pumping</b> unit, horsehead pump, rocking horse, beam pump, dinosaur, {{grasshopper}} pump, Big Texan, thirsty bird, cricket, or jack pump) is the overground {{drive for}} a {{reciprocating piston pump}} in an oil well.|$|R
50|$|Note that a {{tree and}} {{wellhead}} are separate pieces of equipment not to be mistaken as the same piece. The Christmas tree is installed {{on top of the}} wellhead. A wellhead is used without a Christmas tree during drilling operations, and also for riser tie-back situations that later would have a tree installed at riser top. Wells being produced with rod pumps (<b>pump</b> jacks, nodding <b>donkeys,</b> grasshopper <b>pumps,</b> and so on) frequently do not utilize any tree owing the absence of a pressure-containment requirement.|$|R
50|$|Dorset {{possesses}} 3 onshore {{oil fields}} in the southeast of the county, at Wareham, Kimmeridge and Wytch Farm. Wytch Farm lies between the Purbeck Hills and Poole Harbour; the Purbeck Monocline defines the field's southern limit. Wytch Farm has been producing oil since 1979. A few miles to the southwest at Kimmeridge, a nodding <b>donkey</b> has been <b>pumping</b> up oil from beneath the shale cliffs there since the late 1950s, although yields are declining.|$|R
50|$|The engine carried {{its water}} in a well-tank and the coal in a locker on the footplate. A <b>donkey</b> <b>pump</b> on the coal locker fed water to the boiler. The chimney had an {{inverted}} conical shape and the wide opening was covered by wire mesh, {{to serve as a}} spark arrester. The locomotive was erected in a tarred timber shed on Market Square in Durban and was painted green, with copper-coloured wheels and with a huge polished brass dome cover.|$|E
50|$|Treswell {{is located}} over the South Leverton {{oilfield}} which runs beneath it, {{and there are}} four nodding <b>donkey</b> oil <b>pumps</b> located over well heads to the north east of the village. The field produces high-grade crude oil, which is taken by road to a collection centre at Gainsborough, from where it is transferred by rail to be refined at Immingham. Because of its quality, it {{is used for the}} production of chemicals and plastics, rather than for fuel. Oil was discovered here in the late 1950s or early 1960s, after Dr Mosaddeq took power in Iran and nationalised the oil industry there. Displaced engineers working for British Petroleum returned to the UK, and South Leverton oilfield was one of several which were identified at that time {{as a result of their}} exploration skills.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that the Texas Collegiate League would add a team in Kilgore for the upcoming season. Fans were invited to make suggestions to the front office of the new club in the [...] "Name Your Team" [...] contest. In early April 2008, general manager Mike Lieberman announced the new team would be called the East Texas Pump Jacks, complete with dual logos representing East Texas' history in the oil industry. One logo is a <b>donkey</b> representing the <b>pumping</b> unit or horsehead pump, the over ground for a reciprocating piston installed in a borehole. It is used to mechanically lift liquid out of the well if there is not enough bottom hole pressure for the liquid to flow {{all the way to the}} surface. The other logo is a dinosaur, representing the fossil fuels used in oil drilling.|$|R
