In this work, a series of <b>gallium</b> oxide/carbon <b>nitride</b> composites with various gallium to carbon ratios (Ga/C = 1 - 50 mol%) was prepared by impregnation method for removal of cyclohexane under visible light irradiation for the first time. The successful preparation of <b>gallium</b> oxide/carbon <b>nitride</b> composites was supported by several characterization techniques. Xray diffraction (XRD) patterns and diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DR UV-vis) spectra revealed that the increased Ga/C ratio resulted in the increased formation of Ga 2 O 3. Furthermore, all the prepared composite samples also showed visible light absorption up to about 430 nm. In the photocatalytic removal of cyclohexane under 6 h of visible light irradiation, sample with low loading of 1 mol% Ga/C improved the photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride for two times.

Some of these nitrides were identified as highly efficient optical luminescence materials and, therefore, are promising candidates for photon conversion [4, 5]. In order to estimate the performance of a luminescent material in phosphor-converted (pc) -LEDs at higher temperatures, band-gap investigations are of special interest.
