40|$|ABSTRACT- Short Shoot Syndrome (SSS) causes severe {{crop losses}} in Oregon {{vineyards}} due to bunch necrosis {{during the early}} part of the season. Other symptoms include malformed leaves, unusually short and angled shoots, scar tissue and bronzed leaves close to harvest time. This work shows that SSS found in Ore-gon vineyards is closely associated with grape <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Calepitrimerus vitis (Nalepa) infestations. Very few bud mites, Colomerus vitis (Pagenstecher), were found in the vineyards during the current year and no relationship could be found between SSS symptoms and this species. During winter, <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> are dormant and no evidence of direct bud damage from <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> was found inside undeveloped buds. Tissue damage from mites was first observed between bud break and the two-leaf stage in <b>mite</b> infested vineyards. <b>Rust</b> <b>mite</b> colonies were found under outer bud scales and bark of canes close to the buds.

To increase the diversity of rust resistance in wheat and barley, a project was initiated to identify and characterise rust resistance genes from the wild species of Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) and Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum (wild barley), respectively. One hundred and two accessions of Sharon goatgrass from Israel and 318 Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) accessions from the Fertile Crescent, Central Asia, North Africa, and the Caucasus region were evaluated for resistance to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust,</b> stem rust, and/or stripe rust. Sharon goatgrass exhibited a wide range of infection types (ITs) in response to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust,</b> stem rust, and stripe rust. The percentage of resistant accessions in Sharon goatgrass was 58. 8 â€“ 78. 4 % for <b>leaf</b> <b>rust,</b> 11. 8 â€“ 69. 6 % for stem rust, and 46. 1 % for stripe rust, depending on the race used and the plant growth stage. Genetic studies with Sharon goatgrass revealed oligogenic resistance to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> and stem rust. Wild barley also exhibited a wide range of ITs to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> and stem rust; however, the overall frequency of resistance was lower than for Sharon goatgrass.

The first objective was to verify the environmental conditions that favor P. triticina infections in an outdoor field environment. Wheat was inoculated with P. triticina and exposed to ambient weather conditions for 16 hours. Number of hours with temperature between 5 to 25 Â°C and relative humidity > 87 % were highly correlated and predicted <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> infections with 89 % accuracy.

Objectives two and three of this research were to identify environmental variables associated with <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> and stripe rust epidemics and to evaluate these predictors in models. Mean yield loss on susceptible varieties was estimated for nine Kansas crop reporting districts (CRDâ€™s). Monthly environmental variables were evaluated for association with stripe rust epidemics (> 1 % yield loss), <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> epidemics (> 1 % yield loss), severe stripe rust epidemics (> 14 % yield loss) and severe <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> epidemics (> 7 % yield loss) at the CRD scale. Stripe <b>rust</b> and <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> epidemics were both strongly associated with soil moisture conditions; however, the timing differed between these diseases. Stripe rust epidemics were associated with soil moisture in fall and winter, and <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> epidemics during winter and spring. Severe stripe <b>rust</b> and <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> epidemics were associated with favorable temperature (7 to 12 Â°C) and temperature (15 to 20 Â°C) with relative humidity (> 87 %) or precipitation in May using tree-based methods of classification, respectively. The preliminary models developed in this research could be coupled with disease observations and varietal resistance information to advise growers about the need for foliar fungicides against these rusts in Kansas winter wheat...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> and tan spot of wheat by seed {{treatment}} with fungicides was evaluated during 1998 in Passo Fundo, RS. Except for treatments including triadimenol and iprodione, <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> and tan spot severity in above ground parts of wheat plants was drastically {{reduced by the}} fluquinconazole fungicide used...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{diseases}} which limiting production in arabica coffee is the <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix, B et Br. Selection and testing on thirteen promising arabica coffee clones were carried out at endemic area for <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> disease, Andungsari Research Station, for six fruiting times. The aims of these test were to find out superior planting material as clone with genetic resistance to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust.</b> As the beverage commodities, criterium selections for superiority clone besides resistant to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> and yielding ability of more than 1, 5 ton/ha also must be excellent in cup quality. Under this consideration, BP 416 A clone showed as the best high yielding ability i. e. 1, 595 kg/ha and stable, besides resistant to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> disease {{compared to the other}} clones tested. This clone had good cup quality, better than earlier released variety such as USDA 762 and S 795 although was not better than Andungsari 1 that were planted in the same location. The best physical bean characteristics was obtained on BP 513 A clone wich is derived from S 795 x Caturra red, having 89. 2 % of normal bean and 18. 3 % outurn characteristics. However, due to lower yielding and more susceptible to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust,</b> this clone could not be classified as superior clone...|$|R
40|$|Disease-susceptibility of apricot cultivars is a key-stone towards low-input {{production}} systems. Among {{the main}} diseases, the susceptibility to Monilinia spp. and <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> of apricot cultivars are economically important but rarely assessed. A 5 -years study in two sites {{was conducted to}} assess the susceptibilities to Monilinia spp. and <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> of 16 apricot cultivars under natural conditions (no inoculation). No fungicide and insecticide were applied during the experiment. In Torreilles site, no significant Monilinia spp. was observed. In Gotheron site, the percentage of shoots necrosed by Monilinia spp. ranged from 13 % to 100 % during 2010 - 2011. A Genotype x Environment interaction was observed for Monilinia spp. damages. Concurrently a high variability to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> was observed in both sites. The ranking of cultivars susceptibility to <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> was similar between both site...|$|R
40|$|In 2005 â€“ 2008 {{virulence}} of {{the wheat}} <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> population was studied on Thatcher near-isogenic lines with Lr 1, Lr 2 a, Lr 2 b, Lr 2 c, Lr 3 a, Lr 9, Lr 10, Lr 11, Lr 15, Lr 17, Lr 19, Lr 21, Lr 23, Lr 24, Lr 26 and Lr 28. Samples of <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> {{were obtained from}} different parts of the Czech Republic. A total of 233 wheat <b>leaf</b> <b>rust</b> isolates were analyzed. Resistance gene Lr 9 was effective to all tested isolates as in the four previous years. Virulence to Lr 19 (0. 8...|$|R
