5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the storm is over, <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E
