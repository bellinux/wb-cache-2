40|$|ABSTRACT Needs for {{a quality}} {{perspective}} {{in the management}} of data resources are becoming increasingly critical. This paper investigates how to associate <b>data</b> with <b>quality</b> information that can help users make judgments of the <b>quality</b> of <b>data.</b> Specifically, we propose the concept of <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> object and investigate its structure and behavior. The structure of the <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> object includes a description of the datum object, its corresponding quality description object, and a mechanism to associate the datum object with its quality description object. The behavior of the quality object includes a set of methods to measure quality dimensions (such as timeliness, completeness, credibility). In addition, we have developed a <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> object algebra that includes quality comparison methods and an algebra that extends the relational algebra to the <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> object domain. It allows for a systematic construction of retrieval methods for <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> objects. The concept of <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> object presented in the paper is a first step toward the design and manufacture of data products. We envision that the quality dat...|$|R

50|$|<b>Data</b> {{resource}} <b>quality</b> is {{a measure}} of how well the organization's data resource supports the current and the future business information demand of the organization.

25|$|Effective {{analytic}} QC methods {{serve as}} a gatekeeper for excellent quality assays. In a typical HTS experiment, {{a clear distinction between}} a positive control and a negative reference such as a negative control is an index for good quality.

25|$|The {{majority}} of issues with tissue residue {{arise in the}} interpretation of tissue residue data.

Choice of tissue for tissue residue analysis can also be difficult and has an effect on tissue residue data. When choosing tissue, a scientist needs to consider: mode and mechanism of action of chemical being tested, site of toxic action for the chemical and species combination being studied and strength of the tissue residue-response relationship. There is also a lack of reliable tissue residue relationships available for comparison.|$|E
