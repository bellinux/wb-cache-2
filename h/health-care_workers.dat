25|$|<b>Health-care</b> <b>workers</b> {{treating}} {{people with}} Ebola are at greatest risk of infection. The risk increases {{when they do}} not have appropriate protective clothing such as masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection; do not wear it properly; or handle contaminated clothing incorrectly. This risk is particularly common in parts of Africa where the disease mostly occurs and health systems function poorly. There has been transmission in hospitals in some African countries that reuse hypodermic needles. Some health-care centers caring for people with the disease do not have running water. In the United States the spread to two medical workers treating infected patients prompted criticism of inadequate training and procedures.|$|E
25|$|Although disease-specific {{interventions}} are important, further {{strengthening of the}} public-health system will be needed if China is to halve the prevalence of tuberculosis {{and the number of}} deaths caused by the disease. To increase access, a package of essential public-health services for rural inhabitants and urban migrants should be provided with governmental subsidies. This package should include services for at least tuberculosis, immunisation, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and maternal and child health. The government must also address the warped incentives in hospitals that encourage the generation of profits from drugs, tests, and state-of-the-art technologies. This profit generation fuels the inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including tuberculosis. Finally, the government should provide operational costs for public-health services and full salaries for <b>health-care</b> <b>workers,</b> especially at and below the county level, where most of the rural population live. The number of staff needed for essential public-health functions should be carefully calculated, and public-health workers must be given fair pay.

Psychological support units are also hampered by the lack of material resources available to the medical community on-ground. Medical practitioners and <b>health-care</b> <b>workers</b> face daunting challenges in conflict and post-conflict area. As the WHO explains, [...] "healthcare delivery fragments and deteriorates, memory and knowledge are eroded, and power disperses". War-torn societies in immediate post-conflict zones have broken medical infrastructure such as: destroyed or partially destroyed hospitals (or clinics); non-functioning hospitals; poor, scarce or inadequate medical supplies, lack of running water, and scarce or lack of electricity. Dismantling weapons from armed rebels and other groups are prioritized in immediate post-conflict situations which in effect de-prioritizes the immediate physical and psychiatric care that war rape victims are in urgent need of. [...] "If {{we do not have the}} capacity to prevent war, we have a collective responsibility to better understand and treat its psychiatric, medical, and social consequences." [...] Access to phycological health services further causes inequity for survivors of war rape who are at the margins of society living in chronic poverty or located in rural regions. Healthcare and psychiatric care is a key component to the healing processes of war rape.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This paper {{provides}} a concise {{review of the}} efficacy, effectiveness and affordability of health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation, in order to inform national guideline development and assist countries in planning their provision of tobacco cessation support. Methods: Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of major health-care tobacco cessation interventions were used to derive efficacy estimates in terms of percentage-point increases relative to comparison conditions in 6 ‚Äì 12 -month continuous abstinence rates. This was combined with analysis and evidence from ‚Äòreal world‚Äô studies to form a judgement on the probable effectiveness of each intervention in different settings. The affordability of each intervention was assessed for exemplar countries in each World Bank income category (low, lower middle, upper middle, high). Based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, an intervention was judged as affordable for a given income category if the estimated extra cost of saving a life-year was {{less than or equal}} to the per-capita gross domestic product for that category of country. Results: Brief advice from a <b>health-care</b> <b>worker</b> given opportunistically to smokers attending health-care services can promote smoking cessation, and is affordable for countries in all World Bank income categories (i. e. globally). Proactive telephone support, automated text messaging programmes and printed self-help materials can assist smokers wanting help with a quit attempt and are affordable globally. Multi-session, face-to-face behavioural support can increase quit success for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and is affordable in middle- and high-income countries. Nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, nortriptyline, varenicline and cytisine can all aid quitting smoking when given with at least some behavioural support; of these, cytisine and nortriptyline are affordable globally. Conclusions: Brief advice from a <b>health-care</b> <b>worker,</b> telephone helplines, automated text messaging, printed self-help materials, cytisine and nortriptyline are globally affordable health-care interventions to promote and assist smoking cessation. Evidence on smokeless tobacco cessation suggests that face-to-face behavioural support and varenicline can promote cessation...|$|R
40|$|Hand {{cleansing}} is {{the primary}} action to reduce health-care-associated infection and cross-transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Patient-to-patient transmission of pathogens via health-care workers' hands requires five sequential steps: (1) organisms are present on the patient's skin or have been shed onto fomites in the patient's immediate environment; (2) organisms must be transferred to health-care workers' hands; (3) organisms must be capable of surviving on health-care workers' hands for at least several minutes; (4) handwashing or hand antisepsis by the <b>health-care</b> <b>worker</b> must be inadequate or omitted entirely, or the agent used for hand hygiene inappropriate; and (5) the caregiver's contaminated hand(s) must come into direct contact with another patient or with a fomite {{in direct contact with}} the patient.

30|$|Catheter {{securement}} can {{be accomplished}} using several different methods. The most frequently used method of securing short-term CVCs to the skin is silk or nylon sutures [2, 5, 6]. However, the use of sutures is associated with needlestick or sharp injuries to the <b>health-care</b> <b>worker,</b> as well as patient discomfort and the consequences related to disrupting the patient‚Äôs skin barrier [7]. To address these issues, manufactured catheter stabilization devices have entered {{the market in the}} last decade and are gaining in acceptance to provide securement [8]. Since 2006, various guidelines recommend the use of such securement devices [1, 8 ‚Äì 10]. A recent literature review also found that securement with adhesive systems is more effective than suturing to reduce blood stream infections [11]. Yet, changing practice in health care can take a long time and physicians are likely to continue using sutures for securing CVCs until a larger body of evidence exists for an effective alternative.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen the global {{emergence}} of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), causing substantial health and economic burdens on patients and health-care systems. This epidemic has occurred {{at the same time}} that policies promoting higher patient throughput in hospitals have led to many services operating at, or near, full capacity. A result has been limited ability to scale services according to fluctuations in patient admissions and available staff, and hospital overcrowding and understaffing. Overcrowding and understaffing lead to failure of MRSA control programmes via decreased <b>health-care</b> <b>worker</b> hand-hygiene compliance, increased movement of patients and staff between hospital wards, decreased levels of cohorting, and overburdening of screening and isolation facilities. In turn, a high MRSA incidence leads to increased inpatient length of stay and bed blocking, exacerbating overcrowding and leading to a vicious cycle characterised by further infection control failure.
