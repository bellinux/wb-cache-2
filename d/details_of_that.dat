25|$|Crescentius the Elder, {{the brother}} of Pope John XIII, had {{previously}} deposed and had strangled Pope Benedict VI, and helped install Antipope Boniface VII in Rome {{in opposition to the}} imperial candidates, Pope Benedict VII and Pope John XIV, the latter of which perished in the Castel Sant'Angelo like Benedict V. Crescentius the Younger, the son of Crescentius the Elder, likely had a strong hand in the election of Pope John XV, although the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> papacy are incomplete and disputed. However, it is known that Crescentius the Younger deferred to Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor for the choice of the successor of John XV: Pope Gregory V, Otto III's cousin. Yet, not long afterward, disputes with the emperor and Gregory V caused Crescentius the Younger to support Antipope John XVI, who was deposed with some difficulty by Otto III, who proceeded to have John XVI mutilated and Crescentius the Younger killed.|$|E
500|$|One cut Goldenberg had to make, {{which he}} [...] "hated" [...] to do, was {{the absence of}} Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. [...] "The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had {{included}} the Quidditch subplot {{would have been a}} lesser film", he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. [...] "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own {{in the same way that}} Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film". The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been [...] "quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff".|$|E
500|$|The book {{suggests}} that the September 11 attacks were self-inflicted: a covert operation aimed at influencing domestic opinion and to persuade Americans to support the invasions of Afghanistan and of Iraq. It is written in a speculative style, laden with terms such as [...] "could", [...] "might", [...] "maybe" [...] and [...] "if", and does not directly accuse the Central Intelligence Agency of direct responsibility for the attacks. It does, however, attempt to demolish the [...] "conventional" [...] account of the 9/11 attacks, and while it does not build up a substantive account to replace it, it leaves insinuations and rumours to suggest possibilities. For instance, while {{it is argued that}} such well-organized attacks could only occur with [...] "the support of the intelligence agencies", the exact <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> support are left unspecified. The book {{suggests that}} no plane crashed into The Pentagon and none in Pennsylvania on 9/11, and that the alleged mobile phone calls on United Airlines Flight 93 were not real.|$|E

2500|$|During her week of {{performances}} at the Apollo, Vaughan {{was introduced to}} bandleader and pianist Earl [...] "Fatha" [...] Hines, although the exact <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> introduction are disputed. Billy Eckstine, Hines' singer at the time, has been credited by Vaughan and others with hearing her at the Apollo and recommending her to Hines. Hines claimed later to have discovered her himself and offered her a job on the spot. Regardless, after a brief tryout at the Apollo, Hines officially replaced his current male singer with Vaughan on April 4, 1943.|$|E
2500|$|According to Olivelle, {{and other}} {{scholars}} such as Edward Crangle, the concept of Sramana exists in the early Brahmanical literature. The term is used in an adjectival sense for sages who lived a special {{way of life that}} the Vedic culture considered extraordinary. However, Vedic literature does not provide <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> life. The term did not imply any opposition to either Brahmins or householders. In all likelihood states Olivelle, during the Vedic era, neither did the Sramana concept refer to an identifiable class, nor to ascetic groups as it does in later Indian literature. Additionally, in the early texts, some pre-dating 3rd-century BCE ruler Ashoka, the Brahmana and Sramana are neither distinct nor opposed. The distinction, according to Olivelle, in later Indian literature [...] "may have been a later semantic development possibly influenced by the appropriation of the latter term [...] by Buddhism and Jainism".|$|E
2500|$|During the First Great Awakening, a {{movement}} developed among the Baptists known as Separate Baptists. Two themes {{of this movement}} were the rejection of creeds and [...] "freedom in the Spirit." [...] The Separate Baptists saw scripture as the [...] "perfect rule" [...] for the church. [...] However, while they turned to the Bible for a structural pattern for the church, they did not insist on complete agreement on the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> pattern. [...] This group originated in New England, but was especially strong in the South where the emphasis on a biblical pattern for the church grew stronger. [...] In {{the last half of}} the 18th century it spread to the western frontier of Kentucky and Tennessee, where the Stone and Campbell movements would later take root. The development of the Separate Baptists in the southern frontier helped prepare the ground for the Restoration Movement, as the membership of both the Stone and Campbell groups drew heavily from among the ranks of the Separate Baptists. Separate Baptist restorationism also contributed to the development of the Landmark Baptists in the same area at about the same time as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. Under the leadership of James Robinson Graves, this group looked for a precise blueprint for the primitive church, believing that any deviation from that blueprint would keep one from being part of the true church.|$|E

2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
