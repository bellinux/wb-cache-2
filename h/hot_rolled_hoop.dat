While the Mk III had a <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> which ran the full width of the cockpit, the Mk III C was designed to share the <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> design of the Northstar LMP. This standard hoop was positioned immediately behind the drivers seat and integrated the intakes for the engine, although an option <b>roll</b> <b>hoop</b> extension was offered as it was required for the Rolex Sports Car Series.
