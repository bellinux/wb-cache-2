His father, film director Rakesh Roshan, {{is the son of}} music director Roshanlal Nagrath; his mother, Pinky, is the daughter of producer and director J. Om Prakash. His uncle, Rajesh, is a music composer. Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the Bombay Scottish School. Roshan is of part Bengali ancestry from his paternal grandmother's side. Although Roshan practices Hinduism, he says that [...] "I'm not religious. I don't visit temples. But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> is a superpower." ...|$|E

"And so, sir, in the lonelier {{and perhaps}} even more disheartening moments which come to any {{national}} leader, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> will be a corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer {{from the fact that}} you have an admiring friend, a staunch friend that will be all the way with LBJ." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Headquarters USAF and the TAC {{continued}} {{to call for}} a multipurpose aircraft, while both Disosway and Air Chief of Staff Bruce K. Holloway pressed for a pure air-superiority design that would be able to meet the expected performance of the MiG-25. During the same period, the Navy had ended its VFAX program and instead accepted a proposal from Grumman Aircraft for a smaller and more maneuverable design known as VFX, later becoming the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. VFX was considerably closer to the evolving F-X requirements. The Air Force in-fighting was eventually ended by the worry that the Navy's VFAX would be forced on them; in May 1968 it was stated that [...] "We finally decided – and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> is no one who still disagrees – that this aircraft {{is going to be an}} air superiority fighter".|$|E

60|$|As {{she looked}} at me in giving me the purse, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>there</b> was an inner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with displeasure.|$|R
2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There are some that {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> are few men in the parliament who believe that ... We are proud of what the Empire has done, and our contribution must be adequate, and in every way worthy of that effort ... To [...] now would be a national sin, a national calamity. As opposition leader, Cook had opposed almost no government measures throughout 1916, and Hughes and his faction were becoming increasingly distant from the bulk of the ALP and aligning much more with the conservative opposition. When the second reading of the Military Service Referendum bill was moved, it carried 46 to 10 in the House and 19 to 9 in the Senate. In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority. Hughes stared down his enemies within the party and committed himself fully to the campaign: [...] "For myself, I say that I am going into this referendum campaign as if it were the only thing for which I lived." ...|$|E

6000|$|Tim. Now, my lord, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> {{no great}} need of wooing: I suppose my estate will speak for me; yet, {{if you please}} {{to put in a}} word-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, sir,' {{returned}} his partner, 'my {{opinion is that}} we must have got to the MOST remarkable man {{in the country at}} last. So <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> an end to the breed, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then it was {{not about}} Don Ippolito. [...] "Is your mother sick?" [...] asked Ferris, eagerly. [...] "She must have been fearfully tired by that unlucky {{expedition}} of ours. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> nothing serious?" ...|$|R
60|$|EDITH. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> {{will be no}} hinting. Let us {{have the}} plain {{straightforward}} {{truth and nothing but}} the truth.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Quite sure. Mr. Pettitt was in {{the hall}} when he left, and he asked him {{something}} about business. Mr. Schwarz laughed and said, [...] "not bad." [...] <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> nothing wrong, sir,' added the man.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988 Mazer said: [...] "I {{hesitate}} to say I'm delivering messages....I'm writing stories and novels. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> an underlying {{feeling for the}} reader -- a hope, perhaps a moral. But I'm not preaching. I'm telling stories".|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Godall. ‘But now I come {{to look at}} {{you more}} closely, I {{perceive}} that you are changed. My poor boy, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> is nothing wrong?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word I am very sorry," [...] {{said the}} judge. [...] "But {{what made him}} go off so suddenly? <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> nobody ill at The Cleeve!" [...] And then the judge took his first spoonful of soup.|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't listen, miss. But {{when one}} is in and out one cannot stop one's ears. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there</b> isn't going to be {{anything}} wrong between 'em about the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your passion {{does not}} alarm me greatly,' laughed the Doctor. 'I don't think it ever equalled {{that for the}} reigning ship. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>there's</b> a vacancy in that {{department}} for the present, and {{that we may have}} you at home a little.' ...|$|R

6000|$|In the settles of {{the large}} room, guyed to the ceiling by cords as usual for stability, an {{ordinary}} group sat drinking and smoking with statuesque quiet of demeanour.
