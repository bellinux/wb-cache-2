30|$|Freight {{activity}} {{is difficult to}} understand {{because there are many}} actors involved (e.g., shippers, carriers, distributors, freight forwarders, receivers) involved in multiple industry segments and not much information is available about how they operate. As a result, characterizing freight patterns require a multi-layer and multi-actor approach. Goods movements can be broadly divided in three clusters: (1) the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> resulting from economic transactions that arrive through international gateways (e.g., ports, airports) and are then transported to manufacturing districts or to wholesalers for distribution; (2) the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> that are consumed by manufacturers, transformed, and then shipped again to local or international destinations; and (3) the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> that are distributed for final consumption (e.g., supplies for retail stores). These three types <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> converge in urban environments. While most of the attention has traditionally focused on the first and the second clusters because they move the largest amounts of cargo, the bulk of freight trips—and their negative impacts—are produced by urban deliveries, that are actually the focus of the “City Logistics” initiatives.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a steady state theory of complex transport networks used to model the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity,</b> information, viruses, opinions, or traffic. Our approach {{is based on the}} use of the Markov chains defined on the graph representations of transport networks allowing for the effective network design, network performance evaluation, embedding, partitioning, and network fault tolerance analysis. Random walks embed graphs into Euclidean space in which distances and angles acquire a clear statistical interpretation. Being defined on the dual graph representations of transport networks random walks describe the equilibrium configurations of not random commodity flows on primary graphs. This theory unifies many network concepts into one framework and can also be elegantly extended to describe networks represented by directed graphs and multiple interacting networks.

40|$|Every {{route of}} a {{transport}} network approaching equilibrium {{can be represented}} by a vector of Euclidean space which length quantifies its segregation {{from the rest of}} the graph.

We give an example of the canal network of Veneice to demonstrate our result. The method is applicable to any transport network. PACS: 89. 65. Lm, 89. 75. Fb, 05. 40. Fb, 02. 10. Ox Transport networks are used to model the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity,</b> information, viruses, opinions, or traffic. They typically represent the networks of roads, streets, pipes, aqueducts, power lines, or nearly any structure which permits either vehicular movement or flow of some commodity, products, goods or service. The major aim of the analysis is to determine the structure and properties of transport networks that are important for the emergence of complex flow patterns of vehicles (or pedestrians) through the network such as the Braess paradox [1]. This counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs when adding more resources to a transportation network (say, a new road or a bridge) worsens the quality of traffic by creating longer delays for the drivers, rather than alleviate it. The Braess paradox has been observed in the street traffic of Ne...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{performance}}, performance persistence, survival and <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commodity</b> Trading Advisors, {{also known as}} CTAs or Managed Futures Funds. One of the main contributions of this thesis is the novel classification of CTA strategies. This is obtained by hand-collecting information frequently by directly contacting the funds in the database. I thus identify two main trading styles: Systematic and Discretionary CTAs which are {{the main focus of}} this thesis. I further separate Systematic CTAs into trend-followers with differing trading horizon. This novel dataset allows me to reconsider many hitherto studied issues in the CTA space with an application to these sub-strategies. The first section investigates the differences in mortality between Systematic and Discretionary CTAs, over the longest horizon than of any in the literature. A detailed survival analysis over the full range of CTA strategies is provided. Systematic CTAs have a higher median survival than Discretionary CTAs, 12 vs. 8 years. I hand collect information on reasons for exit from the database. I propose new filters that will better identify real failures among funds in the graveyard database. Separating graveyard funds into real failure I re-examine the attrition rate of CTAs. The real failure rate is 11. 1...|$|E

40|$|Situations {{in which}} the civil supply of goods is {{threatened}} or affected by attacks, natural catastrophes, major accidents or criminal activities are increasing. Furthermore the unique identification of goods {{as well as the}} traceability up to the manufacturer gain in importance. Currently, the question is how to get more security in the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> in a feasible manner, without constraining them with additional inspections. Therefore the partners of the joint research project "Trans 4 Goods - Security in supply chains in the scope of surface transport of goods by secure information patterns on the freight" ("www. trans 4 goods. org") determine feasible approaches. Referring to a pharmaceutical supply chain, an IT-system concept shall be developed bundling capture and communication systems in a web portal solution. Additionally, local AutoID-data carriers (currently: 2 D-Codes, RFID) which are attached to goods, packaging and carrier are examined as new technological solution for tracking security relevant data electronically in real-time concerning dimension and weight, means of transportation, temperature, location as well as the method of control. To assure data integrity and thus prevent manipulation suitable encryption methods are researched. Innovative depth image sensor concepts are tested on the level of freight, whose measured data alone or in combination with the data of the AutoiD carrier from the different object levels allow a station history related analysis of the data model...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} an upsurge of {{geographical}} work tracing globalised <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> {{in the wake of}} Appadurai’s (1986) call to ‘follow the things’. This paper engages with calls to follow the thing but argues that work thus far has been concentrated, first, on global flows from developing world producers to developed world consumers, and, second, on things that remain stable as they circulate. This paper instead argues that ‘follow the thing’ research needs to also attend to flows ’down’ the value chain, from developed to less developed worlds, and to things that are either coming apart or being disassembled. The case presented here is end-of-life ships, sent to be broken in less developed countries, as most are, in this case in Bangladesh. It looks at how the arts of transience re-work materials from rubbish value ships into new forms and objects in the household furnishing sector, which are then appropriated by Bangladeshi middle class consumers. Far from being a minor feature this is shown to be empirically a significant component of the Bangladeshi economy. Theoretically the paper challenges many habitual assumptions about global <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> and urges ‘follow the thing’ research to rethink the thing. Paying attention to the back-end of the value chain shows that things are but temporary configurations of material. At best partially stable, things are argued to be endlessly being assembled, always becoming something else somewhere else...|$|R
