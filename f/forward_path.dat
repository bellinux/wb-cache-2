5|$|Upon moving ashore, the National Hurricane Center {{expected}} the <b>forward</b> <b>path</b> of Ivan to be blocked, and accordingly forecast the hurricane to stall {{in the southern}} Appalachian Mountains before dissipating. As the hurricane crossed Mobile Bay it turned to the north-northeast, and within twelve hours Ivan rapidly weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became less-defined, and early on September 17 the cyclone deteriorated into a tropical depression over northeastern Alabama. Ivan accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front, dropping heavy rainfall along its path and also producing a widespread tornado outbreak from Alabama through Maryland. Late on September 18, the remnants of Ivan transitioned into an extratropical low as it merged with the cold front over the Delmarva Peninsula.|$|E

40|$|ODMRP (On-Demand Multicast Routing Proto-col) [5] [7] [1] is {{a popular}} {{multicast}} protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. The strengths of ODMRP are simplicity, high packet delivery ratio, and non-dependency on a specific unicast protocol. ODMRP floods a route request over the entire network to select a set of forwarding nodes for packet delivery. However, a single <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> is vulnerable to node failures, which are common due to the dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks. Further-more, a set of misbehaving or malicious nodes can create network partitions and mount Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We propose a ODMRP-based wireless multicast protocol named Resilient-ODMRP that offers more reliable <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths</b> in face of node and network failures. A subset of the nodes that are not on <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths</b> re-broadcast received packets to nodes in their neighborhoods to overcome perceived node failures. This rebroadcasting creates redundant <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths</b> to circumvent failed areas in the network. Each node makes this forwarding decision probabilistically. Our simulation results indicate that Resilient-ODMRP improves packet delivery ratio with minimal overheads, while retaining the original strengths of ODMRP. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{available bandwidth}} as a routing metric for IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based ad-hoc networks. The available bandwidth on a data <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> is an approximation of the <b>forwarding</b> <b>path’s</b> residual data relaying capacity. High available bandwidth on a data <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> implies low data traffic {{load on the}} path, therefore data flows may experience low delay and high packet delivery ratio (PDR). Our aim is to evaluate available bandwidth as a routing metric. We present different available-bandwidth-based routing protocols for IEEE 802. 15. 40 -based networks, namely: end-to-end available-bandwidth-based routing protocol (ABR), available bandwidth and contention-aware routing protocol (ABCR), and shortest hop-count and available-bandwidth-based opportunistic routing protocol (ABOR). Moreover, we also present variants of ABR and ABCR capable of distributing a flow’s data packets on multiple paths by maintaining the top K downstream nodes (the downstream nodes that advertised best data <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths</b> towards a sink node) corresponding to each sink node in a routing table. We focus on both single-sink and multi-sink networks. We performed extensive simulations, and the simulation results demonstrate that the available bandwidth routing metric shows better results when combined with a routing metric that helps to limit a data <b>forwarding</b> <b>path’s</b> length, i. e., shortest hop-count or intra-flow contention count. For multi-path data forwarding towards the same sink node, and at high traffic volumes, the available bandwidth metric demonstrates best performance when combined with the shortest hop-count routing metric...|$|R

The motor inductance and winding resistance form a low-pass filter with a bandwidth around 200 Hz. Acceleration to velocity is an integrator and velocity to position is an integrator.

40|$|International audienceConfronted to the {{increasing}} dynamic of Internet routing system and its underlying topology, we propose a reliability and availability analysis method based on the characterization of the dynamic properties (in particular, the stability properties) of routing paths and their corresponding <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths.</b> The key driver underlying this method is that transient but frequent changes in the spatio-temporal properties of routing paths can affect the performance and operating conditions of the corresponding forwarding paths; hence, their reliability. The results obtained by means of this method verify that, although {{the main cause of}} instability results from the forwarding plane dynamics, a second order effect relates <b>forwarding</b> and routing <b>path</b> instability events. Applying our analysis method reveals that the dominant source (main cause) of instability originates indeed from the forwarding plane. This result which confirms previous studies from 2003 further corroborates the assumption that the dynamic properties of routing system are mainly driven by its adaptation to the forwarding system (adaptive routing). However, even if the likelihood of forwarding instability becomes the prominent behavior (cause), about 50 % of them induce routing path instability whereas the corresponding <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> remains unstable. This observation suggests that 50 % of the reactive decisions performed by the BGP routing system (reactive routing) tend to further delay convergence of the <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths.</b> In turn, this observation provides the first indication that simple causal effects can't explain anymore the occurrence of instability. Moreover, more elaborated analysis techniques (such as the one proposed in this paper) are required to explain the interdependent routing and <b>forwarding</b> <b>paths</b> dynamics which affects their reliability and availability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnalysis of real {{datasets}} {{to characterize}} the local stability properties of the Internet routing paths suggests that extending the route selection criteria to account for such property would not increase the routing path length. Nevertheless, even if selecting a more stable routing path could be considered as valuable from a routing perspective, {{it does not necessarily}} imply that the associated <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> would be more stable. Hence, if the dynamics of the Internet routing and forwarding system show different properties, then one can not straightforwardly derive the one from the other. If this assumption is verified, then the relationship between the stability of the <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> (followed by the traffic) and the corresponding routing path as selected by the path-vector routing algorithm requires further characterization. For this purpose, we locally relate, i. e., at the router level, the stability properties of routing path with the corresponding <b>forwarding</b> <b>path.</b> The proposed stability model and measurement results verify this assumption and show that, although the main cause of instability results from the forwarding plane, a second order effect relates <b>forwarding</b> and routing <b>path</b> instability events.
