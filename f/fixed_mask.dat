40|$|Abstract. MDPL is a masked logic {{style that}} unites {{principles}} of dual-rail precharge {{as well as}} masked logic to achieve resistance against differential power analysis attacks. MDPL has received much attention and numerous papers discussing the security provided by MDPL {{as well as its}} weaknesses have been published.

At present, it is unclear to what extent these concepts affect the security provided by MDPL in practice. We fill this gap and present results of an extensive case study of attacks against an MDPL prototype chip. We demonstrate successful DPA attacks and show that MDPL implementations, resistant to standard DPA attacks, can be broken in practice. Further, we show that the underlying concept of the folding attack, i. e. analysis of probability densities, indeed exposes MDPL’s greatest weakness: the masking renders the circuit more vulnerable to attacks than a circuit with a <b>fixed</b> <b>mask.</b> In addition, our analysis leads to novel insights into the power consumption properties of MDPL in real silicon...|$|E

The research merit {{of the process}} is its use in producing {{a new type of}} electrical transducer micro-turbine using a novel axial format. [1] The necessary micro-machining precision for this was achieved by computer-controlling a laser beam using an elevating stage to step a moving mask across a <b>fixed</b> <b>mask,</b> i. e. a variant of dynamic mask-dragging or mask-aperturing. The moving mask image was projected on to a series of flat 600 µm wide, 1000 µm deep preform surfaces, reducing each to 50 µm thickness with curvature. Precise control of each mask in-crement to ablation depth and focus allowed a range of 3 -D curves to be realized. The ablation rate versus surface quality was optimized throughout by ablating just 300 nm per laser pulse and using 2000 pulses spread over 90 sites. The process represents a cost effective means of using basic masks to continuously shape flat surfaces in the axial direction with high aspect ratios, high speed and pre-cision, and is applicable to both micro streamlining and the manufacture of micro expansion nozzles...|$|E

The ability to rapidly reconfigure the spatial profile within the pulse shaper would allow the possibility of shaping to occur on an input pulse-by-pulse basis. For our solution, we turn to the asymmetric Fabry-Perot quantum well modulator for its high-speed functionality and optical bandwidth capabilities. An array of such devices could provide a quickly changing spatial profile that would enable rapid reconfiguration. Device design, fabrication, and testing will be addressed along with pulse shaping experiments and results. ...|$|R

Two sets of a pair of FMA channels, vertically and horizontally disposed, contain the beam rather than define it. They are subject to very large heat fluxes during containment.

Channels are set at grazing angles ranging from 1 to 6 degrees with respect to the beam, {{depending on the type of}} insertion device. APS insertion devices will impose higher heat fluxes on FMAs. Therefore, a need exists to improve the FMA engineering, keeping in the mind the current design criteria and philosophy of FMAs. Preliminary analysis of current heat transfer practice indicates that the major resistance to heat transfer is on the coolant side. Therefore, FMA cooling would benefit from enhanced heat transfer on the coolant side.

Typical implementations used a <b>fixed</b> <b>mask</b> pattern and are designed to operate in the X-Ray or gamma ray bands. Recently applications have emerged in the visible and infra red bands for low cost lens-less imaging systems and system studies have shown that considerable advantages in image resolution may accrue from the use of multiple different images of the same scene – requiring a reconfigurable mask. Previously reported work focused on realising a 2 x 2 cm single chip mask in the mid-IR based on polysilicon micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS) technology and its integration with ASIC drive electronics using conventional wire bonding.

30|$|For OFDMA systems, some {{traditional}} ICIC techniques, such as power control, interference cancellation, fractional frequency reuse, multiple-input multiple-output transmission and space {{division multiple access}} [2], have been proposed. Some of these strategies, however, require knowledge about {{the position of a}} MS relative to it's own and neighbouring BSs [2], which clearly increases the signalling burden in the network. In [8], other specific ICIC techniques are suggested, such as slow power control, frequency division multiplexing resource allocation, and coordination by MS alignment, though management of interference from other cells is not considered. Further research in [9] presents a distributed uplink power allocation technique based on a maximum sum rate optimisation, yielding superior results in terms of average system throughput, however ignoring the tradeoff between cell-edge performance and overall spectral efficiency. In [10], a softer frequency reuse scheme is introduced, where cell-edge power masks are used to mitigate inter-cell interference. These <b>fixed</b> <b>masks</b> cannot, however, adapt to the service-dependent requirements of the neighbouring cells, potentially wasting bandwidth. In [11], the downlink scheduling is formulated as an optimisation problem, and a decomposition of the problem is performed.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of new materials and processes to microfabrication has, in large part, enabled many important advances in microsystems, lab-on-a-chip devices, and their applications. In particular, capabilities for cost-effective fabrication of polymer microstructures were transformed by the advent of soft lithography and other micromolding techniques 1, 2, and this led a revolution in applications of microfabrication to biomedical engineering and biology. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to fabricate microstructures with well-defined nanoscale surface textures, and to fabricate arbitrary 3 D shapes at the micro-scale. Robustness of master molds and maintenance of shape integrity is especially important to achieve high fidelity replication of complex structures and preserving their nanoscale surface texture.

Auto-CPAP devices apply at any time the minimally required pressure to normalise breathing and may improve patient comfort and compliance. We present an open descriptive study of auto-CPAP treatment at home in patients previously managed with conventional CPAP.  METHODS—Fifteen patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), previously treated {{for at least one}} year with standard CPAP, were followed prospectively for a two month period on auto-CPAP. Outcome measures were both subjective evaluation by the patients and objective (polysomnographic) data obtained at one and two months of follow up.  RESULTS—The Epworth sleepiness score did not change significantly between baseline and follow up after one and two months and no systematic changes in CPAP related side effects were reported. Compared with the baseline polysomnographic values without treatment, a significant improvement in both respiratory and sleep parameters was observed during auto-CPAP. These results were not significantly different from those obtained with standard CPAP. A significant correlation was found between the effective CPAP pressure (Peff) and {{the amount of time spent}} below Peff during auto-CPAP treatment (r = 0. 6,p = 0. 01).  CONCLUSION—Long term auto-CPAP treatment in these patients with severe OSA appears to provide comparable efficacy to that of standard CPAP treatment. ...|$|E

If the satellite moves, the star moves on the CCD, and flux is lost outside the mask. We outline several different methods for a jitter correction algorithm developed to use the barycentre data to correct for the flux lost. So far we have obtained the best results with a method that explicitly reconstructs the mean spacecraft attitude per exposure based on a least squares fit of the barycentre displacements. The reconstructed attitude allows us to determine the fraction of the point spread function (PSF) that falls outside the mask per integration interval and per star. This, in turn, allows us to correct the measured fluxes. We present results that examine the improvement in the frequency spectrum, demonstrating that stellar oscillations (if present) are preserved, while jitter frequencies are removed.
