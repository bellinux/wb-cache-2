5000|$|There {{are many}} {{activities}} during the festival, from the massively attended Pregon (opening speech) {{to the final}} fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as [...] "Jota aragonesa" [...] (the most popular dance of folklore music genre), a procession of gigantes y cabezudos, concerts, exhibitions, vaquillas, bullfights, <b>fairground</b> <b>amusements,</b> and fireworks.

5000|$|In 1964, Coney Island's last {{remaining}} large theme park, Steeplechase Park, closed. The rides were auctioned off, and {{the property was}} sold to developer Fred Trump, the father of Donald Trump. Trump, convinced that the amusement area would die off once the large theme parks were gone, wanted to build luxury apartments on the old Steeplechase property. He spent ten years battling in court to get the property rezoned. At one point Trump organized a funeral for amusement parks in Coney Island. Trump invited the press to the funeral where bikini-clad girls first handed out hot dogs, then handed out stones which Fred invited all to cast through the stained-glass windows of the pavilion. Then, pronouncing the amusement park dead, he had the pavilion bulldozed. After a decade of court battles, Trump exhausted all his legal options and the property was still zoned only for amusements. He eventually leased the property to Norman Kaufman, who ran a small collection of <b>fairground</b> <b>amusements</b> on {{a corner of the}} site, calling his amusement park [...] "Steeplechase Park".|$|R
5000|$|BonBon-Land and Gerstlauer {{were awarded}} the [...] "FKF-Award 2003" [...] by Freundeskreis Kirmes und Freizeitparks e.V. (Friends of <b>Fairground</b> and <b>Amusement</b> Association) for the {{construction}} of Vild-Svinet. The coaster was also ranked as the 3rd most innovative coaster of 2003 by COASTER-net. Frommer's included the coaster in their book, Frommer's 500 Adrenaline Adventures. Each award cited the coaster's steeper than vertical drop as being one of the primary justifications for Vild-Svinet's inclusion. Lonely Planet describes the coaster as [...] "bonkers-looking" [...] and notes that it is the most extreme amusement ride at BonBon-Land.|$|R
50|$|From the start, the new pier's {{emphasis}} was on fun rather than the genteel relaxation provided at North Pier. In the early days fun was provided mainly by dancing facilities, but in the 20th century, roller skating was introduced along with <b>fairground</b> rides and <b>amusement</b> machines. Steamboat excursions departed from the landing jetty as they did from North Pier. The dance halls became less popular after the Second World War and the facilities were adapted into a theatre, bars and amusement arcades by the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|The funfair was {{extremely}} popular, with <b>fairground</b> rides and <b>amusements,</b> including a [...] "corkscrew" [...] roller coaster - {{which was at}} Flamingoland in Yorkshire from 1983 to 2011, then at Luna Park in France - ghost train and waltzers, the House that Jack Built, and the Fun House. The Dome also housed an amusement arcade and later a Laser Quest Laser Tag arena. It {{was used as a}} classroom for pupils of Whitley Bay High School during a caretakers' strike in the 1980s, and later became a live music venue, playing host to several bands, including Ash in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the parks stayed {{relatively}} unchanged from the 1970s to mid 1990s, and this situation led to the preparation of a master plan for redeveloping the square, established in 1993. The 1993 master plan guided the ongoing renovation conducted in the late 1990s to the 2000s, and gave the Merdeka square its present look. The aim was to return the function of Merdeka Square as an open space and green area. All buildings were removed and the square was transformed back to greenery. Since the early 1990s the <b>fairground</b> and the <b>amusement</b> park in the southern park were demolished {{had been given the}} old park function once again. The road surrounding the monument is not accessible to motorized traffic.|$|R
