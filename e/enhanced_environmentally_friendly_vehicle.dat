40|$|During the fifties, {{the use of}} LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) was {{promoted}} in Italy and the Netherlands. The Dutch government promulgated tax regulations which made the use of LPG, available in large quentities as a by-product in the refineries, attractive as an automotive fuel. Dedicated heavy-duty vehicles, mainly city buses, {{have been used for}} some time now. The largest fleet of (LPG) city buses have been running in Vienna for a number of years. New interesting developments are being carried out at the moment, as promising markets are developing. Today's engine development is heavily controled by increasingly stringent emission legislation, leading to more rapid developments. The EEV (<b>Enhanced</b> <b>Environmentally</b> <b>Friendly</b> <b>Vehicles)</b> -standards will come into force for polluted areas/cities, creating an extra incentive for the development of extra clean vehicle technology. The future of gaseous fuels depends on the maximum of polluting emission allowed, the technology available and the cost of the concepts developed. Promising developments take place {{in the area of the}} conventional prime mover, the diesel engine. Demonstration projects of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), deNOx-catalysts and particulate traps on diesel engines produce good results. At the end of the day the concept that fulfils all legislative requirements and can be sold at the lowest price will be the winner. And that may be an engine running on a conventional or on an alternative fuel...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} size-resolved {{particle}} and gaseous emissions from 28 individual diesel-fuelled and 7 {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) -fuelled buses, selected from an in-use bus fleet, were characterised for real-world dilution scenarios. The method used was based on using CO 2 as a tracer of exhaust gas dilution. The particles were sampled by using an extractive sampling method and analysed with high time resolution instrumentation EEPS (10 Hz) and CO 2 with a non-dispersive infrared gas analyser (LI- 840, LI-COR Inc. 1 Hz). The gaseous constituents (CO, HC and NO) were measured by using a remote sensing device (AccuScan RSD 3000, Environmental System Products Inc.). Nitrogen oxides, NO x, were estimated from NO by using default NO 2 /NO x ratios from the road vehicle emission model HBEFA 3. 1. The buses studied were diesel-fuelled Euro III–V and CNG-fuelled <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Environmentally</b> <b>Friendly</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (EEVs) with different after-treatment, including selective catalytic reduction (SCR), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and with and without diesel particulate filter (DPF). The primary driving mode applied {{in this study was}} accelerating mode. However, regarding the particle emissions also a constant speed mode was analysed. The investigated CNG buses emitted on average a higher number of particles but less mass compared to the diesel-fuelled buses. Emission factors for number of particles (EF PN) were EF PN, DPF = 4. 4 ± 3. 5 × 10 14, EF PN, no DPF = 2. 1 ± 1. 0 × 10 15 and EF PN, CNG = 7. 8 ± 5. 7 × 10 15 kg fuel − 1. In the accelerating mode, size-resolved emission factors (EFs) showed unimodal number size distributions with peak diameters of 70 – 90 nm and 10 nm for diesel and CNG buses, respectively. For the constant speed mode, bimodal average number size distributions were obtained for the diesel buses with peak modes of ~ 10 nm and ~ 60 nm. Emission factors for NO x expressed as NO 2 equivalents for the diesel buses were on average 27 ± 7 g (kg fuel) − 1 and for the CNG buses 41 ± 26 g (kg fuel) − 1. An anti-relationship between EF NO x and EF PM was observed especially for buses with no DPF, and there was a positive relationship between EF PM and EF CO...|$|R

These engines are also optionally available with <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (EEV) certification, meaning that their emission levels are lower than even the most stringent European Union emissions standards.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we report the first direct {{measurements}} of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in the UK using a vehicle emission remote sensing technique. Measurements of NO, NO 2 and ammonia (NH 3) from almost 70, 000 vehicles were made spanning vehicle model years from 1985 to 2012. These measurements were carefully matched with detailed vehicle information data {{to understand the}} emission characteristics {{of a wide range}} of vehicles in a detailed way. Overall it is found that only petrol fuelled vehicles have shown an appreciable reduction in total NOx emissions over the past 15 – 20 years. Emissions of NOx from diesel vehicles, including those with after-treatment systems designed to reduce emissions of NOx, have not reduced over the same period of time. It is also evident that the vehicle manufacturer has a strong influence on emissions of NO 2 for Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars and urban buses. Smaller-engined Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars are also shown to emit less NO 2 than larger-engined vehicles. It is shown that NOx emissions from urban buses fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are comparable to those using Exhaust Gas Recirculation for Euro V vehicles, while reductions in NOx of about 30 % are observed for Euro IV and EEV vehicles. However, the emissions of NO 2 vary widely dependent on the bus technology used. Almost all the NOx emission from Euro IV buses with SCR is in the form of NO, whereas EEV vehicles (<b>Enhanced</b> <b>Environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>Vehicle)</b> emit about 30 % of the NOx as NO 2. We find similarly low amounts of NO 2 from trucks (3. 5 – 12 t and > 12 t). Finally, we show that NH 3 emissions are most important for older generation catalyst-equipped petrol vehicles and SCR-equipped buses. The NH 3 emissions from petrol cars have decreased by over a factor of three from the vehicles manufactured in the late 1990 s compared with those manufactured in 2012. Tables of emission factors are presented for NOx, NO 2 and NH 3 together with uncertainties to assist the development of new emission inventories...|$|E

40|$|Vehicles {{will remain}} {{important}} transport means {{for decades to}} come. Improving the environmental performance of vehicles is therefore an important issue. But we ought to give a clear answer to what an <b>Environmentally</b> <b>Friendly</b> <b>Vehicle</b> is. Shall we promote these vehicles? What are the experiences? Is it possible to give a sound background for policy making? These are the questions that are dealt with in this study for the Nordic Council of Ministries, Theme Group for Sustainable Mobility. Different criteria are used to define <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the EU, the USA and the Nordic countries. These criteria often mix performance and emission limits with technology and fuels. Certain technologies are pre-qualified as <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly.</b> Alternative technologies and renewable fuels are tempting – but {{are not at all}} a guarantee for great environmental effects.

The Swedish programme, “Miljöfordon”, in Stockholm and Gothenburg is called a success story. Denmark has since 2000 had an energy labelling system for new vehicles. The Danish labelling system is, together with high fees and taxation, thought to have accomplished a highly energy efficient vehicle fleet.
