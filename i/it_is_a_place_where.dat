5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
500|$|Other {{philosophers}} and writers identified as influences include Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ray Brassier, Emil Cioran, and Eugene Thacker. Mathijs Peters, {{in a piece}} for Film International, argued that True Detective probes Schopenhauerian philosophy through its approach to individuality, self-denial, the battle between dark and light, and so forth. Ben Woodard noted the show's evolving philosophy, which examines a setting where culture, religion, and society are direct by-products of biological weakness. Woodward wrote, [...] "Biological programming gets recuperated and socially redistributed visions, faiths, and acerbic personalities take the reins of uncertain ends creating a world where 'people go away'." [...] Even the setting, Fintan Neylan argued, emphasizes a world [...] "where the decrepitude of human ordering cannot be hidden." [...] He stated, [...] "This {{is not a place}} where hope fled; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> hope could never take root. It is with these people and environs that the real horror is sourced." [...] Yet Neylan observed that Cohle's actions are not motivated by misanthropy, rather a drive to challenge [...] "those who try to either disguise or manipulate this frailty of humans for their own benefit." [...] And in doing so, Cohle ultimately confronts [...] "an entire philosophical history which has taken its task as that of sweeping frailty away." [...] Christopher Orr at The Atlantic said True Detective was [...] "Fincherian in the best sense", a fusion of Se7en (1995) and Zodiac (2007), because of its subject matter, sleek cinematography, and [...] "vivid, unsettling" [...] aura.|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{explores the}} issue of {{timelessness}} or eternity even {{within the framework of}} mortal existence. A major trope with which it accomplishes this task is the alchemist's laboratory in the Buendía family home. [...] The laboratory was first designed by Melquíades near the start of the story and remains essentially unchanged throughout its course. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the male Buendía characters can indulge their will to solitude, whether through attempts to deconstruct the world with reason {{as in the case of}} José Arcadio Buendía, or by the endless creation and destruction of golden fish as in the case of his son Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Furthermore, a sense of inevitability prevails throughout the text. [...] This is a feeling that regardless of what way one looks at time, its encompassing nature is the one truthful admission.|$|E

Neither will I in any way countenance the opening up of Carrington--my Carrington--to industrial exploitation for the influx of all and sundry.

60|$|There is {{an island}} in the Indian Ocean, so unfortunate as not yet to have been visited either by Discovery Ships or Missionary Societies. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> all those things are {{constantly}} found which men most desire to see, and with the sight of which they are seldom favoured. It abounds in flowers, and fruit, and sunshine. Lofty mountains, covered with green and mighty forests, except where the red rocks catch the fierce beams of the blazing sun, bowery valleys, broad lakes, gigantic trees, and gushing rivers bursting from rocky gorges, are crowned with a purple and ever cloudless sky. Summer, in its most unctuous state and most mellow majesty, is here perpetual. So intense and overpowering, in the daytime, is the rich union of heat and perfume, that living animal or creature is never visible; and were you and I to pluck, before sunset, the huge fruit from yonder teeming tree, we might fancy ourselves for the moment the future sinners of another Eden. Yet a solitude it is not.|$|E

60|$|KEEGAN. This world, sir, is {{very clearly}} {{a place of}} torment and penance, {{a place where the}} fool flourishes and the good and wise are hated and persecuted, a place where men and women torture one another in the name of love; where {{children}} are scourged and enslaved in the name of parental duty and education; where the weak in body are poisoned and mutilated in the name of healing, and the weak in character are put to the horrible torture of imprisonment, not for hours but for years, in the name of justice. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the hardest toil is a welcome refuge from the horror and tedium of pleasure, and where charity and good works are done only for hire to ransom the souls of the spoiler and the sybarite. Now, sir, there is only one place of horror and torment known to my religion; and that place is hell. Therefore it is plain to me that this earth of ours must be hell, and that we are all here, as the Indian revealed to me--perhaps he was sent to reveal it to me to expiate crimes committed by us in a former existence.|$|E
60|$|It {{is obvious}} {{that there is a}} great deal of {{difference}} between being international and being cosmopolitan. All good men are international. Nearly all bad men are cosmopolitan. If we are to be international we must be national. And it is largely because those who call themselves the friends of peace have not dwelt sufficiently on this distinction that they do not impress the bulk of any of the nations to which they belong. International peace means a peace between nations, not a peace after the destruction of nations, like the Buddhist peace after the destruction of personality. The golden age of the good European is like the heaven of the Christian: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> people will love each other; not like the heaven of the Hindu, a place where they will be each other. And in the case of national character this can be seen in a curious way. It will generally be found, I think, that the more a man really appreciates and admires the soul of another people the less he will attempt to imitate it; he will be conscious that there is something in it too deep and too unmanageable to imitate. The Englishman who has a fancy for France will try to be French; the Englishman who admires France will remain obstinately English. This is to be particularly noticed in the case of our relations with the French, because it is one of the outstanding peculiarities of the French that their vices are all on the surface, and their extraordinary virtues concealed. One might almost say that their vices are the flower of their virtues.|$|E
60|$|The {{party of}} {{progress}} also talks {{much about the}} prospects of confederation with the Cape, if once they get responsible government. Most people, however, will think that the fact of their being independent, and therefore {{responsible for their own}} defence, will hardly prove an inducement to the Cape to offer to share those responsibilities. The only confederation possible to Natal as a self-governing community will be a Boer confederation, to which it may be admitted--on certain terms. Another cry is that the moment responsible government is established immigrants will flow into the country, and thus restore the balance of races. I take the liberty to doubt the truth of this supposition. The intending emigrant from Europe does not, it is true, understand {{the ins and outs of}} the Natal native question, but he does now that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> there are wars and rumours of wars, and where he might possibly be killed, and the result is that he wisely goes to some other colony, that has equal advantages to offer and no Kafirs. To suppose that the emigrant would go to Natal when he came to understand that it was an independent settlement of a few white men, living in the midst of a mass of warlike Kafirs, when Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States, are all holding out their arms to him, is to suppose him a bigger fool than he is. At the best of times Natal is not likely to attract many desirable emigrants: under a responsible government I do not believe that it will attract any.|$|E
