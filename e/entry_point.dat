5|$|Canoeing {{or other}} non-motorized boating {{is the most}} popular method of {{exploring}} the BWCAW. A 2007 study found more than 94% of overnight visitors used a non-motorized boat to travel through the park. The BWCAW's size and abundance of campsites, lakes, rivers and portage trails allow for almost countless options for different routes. Many online maps and guidebooks offer suggested routes based on <b>entry</b> <b>point,</b> duration and difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Market Street is {{a unique}} set in the Modular Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and is {{recommended}} for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller than the others {{was to provide a}} lower cost <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> into the Modular Houses series.|$|E
5|$|Permits are {{required}} for all overnight visits to the BWCAW. Quota permits {{are required}} for groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW entry points. From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.|$|E

50|$|<b>Entry</b> <b>points</b> apply both {{to source}} code and to {{executable}} files. However, in day-to-day software development, programmers specify the <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> only in source code, {{which makes them}} much better known. <b>Entry</b> <b>points</b> in executable files depend on the application binary interface (ABI) of the actual operating system, and are generated by the compiler or linker (if not fixed by the ABI). Non-executable object files may also have <b>entry</b> <b>points,</b> which are used later by the linker when generating <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> of an executable file.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in February, {{with the}} help of the French {{ambassador}} Léon Roches, a plan was formulated to stop the imperial court's advance at Odawara, the last strategic <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> to Edo, but Yoshinobu decided against the plan. Shocked, Léon Roches resigned from his position. In early March, under the influence of the British minister Harry Parkes, foreign nations signed a strict neutrality agreement, according to which they could not intervene or provide military supplies to either side until the resolution of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Midway between Natural Bridge and Harrisville, NY3 intersects NY812. NY812 turns east onto NY3, {{following}} NY3 northeast into St. Lawrence County before splitting to {{the northwest}} between Harrisville and Pitcairn. Shortly after departing NY812, NY3 enters Adirondack Park. The route follows a largely eastwest routing from its <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> to Tupper Lake, where it merges with NY30. Near Upper Saranac Lake, NY30 heads north toward Malone as NY3 continues northeast through nearby Saranac Lake toward Plattsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Southwark {{was settled}} by the Romans around 43 CE. It {{served as an}} <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> into London from {{southern}} England, particularly along Watling Street, the Roman road from Canterbury; this ran into what is now Southwark's Borough High Street and from there north to old London Bridge. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including Geoffrey Chaucer's Tabard Inn. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, bear baiting, theatres (including Shakespeare's Globe) and prisons. In 1796 there were five prisons in Southwark—the Clink, King's Bench, Borough Compter, White Lion and the Marshalsea—compared to 18 in London as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The $4.2 million {{expansion}} {{will expand}} the rail trail parking lot from 70 spaces to 210. Completion {{is scheduled for}} spring 2018. A handicapped-accessible sidewalk and a kiss-and-ride lane / bus loop will be constructed next to the station, with plans for a future pedestrian plaza and restrooms where the USO building was located. The project will not include renovations to make the station handicapped accessible, which would have substantially increased the project cost. However, with the parking issues settled and the accessible <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> in place, Ayer may {{be included in the}} next round of MBTA station overhaul projects.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for {{passengers}} and mail. It had a signal station (built 1872) {{and a time}} ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for First Division clubs. Bolton Wanderers were drawn away at Accrington Stanley but, following a request to the FA, the match was switched to Bolton for crowd safety reasons. Bolton's David Jack scored the only goal {{of the game in}} an unexpectedly close contest. To the resentment of the Bolton crowd, Ted Vizard was sent off {{for the first time in}} his career, leading the referee to require a police escort to the railway station. In the fourth round Bolton were held to a surprise draw at Third Division Bournemouth. The Wanderers lost Bill Cope to injury after fifteen minutes. A 1–0 half-time lead quickly turned into a 2–1 deficit early in the second half but, with five minutes remaining, Jack scored an equaliser.|$|E

5|$|In January 1947, the 6th Airborne Division {{was moved}} to {{northern}} Palestine, swapping locations with the 1st Infantry Division. The 3rd Parachute Brigade took over responsibility for Haifa, which was considered a problem area. The brigade had to guard the docks and port of Haifa, which were the main <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for immigrants arriving in the country. In addition, the many oil pipelines and installations in the region were a potential target for sabotage. The brigade's first operation was imposing a curfew on the Jewish quarter after the kidnapping of two Britons {{in retaliation for the}} death sentence imposed on Dov Gruner. The next major operation was in July, when an indefinite night time curfew was imposed, in response to several attacks in and around the city. The curfew lasted {{until the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1874 as a {{replacement}} for Bishopsgate station as the Great Eastern Railway's main London terminus. By 1895 it had the largest number of platforms on any terminal railway station in London. During the First World War, an air raid on the station in 1917 led to 162 deaths. In the build-up to the Second World War, the station served as the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for thousands of child refugees arriving in London as part of the Kindertransport rescue mission. The station was damaged by the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, and during the 7 July 2005 terrorist attacks in the city seven passengers were killed when a bomb exploded aboard an Underground train just after it had departed from Liverpool Street.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for First Division clubs. Everton were drawn to play Leicester City at Filbert Street, an all First Division tie. The match was close; Dixie Dean scored for Everton after three minutes, but Leicester quickly levelled the score. A goal by Jimmy Stein gave Everton a 2–1 half-time lead, but Leicester again equalised. James Dunn eventually scored to secure a 3–2 win for Everton. Second Division Bury provided the opposition in the fourth round. Tommy Johnson scored twice for Everton in the opening half-hour. From that point, though Bury enjoyed significant spells of possession, Everton thwarted their efforts by preying on Bury mistakes. In the second half Dean added a third goal from a rebounded Cliff Britton free-kick, and Bury scored a late consolation goal. Everton were drawn at to play Leeds United {{at home in the}} fifth round. Leeds' strong league form meant Everton entered the match as slight underdogs despite home advantage. Everton goalkeeper Ted Sagar made two important saves in the first half to deny Arthur Hydes and Billy Furness. Everton the gained the upper hand and scored twice, Dean with the first, and Stein with the second, direct from a corner.|$|E
5|$|Poti is {{the crucial}} port of Georgia on the Black Sea {{and serves as}} an {{essential}} <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia. Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the port. Russia positioned ships {{in the vicinity of}} Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008. The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said that Russian troops were in Poti, although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by Russian troops in Poti. Russian deputy chief of the General staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied the Russian presence in Poti the following day. One day after Russia's declaration of the beginning of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 Russian soldiers moved into the port on the morning of 19 August. Russian forces took twenty-one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to a military base occupied by Russian troops in Senaki. The Wall Street Journal said that Russian actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy. Russian military was looting and damaging properties during their presence in Poti, even ransacking toilets.|$|E

5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent warning signs – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{school is}} selective; {{admission}} {{is based on}} assessments in English, mathematics and reasoning, an academic reference from the applicant's current school and an interview.

5|$|Wohlwend met Mike Boxleiter in an {{experimental}} video game development class they took together at Iowa State University. Wohlwend {{had attempted to}} help Boxleiter with a project, but quit after drawing a few aliens. They met again as coworkers at the university's Virtual Reality Application Center during Boxleiter's final year of college. Upon discovering their close interests, they began to work on an Adobe Flash game named Dinowaurs while they completed college. So as to make money while they worked on the game, they founded Intuition Games at the university's Research Park around May 2007. They decided to stay in Ames, Iowa due to its financial feasibility and local connections, but two other team members (friends from Iowa State) lived farther away. They saw Flash games as an easy <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> into full-time self-employment, but planned to eventually work on console platforms such as WiiWare.|$|E
