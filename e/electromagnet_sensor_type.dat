40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), {{with the}} {{cooperation}} of 14 other Federal agencies, has proposed a quality assurance plan for acquiring digital imagery in the United States. This plan is a result of cooperative work with sensor manufacturers, data providers, and the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS). The plan identifies four key components affecting quality when acquiring digital imagery. The four components are 1) <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification, 2) data provider certification, 3) contracting guidelines for procuring digital imagery, and 4) quality assessment guidelines. The implementation details in each component are still being developed and will be further refined; however, the <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification component is the most mature and four key digital aerial sensors systems have completed certification. The <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification process is being further refined 1 through the lessons learned from the initial certifications and certification documentation has been updated. Currently, the <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification approval is being considered as a requirement for procurements for use by officials in the United States. One primary concern is that manufacturers are generally required to perform some sort of acceptance test with each of their prospective buyers, and there is a different process used by each country for procurement and acceptance. Even though the USGS is informally discussing the possibility of a reciprocal <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> certification process with European Spatial Data Research (EuroSDR), Australia, and Canada, there is no commonly accepted procedure that is universally used by all countries.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} one of {{the sensor}} concepts that have been considered for the attitude determination system of the mobile asteroid surface scout (Mascot), flying aboard the Hayabusa 2 spacecraft. Newly developed orientation temperature sensor (OTS) are used to acquire temperature readings from multiple sides of Mascot, and determine {{the orientation of the}} lander relative to the asteroid surface based on these readings. We describe the modelling and hardware testing of the OTS using different optical surfaces with high and low absorptance and emittance. OTS performance is then evaluated under actual mission conditions to determine which <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> or combination of <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> can be used for attitude determination. The results show that both single and multiple <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> concepts can be used to determine the attitude relative to the asteroid surface. A single type low a, high e sensor provides information on which side of the lander is facing the surface, while a combination of two sensors with identical e and very distinct a makes it possible to determine the direction of the Sun with an error of 5 �. While not used as part of Mascot’s attitude determination system due to a response time of 5 – 10 min, opposed to other available, instant <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> (optical, photovoltaic), the OTS {{have been added to the}} Mascot baseline design as a proof of concept, and to collect additional science data during Mascot’s mission on the surface of 1999 JU 3. This provides the opportunity to validate the OTS hardware and concepts as a lightweight, low cost alternative for future missions, and directly compare their performance with Mascot’s other <b>sensor</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

40|$|Torque ripple {{exists at}} {{the output of}} {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) {{as a result of}} current error, non-sinusoidal back-EMF and cogging torque. Since part of the cogging torque component is based on manufacturing error, motor design may not eliminate all torque ripple. One possible method for reducing torque ripple is by injecting the inverse of a torque ripple estimate to the current controller. Torque estimators that include cogging torque rely on feedback from different sensors such as vibration sensors and accelerometers, microphones, speed and torque sensors. This paper outlines a control method that can utilize any sensor with a linear transfer function between the torque and the sensor input. The method determines an estimate of the torque ripple for a number of harmonics simultaneously, as well as the transfer function between the torque and the sensor. Experimental results show different <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> provide similar estimates of the torque with less than 2 % variation in magnitude for the <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> used.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Chinese <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> used for terrestrial remote sensing has necessitated an additional effort to evaluate and standardize the data they acquire. In this study, we assessed the potential use of GF- 1 WFV (Wild Field Camera), ZY- 3 MUX (Multi-spectral camera), and HJ- 1 CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensor data for grassland monitoring by comparing spectral field measurements, vegetation coverage, and the leaf area index (LAI) of grassland stands with reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Based on spectral field measurements, the characteristic differences of spectral response functions of the sensors were analyzed. Based on simulations using the SAIL bidirectional canopy reflectance model coupled with the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model (PROSAIL), we investigated the effects {{of changes in the}} sensors’ zenith angle caused by side sway. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) Differences in the adjusted coefficients of determination (R 2) exist when comparing correlations between the reflectances from the three <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> in different bands. The values of R 2 are 0. 556 – 0. 893 and 0. 819 – 0. 850 for the infrared and red bands, respectively, and these data show a better correlation for the red band than for the infrared band. Fitted slope equations revealed inconsistencies in the data between the different <b>sensor</b> <b>types.</b> In the red band, GF- 1 WFV and HJ- 1 CCD data are the most consistent, but in the near-infrared band, GF- 1 WFV and ZY- 3 MUX data are the most consistent; (2) The correlation of NDVIs obtained from the different <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> is high (R 2 between 0. 758 and 0. 852); however, the consistency is low in that the NDVI based on GF- 1 WFV data is significantly higher than that based on ZY- 3 MUX and HJ- 1 CCD data. In contrast, the mean difference is small between the NDVIs based on ZY- 3 MUX and HJ- 1 CCD; (3) Correlation analysis between ground grass-coverage and measured LAI data shows that the three <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> are better at estimating coverage than the LAI, and that the GF- 1 WFV sensor gave the best performance; (4) Changes in the sensors’ zenith angle caused by side sway were proven to have greater impact on reflectance and NDVI than the spectral response function; (5) For LAI values of 0 – 3, the NDVI changes significantly with increasing LAI, and differences between the three <b>sensor</b> <b>types</b> are obvious. For LAI > 3. 5, the NDVI appears to experience a saturated tendency, which greatly reduces the differences between the sensors...|$|R

40|$|The spline {{section of}} {{helicopter}} gearbox structure {{is susceptible to}} fatigue crack, and non-redundant characteristic leads {{to the need for}} early flaw detection strategies. Acoustic Emission (AE) method relies on propagating elastic waves due to release of energy from active flaws. The initiation of damage is identified using the features of AE waveforms such as energy, amplitude and frequency centroid. The characteristics of the AE features are influenced by <b>sensor</b> <b>type,</b> <b>sensor</b> location and gearbox operational conditions. In this study, the AE data was collected from a helicopter gearbox with a notched spline section and realistic operational conditions using two different AE sensors located at two different positions. The data collection was conducted over one year under various operational conditions. The AE features were extracted from long duration waveforms (100 milliseconds) at every pre-defined time step (every 5 seconds). The frequency domain features of frequency centroid and energy distribution in various frequency bands were compared with gearbox operational conditions such as torque, lift, gyroscopic moment, and temperature. The influences of <b>sensor</b> location, <b>sensor</b> <b>type</b> and operational conditions on the AE features are presented in order to decouple their influences from the AE features due to damage.
