40|$|We {{define a}} robust <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> {{as a model}} where the {{existence}} of an undetectable fault implies the existence of logic redundancy, or more generally, a suboptimality in the synthesis of the circuit. The stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> is robust, but other <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> such as certain bridging <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> are not. A robust <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> provides a mechanism to synthesize circuits in which all the target faults are detectable and 100 % fault coverage is achievable. The ability to achieve 100 % fault coverage, or understand why it is not achievable, is important since the requirement to achieve high test quality translates into a requirement to achieve complete fault coverage for target faults, regardless of the metrics used to measure test quality. We discuss a robust bridging <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> and its use as part of a test generation process for a non-robust bridging <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> (a non-robust bridging <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> may have to be used in order to capture the behavior of bridging defects).

40|$|Abstract—Sequential test {{generation}} {{becomes very}} time consuming when the circuit-under-test has many hard-to-test faults. This happens in cyclic sequential circuit. Design-for-testability method is applied on such circuit {{in order to}} speed up test generation time. However, this introduces huge area overhead. Alternatively, functional test generation is used to generate test sequences. In this option, stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> alone is not sufficient. Functional test generation works based on functional <b>fault</b> <b>model.</b> Several functional <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> have been introduced and few {{of them have been}} shown to have high correlation with stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> through experiment. However, not all the stuck-at faults are considered in the experiment. One of the fault categories which were out of consideration is stuck-at faults in the arithmetic modules. This is because there is no functional <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> correlating well with stuck-at faults in the arithmetic modules. In this work, we refine the functional <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> for arithmetic operations and show the superiority of our extended functional <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> to other functional <b>fault</b> <b>model</b> theoretically and experimentally...|$|R

Matching is re-formulated as a problem of relating faults to known parameters and measurements of a system.

40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} {{we make a}} case for moving the level of test pattern {{generation}} for fabrication faults to the system level. Like many other researchers we feel it is necessary to handle the growing size and complexity of testing of digital systems. As the first step in this direction, system level <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> must be defined. Unlike logic level stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> it is hard to define general <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> at the system level. In this paper, we argue that it is practical and efficient to define application area specific system level <b>fault</b> <b>models.</b> A NoC switch is used as a case study to explain the idea of such system level <b>fault</b> <b>models.</b> We propose two metrics to evaluate the efficiency of system level <b>fault</b> <b>models.</b> We also propose a method for generation of test patterns using system level <b>fault</b> <b>models.</b> Our initial evaluation experiments show that the test patterns generated using the proposed system level faults have much higher fault coverage than purely random test patterns but lower coverage than test pattern generated on actual implementation using the PODEM algorithm. The results of this case study demonstrate that application area specific system level <b>fault</b> <b>models</b> have a good potential for testing complex systems...|$|R
