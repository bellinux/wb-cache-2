5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{was on a}} {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a microphone and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E
25|$|Coarticulation is {{the act of}} {{controlling}} a sound in two places at once. A common example of this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> created by rolling an “r” sound while saying a “v” sound. This is called a voiced alveolar trill with labiodental articulation. Similarly, epenthesis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> created when beatboxers sing and do percussion at the same time. Contrary to what the sound suggests, heir tongue is not in two places at once. This effect is created by placing percussive sounds {{in the middle of}} words.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge is}} {{supposed}} to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont sisters. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops. The most commonly reported phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about. Another legend says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.|$|E

25|$|The band {{released}} two EPs. The {{first is}} the self-titled Evanescence EP (1998), of which about 100 copies were made and distributed at the band's early live performances. The second <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Asleep EP, {{also known as the}} Whisper EP (1999). There was also a third EP called Mystary EP (2003). For their first full-length demo CD, Origin (2000), about 2,500 copies were produced and sold to concert audiences. Origin and the EPs contain demo versions of some songs on their debut album, Fallen. During a radio interview, Lee and Moody encouraged fans to download the band's older songs from the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The slam of Cox's {{dressing}} room door awakens Box, who suddenly remembers his bacon. When {{he sees a}} mutton chop on the gridiron, he assumes it is Bouncer's, and throws it out the window, hitting a pedestrian outside. He once again puts the bacon on the fire, and goes to his {{dressing room}} to retrieve his breakfast utensils. The slam of Box’s dressing room door sends Cox scurrying back in, assuming it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of someone knocking. Seeing the bacon on the gridiron once again, he tosses it out the window, hitting the pedestrian for a second time.|$|E
25|$|The {{bracketed}} term includes two feedback loop speeds; the downstream speed is {{the speed of}} the vortices u and the upstream speed is that of sound c0. The various modes are described by an integer n with an empirical delay constant β (near 0.25). The integer n is closely related to the number of vortices en route to the edge. It is clear from shadowgraphs that the fluctuating force near the downstream edge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> source. Since the Mach number of the flow can be appreciable, refraction makes it difficult to determine the major axis of the dipole-like sound field. The preferred frequencies in shallow cavities are different from those for the edge tone.|$|E

25|$|The {{diameter}} of the orifice and cavity is d, the distance between orifice and cavity is h, and the orifice pressure P was given in kilograms per meter squared. At the lower limit of h the second term disappears. In this case, the equation could have been reformatted {{in terms of the}} acoustical Strouhal number as shown in the second equation above. The characteristic speed U at the nozzle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> speed c0. It is interesting that the number is very close to that found by Strouhal for flow over a cylinder. There are two characteristic length scales. Nozzle diameter d characterizes the sound power while the separation distance h characterizes the frequency.|$|E
500|$|In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Roni Sarig felt that, strong rapping notwithstanding, the album's music [...] "suffers as the duo {{make their}} {{first attempt at}} self-producing" [...] and stated, [...] "Although ATLiens promised {{expanded}} vistas with its interstellar motif, the record delivered something of a sophomore slump... At best, ATLiens <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of an ambitious group searching for its voice." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods of assessing the heart's condition is {{to listen to it}} using a stethoscope. Typically, healthy hearts have only two audible heart sounds, called S1 and S2. The first heart sound S1, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as [...] "lub". The second heart sound, S2, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as [...] "dub". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. S2 may split into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems. Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms. A third heart sound, S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A fourth heart sound S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.|$|E

500|$|Loaded's second album, Sick, was {{released}} on March 20, 2009 in Europe and April 7 in the US, peaking at number 43 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Sick sold 1,400 copies in the first week, while [...] "Flatline" [...] {{was chosen as the}} first single to go to radio. The album received generally positive reviews, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stating [...] "Loaded <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a working band working and an old rocker staying sober, kicking out some lead-heavy grooves and sculptured pieces of sleaze." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, [...] "like Rock 'n' Roll, John Lennon's 1975 {{album of}} primal rock gems, Kisses on the Bottom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a {{musician}} joyfully tapping his roots; and like his former song writing partner, McCartney is better transforming influences than mirroring them. But it's fun, and touching, {{to hear him}} crooning {{his way through the}} great American songbook." [...] In a review of the album for BBC Music, writer Patrick Humphries referred to the collection as [...] "an album of neglected dishes from the great banquet of American popular music", before concluding that [...] "what McCartney accomplishes here, in the best possible sense, is an album ideally made for Easy Listening".|$|E

References to other science fiction stories were made by artist Ivan Reis, who inserted characters such as E.T., ALF and a Predator into large two-page illustrations. The writers also included the sound [...] "EPA" [...] in Green Lantern #25 as a direct reference to a scene in The Simpsons Movie where Comic Book Guy says it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> Green Lantern made when Sinestro [...] threw him in a vat of acid.|$|E

500|$|... "Listening to The Basement Tapes now, {{it seems}} to be the {{beginning}} of what is called Americana or alt.country," [...] wrote Billy Bragg. [...] "The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well." [...] The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, [...] "If rock'n'roll <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, The Waterboys—have since tried to get back to that place." ...|$|E
500|$|Bells were a {{theme of}} {{the opening day of}} the Olympics, {{starting}} at 8.12am with artist Martin Creed's , when bells were rung across the UK including forty strikes of Big Ben. [...] "The sound of bells <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of England", Boyle had told volunteers during rehearsal. Much of the music for the ceremony contained 'bell' references, linking to the large bell forged for the ceremony and evoking bells as [...] "the sound of freedom and peace". [...] Modified sequences based on the traditional British eight-bell peal underlaid [...] "And I Will Kiss" [...] and carried through into the [...] "Tubular Bells"/NHS section, with handbells and a tolling large bell featured on 'Caliban's Dream' and at key points in the ceremony. A handbell chime also played after the close, as the stadium emptied.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} reception to {{the record}} {{was the best of}} the band's career, with five-star reviews from State.ie, Mail on Sunday, the Star and Heinekenmusic.ie, and 4.5 stars from Entertainment.ie, and 4 stars from Hotpress, Irish Times, Irish Independent, Sunday Times, Metro, RTÉ guide, Goldenplec.ie and many more. It was described by entertainment.ie: “Little Sparks is not only an album which is Delorentos’ best work to date, but one of the finest Irish releases of recent times" [...] and by the Irish Times as [...] "Full of brave, bracing and emotionally direct songs, it’s the sound of a band who have found their musical and lyrical groove.", and by hotpress as “An early bid for Irish album of the year… Little sparks <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a group striving to write the flab-free, solid-gold pop record of their lives, mission accomplished.” ...|$|E

500|$|Harry later said: [...] "The newspapers, television, theatres {{and radio}} were all run {{by people of}} a {{different}} generation who {{had no idea of}} what youngsters wanted. For decades they had manipulated and controlled them. Suddenly, there was an awareness of being young, and young people wanted their own styles and their own music, just at the time they were beginning to earn money, which gave them the spending power. Mersey Beat was their voice, it was a paper for them, crammed with photos and information about their own groups, which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout Britain as its coverage extended to other areas." [...] Because of the employment situation in Liverpool at the time, The Daily Worker newspaper denounced the enthusiasm of younger people in Liverpool by saying [...] "The Mersey Sound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of 30,000 people on the dole." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, {{conductor}} Robert Ziegler, {{who worked}} with Radiohead on The King of Limbs, tweeted photos of the band recording with a string orchestra. The strings and choir sections were arranged by Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra with conductor Hugh Brunt; the orchestra had previously worked with Greenwood on his score for the 2012 film The Master. The strings were recorded at RAK Studios in London. Cellist Oliver Coates said: [...] "Nigel, Jonny and Thom all have this awesome relationship, and were so animated during the recording. I remember we were laying down the cello part {{at the end of}} 'Daydreaming' and Thom said, 'That's it – that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the record.'"
