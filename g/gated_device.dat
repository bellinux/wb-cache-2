40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} the successful development of surface-gated, highly phosphorus doped single electron transistors, defined by scanning probe lithography and low-temperature silicon molecular beam epitaxy. In order to fabricate these devices, a custom ultra-high vacuum technique {{was developed to}} grow silicon dioxide as a gate dielectric at low temperatures to prevent thermal diffusion of the buried STM patterned dopants. This technique combined atomic oxygen generated using an RF plasma source with a coincident flux of sublimated silicon to grow silicon dioxide at temperatures down to 160 degrees C at growth rates of 0. 3 nm. min^&# 8722; 1. Using aluminium electrodes deposited on the dielectric, aligned to our buried STM-patterned dopants, {{we were able to}} form atomically-abrupt, surface-gated single electron transistors. We performed chemical and structural analyses of the low temperature oxide using STM, TEM, XPS, and ellipsometry. These analyses indicated the oxide had low suboxide content and a sharp interface with the silicon substrate (1. 25 x 10 ^&# 8722; 12 cm^&# 8722; 2) &# 151; believed to arise from spitting of silicon particles from the Si cell. These defects created leakage paths in C-V and MOSFET devices and, despite reducing the device size to 2 x 10 ^&# 8722; 4 cm^ 2, inhibited electrical optimisation of the oxide. Nevertheless, electrical characterisation of the oxide was possible for several samples and indicated a trap density of Nit < 4. 3 x 10 ^ 11 cm^&# 8722; 2, consistent with that of un-annealed thermal oxide control samples (Nit < 3 &# 8722; 6 x 10 ^ 11 cm^&# 8722; 2). The low temperature UHV silicon dioxide was then incorporated into a surface gated single electron transistor with 200 P donors, whose small size (< 1 x 10 ^&# 8722; 8 cm^ 2) reduced the likelihood of overlap with macroscopic defects. The results were compared to an inplane gated SET of the same size, which did not have a surface gate. The surface gated SET showed gating up to electric fields of 1 MV. cm^&# 8722; 1 &# 151;exceeding the range of all-epitaxial in-plane gates by around one order of magnitude (< 0. 2 MV. cm&# 8722; 1). Using the surface gate, we were able to tune the number of electrons on the dot by 160 e, compared to 30 e using a comparable in-plane <b>gated</b> <b>device.</b> Low-frequency noise measurements showed similar charge noise using the two gating schemes (Qd = 0. 5 %e surface gated vs. 0. 2 %e in-plane gated), however there was severe hysteresis (4000 e) in the gate action of the surface <b>gated</b> <b>device.</b> These results emphasise the greater tunability afforded by surface gated devices but highlight the need for further improvement of the low temperature dielectric...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Cr {{addition}} to the gate of a Pd/AlN/Si Hydrogen gas sensor was investigated by modifying the gate composition and structure. A device with a pure Pd gate responds to hydrogen concentrations as low as 1 ppm, with saturation at about 60 ppm. However, with a Pd 0. 96 Cr 0. 04 alloy <b>gated</b> <b>device,</b> although the response amplitude was reduced, the dynamic range was considerably enhanced, with useful response up to 50, 000 ppm and with quite satisfactory signal to noise down to 50 ppm. Interestingly, in 10 % Cr alloyed to the gate, the response was lost. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this effect, two gate structures were studied where {{a thin layer of}} pure Pd was added to the 4 % alloy gate, one at its outer surface and the other at the gate/AlN interface. The response of the former saturated at 60 ppm and in general behaved comparably to the device with a pure Pd gate, whereas the latter showed the expanded dynamic range. For all these cases the maximum magnitude of the electrical response is in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 V, even though the hydrogen concentration range varies by three orders of magnitude. This indicates that saturating electrical response is highly sensitive to the properties of the gate outer surface, whereas hydrogen sensitivity is highly dependent on the amount of hydrogen reaching the interface between metal gate and insulator.

The devices exhibit pronounced memory retention with a memory window in excess of 4 V realized using an operating voltage less than 6 V. Gate polarity induced motion of oxygen vacancies in the gate insulator is proposed to {{play a vital role}} in emulating synaptic behavior, directly measured as the transmission of a signal between the source and drain (S/D) terminals, but with the added benefit of independent control of synaptic weight. Unlike in two terminal memristor/resistive switching devices, multistate memory levels are demonstrated using the gate terminal without hampering the signal transmission across the S/D electrodes. Synaptic functions in the devices can be emulated using a low programming voltage of 200 mV, an order of magnitude smaller than in conventional resistive random access memory and other field effect transistor based synaptic technologies. Robust synaptic properties demonstrated using fully transparent, ecofriendly inorganic materials chosen here show greater promise in realizing scalable synaptic devices compared to organic synaptic and other liquid electrolyte <b>gated</b> <b>device</b> technologies.

This is so because of its very special properties like high charge carrier mobility, highly linear dispersion relation, high current carrying capacity and so on. However, since we have a finite resistance at Dirac point, the on/off ratio in graphene devices is sufficiently low, making graphene devices not so suitable for logical applications. At the same time, the 1 /f noise, which is understood till now to originate from surface disorders like those observed in a two-dimensional electron gas system like graphene and is a major unwanted outcome in mesoscopic regime devices, reduces very much at high frequencies, making these devices good candidates for high frequency analogue applications.

Spins associated with impurities and quantum dots in silicon are an ideal physical platform for quantum bits (qubits) - the fundamental element of a quantum computer - due to (i) their potential for scalability and (ii) long coherence times. There are three crucial elements of a spin based quantum computer: (i) a well defined spin qubit, that can be read out and controlled in a <b>gated</b> <b>device,</b> (ii) precise control and tunability of exchange interaction between two spins, and (iii) a robust spin transport mechanism for transferring the spin state to {{different parts of the}} quantum computer. This thesis presents detailed electrostatic and quantum mechanical modeling of several spin-hosting nanostructures that can demonstrate the above building blocks. The achievements of this thesis are enumerated below. (i) We demonstrate a metrology technique that locates impurity spin qubits to a precision several thousand times smaller than the experiment. (ii) With a numerically accurate technique, we investigate a particular scheme for tuning the exchange interaction between two impurity spins, and reveal exchange tunabilities much larger than current predictions.

We present advancements of the alignment strategy for patterning ex-situ metallic contacts and top gates over the buried dopant devices.

In general, field effect transistors (FETs), electric double layer field effect transistors (EDL-FETs), and photodetectors are crucial part of several electronics based applications such as tele-communication, bio-sensing, and opto-electronic industry. After the discovery of graphene, several 2 D semiconductor materials like TMDs (MoS 2, WS 2, and MoSe 2 etc.), group III-VI materials (InSe, GaSe, and SnS 2 etc.) are being studied rigorously in order to develop them as components in next generation FETs. Traditionally, thin films of ternary system of Copper Indium Selenide have been extensively studied and used in optoelectronics industry as photoactive component in solar cells. Thus, it is expected that atomically thin 2 D layered structure of Copper Indium Selenide can have optical properties that could potentially be more advantageous than its thin film counterpart and could find use for developing next generation nano devices with utility in opto/nano electronics. Field effect transistors were fabricated using few-layers of CuIn 7 Se 11 flakes, which were mechanically exfoliated from bulk crystals grown using chemical vapor transport technique. Our FET transport characterization measurements indicate n-type behavior with electron field effect mobility µFE ≈ 36 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1 at room temperature when Silicon dioxide (SiO 2) is used as a back gate. We found that in such back gated field effect transistor an on/off ratio of 10 ^ 4 and a subthreshold swing ≈ 1 V/dec can be obtained. Our investigations further indicate that Electronic performance of these materials can be increased significantly when gated from top using an ionic liquid electrolyte [1 -Butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM-PF 6) ].

The thesis describes {{the impact of the}} Al 2 O 3 dielectric on the electrical proper- ties of the buried nanostructure and successful efforts to maintain the integrity of the dielectric whilst contacting the buried donor layers in silicon. Dose rates are optimized for the EBL resist to contact the buried donor device. Moreover, with the optimization of the etch rate of the deposited Al 2 O 3 to minimize the dielectric undercut, the top gate was successfully implemented on 3 types of donor based devices. In the first device a 2 D δ-layer, the implementation of top gate shows a effective gate range of - 4 V to 4 allowing ∼ 3 change in the carrier density of the highly doped (∼ 1014 cm− 2) δ-layer in silicon. In the second device an Al 2 O 3 dielectric and a top gate was integrated onto a precision STM-patterned SET. An increase in the overall tunability of the SET iii quantum dot was observed using the top gate owing to its large lever arm (∼ 4 times that of the in-plane gate) with no significant reduction in the charging energy of the quantum dot. An enhanced gating range of - 4 V to 4 V was observed for the SET quantum dot device. Additionally, the patterned top <b>gated</b> <b>device</b> demonstrated exceptional stability with the lowest noise and drift of all devices and a successful dynamic frequency response up to 1 MHz. In the third device the top gate and an Al 2 O 3 dielectric was incorporated into a precision STM-patterned 4 quantum dot device with the aim to capacitively couple two singlet-triplet qubits. Without the top gate the limited in-plane gate range did not allow any singlet-triplet inter-dot transitions in the gate space. However, after successful patterning of a top gate, two new inter-dot transitions were accessible in the gate range, with one of them being a singlet-triplet type inter-dot transition. An enhanced gate range of - 4 V to 4 V was again observed for the top gate patterned on top of the 4 quantum dot.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{semiconductor}} nanowires and nanotubes have garnered increased attention for their unique properties. With their nanoscale dimensions comes high surface area and quantum confinement, promising enhancements {{in a wide}} range of applications. 1 -dimensional nanostructures are especially attractive for energy conversion applications where photons, phonons, and electrons come into play. Since the bohr exciton radius and phonon and electron mean free paths are on the same length scales as nanowire diameters, optical, thermal, and electrical properties can be tuned by simple nanowire size adjustments. In addition, the high surface area inherent to nanowires and nanotubes lends them towards efficient charge separation and superior catalytic performance. In thermoelectric power generation, the nanoscale wire diameter can effectively scatter phonons, promoting reductions in thermal conductivity and enhancements in the thermoelectric figure of merit. To that end, single-crystalline arrays of PbS, PbSe, and PbTe nanowires have been synthesized by a chemical vapor transport approach. The electrical and thermal transport properties of the nanowires were characterized to investigate their potential as thermoelectric materials. Compared to bulk, the lead chalcogenide nanowires exhibit reduced thermal conductivity below 100 K by up to 3 orders of magnitude, suggesting that they may be promising thermoelectric materials. Smaller diameters and increased surface roughness are expected to give additional enhancements. The solution-phase synthesis of PbSe nanowires via oriented attachment of nanoparticles enables facile surface engineering and diameter control. Branched PbSe nanowires synthesized by this approach showed near degenerately doped charge carrier concentrations. Compared to the bulk, the PbSe nanowires exhibited a similar Seebeck coefficient and a significant reduction in thermal conductivity in the temperature range 20 K to 300 K. Thermal annealing of the PbSe nanowires allowed their thermoelectric properties to be controllably tuned by increasing their carrier concentration or hole mobility. After optimal annealing, single PbSe nanowires exhibited a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0. 12 at 300 K. In addition, using a field-effect <b>gated</b> <b>device,</b> the Seebeck coefficient of single PbSe nanowires could be tuned from 64 to 193 μV*K - 1. This direct electrical field control of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient suggests a powerful strategy for optimizing ZT in thermoelectric devices and these results represent the first demonstration of field-effect modulation of the thermoelectric figure of merit in a single semiconductor nanowire. This novel strategy for thermoelectric property modulation could prove especially important in optimizing the thermoelectric properties of semiconductors where reproducible doping is difficult to achieve. Recent theoretical work has shown large enhancements in ZT for single-crystal nanowires containing nanoscale interfaces along their lengths. M 2 O 3 (ZnO) n (M = In, Ga, Fe) superlattice nanowires were synthesized via a novel solid-state diffusion approach to investigate this possible enhancement. Using atomic resolution Z-contrast STEM imaging a detailed structural analysis was performed on In 2 -x Ga x O 3 (ZnO) n nanowires, leading to the discovery that octahedral inclusions within the superlattice structure are likely generated through a defect-assisted process. Single-nanowire thermal and electrical measurements onIn 2 -x Ga x O 3 (ZnO) n reveal a simultaneous improvement in all contributing factors to the thermoelectric figure of merit, giving an order of magnitude enhancement over similar bulk materials at room temperature. This is the first report of enhancement of all three thermoelectric parameters (Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal resistivity) for a nanowire system. Photoelectrochemical water splitting is another exciting renewable energy application that can benefit from the high surface area of nanomaterials. Recently, (Ga 1 -x Zn x) (N 1 -x O x) has gained widespread attention as a high efficiency material for visible-light-driven H 2 and O 2 generation. To improve the crystallinity of the material and reduce charge recombination (Ga 1 -x Zn x) (N 1 -x O x) nanotubes were synthesized by epitaxial coating of GaN onto ZnO nanowires. The nanotubes were single-crystalline, solid solutions of GaN and ZnO with ZnO compositions up to 10 % and bandgaps as low as 2. 6 eV. Incorporation of In into these nanotubes pushed the absorption even further into the visible. After decoration with Rh 2 -y Cr y O 3 nanoparticle cocatalysts, (Ga 1 -x Zn x) (N 1 -x O x) nanotubes spontaneously generated H 2 in aqueous solutions under illumination. The photoanodic properties of these nanotubes are under investigation. The significant reductions in thermal conductivity achieved using lead chalcogenide and In 2 -x Ga x O 3 (ZnO) n nanowires highlight their use in thermoelectric power generation. The promise of 1 -dimensional materials for energy conversion is further evident in the superior crystalline quality and high surface areas of the (Ga 1 -x Zn x) (N 1 -x O x) nanotubes. As research continues along these direction we move ever closer toward implementation of nanowires and nanotubes for clean, renewable, and more efficient energy use...|$|E

A floating gate MOSFET structure, in which tunneling occurs {{at the corners of}} a polysilicon slab, has been fabricated using a standard 1. 2 p. m n-well CMOS process. The analog storage performance of the floating gate is evaluated. A three-dimensional device simulator, DAVINCI, is used to characterize the field enhancement due to geometry. The charg-transfer behavior of floating <b>gate</b> MOS <b>devices</b> is thoroughly analyzed and modelled.

MESFETs with silver oxide (AgOx) and iridium oxide (IrOx) Schottky gates with mobilities up to 70 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 {{were subjected to}} extensive bias and illumination stress tests. Device instability appeared to be strongly dependent on gate metal type, bias conditions and ZnO film morphology. Positive bias stress of AgOx <b>gated</b> <b>devices</b> resulted in irreversible damage that {{is thought to be}} due to Ag electromigration across the gate interface.

40|$|Wide-field {{continuous}} wave fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging, frequency domain photon migration, and spatially modulated imaging {{have the potential}} to provide quantitative measurements in vivo. However, most of these techniques have not yet been successfully translated to the clinic due to challenging environmental constraints. In many circumstances, cardiac and respiratory motion greatly impair image quality and∕or quantitative processing. To address this fundamental problem, we have developed a low-cost, field-programmable gate array–based, hardware-only <b>gating</b> <b>device</b> that delivers a phase-locked acquisition window of arbitrary delay and width that is derived from an unlimited number of pseudo-periodic and nonperiodic input signals. All device features can be controlled manually or via USB serial commands. The working range of the device spans the extremes of mouse electrocardiogram (1000 beats per minute) to human respiration (4 breaths per minute), with timing resolution ⩽ 0. 06 %, and jitter ⩽ 0. 008 %, of the input signal period. We demonstrate the performance of the <b>gating</b> <b>device,</b> including dramatic improvements in quantitative measurements, in vitro using a motion simulator and in vivo using near-infrared fluorescence angiography of beating pig heart. This <b>gating</b> <b>device</b> should help to enable the clinical translation of promising new optical imaging technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of gate dopant concentration and thermal budget on {{the reliability of}} tunnel dielectric films was stud-ied. Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitors were furnace annealed after gate formation, floating <b>gate</b> <b>devices</b> were fabricated with interpoly dielectric films either grown by furnace oxidation or deposited by rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD); the latter process {{is associated with a}} much lower thermal budget. Ion implanted amorphous silicon was employed for the gate electrodes of the MOS capacitors and for the floating gate layers of the memory devices. The reliability of the dielectrics was evaluated under a constant current stress, and the cycling endurance of the floating <b>gate</b> <b>devices</b> was examined. It was found that tap generation and charge trapping increase with increasing annealing time and increasing dopant concentration, while charge to breakdown (Q 84) decreases with increasing annealing time. The cycling endurance plot for the floating <b>gate</b> <b>devices</b> revealed little distortion of the threshold voltage window for devices with the low thermal budget RTCVD interpoly dielectric film. Based on this study, a low thermal budget process is preferable for the formation of the interpoly dielectric...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{potential}} problems of a Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD) -based Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the Ion back Flow (IBF) : ions generated through the avalanche amplification process flow back to the drift volume of the TPC and disarrange an electric field inside it. Consequently non-negligible degradation of azimuthal spatial resolution is caused due to this IBF. Meanwhile, {{it is necessary to}} collect primary ionized electrons to maintain intrinsic performance of the MPGDs. The MPGD based TPC is currently planned {{to be used as a}} central tracking detector of the International Large Detector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future International Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal spatial resolution of less than 100 μ m over the drift length of the TPC to attain high momentum resolution. Because of a unique beam structure of the ILC, the IBF is a critical issue for the realization of the ILD-TPC. Not only to suppress the ion back-flow to the drift volume, but also to allow the primary electrons pass through, a large aperture GEM-like <b>gating</b> <b>device</b> has been developed. Several bench tests for confirming the performance of the <b>gating</b> <b>device</b> have been conducted, besides that, beam test with the full detector module equipped with the <b>gating</b> <b>device</b> was carried out to verify the resolution that the full module can provide. As a result, it turned out that the developed <b>gating</b> <b>device</b> fulfills requirements for maintaining the performance of the MPGD based TPC, and it has sufficient performance for the central tracker of the ILD at the ILC.
