5|$|Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 {{and found}} himself facing the dilemma of having many {{supporters}} in the city, but little money. A <b>family</b> <b>council</b> was held there by the Ayyubid emirs of Egypt where {{it was decided that}} al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, Saladin's nephew, would launch an expedition against the coastal region of Barqa (Cyrenaica) west of Egypt with a force of 500 cavalry. In order to justify the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking them for their robberies of travelers and ordering them to pay the alms-tax (zakat). The latter was to be collected from their livestock.|$|E

25|$|Brenna's last {{building}} in Saint Petersburg was a wooden theatre commissioned by Antonio Casassi in 1801; in 1832 Carlo Rossi {{replaced it with}} present-day Alexandrinsky Theatre building. Murder of Paul (March 11, 1801) and ascension of Alexander I of Russia spelled end of Brenna's career; he was not even invited to decorate the funeral ceremonies. Alexander clearly preferred the art of Quarenghi and Andrey Voronikhin. The <b>family</b> <b>council</b> decided to leave Russia for Saxony; other Italians (Concensio Albani, Antonio Rusca, Giuseppe Sarti) followed, for different reasons.

50|$|To {{prevent the}} marriage, Tatiana's father, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, demanded that Konstantine leave Saint Petersburg, {{prompting}} the Georgian nobleman {{to return to}} his hometown of Tiflis (Tbilisi, Georgia), and awaiting military deployment to Tehran. As a result of his departure, Konstantine and Tatiana remained apart for an entire year. Their love, however, withstood the time and distance. Due to Tatiana's stubbornness, three Imperial <b>Family</b> <b>Councils</b> were convened on the matter of marriage, with the participation of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia himself. The final outcome of these <b>family</b> <b>councils</b> was that the Emperor issued an order, allowing the couple to get married.

2500|$|Government {{officials}} of all ranks expected the new tsar just as eagerly. On , Minister of Finance Georg von Cancrin ordered minting {{of a new}} coin bearing the profile of Emperor and Autocrat Constantine. Cancrin attended the [...] meeting of the State Council and was {{fully aware of the}} unfolding controversy, yet acted in confidence that Constantine was the emperor. This confidence persisted despite the suspicious silence of Grand Duke Michael and his retinue. Michael did not pledge allegiance to Constantine and evaded all inquiries about His Majesty. Rumours and speculations made Michael's presence in the palace intolerable and the <b>family</b> <b>council</b> dominated by Empress Maria decided that he must return to Warsaw and personally persuade Constantine to come to Saint Petersburg.|$|E
2500|$|In 1859, Sarah {{learned that}} her father had died overseas. Her mother summoned a <b>family</b> <b>council,</b> {{including}} Morny, {{to decide what to do}} with her. Morny proposed that Sarah should become an actress, an idea that horrified Sarah, as she had never been inside a theater. [...] Morny arranged for her to attend her first theater performance at the Comedie Française in a party which included her mother, Morny, and his friend Alexandre Dumas, père. The play they attended was Brittanicus, by Jean Racine, followed by the classical tragedy Amphytrion by Plautus. Sarah was so moved by the emotion of the play, she began to sob loudly, disturbing the rest of the audience. Morny and others in their party were angry at her and left, but Dumas comforted her, and later told Morny that he believed that she was destined for the stage. After the performance, Dumas called her [...] "my little star".|$|E

2500|$|Trump {{may have}} {{strategically}} directed {{money from the}} Trump Foundation to support his presidential campaign. In one case, the grants were used specifically to pay for newspaper ads. In October 2016 RealClearPolitics reported that Trump directed significant amounts of foundation money to conservative organizations, possibly in return for political support and access. [...] The news organization found that, from 2011 through 2014, Trump had [...] "harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups.... In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president." [...] At {{least two of the}} groups are based in Republican-leaning early presidential primary states. In addition to Citizens United (above), groups include Iowa's The Family Leader, the South Carolina Palmetto <b>Family</b> <b>Council,</b> the American Conservative Union, and the American Spectator Foundation. Trump's granting of foundation money to these groups could have violated the law, if it was in return for his personal right to speak or gain access to networking events.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1990s, {{senior members}} of the Bagrationi-Mukhraneli {{descendants}} began re-patriating to Georgia from Spain, ending generations of exile. Irakli's elder son, Prince Georgi Bagrationi-Mukhraneli, was officially recognized by government and church leaders when he brought his father's remains from Spain to rest with those of his ancestors in Svetitskhoveli Cathedral at Mtskheta in 1995, and took up residence in Tbilisi in 2005, where he died. His eldest son, Prince Irakli (Erekle), born 1972), moved to Georgia in 1999 and, although previously embraced as a future pretender to the throne by some Georgian monarchists, has moved back to Spain and deferred his own dynastic claim, since {{the death of his father}} in 2008, to that of his younger brother, Prince Davit (born 1976). Davit took up residence in Tbilisi, obtained Georgian citizenship, claimed the Mukhraneli dynastic titles, and became Head of the <b>Family</b> <b>Council.</b> The Bagration Mukhraneli is the senior surviving legitimate branch of the Bagration patrilineage, descending directly from King Constantine II of Georgia.
