5|$|The last {{important}} {{source for the}} history of Ludgarda are Annals of Jan Długosz, who wrote about this events almost two centuries after (around 1480). Długosz was the first chronicler who locates Poznań as the place of Ludgarda's death.

5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour is prefigured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the English had {{dominated}} {{the trade in}} spices and textiles with Italy and Turkey. England consumed most of the olive oil and currants exported from those lands. However, after 1648 here too occurred a complete reversal {{in favor of the}} Dutch. The Genoese shifted their purchases to the Dutch entrepot and started to use Dutch shipping for their carrying trade predominantly. This was mostly due to the far-lower shipping rates the Dutch charged. But other factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> rise of the share the Dutch obtained in the intra-Mediterranean trade were the grip they obtained on the trade in Spanish bullion (often reminted as Dutch trade coins of high quality) to the Levant, and the progress the Dutch fine-cloth industry made with their products that were of a higher quality than the English. As a result, the English were thrown on the defensive in this area, too. To add insult to injury more and more imports that had reached England directly before, were from now on re-exported from the Amsterdam entrepot in Dutch ships.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{its great}} size and tusks, the walrus {{has only two}} natural predators: the killer whale (orca) and the polar bear. [...] The walrus does not, however, {{comprise}} a significant component of either predator's diets. Both the orca and the polar bear are also most likely to prey on walrus calves. The polar bear often hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming the individuals crushed or wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> exodus, typically younger or infirm animals. The bears also isolate walruses when they overwinter and are unable to escape a charging bear due to inaccessible diving holes in the ice. However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare. Walruses {{have been known to}} fatally injure polar bears in battles if the latter follows the other into the water where the bear is at a disadvantage. Polar bear–walrus battles are often extremely protracted and exhausting, and bears have been known to forgo the attack after injuring a walrus. Orcas regularly attack walrus, although walruses are believed to have successfully defended themselves via counterattack against the larger cetacean. However, orcas have been observed successfully attacking walruses with few or no injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Truffaut chose {{pre-recorded}} {{music from}} composer Maurice Jaubert's 1936 [...] "Concert Flamand", {{with whom he}} had already collaborated four times, and played it on set {{in order to create a}} rhythm and establish a religious, ritualistic atmosphere for the cast and crew.

[...] Filmmaker François Porcile later said [...] "It's not surprising to find, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> explosive tension and somber conviction of his acting, a direct echo of Jaubert's style, with its gathering momentum and sudden restraint, its reticence and violence." [...] Truffaut explained: [...] "I realized that his music, full of clarity and sunlight, was the best to accompany the memory of all these dead." [...] However, an infrequent use of music throughout the final film sees a consistent quietness take place, which is regarded to have masked [...] "an exploration of human isolation in an inhuman society and of the strength and limitations of moral and aesthetic purity."

2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Lucy Walker is well documented, but nearly every source contains some contradictions, garbled names, or incomplete information. Eyewitnesses included Captain Dunham of the snagboat Gopher, an anonymous gentleman from Baltimore, the pilot Capt. Thompson, {{and a group of}} ministers and laymen aboard the Lucy Walker. [...] The latter told about their misadventures during and after the explosion, but somehow failed to notice or mention that the owner of the vessel was an American Indian, that drinking and gambling was present, or that the boat was engaged in a race with another boat. [...] Most of the newspaper accounts also failed to note this aspect of the accident. The owner of the ship was identified in most newspapers as Captain David Vann, possibly confusing him with a cousin of that name who had served as the Treasurer of the Cherokee Nation. This David Vann was a brother of Joseph ("Tenulte") Vann. [...] Various sources provide estimates of fatalities widely ranging from 18 to more than 100 deaths. [...] Albert Koch misheard the name of the vessel as [...] "Louise Walker." [...] Even the date of the accident has frequently been listed in error in many reference works, which have the date as October 22 or 25, 1844.

2500|$|Shelley, in this poem, {{associates}} orgasm {{with death}} {{when he writes}} [...] "the death which lovers love". In French literature, the term la petite mort (the little death) is a famous euphemism for orgasm; it is the representation of man who forgets himself and the world during orgasm. Jorge Luis Borges, in the same vision, wrote {{in one of the}} several footnotes of [...] "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" [...] that one of the churches of Tlön claims Platonically that [...] "All men, in the vertiginous moment of coitus, are the same man. All men who repeat a line from Shakespeare are William Shakespeare." [...] Shakespeare himself was knowledgeable of this idea: lines [...] "I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes" [...] and [...] "I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom", said respectively by Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing and by King Lear in the play of that ilk, are interpreted as [...] "to die in a woman's lap" [...] = [...] "to experience a sexual orgasm". Sigmund Freud with his psychoanalytic projects, in The Ego and the Id (1923), speculates that sexual satisfaction by orgasm make Eros ("life instinct") exhausted and leaves the field open to Thanatos ("death instinct"), in other words, with orgasm Eros fulfills its mission and gives way to Thanatos. Other modern authors have chosen to represent the orgasm without metaphors. In the novel Lady Chatterley's Lover (1928), by D. H. Lawrence, we can find an explicit narrative of a sexual act between a couple: [...] "As he began to move, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> helpless orgasm there awoke in her strange thrills rippling inside her..." ...|$|E
