40|$|The {{principal}} {{obstacle to}} successful clinical transplantation {{of a human}} organ, immunological rejection, {{seems to be a}} result of inadequacies in two areas: (a) the inability to induce tolerance to tissue antigens; and (b) the inability of present donor-recipient matching schemes to differentiate major <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> from other cell-associated antigens. The importance of surmounting the latter {{stems from the fact that}} the immune activity against nonmajor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> is relatively easily controlled via immunosuppressive therapy, whereas, the immune activity incited by major <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> primarily those encoded by the FOUR end (1, 2) of the HL-A locus (tt- 2 K region of the mouse [3]) is very difficult to control. Presently, two methods are used in assessing the relationship of <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> of donors and recipients for organ transplantation; tissue typing (serology) and the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) assays. A third, the release of 51 Cr from target cells by killer cells produced in one-way MLR, termed "cell-mediated lympholysis or CML " (4), is presently under investigation (5) ...|$|R

40|$|The thymus {{has been}} shown to play an {{important}} role in the generation of T cell tolerance to self antigens. Developing T cells are readily tolerized to antigens which are expressed in the thymus, and it is generally thought that such thymic tolerance occurs by a mechanism of clonal deletion. We sought to examine whether T cells which initially encountered a "self antigen" post-thymically would be rendered tolerant of that antigen, and if so whether the mechanism of tolerance induction would differ from that found for thymic antigens. We constructed bone marrow radiation chimeras which were grafted with two thymus lobes differing in minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens.</b> T cells which matured in one thymus would be tolerized to the minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> expressed in that thymus but would not encounter, and would therefore have no early opportunity of being tolerized to the minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> expressed by the other thymus. The initial encounter with the minor antigens on the second thymus would occur post-thymically. Would these T cells be tolerant or responsive to those minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens?</b> We found that tolerance was dominant in these chimeras. The data further suggest that the mechanism responsible for tolerance induction in the periphery may differ from that which operates in the thymus...|$|R
40|$|Two allelic {{forms of}} mouse beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m), the small {{polypeptide}} chain of H- 2 <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens,</b> have been identified.

Mice heterozygous for beta 2 m synthesize both forms, showing codominant expression of beta 2 m alleles. In mice heterozygous for both H- 2 and beta 3 m, individual H- 2 <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> associate with both beta 2 m forms.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that lymphocytes sensitized to cell-associated antigens may be rendered hyporeactive toward cells expressing these antigens by prior incubation with such antigens in soluble form was investigated. Mice were sensitized {{to the foreign}} <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> of an allogeneic strain of mice; lymphocytes from such sensitized mice were incubated with serum from normal mice of the sensitizing, sensitized, and F 1 hybrids of the two strains. These lymphocytes were washed and their in vitro activity against preparations of cells of sensitizing strain origin was measured by modifications of a standard assay. Sera from the sensitizing strain, and from F 1 hybrids of the sensitizing and sensitized strains (which {{would be expected to}} contain the soluble <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> to which the lymphocytes were sensitized), abrogated the in vitro activity of lymphocytes against target cells of the sensitizing strain, while serum from the sensitized strain did not. Soluble tumor-specific or <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> may be responsible in part for the specific abrogation of sensitized lymphocyte activity by serum from tumorbearing, successfully allografted, allogeneically pregnant, or chimeric animals...|$|R
40|$|Five {{strains of}} guinea-pigs {{homozygous}} for GPL-A and 2 / 13 <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> were sequentially immunized with seven structurally unrelated antigens (TGAL, BPO-BGG, ASAN, BPO-PLL, phenetidine, horseradish peroxidase and DNP-dodecapeptide). Considerable {{differences in the}} immune response were observed, as measured by delayed skin reactivity and antigen-induced lymphocyte stimulation in vitro. The data presented show that when the progeny of various back-cross matings are analysed for their responder status, {{the responses to the}} antigens (TGAL, BPO-BGG, phenetidine and ASAN) are in most cases linked to the genes controlling the respective <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens.</b> However, it appears that the responses to the various antigens in our system may be under polygenic control...|$|R

50|$|The minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigen</b> 13 is a nonamer peptide that {{originates}} from {{a protein}} encoded by the H13 gene. The peptide {{is generated by}} the cytosol by the proteasome, enters the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and is presented on the cell surface on H2-Db major histocompatibility anigen I (MHC I) molecules. The alloreactivity, which leads to transplant rejection in mice, is conferred by Val/Ile polymorphism in the ‘SSV(V/I)GVWYL’ peptide. The orthologue gene in humans is called HM13.

About 5 % of the labeled receptors were immunoprecipitated by a conventional mouse antiserum against H- 2 b <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> and by a monoclonal antibody against Class 1 antigens of the H- 2 b haplotype (Kb and Db). No immunoprecipitation was obtained with a monoclonal antibody against Class 2 antigens of I-Ab or against Class 1 antigens of the H- 2 k haplotype.

40|$|<b>Histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens,</b> virus infections, {{and disease}} are {{discussed}} relative to avenues {{of research in}} humans with arenavirus infections. The data implicating a relationship between histocompatibility complexes in man and animals and diseases of {{the central nervous system}} are reviewed. <b>Histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> may share common antigenic determinants with viruses, act as receptor sites for attachment of viruses, and be altered by viruses. In addition, genes regulating immune responses to a variety of natural and synthetic antigens are linked, in many species, to the major histocompatibility complex. Since injury associated with virus infections may be largely due to the activity of the immune system, study of immune response genes may provide insight into understanding resistance to disease. Further, histoincompatibility reactions can activate latent viruses with resultant disease...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the helper and cytotoxic T-cell response to minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> and generated long term antigen-specific cell lines to them. Antigen-specific activity was selected for by regular restimulation with irradiated cells bearing the antigens {{in the presence of}} interleukin 2, so that alloreactivity to other cell surface antigens was gradually lost. Helper T cells cultured over several months were active in vivo and in vitro, but the culturing method eventually selected for cytotoxic T cells at the expense of helper T cells, with concomitant changes in the proportions of cells expressing the Lyt phenotypes. Individual long term cultures of cytotoxic T cells specific for minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> were restricted by either H 2 K or D but not both. Helper T cells to minor <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> derived directly from primed F 1 mice did not show restriction to the priming parental haplotype. This is consistent with antigen reprocessing by the F 1 antigen presenting cells such that populations of helper T cells restricted by both parental H- 2 haplotypes were primed. F 1 cytotoxic T cells were restricted to the parental H- 2 haplotype used for in vitro boosting, irrespective of which H- 2 was used for in vivo priming...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-five <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> {{have been}} {{measured}} in 100 coal miners with pneumoconiosis attending a pneumoconiosis medical panel {{and the results}} compared with a panel of 200 normal volunteers not exposed to dust. Chest radiographs were read independently by three readers according to the ILO U/C classification. On a combined score, 40 men were thought to have simple pneumoconiosis and 60 men complicated pneumoconiosis. The number of antigens tested and associations between antigens caused difficulties in assessing the statistical significance of differences in prevalence of antigens between groups of men. Using stringent criteria for statistical significance, {{no significant differences were}} found in antigen prevalences between miners and controls, or miners with simple or complicated pneumoconiosis. When a less stringent statistical approach was applied, three antigens appeared to have abnormal prevalences in these 100 miners by comparison with the normal volunteers. More detailed examination of these antigen prevalences in relation to radiographic category of pneumoconiosis did not provide any supportive evidence that these slight associations were of statistical or clinical significance. Reports on <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> in miners with pneumoconiosis are reviewed briefly and the results compared. There is no good evidence that any of the <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> so far tested are associated with a clinically important altered risk of simple or complicated pneumoconiosis when dust is inhaled...|$|R

40|$|Insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus is {{often accompanied by}} manifestations of autoimmunity and is frequently associated with certain HLA haplotypes, predominantly DR 3 and DR 4. Because the major <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> are important determinants of the immune response in various tissues, we have investigated their expression on the pancreatic islet cells. Human, mouse, or rat islets of Langerhans, as well as lymphocytes or other differentiated cells, were biosynthetically labeled with radioactive amino acids, lysed in detergent, and immunoprecipitated with several antisera specific for major histocompatibility antigenic groups. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by NaDodSo 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. The major <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens</b> corresponding to the H- 2 K,D molecules in mice, the H 1 -A in rats, and the HLA-A, -B, and -C in humans were precipitated from both islet and lymphocyte lysates and were accompanied by beta 2 -microglobulin. Binding of H- 2 antibodies to islet cells was also confirmed by a radioligand assay using 125 I-labeled protein A and by indirect immunofluorescence. Analyses in the fluorescence-activated cell sorter revealed that greater than 95 % of the cells in the beta-cell-rich fraction were fluorescent, providing further evidence that the pancreatic beta cells express the major <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>antigens.</b> Monoclonal antibodies or mouse alloantisera against HLA-DR or Ia antigens did not react with labeled pancreatic islet cell proteins...|$|R
