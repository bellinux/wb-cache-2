After completing the survey, they received a monetary reward. Previous research has documented that giving a monetary reward to participants can improve their motivation in responding, thus being beneficial to the quality of survey data (Esterman, Reagan, Liu, Turner, & DeGutis, 2014). Online studies even amplify this advantage. A monetary incentive can inspire participants to respond carefully when researchers are unable to monitor how the participants <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> which is why plenty of psychological studies using online platforms pay for participation (e.g., Saleem, Anderson, & Barlett, 2015; Stroessner, Scholer, Marx, & Weisz, 2015).|$|E
40|$|This survey study {{sought to}} examine poverty {{discourse}} within the Dutch politics. The way in which politicians see and talk about poverty and the poor {{is very important for}} the way in which poverty policies are formed. To reduce or solve the poverty problem, policies have to fit the needs of the people. To start with this, we first need to know how politicians think about the poor and poverty. The poverty discourse of the Dutch politicians is examined by frames. There is expected that there are multiple frames and that political preference has influence on this. Dutch politicians (national and municipal) are approached via email to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> and 76 surveys are used to analyze. The results show political preferences is of significant influence on the founded frames. Overall, Dutch politicians do not view poverty as a problem of the individual, but more as something that has to be solved by the government. It is not seen as a problem because of some policies, but more of something that is due to fate. Why is poverty seen as something that is caused by fate? And if so, why can policies offer a solution?

Over 2000 participants <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> online, and their responses were compared to those given in 1977. Opinions related to the victim-survivor had shifted: fewer people believed that a woman is responsible if she is raped (34% in 1977; 15% in 2010), and fewer people thought that the victim’s prior sexual experience {{should be taken into}} account <b>in</b> <b>the</b> punishment of those found guilty of rape (42% in 1977; 19% in 2010).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{relationship}} between transformational leadership and professionalism with the mediate role of psychological empowerment in a Dutch bank. Background – The use of the concept professionalism increases within the banking industry. The supervisors in the banking industry {{emphasize the importance of}} professionalism in relation to the desired culture within the banking industry. The way transformational leaders can influence the professionalism of employees within the banking industry is unknown. To what extend the transformational leader can influence the employees psychological empowerment to increase the degree of professionalism is subject of research. Methodology – The study uses a cross-sectional questionnaire survey design. All measures have been administered in Dutch and the participation to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> was voluntary. Questionnaires have been completed by one hundred sixty two employees working in several units of a large bank in The Netherlands. The mediation route from transformational leadership via psychological empowerment to professionalism is tested by applying the product-of-coefficient method. Results – This study shows that a transformational leadership style influences the experienced professionalism of employees. The relation between transformation leadership and psychological empowerment and the relation between psychological empowerment and professionalism appears to be positive and significant. The mediation route is partially confirmed in this research. Conclusion, discussion and implications – Transformational leaders can influence professionalism of employees within an organisation. By coaching employees and to give individual attention, transformational leaders can stimulate growth of intellect of employees. To challenge employees to question existing assumptions by discussing dilemmas and motivate employees to view issues from different angles, transformational leaders can increase professionalism of their employees. The impact that employees experience in their work, together with the autonomy employees experience in their job, is an important incentive to show professionalism. Overall the results shows that employees within the bank experience a low degree of professionalism. Employees experience a high degree of organisation as a referent, where employees are facilitated by sharing knowledge. Interesting results which need attention of the management are the low degree of belief in public service and sense of calling of the employees. The degree of transformational leadership and psychological empowerment experienced in the organisation is of a high degree. Further research of professionalism within non-traditional occupational groups is recommended. More research is needed to conceptualize professionalism in the banking industry. The results of this research can contribute to improve the measuring instrument of professionalism...|$|E
40|$|To create {{positive}} customer experiences, {{the service}} industry is increasingly {{paying attention to}} hospitality. However, service organisations {{are in need of}} tools to improve the experience of hospitality of their customers. What service attributes result in an experience of hospitality? Research on hospitality has thus far focussed on service staff behaviour (Ariffin & Maghzi, 2012; Blain & Lashley, 2014; Tasci & Semrad, 2016). However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the role of environmental attributes in the experience of hospitality. Besides Brotherton (2005), who showed that modern, clean, comfortable and bright are aspects people associate with hospitality, little is known about how the perception of attributes of the physical service environment contribute to our experience of hospitality. Research has shown that the experience of hospitality in service environments is represented by three factors: inviting, care and comfort (Pijls, Groen, Galetzka & Pruyn, 2017). These factors are expected to be triggered by mental concepts grounded in bodily sensations. According to embodied cognition theory, attributes we perceive with our senses result in bodily sensation, such as warmth, weight or distance, which in turn affect our mental state. Embodied cognition is the idea that emotions and thoughts not only originate in the brain, but that we also think and feel with our body (Lobel, 2014). We expect that embodied cognition is one of the mechanisms underlying the experience of hospitality, linking the experience of hospitality to the impact of the physical environment. As far as we know the theory of embodied cognition has not yet been studied in the context of hospitality. Mental warmth is one of the abstract metaphors grounded in a concrete experience, in this case in the sensation of physical warmth (Williams & Bargh, 2008; Lakoff and Johnson, 1999). This experiment explores the effect of the perceived physical warmth on the experience of mental warmth among customers of a theatre by examining the effect of cold versus warm furniture material and by examining the effect of cold versus hot drinks. Based on the studies performed by Williams and Bargh (2008) and IJzerman & Semin (2009) on the effect of holding cold versus hot drinks, it is expected that: H 1 Touching and drinking a hot drink will lead to the experience of hospitality H 2 Touching and drinking a hot drink will lead to the experience of physical warmth, and subsequently mental warmth, which will result an increased experience of hospitality, compared to touching and drinking a cold drink. H 3 Sitting on furniture made of warm material will lead to the experience of hospitality H 4 Sitting on furniture made of warm material will lead to the experience of physical warmth, and subsequently mental warmth, which will result an increased experience of hospitality, compared to touching and drinking a cold drink. The experience of hospitality will be measured in a theatre foyer. A 3 (warm versus neutral versus cold furniture material) x 2 (warm versus cold drink) between-subjects factorial design will be employed. Visitors to the theatre will be asked to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> while holding and drinking either a warm or a cold drink, and while sitting either on warm, neutral or cold furniture. The experience of hospitality will be measured with the 13 -item Experience of Hospitality Scale. Mental warmth will be measured by 5 questions, such as ‘the foyer has an intimate atmosphere’, ‘I’m warmly treated in this theatre’, ‘this theatre is a warm organisation’.

40|$|Philanthropy is {{increasingly}} becoming {{a part of}} the economic reality in Belgium. Government grants have been the dominant source of income (Salamon, 2004). However, due to successive cuts in public expenditures, nonprofit organisations are under increasing pressure to diversify their sources of funding and to look for philanthropic sources (Ispos Public Affairs, 2012). Because of this growing importance of private fundraising, a professional approach is imperative. Although the literature shows that private donations play an increasingly important role in Western European welfare states, Schuyt (2010) argues that the potential of private fundraising is not yet recognized and philanthropy has yet to become a tradition to be established. Still, research focusing on Belgian fundraising is quite limited. The existing research mainly focuses on the giving side of fundraising (e. g. Carton, Gijselinckx & Hustinx, 2011). Research on the organization’s point of view is limited to small, private initiatives or focuses on one fundraising channel (e. g. Rombaut & De Coster (2008); Verhaert (2010)). This illustrates the need for an overall study that maps out how private fundraising from philanthropy is currently organized in Belgium. Therefore, the main research questions of this study are: (1) How is private fundraising operationalized, in terms of organizational structures and strategic approaches? (2) What fundraising tools are used and how successful are they? (3) Which needs and bottlenecks are there among Belgian fundraisers? This contribution also seeks to identify the variables that help explain fundraising success and more specifically, the success of the varying fundraising tools. A qualitative study of 21 in-depth interviews with those responsible for fundraising in Belgian non-profit organisations was conducted to explore how fundraising is organized and executed. A semi-structured questionnaire was set up, based on a comprehensive literature review. Taking into account some variables like region, activity domain and size of the organization, a non-stochastic sample was drawn of 21 Belgian nonprofit organisations that raise private funds. The questions related to the importance of fundraising in the organisation’s structure (e. g Hager et al., 2002), the existence of a fundraising culture (e. g. Shoham et al., 2006), the degree of a strategic approach of fundraising and the use and effectiveness of existing fundraising tools. The hypotheses proposed based on the qualitative part are being tested in the quantitative part of the study, by means of a structured questionnaire. An e-mail survey is sent to a sample of 8000 Belgian non-profit organisations, using a database that serves as a good representation of the whole private, Belgian non-profit sector (all regions, sizes and activity domains are covered). Those responsible for private fundraising are asked to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> The survey aims to collect a minimum of 500 completed questionnaires. Although the quantitative part of this study will only be finished by March 2013, the qualitative part provided some indicative results. For example, there are indications that the importance of fundraising in the organisations’ structure differs largely among organisations. Also a negative attitude towards fundraising still exists in the culture of many non-profits. It seems that a lot of fundraising problems are caused by a lack of internal fundraising and marketing oriented culture. Additionally, {{there seems to be a}} positive correlation between the size of the total income and having full-time employees for fundraising on the one hand and the profundity of the strategic planning process (a factor that is seen as crucial in the overall fundraising approach (Sargeant & Jay, 2004)) on the other hand. Concerning the fundraising tools used, it appears that the traditional fundraising channels (like direct mail) still remain the most important for Belgian fundraisers compared to the new online and mobile channels. A comparison between the fundraising channels was also made, taking different issues into account (the type of donations asked for, the channel’s target group and other success variables). It appears for example that paid mass media and telemarketing are almost exclusively used by large organisations, that direct mail mainly reaches an older audience in decline, that telemarketing only works for asking regular and not for one-off donations, etc. An important indicative conclusion from the qualitative study is that in Belgium, as in other countries (Hager et al., 2002), the understanding of fundraising is hampered by a lack of financial information on fundraising efforts and costs. Special attention was given to factors that make it difficult to benchmark fundraising (e. g. Aldrich (2009); Yi (2010)). As a consequence, the assessment of the fundraising channels’ efficiency is mainly limited to the fundraiser’s expert experience. The combined results of the two studies will give a comprehensive answer to the research questions, and form the first step to more transparency in Belgian fundraising. Furthermore, it can serve as a stepping stone to further research to increase fundraising effectiveness. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{difficulty}} of treating pregnant patients {{with breast cancer}} is of course, {{the presence of the}} fetus in utero, and associated safety-related issues for the fetus. But any risk to the fetus, however small or theoretical, is often judged to trump treatment that may be of substantial importance to the wellbeing (and even survival) of the pregnantwoman. The core of this thesis is the belief that treating the pregnantpatient as good as possible is of utmost importance. A healthy mother also benefits the child. Evidence in the treatment of non-pregnant patients cannot automatically be extrapolated to the pregnant patient. The first step of this thesis was to identify current knowledge, gaps, and research priorities. We then decided to concentrate on clinically relevant issues of staging, treatment and prognosis, which would have the biggest impact on treatment of women with BCP. Current practiceWith increasing knowledge, breast cancer during pregnancy has become very treatable. Treatment can be started during pregnancy. However, not all physicians are aware of this fact. We performed the first survey that assessed healthcare providers practice in management of cancer during pregnancy in 2011 (chapter 2. 2). 248 The most important observation of the survey was that there was no consensus about management of cancer during pregnancy among respondents. Termination of pregnancy, delay of maternal treatment and iatrogenic preterm delivery were frequently applied strategies in the management of pregnant cancer patients. These results suggest that current treatment is not in line with recent evidence, and there is room for improvement on the oncologic treatment of pregnant women. Also, 42 % of physicians that started to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> did not answer any questions on cancer during pregnancy; this might imply an interest but simultaneous lack of knowledge in the subject. Centralisation of treatment is needed. StagingCA 15 - 3 can be used during pregnancy, although physiologic elevations are possible and relevance of tumour marker measurement at time of diagnosis is debatable (chapter 3. 1). 149 CA 15 - 3 levels in pregnant women diagnosed with BCP has not been reported before. We performed a small retrospective analysis within our cohort (chapter 3. 2); CA 15 - 3 measurements during pregnancy varied between trimesters of pregnancy and stage of disease. As with the non-pregnant patient, 148 there is insufficientdata to recommend CA 15 - 3 for diagnosis and staging. Next, we investigated whether breast MRI and WB-DWI are helpful staging tools during pregnancy. In an attempt to minimize ionizing radiation to the fetus, but meanwhile stage the cancer more accurately, whole-body diffusion weighted MRI seems very promising (chapter 3. 4). Of course the results of our pilot study need to be confirmed in a larger trial before this technique canbe widely implemented. Limited accessibility and lack of expertise remain a challenge. Treatment and outcomeThere is a need to address radiation safety issues to the fetus when using the SLN mapping techniqueduring pregnancy. The patient needs to be reassured by placing the amount of radiation that reaches the fetus into a proper context. 61 Migration of the short-lived gamma-emitting radionuclide 99 m-technetium is minimal, with > 95 % retention at the injection site. 186 Twenty years after lymphatic mapping was first applied to the investigation of breast cancer by Giuliano et al, 278 we propose that this technique is not denied to women during pregnancy (chapter 4. 1). Obstetrical complications were not different between women who received chemotherapy during pregnancy, and women who received chemotherapy after delivery (chapter 4. 2). 184 Neonatal morbidity was mainly associated with prematurity. Oncological prognosis is correlated to tumour type and stage. We didnot find any difference in prognosis of women diagnosed with BCP compared to young women with non-pregnancy associated breast cancer. The overall maternal survival in our series was comparable to non-pregnant breast cancer patients (chapter 4. 3), 17 after adjusting for the covariates age, stage, grade, hormone receptor status, HER 2 status, histology, type of chemotherapy, use of trastuzumab, radiotherapy and hormone therapy. Breast cancer during pregnancy does not jeopardize maternal prognosis. Last but not least, we attempted to unravel the complexity of ethical issues on cancer during pregnancy in a clear and structured way (chapter 4. 4). At all times, we should be guided by {{what is best for the}} patient. In the particular case of cancer during pregnancy, we propose to actively involve the pregnant woman in treatment planning, depending on gestational age. The previable fetus needs consent of the pregnant woman to be taken into consideration. The viable fetus requires beneficence and nonmaleficence based obligations which have to be weighed against the obligations towards the pregnant woman. Decisions should be tailored to each specific case. This process requires a multidisciplinary and balanced assessment of clinical benefits and harms to both the pregnant woman and fetus as well as taking into account the values of the pregnant woman. Centralisation of care is needed. In conclusion, breast cancer treatment during pregnancy is safe for mother and child, therefore, pregnant patients with breast cancer should be treated as similarly as possible to non-pregnant patients with breast cancer. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|A first {{possible}} explanation is that part of the estimated differences might be related to measurement problems because of the subjective nature of the disability data used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis. As can be inferred from Table  1, the percentage of adult population reporting to have strong limitations widely varies across countries. It could be argued that some of these differences are related to the disparate concept of disability applied by <b>the</b> respondent when <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> questionnaire (and not to their “true” degree of disability). In this respect, Jürges’s (2007) cross-national differences in self-reported health tend to be higher than <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> true health (measured by diagnosed conditions), while the degree of dissonance between the two is different among countries, with Danish and Swedish having a tendency to overrate their health statuses compared with Germans, for example, who have a tendency to underrate it. If that were the case, those countries with high “statistical” (i.e., self-reported) disability rates would show a lower cost of disability, because part of the population considered to be disabled is not really so, showing therefore zero or a very low extra cost and thereby bringing down the estimated average cost of disability. However, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the share of people over 16 years old with strong limitation in their daily activities and the cost of disability using either of the two methods applied here are remarkably low (− 0.06 and − 0.03, respectively). Thus, we conclude that although measurement error might be one of the factors behind the observed differences, {{is not likely to be}} the main driver of them.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{characteristics}} of yoga practitioners and factors motivating people to practice yoga {{have been studied}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and <b>in</b> Australia. This study aimed to determine the {{characteristics of}} yoga users <b>in</b> India, <b>the</b> factors that motivate them to practice yoga, and the yoga techniques of choice. Materials and methodsThe study was a one-time, cross-sectional survey based on convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria were (a) a minimum of 1 [*]week experience of yoga and (b) at least 10 [*]years of age. 14, 250 people received <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> After excluding {{those who did not}} meet the inclusion criteria or <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> incompletely or incorrectly, 5, 157 respondents were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study. ResultsOut of 5, 157 respondents, there were more males (67. 3 %), aged between 21 and 44 [*]years (33. 7 % of <b>the</b> sample <b>surveyed),</b> educated up to high school (62. 5 %), students (39. 3 %), and those who had between 1 and 12 [*]months of experience in yoga (54. 4 %). The first most common reason to practice yoga for all respondents was physical fitness. Three of the remaining reasons to practice yoga differed significantly with age: (i) yoga for disease management (χ 2 [*]=[*] 17. 62, p[*]<[*] 0. 005), (ii) yoga as a hobby (χ 2 [*]=[*] 10. 87, p[*]<[*] 0. 05), and (iii) yoga based on the guru’s (teacher’s) instructions (χ 2 [*]=[*] 20. 05, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The yoga technique of choice [i. e., (i) asanas (χ 2 [*]=[*] 23. 17, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), (ii) pranayama (χ 2 [*]=[*] 19. 87, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), or (iii) meditation (χ 2 [*]=[*] 9. 64, p[*]<[*] 0. 05) ] differed significantly across age groups. ConclusionIn India, a yoga practitioner was more likely to be male, between 21 and 44 [*]years of age, high school educated, and a student. The reasons to practice yoga and the yoga technique of choice differed significantly with age...|$|R

The research study and internship took place at Back-Roads Touring - a tour operator (based in London) that specializes in small group touring for seniors travellers from Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada. Google Forms online questionnaire was used in order to answer the objectives of <b>the</b> study. <b>In</b> total 1322 clients received an online questionnaire out of which 182 <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> <b>The</b> study had four objectives, however the main focus was to find out which tourism practices (out of 15 choices) were the most important to the respondents during a Back-Roads Tour and which tourism options (using the same 15 choices) the respondents identify as sustainable tourism options (objective 2 and 3). The results showed that the respondents valued the most small group touring and having an experienced tour leader, which are the core practices of the company. Furthermore, the respondents were not seeking for more sustainable tourism practices neither willing to donate money to local charities/non- profit organizations. This finding shows that the clients are content with a current model of a tour, are willing to return, however price and quality will be play a key role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision. The respondents´ lack of wish to support or donate money to charities /non-profit organizations, could be {{due to the fact that}} most of the clients were from middle class thus they did not have enough disposable income. Moreover, one of the objectives of this study was to find out if the clients valued sustainable tourism certification. The results showed that the respondents’ were not aware of the sustainable tourism certification that the company obtained, however slightly over half of the respondents said that the knowledge of the certification has positively influenced them to travel again with a company...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{research}} has documented greater vulnerability {{and exposure to}} stress among temporary workers due to labor uncertainty, especially in cases where temporary workers are considered peripheral workers in whom employers are unlikely to invest foster long-term organizational commitment and motivation to work (Becker, 1993; Amuedo-Dorantes 2000; De Cuyper & De Nitte, 2005; De Cuyper at al., 2008). Many characteristics of temporary employment adds to the vulnerability of temporary workers: poor job characteristics, highly monotonous work (Hall 2006), lower influence on workplace decisions (Aronsson et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002), lower job satisfaction and lower organizational support are possible determinants of work stress. Many studies have found a greater work satisfaction in permanent employees (Benavides et al. 2000; Forde & Slater 2006; Merllié & Pascal 2002; Zant & Cooke, 2005) and a correlation between contract duration and organizational engagement (De Jong & Schalk 2005). Consequently, {{the aim of the}} present study is to further investigate some variables concerning the relationship between individuals and organizations in a group of temporary employees compared to permanent employees. More specifically, is investigated if perceived organizational support affects work engagement and job satisfaction. Furthermore, the extent to which self-esteem, occupational self-efficacy and work values mediated the link between these variables is investigated. Methods: Data collection is still in progress, however is thought to include 200 workers, divided into two groups according to the employment status (100 temporary and 100 permanent workers). Participants <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Survey</b> of Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS), the job satisfaction scale of the Occupational Stress Inventory (OSI), the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (R-SES), the Work Values Scale and the Occupational Self-Efficacy (OCCSEF). A series of hierarchical regression analyses were performed to explore the influence of RSES, Work Values and OCCSEF in order to predict the variance of OSI and UWES scores. Results: Our results further investigate the impact of precarious employment on occupational health and safety. Preliminary results indicate that, overall, there is a significant relationship between perceived organizational support, work engagement and job satisfaction. Differences between temporary and permanent employees will be presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poster. Moreover the role of self-esteem and occupational self-efficacy will be presented. Conclusion and Implication: Results will be discussed in terms of their implication for future research on the psychological impact of temporary employment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} what ethical framework(s) small business managers use in making decisions, and whether they differ from those drawn on by the wider community? Design/methodology/approach – A scale for managerial ethical decision-making has been used, targeting small business people and academics and students in Australia. This scale was piloted in a geographical test community in Queensland Australia. Targeted respondents were asked to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> self-assessment <b>survey</b> (MEP). A quantitative evaluation of the results was carried out by measuring variance between eight ethical variables by ANOVA (analysis of variance). Findings – This study found statistically significant differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ethical decision-making profile of business and non-business decision makers. Contrary to expectations, small business people do not hold economical return as the most important factor in making managerial decisions to the exclusion of other more ethical criteria. There are, however, significant differences between small business people and academics and students in relation to which ethical principles are the most important when making a decision. Originality/value – A new scale has been developed and validated to profile the ethical style of managers. From this tools can be further developed for self-assessment or by organizations wanting to profile the ethical styles of their managers...|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> {{accordance}} with <b>the</b> global trend, <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Netherlands approximately 45 % {{of the population}} is overweight. Existing studies show that patient self-management can reduce these figures, but medical non-adherence is a persistent problem. eHealth can potentially increase adherence to self-management. Consequently, we designed a persuasive computer assistant and evaluated its influence on self-management, i. e., the use of an online lifestyle diary called DieetInzicht. nl. The assistant is represented by an animated iCat, which shows different facial expressions and provides cooperative feedback following principles from the motivational interviewing method. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 118 overweight people over a period of four weeks and studied the difference between diary use with and without computer assistant feedback. Results show that the computer assistant contributed to <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diary more frequently, reduced <b>the</b> decline <b>in</b> motivation to perform self-management, lowered the (reported) BMI, and improved the ease of use. Furthermore, diary use increased knowledge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Finally, personal characteristics, i. e., locus of control, vocabulary, computer experience, age, gender, education level and initial BMI, explained <b>the</b> variance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diary use and its outcome. Of the 118 participants 35 <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closing <b>survey,</b> covering motivation, BMI, lifestyle knowledge and ease of use, which implies that the findings based on these results are mainly representative for motivated participants. In general, this study shows that the Dieetinzicht eHealth service, including a personal computer assistant, is likely to support motivated overweight people and lifestyle related diseases to get a better insight in and adhere to their self-management. © 2009 IOS Press and the authors.
