5|$|Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 {{and thus}} reduce <b>glucagon</b> and blood glucose levels.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in <b>glucagon</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{state of}} DKA is associated, {{in addition to}} the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as <b>glucagon</b> and adrenaline as well as cytokines, the latter of which leads to increased markers of inflammation, {{even in the absence of}} infection.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of <b>glucagon</b> when sugar levels are too low.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of <b>glucagon</b> and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and <b>glucagon.</b> The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of <b>glucagon,</b> thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E
25|$|Some U.S. union teacher {{contracts}} stipulate {{they shall}} {{not be allowed to}} deliver <b>glucagon</b> or even be trained in administration of <b>glucagon.</b>|$|E
25|$|Together, {{cortisol}} and <b>glucagon</b> {{can have}} huge synergistic results, activating the PEPCK-C gene to levels that neither cortisol or <b>glucagon</b> could reach on their own. PEPCK-C is most {{abundant in the}} liver, kidney, and adipose tissue.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that glucokinase {{plays a role in}} the glucose sensing of the pancreatic alpha cells, but the evidence is less consistent, and some researchers have found no evidence of glucokinase activity in these cells. Alpha cells occur in pancreatic islets, mixed with beta and other cells. While beta cells respond to rising glucose levels by secreting insulin, alpha cells respond by reducing <b>glucagon</b> secretion. When blood glucose concentration falls to hypoglycemic levels, alpha cells release <b>glucagon.</b> <b>Glucagon</b> is a protein hormone that blocks the effect of insulin on hepatocytes, inducing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and reduced glucokinase activity in hepatocytes. The degree to which glucose suppression of <b>glucagon</b> is a direct effect of glucose via glucokinase in alpha cells, or an indirect effect mediated by insulin or other signals from beta cells, is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glucagon,</b> another hormone {{produced}} by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), <b>glucagon</b> is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources).|$|E
25|$|Dual hormone insulin pumps that infuse either insulin or <b>glucagon.</b> In {{event of}} hypoglycemia, the <b>glucagon</b> could be {{triggered}} {{to increase the}} blood glucose. This would be particularly valuable in a closed loop system {{under the control of}} a glucose sensor. The Bionic Pancreas, currently in clinical trials for FDA approval, is a recently developed device designed with this technology in mind.|$|E
25|$|Insulin and <b>glucagon</b> can be {{detected}} in the human fetal circulation by {{the fourth or fifth}} month of fetal development.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{aprotinin}} {{can be added}} to tubes of drawn blood to enable laboratory measurement of certain rapidly degraded proteins such as <b>glucagon.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>glucagon</b> {{rescue kit}} {{facilitates}} rapid rescue {{by a simple}} injection, which does not require medical expertise, and can be done quickly and easily outside of a medical facility.|$|E
25|$|However, {{as would}} be {{expected}} given its antagonistic effect on glycogen synthesis, <b>glucagon</b> and its intracellular second messenger cAMP suppresses glucokinase transcription and activity, even in the presence of insulin.|$|E
25|$|A {{biological}} {{approach to}} the artificial pancreas is to implant bioengineered tissue containing islet cells, which would secrete the amount of insulin, amylin, and <b>glucagon</b> needed in response to sensed glucose.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 3 million cell {{clusters}} called pancreatic islets {{are present}} in the pancreas. Within these islets are four main types of cells which are involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Each type of cell secretes a different type of hormone: α alpha cells secrete <b>glucagon</b> (increase glucose in blood), β beta cells secrete insulin (decrease glucose in blood), δ delta cells secrete somatostatin (regulates/stops α and β cells) and PP cells, or γ (gamma) cells, secrete pancreatic polypeptide. These act to control blood glucose through secreting <b>glucagon</b> to increase the levels of glucose, and insulin to decrease it.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, to {{replicate}} the natural function of the pancreas as closely as possible, an artificial pancreas might someday replace all of the beneficial endocrine functions lost, including the delivery of insulin, amylin, <b>glucagon,</b> and C-peptide.|$|E
25|$|In {{hypoglycemia}} {{caused by}} excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, {{but the high}} insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. <b>Glucagon</b> is a common treatment {{for this type of}} hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Earl Wilbur Sutherland won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ″for his discoveries {{concerning}} {{the mechanisms of}} the action of hormones″, in particular the discovery of cyclic adenosine monophosphate as second messenger in the action of catecholamines at β-adrenoceptors and of <b>glucagon</b> at <b>glucagon</b> receptors, which led on {{to the discovery of}} heterotrimeric G proteins. In 1988 James Black was one of three winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ″for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment″, Black’s ″important principles″ being the blockade of β-adrenoceptors and of histamine H2 receptors. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry ″for studies of G-protein-coupled receptors″.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines {{the production of}} the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (desaturation) of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and <b>glucagon</b> (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, <b>glucagon,</b> and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).|$|E
25|$|At {{the present}} time, {{there are no}} {{ready-made}} formulations of glucagon; within hours of reconstitution, the molecule will degrade into amyloid fibrils. Combined with the anxiety of performing a rescue is expense, bulkiness, and concerns over dosing correctly; fortunately, there is no biochemical way to overdose on intramuscularly injected <b>glucagon.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to system parts, {{there are other}} necessary parts associated with overall diabetes therapy including a glucose meter for finger stick calibrations and treatment verification, traditional injectors and supplies, ketones test supplies, test strip vials, skin preparation, <b>glucagon</b> supplements, etc. If using OneTouch UltraLink meter, readings are sent wirelessly to the pump.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{long-term goal}} of future technology for a portable device for treating diabetes is to: a) eliminate all dependent peripheral devices, for example, calibration meter, injection syringes/pens, <b>glucagon,</b> etc.; b) manage very complex life situations with fully automated protocols, for example, respond to DKA, sickness, extreme exercise/eating; and c) single on-off button control. This is absolutely not an impossible goal.|$|E
25|$|High plasma {{levels of}} insulin {{in the blood}} plasma (e.g. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus {{promoting}} the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while epinephrine and <b>glucagon</b> (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting lipogenesis in favor of fatty acid oxidation via beta-oxidation.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the off-label 'mini-dose' is to avoid an {{emergency}} condition that may require <b>glucagon</b> rescue. This might be needed in cases such as when a diabetic child is injected with insulin before breakfast, eats, and then vomits and cannot eat again: with the injected insulin working {{its way into the}} bloodstream and no carbohydrate to balance, there may soon be a hypoglycemic emergency.|$|E
25|$|Amylin agonist analogues slow gastric {{emptying}} and suppress <b>glucagon.</b> They {{have all}} the incretins actions except stimulation of insulin secretion. , pramlintide is the only clinically available amylin analogue. Like insulin, it is administered by subcutaneous injection. The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is nausea, which occurs mostly {{at the beginning of}} treatment and gradually reduces. Typical reductions in A1C values are 0.5–1.0%.|$|E
25|$|HMG-CoA reductase {{is active}} when blood glucose is high. The basic {{functions}} of insulin and <b>glucagon</b> are to maintain glucose homeostasis. Thus, in controlling blood sugar levels, they indirectly affect {{the activity of}} HMG-CoA reductase, but a decrease in activity of the enzyme is caused by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which responds {{to an increase in}} AMP concentration, and also to leptin (see 4.4, Phosphorylation of reductase).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} fasting state, {{cortisol}} stimulates gluconeogenesis (the formation of glucose), and activates antistress and anti-inflammatory pathways. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis, the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose. This is done through its passive influence on <b>glucagon.</b> Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which {{is necessary for}} epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on glycogenolysis.|$|E
25|$|Lipolysis, {{the removal}} of the fatty acid chains from the {{glycerol}} to which they are bound in their storage form as triglycerides (or fats), is carried out by lipases. These lipases are activated by high epinephrine and <b>glucagon</b> levels in the blood (or norepinephrine secreted by sympathetic nerves in adipose tissue), caused by declining blood glucose levels after meals, which simultaneously lowers the insulin level in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Under normal {{metabolic}} conditions, {{the human}} body relies on free blood glucose as its primary energy source. The level of blood sugar is tightly regulated; as blood glucose is consumed, the pancreas releases <b>glucagon,</b> a hormone that stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted {{before it can be}} replenished, the body enters hypoglycemia, and begins the starvation response.|$|E
25|$|At initial diagnosis, {{hypoglycemia}} is corrected with intravenous glucose {{to normalize}} plasma glucose concentration and prevent brain damage. Long-term medical management includes {{the use of}} diazoxide, somatostatin analogs, nifedipine, <b>glucagon,</b> recombinant IGF-I, glucocorticoids, human growth hormone, dietary intervention, or combinations of these therapies. In individuals in whom aggressive medical management fails to maintain plasma glucose concentration within safe limits, or in whom such therapy cannot be safely maintained over time, pancreatic resection is considered.|$|E
25|$|Hexokinase IV {{is present}} in the liver, pancreas, hypothalamus, small intestine, and perhaps certain other neuroendocrine cells, and plays an {{important}} regulatory role in carbohydrate metabolism. In the beta cells of the pancreatic islets, it serves as a glucose sensor to control insulin release, and similarly controls <b>glucagon</b> release in the alpha cells. In hepatocytes of the liver, glucokinase responds to changes of ambient glucose levels by increasing or reducing glycogen synthesis.|$|E
25|$|When the {{glucose level}} {{comes down to}} the usual {{physiologic}} value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently <b>glucagon</b> from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{treatments}} that may be useful. These include efforts to reduce absorption of the drug including: activated charcoal taken by mouth if given shortly after the ingestion or whole bowel irrigation if an extended release formula was taken. Efforts to cause vomiting are not recommended. Medications to treat the toxic effects include: intravenous fluids, calcium gluconate, <b>glucagon,</b> high dose insulin, vasopressors and lipid emulsion. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also be an option.|$|E
