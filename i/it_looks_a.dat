500|$|Four Swords Adventures also {{received}} criticism. Game Revolution {{said about the}} game, [...] "Graphically, Four Swords Adventures is an odd mix of cheap 2D SNES sprites and nice Gamecube particle effects. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like the GBA game, but now wears fancier pants and shows off upgraded visual flourishes, like Wind Waker style curly-Q air poofs. Still, much of the technology has clearly been ported over from the GBA, creating an inconsistent feel." [...] They also criticized the requirement of the link cable, saying that [...] "the required use of the GBA for multiplayer does limit the play potential." ...|$|E
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude {{there is no time}} to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of the}} Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E
500|$|For the film, cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1.85 {{aspect ratio}} shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras, using the M for fight {{sequences}} and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, [...] "Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 {{was a good}} call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [...] going from standing full-size to falling {{through a crack in}} the floor." [...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} met with largely {{positive}} reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode and awarded it an [...] "A" [...] grade. He noted the entries' similarities with [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", noting that both deal with men [...] "who [...] too much about death for [...] own good". He also praised the characterization of Scully and Fellig; {{he noted that the}} former is [...] "no-nonsense" [...] and optimistic, whereas the latter is a [...] "creepy man" [...] who is jealous of those who are capable of dying. Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "doesn’t play out like a classic monster episode, it feels like one". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, comparing it favorably to [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose". He wrote, [...] "If imitation is the highest form of flattery, what is a fascinating offshoot of a previous incarnation? I'd say <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like the latest entry into Season 6 of The X-Files. The engaging 'Tithonus'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, DeVille {{married his}} second wife, Lisa Leggett, who {{proved to be}} an astute {{business}} manager. On the strength of his success touring and selling albums in Europe, they bought a horse farm, Casa de Sueños, in Picayune, Mississippi and began living there as well as at their apartment and studio in the French Quarter of New Orleans. DeVille told an interviewer in 1996: [...] "I finally got the plantation... I just bought this house and [...] <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> little bit like Graceland... I got into horses since my wife is into them. We're raising Spanish and Portuguese bullfighting horses. The bloodline is 2000 years old. She's into breeding, but I just love riding. I've also got five dogs, four cats and a partridge in a pear tree." ...|$|E

The device would become the start of the Google Play edition program, and was followed by other devices, including the HTC One Google Play edition, and Moto G Google Play edition.
