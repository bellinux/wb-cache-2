5|$|His {{expertise}} in airbase construction led to Johns {{being sent to}} the South West Pacific as Chief Engineer, American Forces in Java. Departing Washington, D.C. by air on 14 January 1942, Johns arrived in Surabaya nine days later. His first mission was to provide airfield facilities on Java for 2,000 aircraft. Tapping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> resources of labour available in one of the world's most densely populated regions, Johns set about readying the required airfields. However, Java was captured by the Japanese before the aircraft arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale.

25|$|Many of {{the early}} trovadores, such as Manuel Corona (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), {{composed}} and sang guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros and canciones. The satirical lyric content also fitted well with the son, and many bands played both genres.

Today it seems no longer to exist as a distinct musical form; it has been absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> maw of Salsa.

25|$|Technological {{advances}} {{over several}} millennia gave humans increasing {{control over the}} environment. But it was the Western industrial revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. Such conditions led to a human population explosion and unprecedented industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the Anthropocene. From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the idea}} of the {{absorption}} of the British crown colony of Penang <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> Malay heartland alarmed some quarters of Penang's population over economic and ethnic concerns. The Penang Secessionist Movement was formed in 1948 to preclude Penang's merger with Malaya under the leadership of D.A. Mackay, who was also the chairman of the (European) Penang Chamber of Commerce, a manager of the Eastern Smelting Company and a Federal Legislative Councillor. It was spearheaded by, among others, the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Penang Indian Chamber of Commerce, and the Penang Clerical and Administrative Staff Union. The movement ultimately failed; a secession motion tabled in the Penang Settlement Council in 1949 was narrowly defeated by British official votes, while another petition sent to London in 1951 also met with British disapproval.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{claimed the}} territories of the Philippines after the Spanish–American War. The ethnic Moro (Muslim) {{population}} of the southern Philippines resisted both Spanish and United States colonization. The Spaniards were restricted {{to a handful of}} coastal garrisons or Forts and they made occasional punitive expeditions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> interior regions. After a series of unsuccessful attempts during the centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines, Spanish forces occupied the abandoned city of Jolo, Sulu, the seat of the Sultan of Sulu, in 1876. The Spaniards and the Sultan of Sulu signed the Spanish Treaty of Peace on July 22, 1878. Control of the Sulu archipelago outside of the Spanish garrisons was handed to the Sultan. The treaty had translation errors: According to the Spanish-language version, Spain had complete sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago, while the Tausug version described a protectorate instead of an outright dependency. Despite the very nominal claim to the Moro territories, Spain ceded them to the United States in the Treaty of Paris which signaled the end of the Spanish–American War.|$|E
