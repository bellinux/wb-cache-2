5|$|On 26 September 1941, the <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard structure for the military organisation of the resistance. The <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the <b>General</b> <b>Staff.</b> The basic Partisan unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the Partisan forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment staff would be directly responsible to the <b>General</b> <b>Staff.</b> On that basis, the existing Partisan units operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten detachments, six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and detachments in those regions were placed under the direct control of the <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight.

5|$|Based on {{the outcome}} of the Holbrooke–Tuđman meeting and the {{assessment}} of the HV <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> that the VRS 2nd Corps was completely destroyed, a decision was made to deploy the HV to the area with virtually no preparation and planning. The assessment of the HV <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> was based on ARBiH gains in western Bosnia and Herzegovina over the previous four days. The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the <b>General</b> <b>Staff,</b> General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would continue its rapid advance towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E

5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ceasefire {{agreement}} {{signed on}} 22 September between the JNA and Croatia, which {{provided for the}} resumption of supplies to the JNA barracks, the authorities in Bjelovar refused to restore utilities, claiming that the agreement allowed for the supply of JNA officers and soldiers only, {{but there were also}} civilians sheltering in the barracks. On 27 September, the Croatian <b>General</b> <b>Staff</b> directed that the garrison be captured on 28–30 September. Tus, acting as the Chief of the <b>General</b> <b>Staff,</b> ordered the clandestine killing of extremists before they caused mass killing of civilians or great material damage. According to Tus, this order was based on an assessment that there were extremist JNA officers present in Bjelovar, intent on carrying out such acts.|$|E
