40|$|The {{concept of}} {{fidelity}} and using character species has main {{importance in the}} methodics of Z&uuml;rich-Montpellier phytosociological school. In spite of their long history and importance only few of papers study this question from methodical point of view. In this paper the <b>fidelity</b> <b>concept</b> and measures are shortly rewieved and Juh&aacute;sz-Nagy&rsquo;s unfortunately not well-known <b>fidelity</b> <b>concept</b> is reconsidered. Information statistical (G 2) functions are proposed to measure the three forms of fidelity. On {{the basis of this}} concept we suggest to distinguish faithful and character species. The application of new method is showed by an example: the Illyrian beechwoods...|$|E
40|$|When {{a system}} {{undergoes}} a quantum phase transition, the ground-state wave-function shows {{a change of}} nature, which can be monitored using the <b>fidelity</b> <b>concept.</b> We introduce two Quantum Monte Carlo schemes that allow the computation of fidelity and its susceptibility for large interacting many-body systems. These methods are illustrated on a two-dimensional Heisenberg model, where fidelity estimators show marked behaviours at two successive quantum phase transitions. We also develop a scaling theory which relates the divergence of the fidelity susceptibility to the critical exponent of the correlation length. A good agreement is found with the numerical results.

The considered system can be vulnerable to several attacks because of mobility and absence of infrastructure. While the disturbance is assumed to be of the black hole type, we purpose a control named "PC-AODV-BH" in order to neutralize the effects of malicious nodes. Such a protocol is obtained by coupling hash functions, digital signatures and <b>fidelity</b> <b>concept.</b> An implementation under NS 2 simulator will be given to compare our proposed approach with SAODV protocol, basing on three performance metrics and taking into account the number of black hole malicious nodesComment: submit 15 pages, 19 figures, 1 table, Journal Indexing team, AIRCC 201...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Gaining cardiac {{surgical}} {{competence is}} a complex, multifactorial process {{that may take}} years of experience and on-the-job training. It is critical to provide suitable educational opportunities to gain the necessary knowledge, judgment and skills. In response to the multitude of factors (e. g. European Working Time Directive) currently influencing cardiac surgical training, there have been concerted efforts to reform training practices. Simulation plays an increasingly {{important role in the}} educational process and serves to fill the most important gap in the current training model, i. e. operative exposure. Therefore, a contest has been written out for cardiac surgical trainees to construct their own coronary anastomosis simulator using everyday materials. METHODS: Cardiac surgical trainees were invited to construct their own coronary anastomosis simulator.

40|$|A {{survey of}} air-traffic-management researchers, {{representing}} {{a broad range}} of automation applications, was conducted to document trajectory-predictor requirements for future decision-support systems. Results indicated that the researchers were unable to articulate a basic set of trajectory-prediction requirements for their automation concepts. Survey responses showed the need to establish a process to help developers determine the trajectory-predictor-performance requirements for their concepts. Two methods for determining trajectory-predictor requirements are introduced. A fast-time simulation method is discussed that captures the sensitivity of a concept to the performance of its trajectory-prediction capability. A characterization method is proposed to provide quicker, yet less precise results, based on analysis and simulation to characterize the trajectory-prediction errors associated with key modeling options for a specific concept. Concept developers can then identify the relative sizes of errors associated with key modeling options, and qualitatively determine which options lead to significant errors. The characterization method is demonstrated for a case study involving future airport surface traffic management automation. Of the top four sources of error, results indicated that the error associated with accelerations to and from turn speeds was unacceptable, the error associated with the turn path model was acceptable, and the error associated with taxi-speed estimation was of concern and needed a higher <b>fidelity</b> <b>concept</b> simulation to obtain a more precise resul...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation (DGT), {{with its}} 1500 {{in-house}} translators, produces yearly over 2 million pages of institutional translation and multilingual law. Over the last years, the mounting pressure for cost-efficiency has triggered a detailed scrutiny of all workflow processes {{and led to}} staff reductions combined with an increased use of outsourcing. This chapter presents how DGT has {{put in place a}} corporate quality management policy, approaching quality not only as product quality but also as quality of processes. It describes how focus on needs and expectations naturally led to highlighting the key role of purpose for text production, defining translation quality as fitness-for-purpose, in line with applicable standards. Furthermore, it shows how DGT in order to operationalise this definition addressed various other issues and questions. The outcome was translation quality guidelines outlining the communicative purposes of different text categories and the risks involved. In the implementation of the guidelines, there has been a perceived tension between the fitness-for-purpose concept and high quality, on the one hand, and between the fitness-for-purpose concept and the traditional fidelity paradigm, on the other. The paper analyses why this tension is only apparent and why the fitness-for-purpose concept better than the traditional <b>fidelity</b> <b>concept</b> caters for the needs of the institutional translation and multilingual law-making that takes place in the European context...|$|E
40|$|This book is {{the first}} {{systematic}} account {{of the law and}} economics of the family. It explores the implications of economics for family law [...] divorce, adoption, breach of promise, surrogacy, prenuptial agreements, custody arrangements [...] and its limitations. Before a family forms, prospective partners engage in a kind of market activity that involves searching and bargaining, for which the economic analysis of contract law provides useful insights. Once a couple marries, the individuals become a family and their decisions have important consequences for other parties, especially children. As a result, the state and community have vital interests in the family. Although it may be rational to breach a contract, pay damages, and recontract when a better deal comes along, this practice, if applied to family relationships, would make family life impossible [...] as would the regular toting up of balances between the partners. So the book introduces the idea of covenant to consider the role of love, trust, and <b>fidelity,</b> <b>concepts</b> about which economic analysis and contract law have little to offer, but feminist thought has a great deal to add. Although families do break up, children of divorce are still bound to their parents and to each other in powerful ways. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{methodology}} to optimize hierarchically modulated Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation with Iterative Decoding (HM-BICM-ID). This methodology allows designing a receiver which supports several configurations. Each configuration is able to decode the same transmitted signal over the air with different <b>fidelity.</b> This <b>concept</b> permits using radios with varying processing capabilities, e. g. handhelds, vehicular based etc. However, earlier simulation results have shown that HM-BICM-ID loses, if compared to non-hierarchical schemes, in BER performance due to Inter-Layer Interferences (ILI). Our proposed iterative tunable algorithm optimizes hierarchical modulation schemes considering several criteria by moving critical constellation points towards the optimal direction. A novel modulation scheme has been found with minimized ILI and simulation results show an improved asymptotic BER performance {{in a wide range}} of channel conditions and for a two layered HM-BICM-ID. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} if and how dance communicates vital plot and character information nonverbally. The example analyzed was the film Singin’ in the Rain. This thesis examined the six dance sequences in the film to determine if the dancing is an integral, powerful, and significant communicative addition to the film. Walter Fisher’s Narrative Paradigm was used in conjunction with Seymour Chatman’s concept of kernels and satellites to determine if the dances communicated significantly to the film’s viewers. The Narrative Paradigm, though loosely framed, provided the concepts of coherence and <b>fidelity.</b> These <b>concepts</b> helped determine if the dances made sense and if they told relatable stories. Chatman’s concept of kernels and satellites determined how important these dance sequences were to the film. All dances analyzed, except one, were determined to be kernels, and thus they told vital parts of the story or enhanced the film’s characters...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the metamodel-based {{multidisciplinary}} design optimization (MDO) using variable <b>fidelity</b> modelling <b>concept.</b> The main aim is to improve computational costs of MDO problems based on high fidelity simulation model. One of the main features of the variable fidelity modelling approach adopted in this paper is the utilization of models of different fidelity (i. e. low and high fidelity) in the optimization process. In this approach, the interaction of low and high fidelity models are used to correct (tune) low fidelity model (metamodel) {{in such a way}} that to provide the same level of accuracy of the original high fidelity model but at the same time computationally is a very efficient model repeatedly to be used in the optimization process. In this process, only tuned low fidelity models are used in the optimization process. The method is demonstrated on a collaborative optimization (CO) using a 2 D airfoil wing test problem, involving high fidelity structural and aerodynamic models. The results obtained show that the proposed method significantly reduces computational effort and improves convergence rate for solving MDO problems based on high fidelity models within the CO. ...|$|R

In so doing, the United States Supreme Court invited speculation that such corporations might possess other First Amendment rights as well. The petitioners in Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius are now arguing that for-profit corporations are among the intended beneficiaries of the Free Exercise Clause and, along with the respondents in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, that they also qualify as “persons” under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Neither suggestion follows inexorably from Citizens United, {{and the role of}} the case in the pending disputes remains to be seen.

40|$|Literary {{translation}} theory {{no longer}} understands the {{fidelity to the}} original and the creativity of the translator as opposing <b>concepts.</b> <b>Fidelity</b> is no longer understood as the “word by word” translation, but rather as the identification and transposition of the significant elements of the original work, while the creativity of the translator is interpreted as his/her capacity to identify said elements and find functional equivalences for them, often with linguistic and stylistic resources that {{are very different from}} those in the original. However, when misunderstood, the creativity of the translator can lead to arbitrary interventions to the original text, thus leading to the so-called illusion of translation or pseudo-translation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} law is not a theorist's {{invention}} but one that people use every day. Thus one measure of the adequacy of a theory {{of law is}} its degree of <b>fidelity</b> to the <b>concept</b> as it is understood by those who use it. That means as far as possible. There are important truisms about the law that have an evaluative cast. The theorist has either to say what would make those evaluative truisms true or to defend her choice to dismiss them as false of law or not of the essence of law. Thus the legal theorist must {{give an account of}} the truth grounds of the more central evaluative truisms about law. This account is a theory of legitimacy. It will contain framing judgments that state logical relations between descriptive judgments and directly evaluative judgments. Framing judgments are not directly evaluative, nor do they entail directly evaluative judgments, but they are nonetheless moral judgments. Therefore, an adequate theory of law must make (some) moral judgments. This means that an adequate theory of law has to take a stand on certain (but not all) contested issues in political philosophy. Legal theory is thus a branch of political philosophy. Moreover, one cannot be a moral-aim functionalist about legal institutions without compromising one's positivism about legal norm...|$|R
40|$|This thesis utilises the {{philosophy}} of Gilles Deleuze alongside theory {{from the field of}} 'utopian studies' in order to think through how the concepts of utopia and utopianism might be relevant in an age that seems to have given up on the future. It develops - and argues in favour of - a 'nomadic utopianism', which proceeds through non-hierarchical organisation, maximises what Deleuze calls 'difference-in-itself' and creates new forms of living as it proceeds. From this, nomadic utopias are produced, meaning that the relationship between utopianism and utopia is inverted, such that the former is ontologically prior to the latter. I show how such an approach maintains an etymological <b>fidelity</b> to the <b>concept</b> of utopia as 'the good place that is no place'. I also develop the concept of 'state utopianism" in which a utopian vision functions as a 'perfect', transcendent lack orienting political organisation to its realisation and reproduction. I argue that this is a dystopian politics, and consequently that the state utopia is a dystopia. Contrary to received wisdom - which sees today's 'capitalist realism' as anti-utopian - I argues that the contemporary world {{can be seen as a}} state utopia in which 'there is no alternative'. This makes utopia a central force in contemporary ideology. These two forms should not be seen simply as opposites, however, and this thesis also shows how nomadic utopias can ossiry into state utopias through the emergence or tyrannies of habit. These theoretical concepts are then applied to works of utopian and dystopian literature (Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, Alben Meister's The SO called utopia of the centre beaubourg and Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed); and the practices of 'musicking' (with a focus on the symphony orchestra and collective improvisation) and education. It is hoped that this wi 11 offer a new way of theorising utopia and utopianism, as well as generating a productive political approach from the thought of Gilles Deleuze, and contributing to debates on the political function of musical and educational practiceEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|By invading and annexing Puerto Rico {{and other}} Spanish lands in 1898 - 1899, the United States took an {{imperial}} turn that unsettled its constitutional order. This dissertation traces responses by two groups—one within the U. S. government and another comprised of Puerto Ricans—to the legal uncertainty that reigned until Congress extended U. S. citizenship to “citizens of Porto Rico” in 1917. It also reconstructs {{the social and}} legal terrain surrounding key legal actions: the Treaty of Paris, the Foraker Act, the Insular Cases, and the Jones Act. For representatives of the U. S. government—federal judges, elected officials, and appointed administrators—U. S occupation of the island imposed hard choices between the exigencies of imperial governance and {{what they saw as}} adherence to constitutional norms. For a group of Puerto Ricans, mostly male politicians, competing federal actors and priorities provided openings to advance individual and collective claims to status. 	This study traces the political and legal activities of officials and claimants as well as the metaphors they drew upon to explain their claims. U. S. officials characteristically expressed <b>fidelity</b> to legal <b>concepts,</b> alleged Anglo-Saxon superiority, and contrasted their actions with Spanish imperial misrule. Rather than reject racial hierarchies in U. S. imperialist and eugenic thought, Puerto Rican actors often claimed favorable positions within those hierarchies through Reconstruction metaphors and self-affirming historical accounts of their Spanish-era political participation. 	Close study of Puerto Ricans who sought citizenship or self-government in this period, especially the unusual grouping of claimants involved in Gonzales v. Williams (1904), reveals that existing accounts of the Insular Cases overemphasize the coherence of these decisions. The oft-cited Downes v. Bidwell (1901), moreover, should be read alongside Gonzales. For two decades the Court declined to completely embrace the doctrinal innovations or delineate the implications for Puerto Rican rights of the Downes ruling. The Insular Cases developed slowly and ambiguously, transforming U. S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans from a status that courts might recognize in individual islanders and that might bring them full constitutional protections and eventual U. S. statehood, into a largely empty vessel, achievable only through Congress and heralding indefinite colonialism...|$|R
