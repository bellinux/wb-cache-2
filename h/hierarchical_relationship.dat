He advocated a less <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards and American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.|$|E

25|$|Elites in pre-colonial Rwanda {{propagated}} an origin myth of {{the three}} groups to justify the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> of sociopolitical inequality between them in sacred, religious terms. According to this myth, Kigwa, a deity who fell from heaven, had three sons: Gatwa, Gahutu and Gatutsi. He chose an heir by giving each son the responsibility of watching over a pot of milk during the night. Gatwa drank the milk, Gahutu fell asleep and carelessly spilt his pot, and only Gatutsi kept watch, keeping his milk safe. Therefore, Kigwa appointed Gatutsi to be his successor, and Gahutu to be his brother's servant, while Gatwa was to be resigned to the status of an outsider. Gatutsi would possess cattle and power, and Gahutu would only be allowed to acquire cattle through service to Gatutsi, whereas Gatwa was condemned to the fringe of society. This myth was the basis of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> that placed the Tutsi at the apex of the social pyramid: above the Hutu, who were in turn above the marginalized Twa. The prevalence of this myth became the basis of the social and political stratification of Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|The two {{enclosures}} of {{the main}} fort had separate entrances, with {{no evidence of any}} internal gateway between them, implying a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> between them. The higher section {{of the main}} fort to the west may have formed a high-status enclosure including a royal hall and dwelling, with the larger enclosure to the north east containing a settlement. The higher enclosure would also have included buildings housing the ruler's retinue and others supplying the royal court with its needs. The foundation stones of buildings have been found within the lower enclosure and there is archaeological evidence of livestock being kept within the outer walls of the fort. The site's importance and its excellent nearby anchorage makes it likely that it was an important base for the Pict's naval forces, which are recorded as significant between the 4th and the 8th centuries.|$|E

2500|$|St. Ignatius of Antioch {{spoke in}} [...] "praise of unity" [...] in a Letter to the Ephesians, saying [...] "He, therefore, {{that does not}} {{assemble}} with the Church, has even by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, 'God resisteth the proud.' Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves {{in opposition to the}} bishop, in order that we may be subject to God". Stressing the relationship between the Church initiated by Jesus and the hierarchy set in motion by the apostles, Ignatius writes: [...] "we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself" [...] (§6). Ignatius stresses the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> between God and the bishop more strongly to the Magnesians urging them [...] "to yield him all reverence, having respect to the power of God the Father, ... submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all". In §6 he exhorts them to harmony, and in §13 urges them to [...] "tudy ... to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the apostles, ... with your most admirable bishop...." [...] Thus Ignatius emphasizes unity, obedience, and the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> among the faithful and between the bishop and God. Further elements of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> are mentioned by St. Clement of Alexandria, referring to advice in the [...] "holy books: some for presbyters, some for bishops and deacons" [...] (Jurgens §413), and writing treatises with titles [...] "On the Unity and Excellence of the Church" [...] and [...] "On the Offices of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Widows." [...] In his Stromateis, Clement of Alexandria writes that [...] "according to my opinion, the grades here in the Church, of bishops, presbyters, deacons, are imitations of the angelic glory, and of that economy which, the Scriptures say, awaits those who, following the footsteps of the apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the Gospel".|$|E
2500|$|Many social {{scientists}} {{in other disciplines}} often agonize over the legitimacy of their work as [...] "science", and consequently {{emphasize the importance of}} detachment, objectivity, abstraction, and quantifiability in their work. Perhaps because Boas, like other early anthropologists, was originally trained in the natural sciences, he and his students never expressed such anxiety. Moreover, he did not believe that detachment, objectivity, and quantifiability were required to make anthropology scientific. Since the object of study of anthropologists is different from the object of study of physicists, he assumed that anthropologists would have to employ different methods and different criteria for evaluating their research. Thus, Boas used statistical studies to demonstrate the extent to which variation in data is context-dependent, and argued that the context-dependent nature of human variation rendered many abstractions and generalizations that had been passing as scientific understandings of humankind (especially theories of social evolution popular at the time) in fact unscientific. His understanding of ethnographic fieldwork began {{with the fact that the}} objects of ethnographic study (e.g.,the Inuit of Baffin Island) were not just objects, but subjects, and his research called attention to their creativity and agency. More importantly, he viewed the Inuit as his teachers, thus reversing the typical <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> between scientist and object of study.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{successful}} mainstream Filipino-American rappers is The Black Eyed Peas's apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as [...] "The Apl Song" [...] (Elephunk), [...] "Bebot" [...] (Monkey Business), and [...] "Mare" [...] (The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. [...] "The APL Song" [...] not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer, Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song Allan Pineda Lindo describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, [...] "How would you feel if you had to catch your meal, Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> to one another which is especially important having included another language than English in American Pop song, even though English is one of two of the Official language's of the Philippines.|$|E
