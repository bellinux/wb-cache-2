5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
25|$|Common causes include <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> and NSAIDs. Less common causes include alcohol, cocaine, severe {{illness and}} Crohn disease, among others.|$|E
25|$|PPIs {{have been}} used {{successfully}} in triple-therapy regiments with clarithromycin and amoxicillin for the eradication of <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> with {{no significant difference between}} different PPI-based regimens.|$|E
25|$|Cancer is {{included}} in the differential diagnosis (elucidated by biopsy), <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> as the etiological factor making it 3 to 6 times more likely to develop stomach cancer from the ulcer.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{diseases}} showing similar symptoms. For instance, abdominal pain and tenderness {{may be very}} localized, mimicking acute appendicitis. Furthermore, <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> {{is closely related to}} Campylobacter and causes peptic ulcer disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> colonizes the stomachs of {{more than}} half of the world's population, and the {{infection}} continues to play a key role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastroduodenal diseases. Colonization of the gastric mucosa with <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> results in the development of chronic gastritis in infected individuals, and in a subset of patients chronic gastritis progresses to complications (e.g., ulcer disease, stomach cancers, some distinct extragastric disorders). However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of studies have {{indicated}} that most cases of peptic ulcers, and gastritis, in humans are caused by <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> infection, and an association has been seen with the development of stomach cancer.|$|E
25|$|Another use of AB5 toxins {{is using}} {{members of the}} LT family as adjuvants. This allows the toxin to promote {{immunological}} responses such as IgG2a, IgA, and Th17 to fight for instance gastric <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> infection when a vaccine is given.|$|E
25|$|Some {{strains of}} lactic acid {{bacteria}} may affect <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> infections (which may cause peptic ulcers) in adults when used in combination with standard medical treatments, but no standard in medical practice or regulatory approval exists for such treatment.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} {{may cause}} headaches, including <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> infection, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, and hepatobiliary disorders. The {{treatment of the}} gastrointestinal disorders {{may lead to a}} remission or improvement of headaches.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is {{combined}} with the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin (or metronidazole instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori.</b> Infection by H. pylori is a causative factor {{in the majority of}} peptic and duodenal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} stomach infections of <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori.</b> When used to treat H. pylori infection it is combined with lansoprazole, clarithromycin, omeprazole and others in varying amounts and dosage schedules. It is also used to treat Lyme disease in children under eight-years old.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> was {{identified}} in 1982 by two Australian scientists, Robin Warren and Barry J. Marshall as a causative factor for ulcers. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most gastric ulcers and gastritis {{were caused by}} colonization with this bacterium, not by stress or spicy food as had been assumed before.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} corollaries of the eu-FEDS {{hypothesis}} is that persistent pathogens and aggressive tumor cells are able to either mimic or acquire the same carbohydrate functional groups used to suppress any immune response that could interfere with the reproductive imperative, thus enabling them to similarly resist the human immune response. These pathogens include HIV-1, helminthic parasites such as schistosomes, and <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> the bacterium that causes stomach ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole is {{primarily}} used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontitis, amoebiasis, oral infections, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting is {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% having nausea. However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3–1.5%. After preterm labor, hyperemesis gravidarum {{is the second most}} common reason for hospital admission {{during the first half of}} pregnancy. Factors such as infection with <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> a rise in thyroid hormone production, low age, low body mass index prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and a past history of hyperemesis gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.|$|E
25|$|A major {{causative factor}} (60% of gastric {{and up to}} 50–75% of {{duodenal}} ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> that colonizes the antral mucosa. The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active gastritis (type B gastritis). Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid {{can contribute to the}} erosion of the mucosa and therefore ulcer formation.|$|E
25|$|Bactofilin is a cytoskeletal {{element that}} forms {{filaments}} throughout {{the cells of}} the rod-shaped proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus. The bactofilin protein, BacM, is required for proper cell shape maintenance and cell wall integrity. M. xanthus cells lacking BacM have a deformed morphology characterized by a bent cell body, and bacM mutants have decreased resistance to antibiotics targeting the bacterial cell wall. M. xanthus BacM protein is cleaved from its full-length form to allow polymerization. Bactofilins have been implicated in cell shape regulation in other bacteria, including curvature of Proteus mirabilis cells, stalk formation by Caulobacter crescentus, and helical shape of <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori.</b>|$|E
25|$|In adults, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} areas with a high prevalence of <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and {{has been associated with}} peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe. In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas. Urea breath testing and stool antigen testing perform better than serology-based tests; moreover, serology may be false-positive after treatment with IVIG.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} that subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans, and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by both T. gondii and <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment. Although a causal relationship between latent toxoplasmosis with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established, preliminary evidence suggests that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{in rates}} {{and types of}} {{infection}} alone however, {{have been unable to}} explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, Toxoplasma gondii, and <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma. It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation. Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> {{infection}} (a {{common occurrence}} {{thought to have}} affected {{over half of the}} world's population) is not a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and actually appears to be protective. Despite being a cause of GERD and a risk factor for gastric cancer, the infection seems to be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma of as much as 50%. The biological explanation for a protective effect is somewhat unclear. One explanation is that some strains of H. pylori reduce stomach acid, thereby reducing damage by GERD. Decreasing rates of H. pylori infection in Western populations over recent decades, which have been linked to better hygiene and increased refrigeration of food, could be a factor in the concurrent increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Prunus mume is {{a common}} fruit in Asia and used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine. It has long {{been used as a}} traditional drug and healthy food in East Asian countries. A recent study has indicated that Prunus mume extract is a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with several oral pathogenic bacteria. Recent studies have also shown that Prunus mume extract may inhibit <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers. Experiments on rats suggest that P. mume extract administered during endurance exercise training may enhance the oxidative capacity of exercising skeletal muscle, and may induce the muscle to prefer fatty acids for its fuel use rather than amino acids or carbohydrates, thus assisting endurance.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause is {{infection}} by the bacterium <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> which {{accounts for more than}} 60% of cases. Certain types of H. pylori have greater risks than others. Smoking, dietary factors such as pickled vegetables, and obesity are other risk factors. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread {{to other parts of the}} body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{attendees}} and graduates include Leo Blair, {{the father}} of British Prime Minister Tony Blair; law lecturer at the University of Adelaide while Tony was a child. Robin Warren, who alongside Barry Marshall, discovered that peptic ulcers were largely caused by the infection <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> graduated from the university in the 1950s. Warren and Marshall won the Nobel Prize for their discovery in 2005. Brendon Coventry, who helped discover the immune cycle, Edward Charles Stirling, a physiologist, politician and advocate for women's suffrage, Tim Flannery (Australian of the Year), Maciej Henneberg (physical anthropologist), Margaret Reid, the first female president of the Australian Senate, Janine Haines – the first female federal parliamentary leader of an Australian political party, Margaret White, the first female judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland and Roma Mitchell, the first female Queen's Counsel in Australia (1962), Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia and the first female superior court judge in the British Commonwealth (1965).|$|E
500|$|Drumm {{and colleagues}} {{following}} {{a study of}} children reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> was specifically associated with primary or unexplained gastric inflammation and primary duodenal ulceration whereas the bacteria were not found in association with secondary gastric inflammation and ulcers due to causes such as Crohn's disease or critical illness. [...] Because gastritis and duodenal ulceration are rare in children this study {{had the capacity to}} [...] demonstrate that Warren and Marshall were correct in claiming [...] that H. pylori was a specific pathogen rather than as had been suggested by some, merely an opportunistic colonizer of an inflamed or ulcerated mucosal surface. [...] This {{was the first time that}} New England Journal of Medicine, the worlds leading medical journal published a study [...] on <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori.</b>|$|E
500|$|The European <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>Pylori</b> Study Group {{published}} the Maastricht 2-2000 Consensus Report, suggesting a [...] "test-and-treat" [...] strategy for H. pylori in young patients without atypical symptoms. This strategy advocates {{the use of}} noninvasive testing to evaluate for H. pylori and simply treating if found, {{even in the absence}} of ulcer disease documented on endoscopy.|$|E
500|$|One winner {{has also}} won a Nobel Prize: Barry Marshall, who {{was awarded the}} Buchanan Medal in 1998 [...] "in {{recognition}} of his work on discovering the role of <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> {{as a cause of}} diseases such as duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric cancer and gastritis-associated dyspepsia" [...] and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005. The first winner was John Simon, who won his medal in 1897 [...] "for his distinguished services as an organizer of medical sanitary administration in this country, and as a promoter of scientific research relating to public health"; the most recent winner was Peter Cresswell, who won the medal in 2010 [...] "for his outstanding contributions to immunology, in particular {{to our understanding of the}} processing of foreign protein antigens within cells to stimulate T-cell immune responses." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984 a Western Australian scientist, Dr Barry Marshall, {{discovered}} {{the link between}} <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> (at that time known as Campylobacter pylori) and gastritis. This {{was based on a}} series of self-experiments that involved gastroscopy and biopsy, ingestion of H. pylori, regastroscopy and biopsy and subsequent treatment with tinidazole. His only option was self-experimentation: ethical measures forbade him from administering H. pylori to any other person. In 2005, Marshall and his long-time collaborator Robin Warren were awarded Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, [...] "for their discovery of the bacterium <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> infection, {{alongside}} antibiotics (adjunctive treatment), {{treatment to}} kill H. pylori causing ulcers or other problems involves using two other drugs besides lansoprazole known as [...] "triple therapy", and involves taking twice daily for 10 or 14 days lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin ...|$|E
2500|$|Transformation {{has been}} studied in {{medically}} important Gram-negative bacteria species such as <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. [...] It has also been studied in Gram-negative species found in soil such as Pseudomonas stutzeri, Acinetobacter baylyi, and Gram-negative plant pathogens such as Ralstonia solanacearum and Xylella fastidiosa. Transformation among Gram-positive bacteria {{has been studied}} in medically important species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus sanguinis and in Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. It has also been reported in at least 30 species of Proteobacteria distributed in the classes alpha, beta, gamma and epsilon. The best studied Proteobacteria with respect to transformation are the medically important human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae (class beta), Haemophilus influenzae (class gamma) and <b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> (class epsilon) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori</b> {{bacterial}} infection {{is associated with}} chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The scientific study [...] "Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains" [...] performed by the Medical University of Sofia concluded that all tested L. bulgaricus strains inhibited a number of H. pylori strains.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Helicobacter</b> <b>pylori,</b> enterotoxigenic E. coli TOP10 strain, 987P-fimbriated enterotoxigenic E. coli (a {{strain of}} E. coli), and Lactobacillus reuteri are {{different}} strains of bacteria {{that are found}} {{to adhere to the}} gastrointestinal tract’s mucosal surface.
