40|$|This paper makes four propositions. First, it {{argues that}} the euro’s {{institutional}} design makes it function like the interwar gold exchange standard during periods of stress. Just like the gold exchange standard during the 1930 s, the euro created a ‘core’ of surplus countries and a ‘periphery’ of deficit countries. The latter have to sacrifice their internal <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in order to restore their external equilibrium, and therefore {{have no choice but}} to respond to balance of payments crises by a series of deflationary spending, price and wage cuts. The paper’s second claim is that the euro’s institutional design and the EU’s response to its ‘sovereign debt crisis’ during 2010 - 13 deepened the recession in the Eurozone periphery, as EMU leaders focused almost exclusively on austerity measures and structural reforms and paid only lip service to the need to rebalance growth between North and South. As Barry Eichengreen argued in Golden Fetters, the rigidity of the gold standard contributed to the length and depth of the Great Depression during the 1930 s, but also underscored the incompatibility of the system with legitimate national democratic government in places like Italy, Germany, and Spain, which is the basis for the paper’s third proposition: the euro crisis instigated a crisis of democratic government in Southern Europe underlining that democratic legitimacy still mainly resides within the borders of nation states. By adopting the euro, EMU member states gave up their ability to control major economic policy decisions, thereby damaging their domestic political legitimacy, which in turn dogged attempts to enact structural reforms. Evidence of the erosion of national democracy in the Eurozone periphery can be seen in the rise of anti-establishment parties, and the inability of traditional center-left and center-right parties to form stable governments and implement reforms. The paper’s fourth proposition is that the euro’s original design and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis further widened the existing democratic deficit in the European Union, as manifested in rising anti-EU and anti-euro sentiment, as well as openly Eurosceptic political movements, not just in the euro periphery, but also increasingly in the euro core...|$|E
40|$|A political-economic {{model of}} the {{composition}} of government debt, that is, whether it is issued to domestic or foreign holders, is presented. The key determinant will be the political constraints on repudiation of foreign and domestic debt, which will determine {{the nature of the}} <b>domestic</b> political <b>equilibrium.</b> <b>Economic</b> and political factors determine the effective cost of borrowing at home or abroad, and with the ability to segment markets the government acts like a discriminating monopsonist in placing its debt. A country that expects to face a low effective foreign interest rate, reflecting the expectation that it won't be forced to repay its foreign debts in full, will be characterized by high government spending, a high government budget deficit, low domestic saving and thus a high trade balance deficit so that the domestic economy will look mismanaged in terms of a number of macroeconomic indicators. Very lenient foreign assistance programs would have the same effect. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the influence of Regional Taxes, Regional Retribution, and Specific Allocation Fund (DAK) toward <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth as measured by Regional Gross Domestic Product (PDRB) with capital expenditures as moderating variable. Secondary data of those variables were collected from District and Cities in Java Island using purposive sampling method. Hypothesis test in this research used a multiple regression analysis. The results of the statistical test indicated that simultaneously Regional Taxes, Regional Retribution, and DAK had significant effect on <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth. Partially, Regional Taxes had positive and significant effect on <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth. Regional Retribution and DAK had no effect on <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth. The results of moderation test indicatedthat Capital Expenditures weaken the effect of Regional Taxes on <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth and strengthen the effect of Domestic Retribution on <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth. While Capital Expenditures as a moderating variable was not able to moderate the effect of DAK on <b>Domestic</b> <b>Economic</b> Growth. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{variant of}} the compensation hypothesis rests {{on the premise that}} increased trade exposure heightens <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> volatility, prompting demands for compensation via generous systems of transfers and services. Economic theory suggests that because the expansion of international trade entails integration into larger, deeper, more stable markets, and may entail risk diversification, it may actually promote rather than reduce stability. By the same token, however, economic theory also suggests that smaller economies should experience greater levels of volatility than larger economies, and thus also greater levels of insecurity. The evidence presented here suggests that the level of <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> volatility in the developed economies, during {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century, may indeed have been driven by the size and depth of markets. And critically, for these countries international trade integration may have eased rather than accentuated <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> volatility. ...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{contribution}} of economic openness and the domestic economy to income?” is tested using quantity measures of trade, finance, and <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> base. The short answer is: “It depends”. Africa and the Americas lose from both trade and financial openness. Asia gains from trade openness but not from financial openness. The industrialized region benefits from both trade and financial openness. In all regions, the <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> base compensates for any adverse effects of economic openness. The overall experience with openness could still be enhanced with healthier external and domestic engagements, especially with the latter increasing its relative role in economies. The case study on the Philippines finds that its economy gains from trade and financial openness but not from its <b>domestic</b> <b>economic</b> base. In this case, economic progress is difficult because the gains from external engagement are wiped out by the losses from domestic economy disengagement. ...|$|R
