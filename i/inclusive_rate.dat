40|$|We give a brief {{review of}} the theory of {{inclusive}} decays of heavy hadrons and a discussion of its application to the calculation of several physical quantities. I-Theory of Inclusive Decays of Heavy Hadrons The basic theoretical tool used to study of heavy hadrons is the Wilson operator-product expansion (OPE). The expansion parameter is not necessarily the inverse heavy-quark mass mQ, but rather the energy release, ǫ, of the process at hand. In most calculations of the <b>inclusive</b> <b>rates,</b> ǫ is of the order of the heavy-quark mass, the OPE is expected to give accurate predictions for the decay widths [1]-[5], [7].
