Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest {{uninterrupted}} labors, which know no night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless <b>dairy</b> <b>room</b> of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of [...] "There she blows!"

5000|$|The housemates {{were given}} their fourth weekly task on Day 23, which {{required}} the eight remaining housemates {{to learn the}} Semaphore signalling system. The housemates worked in pairs and attempted to both communicate and transcribe messages using the code. They wagered 35% of their budget on the task, which they failed. The group missed their opportunity to enter the storage room when it opened, thus their food remained locked. The housemates were later given a second task {{in which they had}} to perform a good deed; the housemates passed this task, thus earned the food. On Day 25, Caroline and Tom were nominated for eviction by their fellow housemates. On Day 29, Caroline became the third housemate to be evicted from the House with 62% of the public vote. Nichola celebrated her birthday in the House, thus the housemates were given material to make their own costumes. That same day, the housemates discovered an assault course in the garden, and learned they had to complete the course within eight minutes at a later date. They wagered 50% of their weekly shopping budget on the task, which they ultimately passed. On Day 32, Craig and Nichola were nominated for eviction by their fellow housemates. On Day 35, after weeks of controversy, Nick was ejected from the House when it was revealed he had attempted to influence nominations; a pen and paper were later discovered in his belongings, which he had used to communicate names to his fellow housemates. In the lead up to this, Nick was seen telling Melanie that he saw who would be voted off each week, with Tom winning [...] "All in a dream", causing her to voice her concerns in the <b>Dairy</b> <b>Room.</b> Nick also wrote on a blackboard Tom was using to suggest lyrics for a song the housemates were to perform, as part of a task, being the name of a housemate.

50|$|Dairy farming has {{historically}} been the main business of the area.

By damming the creeks, power was created for foundries and mills. Hop growing and maple syrup production were seasonal occupations. Each of the town's communities developed business districts and became self-sufficient. The last spike of the Edmeston branch of the Ontario & Western RR from New Berlin, was driven at Edmeston in January, 1889, but a rumoured extension to Richfield Springs was never built. Then cars, buses and trucks arrived on the scene. Dams were washed out and electricity became available. The hamlets evolved into bedroom communities.

50|$|Dermaton® was {{the first}} {{registered}} product containing chlorfenvinphos. It {{was introduced in the}} United States in 1963 and was used as an insecticide and acaricide for controlling fleas and ticks on domestic pets and other animals. Between 1963 and 1970, additional uses were registered, including the use as fly spray, surface spray and larvicide. Because of these effects, chlorfenvinphos was often used on farms to control adult flies in <b>dairy</b> barns, milk <b>rooms,</b> poultry houses and yards and other animal buildings. Furthermore, it was used to control larval flies in manure storage pits and piles and other refuse accumulation areas around dairies and feedlots. In the early 1980s, chlorfenvinphos was registered for additional uses in a dust formulation for use in dog kennels and in dog collars for the control of fleas and ticks. Outside the United States, chlorfenvinphos, registered under the trade names Birlane®, C8949, CGA 26351, Sapecron®, Steladone® and Supona®, was used as a soil insecticide for controlling root maggots, root worms and cutworms. Chlorfenvinphos was also used against Colorado beetles on potatoes and scale insects and mite eggs one\ citrus. Furthermore, the compound had the same uses as in the United States.|$|R

Local contractor William Henderson was awarded the project and construction began on the new residence in the spring of 1889 on fifty-three acres. The ground floor consisted of a lobby or reception area, a vestibule and a main hall, a staircase, two drawing rooms, dining room, library, billiard room, kitchen, housekeeper's room, servant's hall, scullery, <b>dairy</b> storage, cooling <b>room,</b> storeroom, china pantry, wine vault, brick safe and a lavatory....At its completion in 1891, Government House was by far the most advanced dwelling in the Northwest Territories. It boasted running water, which was pumped from a well in the basement to a collection tank situated in the attic, and then fed by gravity throughout the house. Sewage was directed from indoor flush toilets to a brick cesspool in the garden area....The plan called for Government House to rest upon a foundation comprising brick and stone construction. Its main portion was 64 feet by 55 feet, and the servant's areas, offices, and bedrooms were 55 feet by 42 feet. In the basement, space was to be provided for a furnace, storage areas, and space for tanks for rain and well water.|$|R
60|$|And now {{a word or}} two as to this Orley Farm. In {{the first}} place let it be {{understood}} that the estate consisted of two farms. One, called the Old Farm, was let to an old farmer named Greenwood, and had been let to him and to his father for many years antecedent to the days of the Masons. Mr. Greenwood held about three hundred acres of land, paying with admirable punctuality over four hundred a year in rent, and was regarded by all the Orley people as an institution on the property. Then there was the farm-house and the land attached to it. This was the residence in which Sir Joseph had lived, keeping in his own hands this portion of the property. When first inhabited by him the house was not fitted for more than the requirements of an ordinary farmer, but he had gradually added to it and ornamented it till it was commodious, irregular, picturesque, and straggling. When he died, and during the occupation of his widow, it consisted of three buildings of various heights, attached to each other, and standing in a row. The lower contained a large kitchen, which had been the living-room of the farm-house, and was surrounded by bake-house, laundry, <b>dairy,</b> and servants' <b>room,</b> all of fair dimensions. It was two stories high, but the rooms were low, and the roof steep and covered with tiles. The next portion had been added by Sir Joseph, then Mr. Mason, when he first thought of living at the place. This also was tiled, and the rooms were nearly as low; but there were three stories, and the building therefore was considerably higher. For five-and-twenty years the farm-house, so arranged, had sufficed for the common wants of Sir Joseph and his family; but when he determined to give up his establishment in the City, he added on another step to the house at Orley Farm. On this occasion he built a good dining-room, with a drawing-room over it, and bed-room over that; and this portion of the edifice was slated.|$|R
