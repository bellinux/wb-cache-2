6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the porch, {{which he}} had {{hitherto}} avoided, and said, pausing before we went out, [...] "My dear child, don't you guess the name?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He, Who formed {{me with a}} mouth, engaged <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> {{nourishment}} till such a time as <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Himself. Thou hast refused me a trifling sum, {{but that}} refusal will not increase thy wealth." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sole Power was {{retired in}} March 2017 {{at the age}} of ten. Lynam said [...] "He was a great horse, but time waits for no man. I was a nobody until he came around and <b>he's</b> <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> places I never felt were {{possible}} to go to.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, at the Museum. We had an orgy in the refreshment-room. But <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{afterwards}} <b>to</b> Tishy's, {{where we}} had another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not by me," [...] said De Bracy, hastily; [...] "I was his prisoner, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> mercy. I {{will not}} harm a feather in his crest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{called himself}} my guardian. I {{believe that when}} I was very young <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the convent where I have been ever since. Two days ago he came to fetch me away." ...|$|E
6000|$|JILL. There isn't much, Dodo. I was in {{an awful}} funk for fear I should meet any of the others, and of course I did meet Rolf, but I told him some lie, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> her room-boudoir, they call it --isn't boudoir a [...] "dug-out" [...] word? ...|$|E
60|$|I was not discouraged, however, {{and when}} the captain came out I {{proposed}} to him that <b>he</b> should <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Sanpritchit the next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I met Mr. Redbrook of Mercer, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> up <b>to</b> his lodgings. If I can do {{anything}} for you, a message will reach me there." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> forward <b>to</b> a great water jar {{that stood}} upon the prow and, behold! {{it seemed to}} be full of blood, and in it was a fish dead, and--stinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vaucross {{stopped and}} talked to {{me a few minutes}} and then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> a high-toned {{restaurant}} to eat dinner. There was music, and then some Beethoven, and Bordelaise sauce, and cussing in French, and frangipangi, and some hauteur and cigarettes. When I am flush I know them places.|$|E
60|$|After lunch, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the kennels to {{introduce}} {{me to the}} other dogs. I had to go, but I knew {{it would not be}} pleasant, and it wasn't. Any dog will tell you what these prize-ribbon dogs are like. Their heads are so swelled they have to go into their kennels backwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was walking}} home through the City, with my kind cousin [...] Augustus, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> that wonderfully {{handsome}} and [...] extraordinarily large new shop, just opened by those [...] enterprising men, Brown, Jones, and Robinson, at No. 81, [...] Bishopsgate Street.

60|$|I {{have never}} known the wind {{to be in the}} east for a single moment since the day when <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the porch to read the name. I remarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and he said, no, truly; it had finally {{departed}} from that quarter on that very day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably {{close to}} half past one. It was two o'clock when I {{looked at my watch}} at Florence Kingsley's house. Directly after Stewart sent Bonita away <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Miss Kingsley's. So, {{allowing}} for the walk and a few minutes' conversation with her, I can pretty definitely say the shooting took place at about half past one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did. At least, {{she thought}} Jason Jones was an artist," [...] {{answered}} Alora with bitter emphasis. [...] "But he was, in fact, a mere dauber. He became discouraged in {{his attempts to}} paint and soon after <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> New York he destroyed all his work--really, it was dreadful!--and {{since then he has}} never touched a brush." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nobody {{can be more}} noble in {{everything}} of that kind than Benjamin," [...] said Gertrude. [...] "It is only because he loves me with all his heart that he is here. Why else was it that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> off <b>to</b> Ostend?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{said that}} Chicago was a live town, {{and that all}} the creatures hurrying by me were engaged in business. That is {{to say they were}} trying to make some money that they might not die through lack of food to put into their bellies. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> canals as black as ink, and filled with un-told abominations, and bid me watch the stream of traffic across the bridges.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{whole affair}} came upon {{me like a}} thunderclap," [...] he told her. [...] "Richard Fardell found it out somehow, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see Parkins. But it was too late. Polden had hold {{of the story and}} meant to use it. I never {{imagined}} but that Parkins had been talking and this journalist had got hold of him by accident. Now I understand that it was Borrowdean who was pulling the strings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} how that may be," [...] said Jonathan, [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> his apartment, and there, obtaining a {{knowledge}} of the trust thou didst burden me with, he demanded it of me, and upon my refusing to deliver it to him he presently fell to attacking me with a dagger. In my efforts to protect my life I inadvertently caused him to plunge the knife into his own bosom and to kill himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes! but I {{am going}} to buy one in London. Dr. Masham says <b>he</b> will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{a place where the}} finest knives in the world are to be bought. It is a great thing to go to London with Dr. Masham.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Pemberton {{wondered}} {{again if}} he might pretend not to understand; but everything good {{gave way to the}} intensity of Morgan’s understanding. “Do you mean <b>he</b> may <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> live with him for ever and ever?” cried the boy. “May <b>take</b> <b>me</b> away, away, anywhere he likes?” ...|$|R
6000|$|Then all {{sat down}} to the {{woodland}} feast and talked among themselves of the merry jest that had been played upon the Sheriff, and of the adventures that had befallen {{each member of the}} band in his disguise. But when the feast was done, Robin Hood took Little John apart and said, [...] "Truly am I vexed in my blood, for I heard the Sheriff say today, 'Thou shootest better than that coward knave Robin Hood, that dared not show his face here this day.'

60|$|For an {{hour that}} {{afternoon}} Caligula {{sat on the}} back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper, which was unusual in a man who despised print.

For he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down, which was his way.|$|E
60|$|He {{showed me}} all the lions; but more than all, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see a charming lioness--a young damsel--the {{daughter}} of a chief--the reputation of whose charms had spread to the neighbouring islands, and even brought suitors therefrom. Among these was Tooboi, the heir of Tamatory, King of Eaiatair, one of the Society Isles. The girl was certainly fair to look upon. Many heavens were in her sunny eyes; and the outline of that arm of hers, peeping forth from a capricious tappa robe, was the very curve of beauty.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{trying to}} be a little warrior. That's what Uncle Chris always used to call me. It started the day when <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have a tooth out, when I was ten. 'Be a little warrior, Jill!' he kept saying. 'Be a little warrior!' And I was." [...] She looked at the clock. [...] "But I shan't be if they don't get here soon. The {{suspense}} is awful." [...] She strummed the keys. [...] "Suppose she doesn't like me, Freddie!

6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{have so much}} to tell you, and the {{carriage}} is waiting already. Thank goodness we dine alone to-morrow night.

60|$|Buck {{claimed he}} knew a {{suitable}} feminine and <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> around <b>to</b> see Miss Sarah Malloy. The minute I see her I am pleased. She looked to be the goods as ordered. No sign of the three p's about her--no peroxide, patchouli, nor peau de soie; about twenty-two, brown hair, pleasant ways--the kind of a lady for the place.|$|R
60|$|Now it was {{perfectly}} clear. <b>He</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> New York, have me locked up, and then return by the next train to Boston. But for once Mr. Stillwell had missed his calculations.|$|R
