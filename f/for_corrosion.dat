5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, {{ruthenium}} and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of oxidation states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces <b>for</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 1 April 2006, the International Association of Classification Societies {{has adopted}} the Common Structural Rules. The rules apply to bulkers more than 90meters {{in length and}} require that scantlings' {{calculations}} take into account items such as the effect of corrosion, the harsh conditions often found in the North Atlantic, and dynamic stresses during loading. The rules also establish margins <b>for</b> <b>corrosion,</b> from 0.5 to 0.9mm.|$|E

On the cable-stayed section, the bridge is marked with navigation lights, {{as well as the}} center of the sailing area having a racon. The bridge is the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E
30|$|Proposed {{regression}} equation {{is very much}} useful for quick assessment to predict the bond strength values <b>for</b> different <b>corrosion</b> levels in structures. Structures can be monitored <b>for</b> different <b>corrosion</b> levels using the applied corrosion monitoring instrument.

5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily <b>for</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections <b>for</b> <b>corrosion,</b> a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E

25|$|To prevent {{corrosion}} {{the fuel}} {{system must be}} made of suitable materials, electrical wires must be properly insulated and the fuel level sensor must be of pulse and hold type, magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type.

25|$|Techniques for {{preparing}} and handling molten salt were first developed at Oak Ridge National Lab. The purpose of salt purification was to eliminate oxides, sulfur and metal impurities. Oxides {{could result in}} the deposition of solid particles in reactor operation. Sulfur had to be removed because of its corrosive attack on nickel-based alloys at operational temperature. Structural metal such as chromium, nickel, and iron had to be removed <b>for</b> <b>corrosion</b> control.|$|E

The mounting struts were tubes of chrome molybdenum steel, enclosed in alloy fairings <b>for</b> <b>corrosion</b> protection. They placed the engine forward of the wing leading edge and the two blade propeller well forward of the pilot's windscreen. This aircraft was flying with the Colombo engine when it attended the Egyptian Air Rally in December 1933.|$|E

The winner was the UH-1B, which was already in service with the Army. The helicopter was designated the UH-1E and modified to meet Marine requirements. The major changes included the use of all-aluminum construction <b>for</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance, radios compatible with Marine Corps ground frequencies, a rotor brake for shipboard use to stop the rotor quickly on shutdown and a roof-mounted rescue hoist.|$|E
25|$|The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted {{sheet metal}} steel receiver, {{but due to}} the higher {{operating}} pressures of the 5.56×45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Finland. All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated <b>for</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower).
