5|$|John Horsefield died on 6 March 1854, aged 62, {{probably}} {{as a consequence}} of a strangulated hernia that had been masked by a tumour. He was buried on 10 March 1854 at the St. Mary's Church, Prestwich, although at some point in his life it seems that he had upset the authorities of the established church for reasons unknown. <b>His</b> <b>table</b> tomb was listed as a Grade II monument by English Heritage in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. <b>His</b> <b>table</b> placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, 1917, the Brewers {{traveled}} to Indianapolis and defeated the team there {{to improve their}} win-loss record to 7–8. Shay visited a local tavern that night and had some drinks. The tavern owner took Shay to a beauty parlor and introduced him to its owner, Gertrude Anderson. Anderson gave Shay a manicure and accompanied him to the Hotel English. Shay complained to busboy Eugene Jones about the placement of sugar bowls at <b>his</b> <b>table.</b> Clarence Euell, a black waiter at the cafe, came to address Shay's concern. An argument ensued during which Shay pulled out a gun and shot Euell in the abdomen. Euell wrestled Shay to the ground, pressing his foot down on Shay's head.|$|E
5|$|The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} the first widely recognized periodic table in 1869. He developed <b>his</b> <b>table</b> to illustrate periodic {{trends in the}} properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E

He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on <b>his</b> <b>table.</b> He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E

5|$|The Wars of the Roses {{during the}} 15th century saw {{prolonged}} fighting between the Yorkists and Lancastrians {{for the control}} of the English throne. John Howard, a Yorkist supporter, was killed at Bosworth Field in 1485 and in the aftermath his son Thomas, the 2nd Duke, was attainted, forfeiting his and his heirs' rights to his properties and titles, and placed in the Tower of London. The Lancastrian victor at Bosworth, Henry VII, granted Framlingham Castle to John de Vere, but Thomas finally regained the favour of Henry VIII after fighting at the victory of Flodden in 1513. Framlingham was returned to Thomas and the Duke spent his retirement there; he decorated <b>his</b> <b>table</b> at the castle with gold and silver plate that he had seized from the Scots at Flodden. The castle was expensively decorated in a lavish style during this period, including tapestries, velvet and silver chapel fittings and luxury bedlinen. A hundred suits of armour were stored in the castle and over thirty horses kept in the stables.|$|E

40|$|Moses Farissol Botarel (Avignon, late fifteenth century) was an {{astronomer}} {{who wrote in}} Hebrew and continued various traditions that depended on astronomy in al-Andalus which, in turn, derived in large part from the zij of al-Battānī (Raqqa, d. 929). <b>His</b> astronomical <b>tables</b> are unusual in that they combine elements from the Parisian Alfonsine Tables with elements from the tables of Levi ben Gerson (Orange, France, d. 1344), Immanuel ben Jacob Bonfils (Tarascon, France, fl. 1350), and Jacob ben David Bonjorn (Perpignan, fl. 1360). We offer an analysis of all <b>his</b> <b>tables,</b> which are restricted to the Sun and the Moon.

25|$|As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several {{offers for}} a {{business}} partnership with an obnoxious young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo). Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at the club. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at <b>his</b> <b>table.</b> Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now-extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga (Luis Guzmán).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a chapter of}} the fourteenth century al-Zīj al-Muwāfiq by Ibn al-Azzūz al-Qusantīnī (d 1354) containing the only known example of numerical tables designed for the computation of the astrological aspects following the most popular method for this practice in the Islamic area: that of lhe Single Hour Line. Ibn Azzūz presents two different procedures. The first one illustrates, according to the author. the method normally used in his time, mentioned by "Ptolemy and Hermes", and transmitted by Abu Ma'shar. The second one is lhe technique that he uses for computing <b>his</b> <b>tables</b> for the latitude of Fes. The geometrical approach of both procedures is the same and what lbn Azzūz offers with <b>his</b> <b>tables</b> is a computational tool that aims to improve (he system avoiding certain errors produced by previous algorilhms. Nevertheless, Ibn Azzūz's final belief is that the computation for lhe aspects must be performed on the ecliptic following the simple method - consisting of adding or subtracting the different aspects to the ecliptical longitude of the star or planet -. whereas the use of <b>his</b> <b>tables</b> is more appropriate for another astrological practice: the tasyīr or system of progressions...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Carlist-controlled territory, Maroto was well {{received by the}} Pretender, who seated him on numerous occasions at <b>his</b> <b>table</b> and tried {{to give him a}} responsible command, which he was unable to accomplish because of the opposition of General Tomás de Zumalacárregui, who always had a negative view of Maroto. When Zumalacárregui was injured in Bilbao, Maroto received a direct order from Don Carlos to replace him and took command of his army. However, the written order, manipulated, was confusing and almost contradictory: Don Carlos ordered that Maroto remain in the army, but under the orders of field marshal Francisco Benito Eraso, until, for reasons of health, the latter retired from the Army of the North. He was told to remain patient and in the meantime to obverse the actions of said general, which could be suspicious.
