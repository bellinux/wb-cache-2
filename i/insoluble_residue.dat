500|$|Osmium is {{obtained}} commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing. During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals, together with non-metallic {{elements such as}} selenium and tellurium settle {{to the bottom of}} the cell as anode mud, which forms the starting material for their extraction. In order to separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several methods are available depending on the separation process and the composition of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia, and dissolution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid. Osmium, ruthenium, rhodium and iridium can be separated from platinum, gold and base metals by their insolubility in aqua regia, leaving a solid residue. Rhodium can be separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium bisulfate.

40|$|The cerium {{anomalies}} {{preserved in}} the Chalk have been investigated as possible palaeoredox indicators of the Late Cretaceous Sea and its sediment.

Variations in the cerium anomaly of different particle size fractions of uncemented chalks suggest that fractionation of rare earth elements between the Chalk's seawater and the various organisms that contributed skeletal material to the bioclastic calcite of the Chalk may have occurred. Post-depositional processes of calcite cementation and late diagenetic sulphidisation have had no apparent effect on the cerium anomaly of the acetic acid <b>insoluble</b> <b>residues.</b> The cerium anomalies associated with the acetic acid <b>insoluble</b> <b>residues</b> from (1) an alternating sequence of chalks and marls from Ballard Cliff (Dorset, UK) typical of Milankovitch cyclicity show a marked diagenetic pattern, whereas those from (2) non-volcanic and volcanic marls display a pattern that is best explained by the variations in the availability of phosphorus and the timing of argillisation of volcanic glass during diagenesis.

40|$|Aerosols {{that serve}} as cloud {{condensation}} nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) {{have the potential to}} profoundly influence precipitation processes. Furthermore, changes in orographic precipitation have broad implications for reservoir storage and flood risks. As part of the CalWater field campaign (2009 – 2011), the variability and associated impacts of different aerosol sources on precipitation were investigated in the California Sierra Nevada using an aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer for precipitation chemistry, S-band profiling radar for precipitation classification, remote sensing measurements of cloud properties, and surface meteorological measurements. The composition of <b>insoluble</b> <b>residues</b> in precipitation samples collected at a surface site contained mostly local biomass burning and long-range-transported dust and biological particles (2009), local sources of biomass burning and pollution (2010), and long-range transport (2011). Although differences in the sources of <b>insoluble</b> <b>residues</b> were observed from year to year, the most consistent source of dust and biological residues were associated with storms consisting of deep convective cloud systems with significant quantities of precipitation initiated in the ice phase. Further, biological residues were dominant (up to 40 %) during storms with relatively warm cloud temperatures (up to − 15 °C), supporting the important role bioparticles can play as ice nucleating particles. On the other hand, lower percentages of residues from local biomass burning and pollution were observed over the three winter seasons (on average 31 and 9 %, respectively). When precipitation quantities were relatively low, these <b>insoluble</b> <b>residues</b> most likely served as CCN, forming smaller more numerous cloud droplets at the base of shallow cloud systems, and resulting in less efficient riming processes.

40|$|The Upper Mississippi Valley mining {{district}} in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois {{is one of}} several world-class lead-zinc mineral districts in developed Paleozoic strata of the northern Midcontinent. Although Mississippi Valley-type deposits vary considerably from district to district, they are defined as being predominantly sphalerite-galena replacement and vein deposits-including vug and breccia fillings-in carbonate host rocks. In general, they are restricted to certain formations; as such they are peneconformable but clearly crosscutting. Therefore, Mississippi Valley-type mineral deposits are epigenetic and stratabound, but not stratiform. Minor occurrences of base-metal sulfides also are present in calcareous and, to a lesser extent, in shaly and sandy rocks in a broad zone surrounding the main Upper Mississippi Valley lead-zinc district. These outlying occurrences are of special interest because similarities in form, distinctive mineral paragenesis, and sulfur and lead isotope systematics imply that they were cogenetic with mineralization in the main district. The outlying occurrences may represent remnants of fluid pathways associated with mineralization in the main district. To evaluate the extent of mineralization in southeastern Minnesota, we initiated a geochemical study that focused on the minor-and trace-element content of <b>insoluble</b> <b>residues</b> in carbonate rocks, using samples from drill holes and operating quarries throughout southeastern Minnesota (Fig. 2; Tables 4 - 52 in appendix). Regional geochemical studies of this kind have revealed, even in rocks that appear to be barren of sulfide ores, a suite of metals characteristic of Mississippi Valley-type mineral deposits.
