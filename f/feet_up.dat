5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> on the desk, realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind <b>feet,</b> <b>up</b> and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E

25|$|The Mayan Temple is {{the grand}} icon of Aquaventure, with {{a height of}} over six stories. The {{structure}} features a series of water rides, including the Leap of Faith, a 60-foot near-perpendicular plunge that sends riders through a clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a shark-filled lagoon. Also located atop the Mayan Temple are the Challenger Slides, two high-speed dueling slides where riders race against the clock for the best times. From just below, the Serpent Slide spins out from 48 <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> the Temple and into the Temple's dark core before emerging through the shark-filled lagoon at a more leisurely “shark-viewing” pace.

25|$|Fox species {{differ in}} fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to {{black and white}} to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted {{to life in the}} desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, {{insulating}} fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with white marking. A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the <b>feet,</b> <b>up</b> the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.|$|E
25|$|British and French {{pilots were}} given {{two weeks of}} training, but the Americans were {{expected}} to fly {{as soon as they}} arrived. Another American flyer, Hilaire du Berrier, was already in Spain by time they arrived.

When the commandant insisted that the planes were safe, Lord took him up for a test flight, and at two thousand <b>feet</b> <b>up</b> one of the four wings broke off. The commandant motioned Lord to climb higher so they could escape by using their parachutes. Lord wanted to try to land with the remaining lower wings intact. He landed the plane safely but was arrested at the airfield. An airplane mechanic intervened and explained that his loss of the wing was accidental, and was not intentional. The pilots went to Valencia, Spain to complain to the Second Spanish Republic air ministry, but nothing changed. Acosta, Schneider and Lord planned to escape from Bilbao to Biarritz, France by motorboat after they had been refused a promised Christmas leave. Their plan was discovered and the pilot of their boat was arrested and executed. The pilots were then jailed for 18 hours. They then returned to the United States.|$|E
