40|$|The {{benefits}} of the modern knowledge economy differ greatly between advanced economies. Average annual labor productivity growth (measured as GDP per hour of work) in the United States accelerated from 1. 2 percent in the 1973 – 1995 period to 2. 3 percent from 1995 to 2006. Conversely, the 15 European Union countries that constituted the union up to 2004 experienced a productivity growth slowdown between these two time periods. For these 15 countries as a group, labor productivity growth declined from {{an annual rate of}} 2. 4 percent during the period 1973 – 1995 to 1. 5 percent during the period 1995 – 2006.

This paper shows that the European productivity slowdown is attributable to the slower emergence of the knowledge economy in Europe compared to the United States.

Inadequate uterine receptivity {{may contribute to the}} majority of implantation failures. To provide a comprehensive inventory of genes and functional networks that represent the maternal input of the embryo-maternal cross-talk, a longitudinal, holistic study of the endometrial transcriptome in relation to the days of estrous and to the receptivity of the endometrium was performed in bovine. At day 3 of estrous, genes related to cell communication and mitochondrial energy metabolism were differentially expressed among high- and low-receptive endometria (HR, LR); at day 7, transcripts functioning in immune and inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis had different abundances. Additionally, temporal transcriptional changes between days 3 and 7 differed considerably among HR and LR. Further, several transcription factors were predicted as relevant for receptivity because they were either differentially expressed among HR and LR animals or are known to be associated with genes we detected to have differential expression. Finally, global DNA methylation varied according to the interaction of receptivity group and day of estrous, and a <b>divergent</b> <b>trend,</b> which correlated with abundance of DNMT 1 transcript, was observed in LR and HR along the estrous cycle days. The study revealed that, even in early estrous, transcripts related to cell communication and response to exogenous stimuli, vascularization, and energy supply show divergent expression and longitudinal temporal regulation in HR and LR.

40|$|The {{observations}} {{show that}} less massive the galaxies are, the higher on average is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar mass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen for local and high-z (back to z~ 1 - 2) galaxy samples. We use observational data related only to disc galaxies {{and explore the}} average SSFR change with z for different masses. For Ms in the range ~ 10 ^ 9. 5 - 10 ^ 10. 5 Msun, the SSFR increases with (1 +z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller galaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM hierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc galaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc feedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories are explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned to reproduce the z~ 0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of outflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to (1 +z) ^ 2. 2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass as Ms^ 0. 1, i. e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to the observed strong SSFR-DS trend. For the re-accretion cases, the dependence on z remains approximately the same as without re-infall, but the correlation on Ms even increases {{for most of the}} reasonable values of the model parameters. The comparison of models and observations in the SSFR-Ms plane at z~ 0 shows the <b>divergent</b> <b>trend</b> in SSFR as lower are the masses (upsizing vs downsizing). We explain why the models show the reported trends, and conclude that the SSFR-DS for low-mass galaxies poses a challenge for LCDM-based disc galaxy evolution models.

In order to achieve this objective, we have done an analysis of the existing literature about this field, from a critical perspective, reviewing the work and writings of several authors that may position towards the Efficient Market Theory, or against it. Following this procedure, we meet two authors that are presented as the two leading figures of the trends in favor or against the theory, and whose literature is deeply studied.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{movement}} in the nominal and real remuneration of two selected positions in the South African public sector over the period 1984 to 2008. Over this period a <b>divergent</b> <b>trend</b> is discernible in the nominal and real remuneration of these two positions. The choice of positions {{in the public sector}} was determined by the availability of historic and current remuneration information and {{by the fact that the}} designations and responsibilities of these positions seemingly remained homogeneous over the period of comparison. South Africa has suffered considerable “job title” inflation over this period, thereby rendering numerous positions unsuitable for comparative purposes. In comparing the remuneration of these two positions in real terms; on a gross and after tax basis; and in terms of increases in prices of selected goods, this paper tests a hypothesis that cost-of-living adjustments in remuneration kept abreast of inflation and of general price increases over the period 1984 to 2008. The comparison confirms the hypothesis in one instance, but refutes it in another instance. This comparison confirms that periodic remuneration adjustments are necessary under conditions of sustained inflation to take account of cost-of-living increases. Without such adjustments incumbents would increasingly experience declines in their standards of living and would be tempted to leave the public sector for better paying positions in the private sector. Oneoff structural adjustments are required to re-align relative remuneration of positions once adjustments have not kept abreast of inflation. In as much as the remuneration of one of the groups used for comparative purposes declined in real terms (i. e. did not keep pace with inflation), it is obvious that the remuneration adjustments of this group did not take any cognisance of possible improvements in productivity. Any compensation for productivity improvements during a period of sustained inflation (albeit more moderate towards the second half of the period of comparison) as was the case in South Africa between 1984 and 2008, would have been reflected in a real improvement in remuneration over this period. Compensation for productivity improvements are outside the scope of this paper. The comparison of the prices of selected goods purchased by a typical household shows considerable changes in relative prices. During a period of sustained inflation, as South Africa suffered from 1984 to 2008 (albeit more moderate from the middle of the 1990 s), price movements reflecting relative price changes are often confused with general price inflation. This impedes the ability of consumers to adjust their spending patterns to reflect changes in relative prices. Over time this inability could contribute to a misallocation of resources in an economy. The methodology developed in this paper can be used for similar comparisons of nominal and real remuneration outside the public sector. The only conditions for such comparisons are the availability of current and historic remuneration information, positions that remained relatively homogeneous in terms of job title and responsibility over the period of comparison, and inflation figures reflected in some or another price index. Likewise, the only conditions for price comparisons are historic and current price data and a relevant price index. The final conclusion is that some restructuring of remuneration in the public sector could be required to ensure the retention of suitably qualified staff. The methodology applied in this paper can be used to calculate the magnitude of structural adjustments required in the public sector to eradicate real declines in remuneration. This methodology can also be used by negotiators to calculate fair and reasonable remuneration adjustments. The fields of application of this methodology developed from the perspective of the economic science are therefore in general management, the management of human resources and organised labour.

40|$|Background: Comparing {{incidence}} of and mortality from cancer {{within a given}} population yields several benefits. One {{of these is the}} opportunity, when trends in incidence differ from those in mortality, to derive inferences about the poten-tial role of improved diagnosis in the rise of incidence rates, and about therapeutic advancements in reducing mortality. Materials and methods: Trends in {{incidence of}} and mor-tality from various cancers or groups of cancers (comprising 55, 682 new malignant tumours and 26, 528 certified cancer deaths) over the period 1974 - 1993 were compared using, respectively, data from the Cancer Registry of the Swiss Can-ton of Vaud (with about 600, 000 inhabitants) and those pro-vided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Results: The overall cancer incidence increased by 10 % to 30 % in both sexes and various age groups, whereas mortality remained approximately the same. The sites primarily re-sponsible for these <b>divergent</b> <b>trends</b> were breast, prostate and colorectal, three sites where cancers have been less frequent-ly diagnosed since the advent of certain technical advance-ments and the introduction of screening.
