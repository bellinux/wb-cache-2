5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed <b>denture)</b> is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial <b>denture)</b> and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full <b>denture).</b> In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the <b>denture</b> wearer.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{the present}} {{prospective}} clinical study was to compare patient-reported outcomes for maxillary conventional <b>dentures</b> and maxillary implant-supported <b>dentures.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-one patients (6 women and 15 men) being edentulous in the maxilla and encountering problems with their existing <b>dentures</b> were included. Twelve patients (4 women and 8 men) received {{a new set of}} conventional <b>dentures,</b> due to insufficient <b>dentures.</b> In nine patients (2 women and 7 men), the existing <b>dentures</b> were adjusted by means of relining or rebasing. All patients received implant-supported <b>dentures</b> on two retentive anchors. In total, 42 implants were inserted in the anterior maxilla. The participants rated their satisfaction on their existing conventional <b>dentures,</b> 2  months after insertion of new conventional <b>dentures</b> and 2  months after insertion of implant-supported <b>dentures.</b> Thereby, patients responded to questionnaires capturing the oral health impact profile (OHIP) using visual analog scales. Seven domains (functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical, psychological and social disability and handicap) were assessed. Higher scores implied poorer patient satisfaction. In addition, the questionnaire involved the evaluation of cleaning ability, general satisfaction, speech, comfort, esthetics, stability, and chewing ability. Higher scores implied higher patient satisfaction. RESULTS Patient satisfaction significantly increased for implant-supported <b>dentures</b> compared with old <b>dentures</b> in all seven OHIP subgroups, as well as for cleaning ability, general satisfaction, ability to speak, comfort, esthetics, and stability (P <  0. 05). The comparison of new conventional <b>dentures</b> and implant-supported <b>dentures</b> revealed a statistically significantly increased satisfaction for functional limitation (difference of 33. 2  mm), psychological discomfort (difference of 36. 7  mm), physical disability (difference of 36. 3  mm), and social disability (difference of 23. 5  mm), (P <  0. 05). Additionally, general satisfaction, chewing ability, speech, and stability significantly improved in implant-supported <b>dentures</b> (P <  0. 05).

25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (also termed <b>denture</b> sore mouth, <b>denture</b> stomatitis, chronic atrophic candidiasis, Candida-associated <b>denture</b> induced stomatitis, and denture-associated erythematous stomatitis) is {{a common}} condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral mucous membrane occurs beneath a <b>denture.</b> In about 90% of cases, Candida species are involved, which are normally a harmless component of the oral microbiota in many people.

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Acrylic resin {{complete}} <b>dentures</b> exhibit certain unavoidable dimensional changes. Processing shrinkage {{and expansion}} due to water uptake are 2 important aspects influencing dimensional accuracy. PURPOSE: This study investigated linear dimensional changes and water sorption of <b>dentures</b> processed by dry and wet heat with different rates of cooling. METHODS: Fine crosses marked on tinfoil inserts were {{placed at the}} incisive papilla and tuberosity regions of edentulous maxillary casts and incorporated into the <b>dentures</b> during polymerization by 3 processing techniques. A traveling microscope {{was used to measure}} the distances between the reference points to determine dimensional changes. Water uptake and content were determined by the mass changes of the <b>dentures</b> with an electronic balance. Data of linear dimensional change and water sorption were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance, respectively. Bonferroni simultaneous confidence intervals (95 %) were applied for multiple comparison. RESULTS: Dry heat-processed and water bath-processed acrylic resin <b>dentures</b> did not exhibit significant differences in shrinkage (0. 42 % to 0. 58 %) at water saturation. Amounts of water sorption of <b>dentures</b> processed by dry and wet heat (0. 50 and 0. 48 mass%, respectively) were not significantly different, and their associated expansion did not entirely compensate for the processing shrinkage. The initial water content of dry heat-processed <b>dentures</b> (1. 77 mass%) was unexpectedly slightly higher than that of wet heat-processed <b>dentures</b> (1. 68 mass%). The rate at which the <b>dentures</b> cooled did not affect their initial water content and subsequent water uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Water uptake of dry and wet heat-processed acrylic resin <b>dentures</b> after deflasking was in both cases low, and the <b>dentures</b> did not reveal significant differences in shrinkage at water saturation. Air oven-processed and water bath-processed acrylic resin <b>dentures</b> show similar dimensional shrinkage at water saturation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to assess {{influence}} {{of different types of}} partial <b>dentures</b> on dental plaque accumulation. The study was conducted in three experimental and one control group with 30 examinees each. In the first experimental group were patients with partial acrylic <b>dentures,</b> in the second were patients with overdentures and in the third group were the patients with metal skeletal <b>dentures.</b> Dental plaque on the remaining teeth was measured by Silness-Loe modified method. Dental plaque scores were obtained at a time when <b>dentures</b> were given to patients and after 6 and 12 months of wearing, respectively. The plaque index of all teeth after 12 months of wearing <b>dentures</b> was relatively low in all three examined groups which resulted from previous education and motivation of examinees for oral hygiene maintenance. However, the highest risk of oral diseases caused by dental plaque is in patients with partial acrylic <b>dentures,</b> then in patients with overdentures, and best preventive effect was achieved in patients with metal skeletal <b>dentures...</b>|$|R

Tribological characteristics of all metal <b>dentures</b> are high, {{but they do not}} meet aesthetic and functional requirements and permanent <b>dentures</b> with ceramic coating cause significant abrasion of the antagonist teeth. Several studies indicated that zirconium dioxide <b>dentures</b> do not cause any abrasion of the antagonist teeth, they are aesthetic and bioinert. ...|$|R
25|$|A {{removable}} partial <b>denture</b> (RPD) is a <b>denture</b> for {{a partially}} edentulous patient who desires to have replacement teeth for functional or aesthetic reasons and who cannot have a bridge (a fixed partial <b>denture)</b> for any reason, {{such as a}} lack of required teeth to serve as support for a bridge (i.e. distal abutments) or financial limitations.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{infection}} and mechanical trauma, inflammatory {{reactions of the}} mucosa beneath a <b>denture</b> can also result from irritation or allergy (allergic contact stomatitis) caused by the materials in the <b>denture</b> itself (acrylic, cobalt, chromium), or in response to substances within <b>denture</b> adhesives. Incomplete curing of the acrylic resin (the prosthetic material) may also be an involved factor.|$|E
25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care. Using <b>denture</b> adhesive may improve the fit, but it tends to work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the <b>denture</b> fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a <b>denture,</b> but it is only a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made <b>denture</b> should last about 5 years or more.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dentures</b> {{that fit}} well {{during the first}} few years after {{creation}} will not necessarily fit well {{for the rest of the}} wearer's lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling never stops in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to resorb progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the <b>dentures.</b> Poorly fitting <b>dentures</b> hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting <b>dentures.</b> Poor fitting <b>dentures</b> may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum.|$|R
25|$|In any case, implant-supported <b>dentures</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} over conventional <b>dentures.</b> They offer improved comfort due to less irritation of the gums, confidence due to less risk of slipping out, and appearance due to less plastic required for retention purposes. Patients with implant-supported <b>dentures</b> have increased chewing efficacy and can speak more clearly.|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: The {{fracture}} of acrylic maxillary complete <b>dentures</b> is a commonly seen clinical problem which usually occurs due to heavy occlusal forces or accidental damage. The {{objectives of the}} study were to measure the impact strength of maxillary complete <b>dentures</b> fabricated with high impact acrylic resin and to evaluate the effect of woven E-glass fiber and silane treated glass fiber reinforcement on the impact strength of the Maxillary complete <b>dentures.</b> Methods:One commercially available heat cured acrylic resin (Trevalon HI) was selected. Preimpregnated woven E-glass fibers (Stick Net) and Silane treated glass fibers were used to reinforce ten maxillary complete <b>dentures</b> each. Ten unreinforced complete <b>dentures</b> served as the control group. The impact strength in Joules of the <b>dentures</b> were measured with a falling-weight impact test. Results: The mean impact strength of the control <b>dentures</b> was 75. 22 +/- 10. 392 J at crack initiation, and 84. 62 +/- 11. 495 J at complete fracture. The mean impact strength of <b>dentures</b> reinforced with preimpregnated woven E-glass fibers was 165. 91 +/- 12. 929 J at crack initiation, and 187. 06 +/- 17. 972 J at complete fracture. The mean impact strength of <b>dentures</b> reinforced with silane treated glass fibers was 112. 30 +/- 8. 709 J at crack initiation, and at complete fracture was 126. 43 +/- 8. 709 J. Interpretation and Conclusion:The impact strength of maxillary complete <b>dentures</b> fabricated with high impact acrylic resin increased significantly after reinforcement with preimpregnated woven E-glass fibers and silane treated glass fibers.

25|$|Dentures (also {{known as}} false teeth) are {{prosthetic}} devices constructed to replace missing teeth; they {{are supported by}} the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity.

40|$|Abstract. Dental {{rehabilitation}} by complete <b>dentures</b> is {{a state-of-the-art}} approach to improve functional {{aspects of the}} oral cavity of edentulous patients. It is important to assure that these <b>dentures</b> have a sufficient fit. We introduce a dataset of 13 edentulous patients that have been recorded with and without complete <b>dentures</b> in situ. These patients have been rated an insufficient fit of their <b>dentures,</b> so that additional (sufficient) <b>dentures</b> and additional speech recordings have been prepared. In this paper we show that sufficient <b>dentures</b> increase the performance of an ASR system by ca. 27 %. Based on these results, we present and discuss three different systems that automatically determine whether the <b>dentures</b> of an edentulous person have a sufficient fit or not. The system with the best performance models the recordings by GMMs and uses the mean vectors of these GMMs as features in an SVM. With this system {{we were able to}} achieve a recognition rate of 80 %. Key words: speech recognition, user modeling, assistive technology, applied system...|$|R

25|$|In {{cases where}} a patient needs a {{complete}} {{upper and lower}} set of dentures, costs can be reduced by having a conventional non-implanted upper <b>denture,</b> since retention of upper dentures {{is much easier to}} achieve, and an implanted lower <b>denture,</b> since lower dentures tend not to fit as well otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{speaking}} partial dentures {{tend to be}} held {{in place}} by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable <b>denture</b> bearing anatomy as the ridge tends to be well formed and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the <b>denture.</b> Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the flange into these regions tends to produce a more retentive lower <b>denture.</b> An implant supported lower <b>denture</b> is another option.|$|E
