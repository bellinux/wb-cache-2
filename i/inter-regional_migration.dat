40|$|Abstract; ProceedingsFormerly {{a country}} of {{nomadism}} par excellence, Mauritania has experienced since its independence in 1960 a spectacular sedentarisation of its nomadic population. In fact, nomads have decreased from 75 % {{of the total population}} in 1965 to 12 % in 1988, and just 6 % in 2000. This rapid and unprecedented sedentarisation, particularly in Southern Mauritania, can be explained by several factors, including the devastating droughts in the 1970 s and 1980 s, as well as the turbulent transformation of Mauritania’s political economy. Together, these factors have destabilized rural livelihoods and accelerated land degradation, livestock loss, urbanization, and conflict between farmers and herders over natural resources and water access across the area, resulting in unprecedented <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration.</b> The aim of this 40 - years study is not to review in detail all the factors driving <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration</b> in Southern Mauritania, but instead to scrutinize at the relationship between vegetation productivity, land cover changes, rainfall trends, and dynamic spatial demographic shifts from 1971 to 2015. In this regard, we propose an advanced assessment approach that integrates demographic information, climatological data, and multi-sensor Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data from 1981 to 2015 at 5. 6 km to characterize the <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration</b> movements in Southern Mauritania. A multi-linear regression analysis was conducted to examine to which extent the <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration</b> movements are controlled by both climate and environmental changes. The demographic data show that Southern Mauritania’s population grew less rapidly at an annual rate between 1977 and 1988 than between 1988 and 2000. The annual growth rate recorded in 2000 was 2. 9 %, compared to 2. 5 % in 1988 and 2. 29 % in 1960. Moreover, the population sedentarized dramatically at a rate of 95. 2 % in 2000 compared to 84. 4 % in 1988. The results also show distinctive interactions between vegetation dynamics, rainfall variations, and <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration</b> during the last four decades: between 1977 and 1988, changes in rainfall bore the greatest impact on migration.

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration</b> as a {{function}} of regional labour market disparities is well known. It is especially important for a country such as Australia with both different and dynamic structures of regional economies, a continuing high level of external migration and a long-term trend of disparities in employment opportunities across the states and regions. The paper discusses an approach to an econometric model of inter-state migration in Australia. Internal population movement from a particular region is measured in relation to the regional level of unemployment. In contrast to previous attempts to construct such a model, <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migration</b> is explained using an essentially non-linear function of unemployment ratio(s) to compare particular regions. The other factor under consideration affecting regional labour markets in Australia is external migration. The inflow's of external migration to Australia are not homogeneously distributed across the states.

40|$|This {{research}} work aims {{to making a}} qualitative approach to the social relevance {{of the slave trade}} in the Congo and northern Angola regions, during the nineteenth century. Framed in the field of the Social and hIstorical Demography, we took as an element of analisys the demographic dynamics of the Angolan soccieties, by essaying the characterization of one micro-demographic variable, the slave migrations. The interest of this theme of research comes up {{by the fact that the}} Atantic slave migrations are generally taken as the driving element of the formation process of the 'Atlantic historical-geographic complex'. Whether they were considered to carry with them particularities belonging to each social formation tied by the slave trade, or bringing odd named-singularities, they are only fully understandable when considered in the whole picture. Thus, the study of the characteristics of this kind of migratory movements, such as their origin, volume and spatial distribution, in Africa, allow us to bypass methods of analysis more centered on the topic of the African dependency on social and economic European structures. The research hypothesis carried on is based on the referenced frame of analysis. By considering the contribution given by the atlantic slave migrations to the structuring of the social formation of the region one is taken to question the way they influenced the demographic behaviors adapted to the new economic realities brought to Occidental Africa in the Modern epoch, as well as the possibility of having influenced the raising of hoemostatic mechanisms of population regulation that weren't strong enough to alter her state in a significant way, at least during the considered period. The method of data analysis adopted was of tyhe causal type. Given the fact that the state of the population is globally expressed by the behavior of three micro-demographic variables - natality, mortality, and migrations - and considering last ones only the <b>inter-regional</b> <b>migrations</b> rooted in the Atlantic slave trade, we aimed at examining the consequences of the permanency of the Angolan slave trade, as of the ones provoked by its sudden eradiction, on the dimension, structure and distribution of the considered region. On the light of what is above said, this work is composed of two main parts: in the first one we try to stress some aspects with major responsibilities on the formation of the South-Atlantic complex based on slave labor. In the second one we carry out an analysis of the relationship between forced migrations and demographic dynamics, namely in what concerns the impact brought by abolition to the Satte of the Population and, by the same token, to the instituted social and economic structuresAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

The main strategic objective, which consists of maintenance of state sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine, and also integration in European and migratory space, ensuring close to the world standards of quality and length of life, realization of rights and freedoms of citizens, is formulated. Actions and tasks of the state migratory policy, ways and methods of regulation of external migrations of the population are considered. Principal reasons of external migrations of population are identified and analysed. The inwardly-regional, interregional and intergovernmental migrations of population of Ukraine in the years of its state independence (1991 - 2014) are analyzed in details. The results of analysis showed that migratory activity goes down on inwardly-regional and interregional levels. Also intensity of exchange of population went down between the regions of country. At the same time Ukraine for years state independence through depopulation processes lost 6, 5 million persons, and in the external migratory moving of population of loss made over 1 million persons. The problem of illegal external labour migration is considered. It is noted that illegal migration from Ukraine to the threats to national security in the Law of Ukraine "On the National Security of Ukraine" is not included, and a {{threat to national security}} posed by illegal migration from Ukraine state authorities and management of both central and local underestimated.

40|$|The 'core-periphery model' is vitiated by its {{assumption}} of static expectations. That is, <b>migration</b> (<b>inter-regional</b> or intersectoral) {{is the key}} to agglomeration, but migrants base their decision on current wage differences alone [...] even though migration predictably alters wages and workers are (implicitly) infinitely lived. The assumption was necessary for analytic tractability. The model can have multiple stable equilibria, so allowing forward-looking expectations would have forced consideration of the very difficult perhaps even intractable issues of global stability in non-linear dynamic systems. This paper's main contribution is to present a set of solution techniques partly analytic and partly numerical that allow us to consider forward-looking expectations. These techniques reveal a startling result. If quadratic migration costs are sufficiently high, allowing forward-looking behaviour has no impact on the main results, so static expectations are truly an {{assumption of}} convenience. If migration costs are lower, however, forward-looking behaviour creates history-vs-expectations considerations. In this case self-fulfilling prophecy. ...|$|R
