Significant interaction of row arrangement × intercropping time of <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> was observed with respect to leaf area index (LAI) of the maize crop. Increasing trends of LAI of maize crop were observed as interseeding of <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> was delayed for 3 weeks after maize (WAM) that stabilized during the 6 WAM interseeding time. Maize stover production was significantly high at 1 : 2 row ratio and delaying of the undersowing <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> in the already established maize crop for 6 weeks, 10. 94 tha - 1 and 11. 39 t ha - 1, respectively. Maize grain yield showed a significant variation with respect to the staggered sowing of <b>haricot</b> <b>bean,</b> whereby the highest (3. 99 t ha - 1) being recorded when <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> intercropping was delayed for 21 days after maize planting. The data of this study revealed that the larger maize plant canopy providing larger photosynthetic area, attained when <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> interseeding was delayed, probably resulted in higher grain yield of maize.

In the present study, a Chi square statistics showed insignificant differences among rotation practices and topographical categories (Table  2). Overall, crop rotation was practiced on 66, 57, 58 and 61 % of sampled cultivated fields of Damot Gale, Damot Sore, Sodo Zuria and total districts, respectively (Additional file 2). Cereals are often rotated with legumes and root crops. <b>Haricot</b> <b>bean</b> is a major legume crop used in the rotation cycle. The rotation in the present study is implemented in the following patterns: (maize → <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> → teff); (root crops → <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> → teff or cereals with root crops). According to local farmers, rotation is implemented to: replenish soil fertility, control pests, make use residual fertilization and receive yield advantage on succeeding crop.|$|R

40|$|<b>Haricot</b> <b>bean</b> is {{considered}} {{as the main}} cash crop and protein source of the farmers in many low lands and mid altitude zones of Ethiopia. The country’s export earning from <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> exceeds that of other pulses such as lentils, horse bean and chickpea. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption of improved technologies and poor marketing system, were among the major problems. Adoption of improved technologies {{is one of the}} most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in Ethiopia. However, the adoption and dissemination of these technologies is constrained by various factors. To this end, the aim of this study was to empirically examine factors affecting adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production package in the study area. Two stage sampling procedure was followed to select rural kebeles and households for the study. Four rural kebeles were selected purposively, and 160 household heads were selected randomly using probability proportional to size sampling. Structured interview schedule was developed, pre-tested and used for collecting the essential quantitative data for the study from the sampled households. Focus group discussion was used to generate qualitative data. In addition, secondary data were collected from relevant sources such as woreda office of agriculture and rural development and others. The result of the study indicated that majority of farmers in the study area preferred local variety over improved because of local market and consumption demand. Moreover, farmers’ practice was found largely to deviate from research and extension recommendations. Result of the econometric model indicated that household head’s attitude towards <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production technology package, participation in extension event (participation in training and field visit) and access to credit were important variables which had positively and significantly influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production package. Where as, perceived relative disadvantage of technology attributes of the household head had shown negative relationship with adoption and intensity of adoption. Some farmers who previously adopted improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties have discontinued planting the varieties mainly due to market problem. The overall finding of the study underlined the high importance of institutional support in the areas of extension; credit and market to enhance adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production package. Therefore, policy and development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support system so as to achieve wider adoption, increased productivity and income to small scale farmers.

40|$|<b>Haricot</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food legumes of Ethiopia and it is considered as the main cash crop and the least expensive source of protein for the farmers in many lowlands and mid altitude of the country. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption of improved technologies and poor marketing system, were among the major problems. Adoption of improved technologies {{is one of the}} most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in Ethiopia. However, the adoption and dissemination of these technologies is constrained by various factors. The aim of this study was to examine factors affecting adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties and associated agronomic practices in Dale Woreda, Sidama zone of SNNPR. In the area, <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> is an important crop, which serves as a source of food and cash. A total of 150 sample households (131 male and 19 female) selected from 5 kebeles of the Woreda were interviewed using structured interview schedule. Qualitative data were collected using group discussion and field observation. Data analysis was done with the help SPSS 17; mainly Chi-square test, F-test Cramer’s V, and Pearson Correlation. Tobit econometrics model was employed using STATA 11. The results of the econometric model indicated that the relative influence of different variables on probability and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production Thus,,sex of house hold head,, attending training on improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production, attending field day programs, conducting demonstration, access to improved seed credit and membership of seed multiplication group were positively and significantly influenced where as market distance negatively influenced adoption and intensity of adoption of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties and associated agronomic practices. Farmers’ evaluation and selection criteria of improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> varieties in the study area in order of importance were high yielding, market demand, price advantage, time of maturity, grain color, grain size, disease resistance and storability. Based on these criteria Nasir variety ranks first and dimtu variety ranks second. In addition, majority of farmers in the study area used seed and fertilizer rates below research and extension recommendations. Farmers’ deviation from recommended package practices was found partly due to inadequate extension service, high cost of fertilizer and also lack of finance. The overall findings of the study underlined the high importance of extension service provision to improve farmers’ access to information and extension advices to address the recommended agronomic practices practically, facilitating access to credit and improving market condition, Attention has to be given to women household headed to participate in improved <b>haricot</b> <b>bean</b> production, Therefore development interventions should give emphasis to improvement of such institutional support systems to increase adoption and productivity of the crop.

60|$|I dined, unromantically enough, {{with a pair}} of {{commercial}} travellers, a post-office clerk, and two stout, elderly men who appeared to be retired officers. Spanish victuals are terrible and strange; food is even more an affair of birth than religion, since a man may change his faith, but hardly his manner of eating: the stomach used to roast meat and Yorkshire pudding rebels against Eastern cookery, and a Christian may sooner become a Buddhist than a beef-eater a guzzler of olla podrida. The Spaniards without weariness eat the same dinner day after day, year in, year out: it is always the same white, thin, oily soup; a dish of <b>haricot</b> <b>beans</b> and maize swimming in a revolting sauce; a nameless entrée fried in oil--Andalusians have a passion for other animals' insides; a thin steak, tough as leather and grilled to utter dryness; raisins and oranges.

Then came a dish of meat--nature unknown, but supposed to be miscellaneous--singularly chopped up with crumbs of bread, seasoned uniquely though not unpleasantly, and baked in a mould--a queer but by no means unpalatable dish. Greens, oddly bruised, formed the accompanying vegetable; and a pâté of fruit, conserved after a recipe devised by Madame Gérard Moore's [...] "grand'mère," [...] and from the taste of which it appeared probable that [...] "mélasse" [...] had been substituted for sugar, completed the dinner.|$|E

To me, from the very first, they seemed absolutely {{the same as the}} similar taboos of Central Africans and South Sea Islanders. All of them spring alike from a common origin, the queer savage belief that various harmless or actually beneficial things may become at times in some mysterious way harmful and dangerous. The essence of them all lies in the erroneous idea that if certain contingencies occur, such as breaking an image or deserting a faith, some terrible evil will follow to one man or to the world, which evil, as a matter of fact, there's no reason at all to dread in any way. Sometimes, as in ancient Rome, Egypt, Central Africa, and England, the whole of life gets enveloped at last in a perfect mist and labyrinth of taboos, a cobweb of conventions. The Flamen Dialis at Rome, you know, mightn't ride or even touch a horse; he mightn't see an army under arms; nor wear a ring that wasn't broken; nor have a knot in any part of his clothing. He mightn't eat wheaten flour or leavened bread; he mightn't look at or even mention by name such unlucky things as a goat, a dog, raw meat, <b>haricot</b> <b>beans,</b> or common ivy. He mightn't walk under a vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair could only be cut by a free man, and with a bronze knife; he was encased and surrounded, as it were, by endless petty restrictions and regulations and taboos--just like those that now surround so many men, and especially so many young women, here in England." ...|$|E
