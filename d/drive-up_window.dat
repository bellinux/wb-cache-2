50|$|The Henderson National Bank {{building}} is a historic bank building in Huntsville, Alabama. One of the only Art Moderne style buildings in Huntsville, the bank was built in 1948. The outer walls are constructed of large blocks of ashlar, while the base and entrance surround on the Jefferson Street façade are lined with dark green stone. The recessed double doors sit below a tall, multi-pane toplight. The entry is flanked by tall, multi-pane windows, giving the façade a much more vertical orientation than the early 20th-century commercial brick style. The upper portion is inscribed with two geometric flower shapes in relief {{and the name of}} the bank. The corner wall is rounded, leading to more tall windows along the side. A <b>drive-up</b> teller <b>window</b> was added to the rear of the building in 1958, which is faced with light tan brick.|$|R

50|$|A drive-through, or drive-thru, {{is a type}} {{of service}} {{provided}} by a business that allows customers to purchase products without leaving their cars. The format was pioneered in the United States in the 1930s by Jordan Martin, but has since spread to other countries. The first recorded use of a bank using a <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> teller was the Grand National Bank of St. Louis, Missouri in 1930. The drive-up teller allowed only deposits at that time.|$|E
50|$|The bank's first {{branch office}} was {{opened in the}} Richfield section of Clifton in 1954, {{is located on the}} portion of Clifton Avenue {{designated}} NJ 161, and was the first to offer a <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> for banking. Fourteen years later Clifton Savings added a third branch in Clifton's Athenia section, in a storefront located on Van Houten Avenue.

50|$|Edina’s library roots {{go back to}} September 1921, and predate Hennepin County Library system. Four {{months before}} Hennepin County Library began its count-wide library services, Edina opened its first library in a school in the Linden Hills neighborhood. In 1926, the library {{relocated}} to 50th and Wooddale, and in 1928, moved to the Westgate Theater building in the Morningside neighborhood. This move allowed Edina to have its first free-standing public library, and it {{became known as the}} Edina Morningside Branch library. The Morningside library was closed by the Hennepin County Board, effective December 31, 1976. In 1954, a second Edina Branch Library opened at 4120 West 50th Street. The former residence of James Bull, it was given to the City by Russell Lund and George Kruse. With room for between 6,000 and 7,000 books, space was limited to children’s and young adult’s books, and general fiction and non-fiction. The space was considered quite small {{by the standards of the}} American Library Association. As a result, the League of Women Voters began campaigning in 1962 for a larger library for Edina. In 1967, following considerable preparation, plans were announced to build on 50th Street and Eden Avenue. The building, known as the Edina Community Library, opened in September 1968 at 4701 West 50th Street next to the Village Hall. Construction costs totaled $410,000, with 15,500 square feet of floor space. The space was designed by Arthur Dickey, an Edina resident, and included a reading room for adults, a children’s room, a <b>drive-up</b> service <b>window,</b> and a multi-purpose room. Art reproductions, displayed near the entry vestibule, were available for checkout by patrons. Edina was the first branch library in the Hennepin County Library system to loan art prints. When the current library opened in April 2002, Edina razed the old library to make way for a new city hall and policy department.|$|R
5000|$|With low sales, {{damage from}} the 1994 Northridge earthquake, {{and the lack of}} a <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> and indoor seating, the {{restaurant}} was closed, and McDonald's planned to demolish it and incorporate some of its features in a modern [...] "retro" [...] restaurant nearby. However, it was listed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 1994 list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. With both the public and preservationists demanding the restaurant be saved, McDonald's spent two years restoring the restaurant and reopened it. Customers today can visit the restored restaurant and an adjoining gift shop and museum.|$|E
50|$|The Bank {{opened its}} 100th branch office in 1979 and {{commenced}} {{work on a}} new computer and operations centre, designed to accommodate 900 staff, enabling the centralisation of many of its support functions. In {{order to meet the}} need of the local market, drive-up cashier tills were long incorporated into the design of many of its offices. This service was available at more than 50 per cent of branches, many of which had multiple lanes, with up to 40 per cent of the business at a branch conducted at a <b>drive-up</b> <b>window.</b> In 1979, Lloyds Bank California also installed its first online cash dispensers at branches in the San Francisco area.|$|E
50|$|The city finally {{passed its}} first-ever library bond issue in 1956. This funded, among other things, a new $4.5 million, 206000 ft2 m2 central library, {{designed}} in the International style by the Seattle firm of Bindon & Wright, and built on the same site as its Carnegie predecessor. Dedicated March 26, 1960, it featured the first-ever escalator in an American library, a <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> for book pick-ups and was Seattle's first public building to incorporate significant new works of art. Among the artists represented were James FitzGerald, Glen Alps, and Ray Jensen. It also incorporated a fountain by sculptor George Tsutakawa, {{the first of many}} fountains Tsutakawa would construct over the remainder of his career.|$|E
5000|$|The first Jack in the Box {{restaurant}} was opened at 6270 El Cajon Boulevard by Robert O. Peterson in 1951.

Jack in the Box was the first drive-through, with the innovation of a two-way intercom that allowed one car {{to place an order}} while another car was being served. Other restaurants had previously offered <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> service, but Jack in the Box was the first major chain to make drive-through windows the focus of its operation.|$|E
50|$|First {{housed in}} the Physical Plant Services {{building}} of the then Louisiana State University in New Orleans campus, UNOFCU opened as the financial institution to the UNO community.

Hitt Alumni Center in 2003, allowing it to offer <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> service alongside its normal lobby service. UNOFCU has also grown to serve not only the students, faculty, and staff, but also contract workers, alumni, and student organizations. Having only one branch, the credit union relies on the CU Service Centers network to help its members who are spread around the country.UNOFCU received a $299,000 NCUA no-interest loan through its Community Development Revolving Loan Fund after sustaining severe damage during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
50|$|Example: A {{fast food}} {{restaurant}} has a <b>drive-up</b> <b>window.</b> Before {{getting to the}} window, customers place their order by speaking into a microphone. The microphone also picks up noise from the engine and the environment. This microphone provides the primary signal. The signal power from the customer’s voice and the noise power from the engine are equal. It is difficult for the employees in the restaurant to understand the customer. To {{reduce the amount of}} interference in the primary microphone, a second microphone is located where it is intended to pick up sounds from the engine. It also picks up the customer’s voice. This microphone {{is the source of the}} reference signal. In this case, the engine noise is 50 times more powerful than the customer’s voice. Once the canceler has converged, the primary signal to interference ratio will be improved from 1:1 to 50:1.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the building's {{north side}} was {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} six-story Fenton Building (also known as the Guaranty Building), obscured from view, and was not given any decorative surface when built. However, following that building's demolition in 1971, the Bank of California Building's newly exposed north façade was resurfaced in cast terracotta in a pattern simulating that {{of the west and}} south façades. A surface parking lot took the Fenton Building's place, and a drive-up teller window was added to the building's north end; this addition was the only substantial alteration to the building's exterior between its completion in 1925 and its nomination to the National Register in 1978. [...] The <b>drive-up</b> <b>window</b> was removed in 1977, after the building's use as a bank ended. In 1980, the parking lot gave way to a new 13-story office building known as the TN Building (converted into a 16-story hotel in 2008, the Marriott-owned Courtyard Portland City Center), leaving the north façade again hidden from view.|$|E
