5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The giant otter shares the South American continent with three of the <b>four</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The giant otter seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E

5|$|Fox's {{family lived}} in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career. The family finally moved to the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia, when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack. Fox {{attended}} Burnaby Central Secondary School, and now has a theatre named for him in Burnaby South Secondary. At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series Leo and Me, produced by the CBC, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided {{to move back to}} Vancouver.

5|$|In 1967, Scarborough was {{incorporated}} as a borough. The reeve {{was replaced with}} a mayor. Albert Campbell, who had been reeve since 1957, became Scarborough's first mayor.

5|$|Königsberg and Nürnberg both saw {{action at}} the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, where the former was {{slightly}} damaged.

The cruisers, save Emden, were also assigned to the planned final fleet action in October 1918, but mutiny among the German capital ships forced the cancellation of the plan. Karlsruhe, Emden, and Nürnberg were interned with the fleet in Scapa Flow, while Königsberg remained in Germany. The three cruisers were scuttled, though only Karlsruhe actually sank. Emden and Nürnberg were beached by British sailors and were seized as war prizes by France and Britain, respectively. Emden was scrapped in 1926 and Nürnberg was sunk as a target in 1922. Königsberg, meanwhile, was surrendered to France in 1920 and renamed Metz; she was ultimately scrapped in 1936.|$|E
