40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) is {{a digital}} {{communication}} system that provides advanced voice networking capabilities to the Edwards Test Range. The EDS {{is a member}} of a new family of all-digital switching systems that internally handle data in digital form. To accommodate analog <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> circuits, conversions between analog and digital formats occur at the system interfaces. The EDS consists of six groups of configuration items: System-level control and monitoring is centralized in the Control and Display Subsystem. Workstations provide subsystem-level control and monitoring. The Central Switching Subsystem, as the primary interface with the range environment, provides system connectivity to radios, telephone circuits, and communications links to other facilities. It integrates the EDS with links to the Control Room Switching Subsystems. Each Control Room Switching Subsystem connects individual user stations within a Mission Control Room or other localized area. The user equipment element consists of a Subscriber Terminal Unit, Channel Expander, and interface panels for headsets, foot switches, and speakers. The Remote Radio Control Unit optimizes usage of available frequencies, allowing control of tunable radios from the Control and Display Subsystem. *The original name, Edwards Communication Switching System (ECSS) was changed to Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) in 1990. The Site Selection Unit facilitates the handover of voice communications between receiver sites when a long-range test is monitored. The system architecture is based on a central system-level control element, a central switch, multiple subsystem-level control elements, multiple subsystem switches, and end-equipment items that are interconnected through the switch network. The EDS combines multiple voice communications applications in a single system. The system is being expanded to <b>integrate</b> <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b> Its major function is support of multiparty networked voice communications within Mission Control Rooms and between other test participants. Other voice functions are an intercom capability including both Direct Access (hot line) and Indirect Access (dial-up), subscriber loop connections to the base-level telephone exchange, and the Public Switched Network System. Digital interfaces allow integration of ciphertext data and Time Space Position Information <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> functions. A system based on the EDS design has also been installed by the Air Force at Eglin AFB. Engineering studies for systems that make use of the EDS design are currently underway by the Navy at China Lake and the Army at White Sands Missile Range. The EDS project office has actively pursued promising program management concepts such as: specifying nondevelopmental items, requiring industry standard interconnectivity and interoperability, and using a multiyear fixed-price requirements-type contract to encourage multiservice participation...|$|R

40|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{was first}} used as {{a simple way to}} provide point-to-point voice transport between two IP hosts. However, the growing interest in providing <b>integrated</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>data,</b> and video services has caused its scope to be expanded. Internet telephony now encompasses a range of services. These services include not only traditional conferencing, call control, multimedia, and mobility services, but also new ones that integrate web, email, presence, and instant messaging applications with telephony. Internet telephony and traditional circuit switched telephony will co-exist for quite some time, requiring interworking between the two. In this paper, we present a suite of protocols, developed in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which provide a partial solution to this complex problem. ...|$|R
