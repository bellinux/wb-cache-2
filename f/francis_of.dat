5|$|According to the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims, he {{was buried}} in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in the Franciscan church {{dedicated}} to Saint <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the church}} of St. Claires in Hakin closed, leaving one Roman Catholic church in Milford Haven, St. <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi on Priory Road. Baptists congregate at North Road Baptist Church {{which is one of}} the older {{religious}} buildings of the community, built in 1878. The Friends Meeting House (Quakers), built in 1811 by the original Quaker whalers who were central to the early growth of the town, is in Priory Road. Quakers travel from distances around Pembroke to worship at the Friends House.|$|E
5|$|In both paintings, Saint <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E

5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Like other Florentines {{of their}} {{financial}} means, Francesco's {{family members were}} art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolomeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco at the family's burial site in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze. Andrea del Sarto painted a Madonna for another member of his family. Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait {{of his wife and}} to Domenico Puligo for a painting of Saint <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi. He is thought to have commissioned Lisa's portrait to celebrate both Andrea's birth and the purchase of the family's home.|$|E
5|$|Nailsea Methodist Church {{was founded}} in 1789; the first {{building}} opened three years later. In 1914 a new chapel was opened on Silver Street, and a youth club was added in the 1960s. In early 1992 the old church was replaced with a larger, flexible, multi-purpose building and the youth club was refurbished and renamed the Wesley Centre after Methodism’s founder, John Wesley. There is also Nailsea Baptist Church, the Catholic Church of St <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi, Southfield Church, the United Reformed Church and the Community Church.|$|E

5|$|Saint <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi is {{credited}} with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ. He himself had recently been inspired by {{his visit to the}} Holy Land, where he'd been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{was founded}} on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain {{established}} Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound effect}} on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Charles VII {{spent most}} of his three-year reign as emperor {{residing}} in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the gout-ridden Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, Maximilian III Joseph (known as Max Joseph) inherited his father's electoral dignities but not his imperial ambition. With the Peace of Füssen (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, in the pending imperial election. He also acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family's electoral position and territories. For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare and brought a generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father's death in 1745 and ended with his own in 1777.|$|E
5|$|Holy Roman {{emperors}} {{had been}} elected from the House of Habsburg {{for most of the}} previous three centuries. Charles VI arranged a marriage of his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, to <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Lorraine. Francis relinquished the Duchy of Lorraine near France in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany near Austria to make himself a more appealing candidate for eventual election as emperor. On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next emperor. Two key exceptions, the duchies of Bavaria and Saxony, held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis's election. When Charles died in 1740, Maria Theresa had to fight for her family's entitlements in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and her husband faced competition in his election as the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E

5|$|In 1646, {{after several}} naval successes against Spain along the Mediterranean, Cardinal Mazarin planned a naval {{expedition}} {{to conquer the}} Spanish-held State of Presidi {{with the aim of}} interrupting Spanish communications with the Kingdom of Naples, threatening the initial stage of the Spanish military corridor, the so-called Spanish Road, and also to frighten pope Innocent X, whose Spanish sympathies displeased him. For this purpose, a fleet commanded by young Admiral Marquis of Brézé was assembled at Toulon. Made of 36 galleons, 20 galleys and a large complement of minor vessels, it had on board an army of some 8,000 infantry and 800 cavalry with baggage under the command of Thomas <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Savoy, who had previously been at the employ of the Spanish Crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Gaudí {{accepted}} a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promotor of the Sagrada Família, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained {{permission from the}} Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with a slab of white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It {{was made by the}} cabinet maker Frederic Labòria, who also collaborated with Gaudí on the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|In reserve, Farnese {{deployed}} a large battalion {{made up by}} the German regiments of Hannibal d'Altemps and Georg von Frundsberg, flanked on {{its right}} by troops of reiters under Duke <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Saxe-Lauenburg, elder brother of Duke Maurice, John Casimir's former lieutenant, and on its left by lancers under Pierre de Taxis. The remaining Spanish cavalry, led by Ottavio Gonzaga, covered the rear. Farnese led his troops personally, and before the battle was started, he scouted the Dutch position, having ordered his troops not to move until his return. On the Dutch side, while De la Noue and Norreys directed the men standing in Borgerhout, William of Orange witnessed the battle from the walls of Antwerp in company of archduke Matthias, brother of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, whom the States General had elected as Governor of the Netherlands {{in opposition to the}} deceased John of Austria.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century mendicant orders were founded by <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played {{a large role}} in the {{transformation}} of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe. Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.|$|E
5|$|Reuniting Bowie with Eno, the quasi-industrial Outside (1995) was {{originally}} conceived {{as the first}} volume in a non-linear narrative of art and murder. Featuring characters from a short story written by Bowie, the album achieved UK and US chart success, and yielded three Top 40 UK singles. In a move that provoked mixed reaction from both fans and critics, Bowie chose Nine Inch Nails as his tour partner for the Outside Tour. Visiting cities in Europe and North America between September 1995 and February 1996, the tour saw the return of Gabrels as Bowie's guitarist. On 7 January 1997, Bowie celebrated his half century with a 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden, New York, at which he was joined in playing his songs and those of his guests, Lou Reed, Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, Robert Smith of the Cure, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Black <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> the Pixies and Sonic Youth.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom <b>Francis</b> <b>of</b> PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E
