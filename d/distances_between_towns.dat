50|$|Across New South Wales in the 1920s and 1930s teams {{played for}} a number of local and {{regional}} challenge cups. Southwest examples include the Alley and Prowse, Bancroft, Batsos, Farrar, O'Farrell, Garden of Roses, Jack Hore Memorial, Motor, Tulk and Weissel Gold cups. A successful team may hold half a dozen such cups at a time. The rise of reliable road transportation to nearby places lead to the demise of challenge cups and their replacement by regular competition schedules. The excellent rail system in the region, the large <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns,</b> and the popularity of the Maher Cup, delayed the establishment of such competitions in the Southwest. When cars and buses became commonplace and roads sealed, people became less dependent on rail and regular competitions easier to arrange. Although permanent competition football was established in 1938 it still played second fiddle to the Maher Cup until the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|The Northern Cape is South Africa's largest province, and <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns</b> are {{enormous}} {{due to its}} sparse population. Its size is just shy {{of the size of}} the American state of Montana and slightly larger than that of Germany. The province is dominated by the Karoo Basin and consists mostly of sedimentary rocks and some Dolerite intrusions. The south and south-east of the province is high-lying, 1200 - 1900 m, in the Roggeveld and Nuweveld districts. The west coast is dominated by the Namaqualand region, famous for its spring flowers. This area is hilly to mountainous and consists of Granites and other metamorphic rocks. The central areas are generally flat with interspersed salt pans. Kimberlite intrusions punctuate the Karoo rocks, giving the province its most precious natural resource, Diamonds. The north is primarily Kalahari Desert, characterised by parallel red sand dunes and acacia tree dry savanna.|$|E
5000|$|Milanich and Hudson, {{based on}} <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns</b> {{reported}} by the Spanish, locate the town of Acuera near Lake Weir and Lake Griffin, near {{the headwaters of the}} Oklawaha River, a tributary of the St. Johns River. A map produced by Jacques le Moyne, who was part of the French attempt to colonize Florida at Fort Caroline, shows a town called Aquouena (Acuera?) east of Eloquale (Ocale), on a tributary of the St. Johns River. The French also recorded that a chief named Acquera was a vassal of Chief Utina. The 17th century missions of San Luis de Acuera and Santa Lucia de Acuera were reported to be at distances from St. Augustine that are consistent with the missions being located near the Oklawaha River and Lake Weir. In 1836 Lake Weir appeared on a map as [...] "Lake Ware", and Milanich and Hudson speculate that [...] "Ware" [...] was derived from [...] "Acuera". Boyer has identified an archaeological site a little to the north of Lake Weir as likely being the site of the town of Acuera. The territory occupied by the Acuera people in historical times was part of the St. Johns culture, which is characterized by the presence of shell middens, burial mounds, and [...] "chalky" [...] pottery made with freshwater sponge spicules as a temper, sometimes decorated with check-stamping.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} isonymy {{structure}} of Texas, we analyzed the surname distributions of 3. 6 million telephone users registered {{for the year}} 1996 in 232 towns distributed in the 7 regions of the state. The number of different surnames was 235, 740. Matrices of isonymy <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns</b> and between geographic regions were constructed and tested for correlation with geographic distance. We found that isonymy distances between the seven regions showed borderline or no correlation with geographic distance, with r = 0. 089 +/- 0. 232, r = 0. 492 +/- 0. 232, and r = 0. 337 +/- 0. 232 for Lasker's, Euclidean, and Nei's distances, respectively. Isonymy <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns</b> were significantly correlated with geographic distance, with r = 0. 249 +/- 0. 006 for Lasker's distance, r = 0. 338 +/- 0. 006 for the Euclidean distance, and r = 0. 418 +/- 0. 006 for Nei's distance. Two dendrograms, one for the 7 regions {{and one for the}} 232 towns, were built from the matrices of Nei's distances. The dendrogram for regions indicates that a main surname differentiation exists between the East and West areas of Texas, with West Texas being predominantly Hispanic and East Texas being predominantly English-speaking. The dendrogram for the towns confirms in detail the differences identified by the matrix of distances between regions. Random inbreeding calculated from isonymy, F(ST), was highest in the west and in the south of the state. It was lowest in the area of Austin and Houston. Average Fisher's alpha for towns was 734, for regions it was 1, 047, and for Texas as a whole it was 1, 230. The geographic distribution of alpha in the state shows distinctly lower values in the traditionally Hispanic west and higher values in the east and on the Gulf of Mexico...|$|E

40|$|A set of {{analytical}} {{capabilities that}} are needed to assess the role satellite communications technology will play in public and other services was developed. It is user oriented in that it starts from descriptions of user demand and develops the ability to estimate the cost of satisfying that demand with the lowest cost communications system. To ensure that the analysis could cope with {{the complexities of the}} real users, two services were chosen as examples, continuing professional education and medical services. Telecommunications costs are effected greatly by demographic factors, involving distribution of users in urban areas and <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns</b> in rural regions.

San Jose, California and Denver, Colorado were used to represent an urban area and the Rocky Mountain states were used to represent a rural region.

40|$|The western United States {{offers a}} case study on the {{importance}} of access to large population centers and their markets, via road and air travel, for economic development. The vast <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns</b> and cities in the American West can be a detriment to business, yet they also serve to attract technology and knowledge-based workers seeking to live in a picturesque setting. In spite of the increasing importance of amenities to migration and business location, also needed is access to markets, particularly via commercial air service. We test a new county classification system for the western United States to reflect differing degrees of access to population centers and account for the increasing importance of airports. Past classifications are based on population size and cross-county commuting. We examine the validity of this new classification and test for differences in economic performance among the three county types. Our findings show that there are three distinct Wests that can be classified using economic performance measures and socioeconomic characteristics. The results show that “metro ” and “isolated” counties are clearly distinct, but “connected ” counties, those that are rural in nature but have ready access to metropolitan areas via air travel, can be difficult to distinguish from “metro ” an...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a case study which {{discusses}} how a realistic game-based simulation training platform may tackle the challenges raised by the requirements for a national competencies certification framework and the requirements {{of a new generation}} of trained water operators. The proposed platform aims to 1) enhance training experience with learn by doing and scenario- based learning experience, 2) increase training capacity for the water industry, 3) provide cost effective methods to deliver training in remote areas, and 4) attract young people to join the water industry workforce. The National Water Commission of Australia is currently developing a national competencies framework for certification of water treatment operators. This framework aims to ensure that the water operator role is carried out by qualified staff. In response to the introduction of this new competencies framework, there will be an increase in demand for skills training in the water industry to ensure that employees at water treatment facilities possess the required certifications. Currently, the water industry is facing several challenges to meet the future training demands required by the new competencies framework. The lack of standardised training manuals and assessment criteria make it very difficult to ensure that training is consistent between different water treatment facilities. Australia is an immense country with sparse distribution of population centres and large <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>towns,</b> which create an insurmountable problem for delivery of training. In particular, for rural areas, there is a substantial lack of trainers available to deliver training. Travel expenses and loss of work days for travelling makes training a very expense exercise. Also, the water industry is facing an ageing workforce with an average age over 45. There are less than 5...|$|E
