60|$|Just as he spoke, one of {{the little}} brown-faced Mohammedan boys fixed his {{glittering}} eyes on an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bulwarks</b> of the ship, through which the water could be seen glancing brightly. That innate spirit of curiosity peculiar to small boys all the world over, induced him to creep partly through the opening and glance down at the sparkling fluid. That imperfect notion of balance, not infrequent in small boys, caused him to tip over and cleave the water with his head. His Mohammedan relatives greeted the incident with shrieks of alarm. Robin, who had seen him tip over, being a good swimmer, and prompt to act, went through the same hole like a fish-torpedo, and caught the brown boy by the hair, as he rose to the surface with staring eyes, outspread fingers, and a bursting cry.|$|R
60|$|John Bumpus {{raised his}} bulky form {{with a degree}} of lithe {{activity}} that proved him to be not less agile than athletic, and, with several others, sprang to obey the order. A few seconds later, the sails were swelled out by a light breeze, and the schooner moved through the water at a rate which seemed scarcely possible under the influence of so gentle a puff of air. Presently the breeze increased, the vessel cut through the blue water like a knife, leaving a long track of foam in her wake as she headed for the coral-island before referred to. The outer reef, or barrier of coral which guarded the island, was soon reached. The narrow <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> this natural <b>bulwark</b> was passed. The schooner stood across the belt of perfectly still water that lay between the reef and the shore, and entered a small bay, where the calm water reflected the strip of white sand, green palms, and tropical plants that skirted its margin, as well as the purple hills of the interior.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{fire that}} gutted the South Steyne in August 1974, the Lady Wakehurst and Lady Northcott were pressed into on the Manly service after having their bows built up {{to contend with the}} rougher {{conditions}} while crossing Sydney Heads and extra <b>gangway</b> <b>openings</b> cut into the upper deck. Following the Tasman Bridge disaster, Lady Wakehurst was sent to Hobart in January 1975 to operate services on the River Derwent, not returning until November 1977.|$|R
6000|$|After Davy {{had cried}} a great deal, and wished very often {{that he had}} not been so {{determined}} to leave home, he dried his eyes and began to take great interest in the curious things he saw around him. What surprised him most of all was, that although he actually was at sea, he could not see the sea at all! This was because the sides of the ship, which are called [...] "bulwarks," [...] were so high that they quite prevented the little boy from seeing overboard. Davy soon found an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bulwarks,</b> however, which his friend Ben called the [...] "gang-way," [...] through which he could see the water and the ships and boats that were sailing there. And when he mounted the high part of the deck in front of the ship, which is called the [...] "forecastle," [...] or when he went upon the high deck at the stern of the ship, which is called the [...] "poop," [...] then he could see all round. And what a wonderful and new sight it was to Davy! His cottage was gone! The beach, and the pier where the nets used to hang, were gone. The trees and fields were all gone, and there was nothing but sea, sea, sea, all round, so that the Fair Nancy seemed the only solid thing in the whole wide world! But poor Davy did not look or wonder long at this, for the breeze freshened, and the waves rose, and the ship plunged, and Davy felt very queer about the stomach! There is a man in every ship called the [...] "steward," [...] and everybody loves that man, because he goes about from morning till night trying to do people good and to make them happy. He looks after breakfasts, dinners, teas, and suppers. He answers every one who calls, and gets for everybody anything that they want. He is never ill, never in a hurry, never in a bad temper; in fact, he is a very charming man.|$|R
25|$|A {{change in}} design {{from that of}} the first three Formidables {{occurred}} <b>in</b> <b>Bulwark</b> and the other four Londons, which is why the Londons often are considered a separate class.

25|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{disaster}} {{appears to have been}} overheating of cordite charges stored alongside a boiler room bulkhead, and this was the explanation accepted by the court of enquiry. It has also been suggested that damage caused to one of the shells stored in the battleship's cross-passageways may have weakened the fusing mechanism and caused the shell to become 'live'. A blow to the shell, caused by it being dropped point down, could then have set off a chain reaction of explosions among the shells stored <b>in</b> <b>Bulwarks</b> cross-passageways sufficient to detonate the ship's magazines.|$|R
