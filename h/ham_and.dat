5|$|Cracker Barrel {{was founded}} in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales {{representative}} for Shell Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen {{to give it a}} Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country <b>ham,</b> <b>and</b> turnip greens.|$|E

5|$|Middlesbrough, {{also from}} the Premier League, were the {{opposition}} in the semi-final at the neutral venue of Villa Park in Birmingham.

The Parrett flows through Langport and then through Middle Moor, Aller Moor to Burrowbridge where it is joined by the River Tone.

5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West <b>Ham</b> <b>and</b> Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 the {{nominally}} independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received {{permission for}} a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an above-ground junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley station. The LT and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green, Mile End and Bow Road. Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East <b>Ham</b> <b>and</b> one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster. In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond. The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House, the GWR's middle circle having started at Earl's Court from 1900.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} near Woolwich was under {{construction}} by 1921, as it ran on open {{land that was}} easy to purchase, but plans {{for the remainder of}} the route had not yet been decided and there were delays due to compulsory purchasing of properties. In 1925, The Times announced a replacement bridge for the Woolwich Ferry was planned as part of the South Circular project to tie in with the East <b>Ham</b> <b>and</b> Barking Bypass (now the A13). A significant amount of new housing had been built along the route of the South Circular since the original 1903 plans, and building costs had risen because of labour and because of further demolition required. In 1927, the Governors of Dulwich College formally objected to the road as it would put the Memorial Library right next to a main road and remove part of the college green.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} West <b>Ham</b> <b>and</b> Millwall has {{involved}} considerable violence {{and is one}} of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, include the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.|$|E

Blackman, <b>Hamming</b> <b>and</b> Kaiser Windows techniques are used for design of bandpass filters using matlabs.

The simulated result shows that Blackman window gives maximum mainlobe width as compared to <b>Hamming</b> <b>and</b> Kaiser Windows. The result also shows that increasing the Kaiser Window parameter Beta widens the mainlobe and decreases the amplitude of sidelobes...|$|R
