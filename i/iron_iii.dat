25|$|The site {{is located}} 13 km east of Kangāvar {{city on the}} left {{bank of the river}} Gamas Āb". The excavations, started in 1965, were led by T. C. Young, Jr. which {{according}} to David Stronach, evidently shows an important Bronze Age construction that was reoccupied sometime before the beginning of the <b>Iron</b> <b>III</b> period. The excavations of Young indicate the remains of part of a single residence of a local ruler which later became quite substantial. This is similar to those mentioned often in Assyrian sources.|$|E
25|$|Despite that A.ustus {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as a common soil-associated fungus, knowledge of its biochemistry remained poor until recently. One of the first metabolites to be isolated and characterized from this fungus, ustic acid (C11H7O7), reacts with <b>Iron</b> (<b>III)</b> chloride to form a deep purple-colored compound. Ustic acid has since been shown to occur in other fungi, notably closely related Aspergilli such as A.granulosus and A.puniceus. Aspergillus ustus produce {{a number of other}} metabolites including autocystins (and versicolourins), austalides, a sterigmatocystin-like chemical, and nidulol. Some metabolites of A.ustus have antibacterial properties. Metabolite chemistry {{has been shown to be}} useful for the taxonomy and identification of this fungus.|$|E
500|$|The colour of C.violaceus {{cannot be}} {{converted}} to a dye, unlike that of some other Cortinarius species, such as C.sanguineus and C.semisanguineus. The colour is caused by an elusive pigment that {{has been difficult to}} isolate; its identity was not known until 1998. It is an <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> complex of [...] (R)-3′,4′-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine [...] It dissolves in water, turning the liquid dark purple before fading to blackish-grey. C. violaceus fruiting bodies contain around 100 times more iron than those of most other fungi. Cortinarius violaceus extract demonstrates an inhibitory activity against cysteine protease.|$|E

50|$|The second {{proposed}} {{model for}} magnetoreception relies on Fe3O4, {{also referred to}} as <b>iron</b> (II, <b>III)</b> oxide or magnetite, a natural oxide with strong magnetism. <b>Iron</b> (II, <b>III)</b> oxide remains permanently magnetized when its length is larger than 50 nm and becomes magnetized when exposed to a magnetic field if its length is less than 50 nm. In both of these situations the Earth's magnetic field leads to a transducible signal via a physical effect on this magnetically sensitive oxide.|$|R
500|$|The Tor {{is formed}} from rocks {{dating from the}} early Jurassic Period, namely varied layers of Lias Group strata. The {{uppermost}} of these, forming the Tor itself, are a succession of rocks assigned to the Bridport Sand Formation. These rocks sit upon strata forming the broader hill on which the Tor stands; the various layers of the Beacon Limestone Formation and the Dyrham Formation. The Bridport Sands have acted as a caprock protecting the lower layers from erosion. The iron-rich waters of Chalice Well, a spring {{at the base of}} the Tor, flow out as an artesian well impregnating the sandstone around it with iron oxides that have reinforced it to produce the caprock. Iron-rich but oxygen-poor water in the aquifer carries dissolved iron (II) [...] "ferrous" [...] iron, but as the water surfaces and its oxygen content rises, the oxidised <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> [...] "ferric" [...] iron drops out as insoluble [...] "rusty" [...] oxides that bind to the surrounding stone, hardening it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{addition}} of inorganic coagulants such as aluminum sulfate (or alum) or <b>iron</b> (<b>III)</b> salts such as iron(III) chloride cause several simultaneous chemical and physical interactions on {{and among the}} particles. [...] Within seconds, negative charges on the particles are neutralized by inorganic coagulants. [...] Also within seconds, metal hydroxide precipitates of the iron and aluminium ions begin to form. [...] These precipitates combine into larger particles under natural processes such as Brownian motion and through induced mixing which is {{sometimes referred to as}} flocculation. [...] The term most often used for the amorphous metal hydroxides is [...] "floc."
