5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (<b>hopefully)</b> decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|I think everybody's enjoyed {{doing their}} own thing. Sharon and Caroline are young mothers, they have young children. Our {{mother and father}} were really were great parents and they hope to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharon's making her own record and will <b>hopefully</b> release it at some point. But we (the band) never finished, we'll keep it open.|$|E
5|$|In December 1782 the {{regiment}} left America for Jamaica. Back in England, a change occurred in army policy, to <b>hopefully</b> increase recruiting, infantry regiments were given additional territorial titles. The 64th became the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Foot and began its long {{association with the}} city of Lichfield as the depot companies moved there and soon after began to wear the Staffordshire Knot on its uniform.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) develops feelings for Kamala (Famke Janssen), a woman destined from childhood for an arranged marriage which <b>hopefully</b> might end a war between two planets. Picard steps in to help in the peace ceremony and later gives Kamala away at her wedding.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, and only then. The medication blocks the positive reinforcement effects of ethanol and <b>hopefully</b> allows the person to stop drinking or drink less.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{underwent}} further {{surgery in}} January 2008 to <b>hopefully</b> restore {{his voice and}} address the complications from his previous surgeries. On April 1, Ebert announced his speech had not been restored. A further surgery was performed in April 2008 after Ebert fractured his hip in a fall. By 2011, Ebert was using a prosthetic chin to hide some of {{the damage done by}} his many chin, mouth, and throat surgeries.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will <b>hopefully</b> be decreased.|$|E
5|$|For Upper Bonnington, {{the first}} dam {{built on the}} river, the {{original}} goal was to improve navigation between Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay's mouth on the Columbia by drowning the dangerous Bonnigton Falls rapids that also blocked fish migration, and <b>hopefully</b> introducing fish to the upper river by constructing a fish ladder. None of these amenities for steamboats or salmon were ever constructed—in fact, the dam ended up being built above the falls instead of below them—and Upper Bonnington Dam, when completed in 1906, only generated hydroelectric power, and has served that purpose ever since.|$|E
5|$|Germany won {{the most}} medals with 18 medals and seven golds. Men's canoe's overall winner was Russia with seven medals (one gold, five silver and one bronze). In men's kayak, {{the big winner}} was Germany with five medals (three golds, one silver and one bronze). Hungary won medals in all nine events of women's kayak. Athlete {{comments}} ranged from disgust over the format adjustment made to the canoe sprint program for the 2012 Summer Olympics to not being upset at all. Paddleability's success at these championships will <b>hopefully</b> push for inclusion into future Paralympic level events.|$|E
5|$|Horny. I'm feeling really horny about it. And very smug … I'm in that mode now, so <b>hopefully</b> I'll stay {{in it for}} a while … I've got a {{few more}} things planned—at least a couple more albums, some EPs, things like that. Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{thinking}} that the FBI agent {{is part of a}} government conspiracy, Crump forces Mulder at gunpoint to drive, infuriating him along the way with antisemitic slurs. Eventually, Mulder and Crump make amends and attempt to work out a solution before it is too late. Mulder explains to Crump that Scully will meet them at the Pacific Coast, the end of the highway. There she will insert a needle into Crump's inner ear, <b>hopefully</b> relieving the pressure. Unfortunately, when Scully arrives, Crump has already died.|$|E
5|$|Q-ships were {{merchant}} ships crewed by Navy {{personnel and}} bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, {{a portion of}} the ship's crew (referred to as a panic party) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q-ship's guns would become operational and open fire, <b>hopefully</b> destroying the submarine.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} treatments {{have shown}} promise in animal models. These include inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase and squalene synthase, cysteine protease inhibitors, dermaseptins collected from frogs in the genus Phyllomedusa (P. oreades and P. distincta), the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine (DhL), which affects {{the growth of}} cultured epimastigote-phase Trypanosoma cruzi, inhibitors of purine uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism. <b>Hopefully,</b> new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the T. cruzi genome.|$|E
5|$|We write jokes, and {{the jokes}} are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} it, and you go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, <b>hopefully</b> it's more than that.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and <b>hopefully</b> protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{a studio}} theatre was {{built at the}} rear of the {{building}} on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled <b>Hopefully.</b> The 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe, starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that <b>hopefully</b> the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought {{essential}} for a Republican to win the White House. One way of, <b>hopefully,</b> assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every Republican president who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor Joseph B. Foraker, but Foraker's light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with Manche, under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, <b>hopefully</b> inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and bore down on her. Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, {{it was obvious that}} Windham would reach Manche first.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} was right, the force would cross the English Channel in {{darkness}} and attack shortly after midnight {{to coincide with the}} Zeebrugge Raid a few miles up the coast. By co-ordinating their operations, the assault forces would stretch the German defenders and <b>hopefully</b> gain the element of surprise. Covering the Inshore Squadron would be heavy bombardment from an offshore squadron of monitors and destroyers as well as artillery support from Royal Marine artillery near Ypres in Allied-held Flanders. Closer support would be offered by several flotillas of motor launches, small torpedo boats and Coastal Motor Boats which would lay smoke screens to obscure the advancing blockships as well as evacuate the crews of the cruisers after they had blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her <b>hopefully,</b> and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E
5|$|It {{was normal}} in fleet {{actions of the}} 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was {{counting}} on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with {{the advantage of the}} weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters; each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent's force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, <b>hopefully</b> forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The French grand {{plan called}} for two French armies to press against the flanks of the {{northern}} armies in the German states while a third army simultaneously approached Vienna through Italy. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push southeast from Düsseldorf, <b>hopefully</b> drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau's army an easier crossing of the Rhine between Kehl and Hüningen. According to plan, Jourdan's army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles quickly reapportioned his troops. Moreau's army attacked the bridgehead at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops—troops recruited that spring from the Swabian circle polities, inexperienced and untrained—which amazingly held the bridgehead for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. On June 23–24, Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard. After pushing the imperial militia from their post on the bridgehead, his troops poured into Baden unhindered. Similarly, in the south, by Basel, Ferino's column moved speedily across the river and proceeded up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and into {{the southern end of}} the Black Forest. Anxious that his supply lines would be overextended, Charles began a retreat to the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, <b>hopefully</b> with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
25|$|The {{partnership}} {{described as}} including {{a series of}} exciting projects, including a developmental blog from the Rugby 2012 development team, and <b>hopefully</b> a series of podcasts throughout the coming months {{in order to give}} you all the fans an opportunity to put questions to the people working at HB Studios. The Rugby Forum are hoping that the community will get involved where ever they can and <b>hopefully</b> enjoy seeing the developments of the game.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{does not}} distinguish between P = (X, Y, Z, 1), and P = (X, Y, Z), which is <b>hopefully</b> clear in context.|$|E
25|$|A ductus would, <b>hopefully,</b> move people, {{intellectually and}} emotionally, through the places {{of a text}} to its end, or its {{intention}} (intentio) to persuade them one way or another.|$|E
25|$|On 3 May her pendant {{number was}} changed to I74 as the Royal Navy were {{changing}} identities for all their ships in order to <b>hopefully</b> confuse the enemy.|$|E
25|$|The Theatre {{has always}} been a {{cultural}} mixing pot for Zimbabweans and visitors alike and a number of Reps members have gone on to find fame and <b>hopefully</b> fortune overseas.|$|E
25|$|The net effect, {{over the}} course of many {{simulated}} games, is that the value of a node representing a move will go up or down, <b>hopefully</b> corresponding to whether or not that node represents a good move.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the test}} series had been {{competitive}} and demonstrated many opportunities of emerging talent {{on both sides}} which would <b>hopefully</b> benefit these two sides, as well as world cricket in general in the coming years.|$|E
25|$|Bank Negara Malaysia for {{the time}} being, uses {{interest}} rate targeting. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is their policy instrument, and is used to guide the short term interbank rates which will <b>hopefully</b> influence inflation and economic growth.|$|E
25|$|As of the 2012–13 season, the GTFC Supporters Trust {{known as}} the 'Mariners Trust' has taken over {{responsibility}} for the operation {{of most of the}} bars at the stadium, which <b>hopefully</b> will lead to refurbishment, and new ideas from fans as to how the bars operate.|$|E
25|$|The Brookhaven {{experiment}} {{ended in}} 2001, but {{ten years later}} Fermilab acquired the equipment, and is working to make a more accurate measurement (smaller σ) which will either eliminate the discrepancy or, <b>hopefully,</b> confirm it as an experimentally observable example of physics beyond the Standard Model.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hopefully</b> in {{the future}} the club {{will be able to}} create a youth team which can be run by players in the first and second XI who are keen on getting into {{coaching}} and create a lasting legacy and flow of talent coming through the club.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{technological}} developments that will <b>hopefully</b> facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker et al. utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, {{they were able to}} create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused {{on a wide range of}} helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range. <b>Hopefully</b> this information along with more detailed prevalence maps can lead to more effective public health measures.|$|E
