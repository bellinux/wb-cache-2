40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the overhead <b>incurred</b> by programs {{that can be}} updated dynamically and argue that, in general, and regardless of the mechanism used, the program must <b>incur</b> an overhead during normal execution. We argue that the overhead during normal execution of the updateable program need not {{be as high as}} the overhead for the updated program. In light of the fundamental limitations and the differences in the overhead that must be <b>incurred</b> by the updateable and updated programs, we propose a new mechanism for dynamic software update based on a new shifting gears approach. The mechanism attempts to <b>incur</b> just the required overhead depending on the stage of update the application is in. Before an update the execution <b>incurs</b> low overhead and when an update occurs the execution <b>incurs</b> higher overhead which reverts to low overhead as the execution progresses. We evaluate the mechanism by modifying an application by hand. Preliminary performance numbers show that the mechanism performs better than existing mechanisms for dynamic software update. I...|$|R

5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy {{adopted by the}} Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, the rapidly growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, {{had the effect of}} rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also <b>incurring</b> greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E
