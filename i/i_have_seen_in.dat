In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
25|$|To watch every {{ball of the}} 1974/75 Ashes {{battle was}} to see {{excitement}} and controversy at its height {{in the game of}} cricket: an Australian fast-bowling pair to rank with the greatest ever to pull on a pair of boots, catching the equal or better of anything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Test cricket, batting and captaincy to match anything Australian sides have produced since the war.|$|E
25|$|I {{have found}} that in the {{composition}} of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.|$|E

500|$|Another highly {{satisfactory}} day was 16 October, {{when the}} spotter over the Kansong area reported [...] "beautiful shooting every shot on target-most beautiful shooting <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> five years." [...] This five-hour bombardment leveled ten artillery positions, and in smashing trenches and bunkers inflicted some 500 enemy casualties.|$|E
500|$|Fellow footballer Vic Richardson {{wrote in}} 1968 that Nash [...] "was {{faster than any}} player <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> getting the ball moving to players running on. Add his high marking ability and speed to his quick {{thinking}} {{and you had a}} player who practically originated today's style of play and one who would be unbeatable at it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1923, the MCC {{discovered}} Wills' old cricket cap {{and put it}} {{on display}} in the Block Arcade, prompting Horace Wills to reflect: [...] "My brother was the nicest man I ever met. Though his nature was care-free, amounting almost to wildness, he had the sweetest temper <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a man, and was essentially a sportsman." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his sophomore}} year in 1912, Des Jardien was {{selected}} as a first-team All-Western player. Stagg praised Des Jardien as a [...] "spectacular" [...] player and [...] "as flashy a center as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> many years." [...] In naming Des Jardien to his All-Western team in 1912, E.C. Patterson in Collier's wrote: [...] "Des Jardien is not great of bulk, at least not horizontally. He is tall and rangy and remarkably active. His usefulness is accentuated when it is seen that some of Coach Stagg's forward pass tricks center around him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{consider}} the 1917 Tech team the best football I have ever coached", Heisman said. [...] "It's {{the best team}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> my long career as a coach. I was lucky in having under me a team whose members possessed much natural ability and who played the game intelligently. I {{have never seen a}} team that, as a whole, was so fast in the composite." [...] For many years, it was considered [...] "the greatest football team the South had ever produced". According to a contemporary New York Sun account, [...] "Georgia Tech looms up as one of the truly great teams of all time." ...|$|E

60|$|He was {{the most}} stalwart son of Texas <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> many a day, but neither his great stature nor his {{striking}} face accounted for something I felt--a something spiritual, vital, compelling, that drew me.|$|R
500|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Jim Tatum, who had {{previously}} coached eight first-team All-Americans at Oklahoma and coached six aside from Ward at Maryland, said that Ward was [...] "the greatest football player I've seen ounce-for-ounce, and the best I've ever coached." [...] Quarterback Jack Scarbath considered Ward one of Maryland's best all-time linemen alongside Randy White. Teammate and first-round NFL Draft pick Ed Modzelewski said, [...] "I still believe he was the greatest player, pound for pound, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> either pro or college ball." [...] Ward {{was inducted into the}} College Football Hall of Fame in 1980, and into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{universality}} of its pacifist theme, Hair {{continues to be a}} popular choice for high-school and university productions. Amateur productions of Hair are also popular worldwide. [...] In 2002, Peter Jennings featured a Boulder, Colorado, high school production of Hair for his ABC documentary series In Search of America. A September 2006 community theater production at the 2,000-seat Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, was praised by original producer Michael Butler, who said it was [...] "one of the best Hairs <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a long time." [...] Another example of a recent large-scale amateur production is the Mountain Play production at the 4,000-seat Cushing Memorial Amphitheatre in Mount Tamalpais State Park in Mill Valley, California in the spring of 2007.|$|E
500|$|... "Varanasi is {{the eternal}} abode of Lord Shiva, {{and one of}} my {{favorite}} temples is that of Lord Hanuman, the monkey god. The city is also where one of the miracles that have happened in my life took place: I met Ma Anandamayi, a great spiritual soul. Seeing the beauty of her face and mind, I became her ardent devotee. Sitting at home now in Encinitas, in Southern California, at the age of 88, surrounded by the beautiful greens, multi-colored flowers, blue sky, clean air, and the Pacific Ocean, I often reminisce about all the wonderful places <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the world. I cherish the memories of Paris, New York, and a few other places. But Varanasi seems to be etched in my heart!" ...|$|E

500|$|Grimsby made {{a strong}} {{challenge}} for promotion in 1951–52 but finished second, three points behind Lincoln City (only one team was promoted from Division Three North, with one from Division Three South). Shankly insisted in his autobiography that his Grimsby team was: [...] "Pound for pound, and class for class, the best football team <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> England since the war. In the league they were in, they played football nobody else could play. Everything was measured, planned and perfected and you could not wish to see more entertaining football". Stephen Kelly quotes the [...] "pound for pound" [...] analysis but qualifies it as [...] "another slight exaggeration, but he meant well". Kelly went on: [...] "that kind of talk could only boost morale at the club".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now {{what do you think of}} that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|McElhenny {{was also}} an asset in the {{receiving}} game, becoming a favorite target of quarterback Y. A. Tittle on screen passes. His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd think he had eyes {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he just saw the guy, out of the corner of his eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I bethought me of {{the picture}} that the Prince and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the skies yonder {{in the land of}} Goshen, but of it I said nothing. Yet I think that Bakenkhonsu saw into my mind, for he asked: ...|$|R
60|$|And I, {{remembering what}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the blue parlour, was silent--for I could not lie. So she flung my hand {{away with a}} bitter laugh, and picked lightly from the table anear a small dagger with a jewelled handle.|$|R

500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|Several Jewish {{authors of}} the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes. Ahimaaz relates that Rabbi Samuel ben Paltiel (980-1010) gave money for oil at [...] "the {{sanctuary}} at the Western Wall." [...] Benjamin of Tudela (1170) wrote [...] "In front of this place is the Western Wall, {{which is one of}} the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court." [...] The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy. While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site, shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) states [...] "the Westen Wall, part of which is still standing, is made of great, thick stones, larger than any <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the {{captaincy}} announcement, the Harvey-led Victorians met Craig's New South Welshmen at the SCG in the last match of the Shield season. Harvey admitted to being irked by the board's snub and {{felt that it was}} because of his blunt nature. The men were cordial at the toss and Craig sent the Victorians in to bat. At the same time, Victorian batsman Colin McDonald hit a ball into his face and broke his nose while practising, as Harvey and Craig went out to toss. Harvey asked for a gentleman's agreement to allow a substitute for McDonald. Craig refused, citing the importance of the match. This evoked a rare angry response from Harvey, according to Benaud. Playing with ten men, Benaud said that Harvey [...] "proceeded, {{with a certain amount of}} anger, to play one of the best innings <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Sheffield Shield". He made 209 and later forced New South Wales to follow-on. In the end the match was drawn and Harvey was unable to deny New South Wales the title. Harvey said that his first double century for Victoria [...] "gave me as much pleasure as any innings I had ever played". He finished his only season as Victorian captain by leading the Shield averages with 836 runs at 104.50.|$|E
