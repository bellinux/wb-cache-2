Consider {{a pair of}} Stern-Gerlach devices with fixed nonparallel orientations that periodically perform spin measurements on identically prepared pairs of electrons in the singlet spin state. Suppose the outcomes are recorded as binary strings l and r (with l sub n and r sub n denoting their n-length prefixes). The hidden-variable theories considered here require that there exists a recursive function which {{may be used to}} transform l sub n into r sub n for any n. This note demonstrates that such a theory cannot reproduce all the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. Specifically, consider an ensemble of outcome pairs (l,r). From the associated probability measure, the Shannon entropies H sub n and <b>H</b> <b>bar</b> sub n for strings l sub n and pairs (l sub n, r sub n) may be formed.

40|$|In this work, {{flat sheet}} {{polysulfone}} (PSf) -based membranes modified with inorganic hydrous aluminum oxide (HAO) nanoparticles {{were used as}} antifouling ultrafiltration membranes for removing oil molecules from oily solution. SEM, AFM and FTIR analyses were performed on the fabricated membranes to study the effect of HAO nanoparticles loading on the membrane properties. The membrane hydrophilicity and separation performance were determined through contact angle measurement and cross-flow ultrafiltration of oily solution, respectively. Results showed that the hydrophilicity of HAO-modified membrane was increased remarkably upon addition of the highest weight ratio of HAO nanoparticles to PSf (i. e. 2 : 1), {{which led to a}} significant rise in permeate flux, achieving 1194 L/m 2 <b>h</b> <b>bar</b> in comparison to 151 L/m 2 <b>h</b> <b>bar</b> shown by the plain PSf membrane. With respect to oil removal efficiency, the modified membrane was found to exhibit almost complete elimination of oil molecules with flux recovery ratio of around 67 % after a simple water washing process. The promising results achieved by the modified PSf membrane could be mainly due to the presence of hydroxyl functional groups on the membrane surface upon addition of highly hydrophilic HAO nanoparticles, which improved not only membrane water permeability but also its antifouling ability...|$|E
40|$|We here {{report on}} the {{separation}} of yeast cells, with micro-engineered membranes having pores that are typically five {{times larger than the}} cells. The separation is due to neither shear-induced diffusion, nor initial lift, but to an effect similar to fluid skimming. The separation performance is linked to the ratio between cross-flow and transmembrane flux, and could be captured with a dimensionless number relating those. On the basis of this dimensionless number, flux and transmission of the cells could be predicted. The mechanism rests on having a sufficiently high cross-flow velocity, such that particles are not dragged too deep in the pore, but are dragged with the cross-flow back into the feed stream. The separation factor can simply be changed by changing the ratio between crossflow velocity and transmembrane flux. Since the membranes have very large pores, fouling does not play a role. Constant high transmembrane flux values of 200 – 2200 L/m 2 h were reached for transmembrane pressures ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 4 bar (typical industrial fluxes are 150 L/m 2 <b>h</b> <b>bar</b> with a maximum of 2000 L/m 2 <b>h</b> <b>bar</b> for short periods of time, comparable to 50 – 400 L/m 2 h [1] and [2]).
