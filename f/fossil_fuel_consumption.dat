[...] Department of Economics and Social Science Consortium. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 This dissertation investigates {{the relationship between}} economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> through three interrelated chapters—each of which addresses a facet of the relationship. The first chapter argues that mainstream explanations for Industrial Revolution generally assign a pride of place to institutional—secure property rights—and technological innovations—the steam engine. Using interdisciplinary sources, this chapter shows that mainstream explanations are based on narrow empirics. More importantly, this chapter shows that switching from water to fossil fuel-based energy sources during the Industrial Revolution was not based on economic considerations since water was neither scarce nor more expensive than coal. Placing the Glorious Revolution on the same historical continuum as the Industrial Revolution—through their common link with the Enclosure Movement—this chapter argues that the real reasons behind switching to <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> were political-economic. The second chapter argues {{that the relationship between}} economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> has not been thoroughly investigated in the case of emerging economies. Building on the understanding obtained via economic history accounts, this chapter argues that the relationship between economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is structurally different in emerging economies. This chapter traces the linkages between economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in emerging economies, highlighting the role played by various economic, structural and technological factors. This chapter also shows that emerging economies—net energy importers, to be specific—face unique macroeconomic challenges in the shape of balance-of-payments crises and financial instability that stem from sudden and severe increases in their energy import bills. The third chapter empirically examines the relationship between economic growth and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> growth in a sample of 35 net energy-importing emerging economies. Results show that in the sample of 35 emerging economies, economic growth Granger causes <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> growth in the period 1981 - 2013. Country-level scatter plots also indicate that in the sample of 35 emerging economies, the relationship between real GDP per capita and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy <b>consumption</b> per capita is linear when using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm—and not curvilinear as postulated by the environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis.

In the present paper, the atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the mean air temperature for the Northern Hemisphere are reviewed since 1860, and they are examined as a function of amounts of CO 2 emitted. Both the atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the mean air temperature have increased with <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption</b> for the period between 1860 and 1940.

All variables have been analysed individually for more than half a century. The research found that while the <b>consumption</b> of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> worldwide has increased trends in the US production and net imports have been dependent on the type of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Most of the US coal and gas production has been for domestic use, which is why it does not have a strong influence on worldwide <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> prices.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the question: Which are {{promising}} options for decreasing material consumption, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in the lifecycle of plastics? The research described in this thesis mainly focuses on measures that change the material system, i. e. measures that change the pattern of material flows through society. By conducting an integral analysis of material flows, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in the lifecycle of plastics, {{it is possible to}} compare different measures at different stages in the life-cycle of a material or product, up and down the product-chain. In this thesis measures to replace feedstocks (changing production routes) are compared with measures for using alternative plastic types (material substitution) and measures for using alternative processes for plastic waste management (increasing materials recycling). A calculation method is developed and used to estimate the impact of the different measures on greenhouse gas emissions and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption</b> over the whole lifecycle of plastics. The research that underlies this thesis leads to the following conclusions: * Changes in steamcracker feedstocks (ethane, LPG, gasoil and naphtha) only marginally influence total <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> and feedstocks <b>consumption</b> and CO 2 emissions. Higher reductions can be achieved by using new processing routes that use biomass as feedstock, like biomass flash pyrolysis and the methanol-to-olefins process combined with methanol production from biomass. Especially a combination of these two routes turns out to be capable of inducing large reductions. * Because substitution potentials between different plastic types are limited and differences in energy use and CO 2 emissions for producing different plastic types are relatively small, no large reductions are to be achieved by substitution between plastics types (unless this would enable product changes increasing material efficiency). * Landfilling and incineration of plastic waste do not allow simultaneous reductions in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> and feedstocks <b>consumption</b> {{on the one hand and}} CO 2 emissions on the other hand. Although it is a cheap and relatively easily applicable option, increasing the share of waste incineration is no valuable option, because it largely increases overall CO 2 emissions. * Largest reductions of CO 2 emissions and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption</b> by measures aiming at enhanced waste management are achieved by increasing the contribution of mechanical recycling, selective dissolution or blast furnace injection. Effort should be made to clear away the obstacles that limit the share of mechanical recycling, by developing appropriate blending and separation techniques. * We estimate that structural changes in the lifecycle of plastics in The Netherlands can lead to a reduction in the <b>consumption</b> of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> of up to 60...|$|R
