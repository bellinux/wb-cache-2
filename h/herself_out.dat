Despite a sometimes stormy relationship with Judy Garland, CBS had found success with several television specials featuring the star. Garland, {{who for years}} had been reluctant to commit to a weekly series, saw the show as her best chance to pull <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of severe financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of all the roles she has played.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E

At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of the house and into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body.

5|$|Lexie {{continues}} to harbor romantic feelings for George, {{oblivious to the}} fact that he doesn't see her in the same way. Their relationship is a mirror foil of George's previous infatuation with the oblivious Meredith. She prioritizes helping George study over taking part in a surgery with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), but feels betrayed when George doesn't request that she become one of his interns after passing his exam. Finally realizing that he doesn't feel the same way, Lexie gives up on her feelings for George and the pair's friendship begins to fizzle out. She later begins a flirtation with Mark, and the pair begin an unlikely romantic relationship, though they are forced to keep it a secret when Meredith and Derek warn Mark away from Lexie. Lexie discovers that some of her fellow interns have secretly been performing simple procedures on each other and begins taking part to prove she's hardcore. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) joins the society, and seeking a more daring procedure, suggests removing her appendix. Though Lexie agrees, she quickly finds <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of her depth, resulting in Meredith and Cristina having to intervene to save Sadie's life. Lexie and the other interns are put on probation. Derek finds Lexie distraught at the day's events, and allows her to move into the attic at his and Meredith's house. Mark comes clean to Derek about his relationship with Lexie, resulting in the two men getting into a fist fight. The pair continue to feud, resulting in Lexie beginning to stress eat until they eventually reconcile. Lexie is delighted when Meredith asks her to be a bridesmaid at her and Derek's wedding, though they eventually give the ceremony to Alex and cancer-stricken Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Mark decides to purchase a house and invites Lexie to move in with him, however she declines, concerned about how fast their relationship is progressing.|$|E

25|$|Beginning with My Name Is Barbra, {{her early}} albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her {{television}} specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, {{but like many}} talented singers of the day, she found <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album Stoney End in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.|$|E

25|$|On November 18, 1995, McPherson was {{involved}} in a minor car accident.

25|$|With the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, {{in which}} the old feudal order made one last attempt to stop the new Japan, {{newspaper}} circulation soared, and woodblock artists were in demand, with Yoshitoshi earning much attention.

25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E

25|$|In October, Loos and {{her brother}} Clifford checked Emerson into a very {{expensive}} sanatorium, where {{he was diagnosed with}} schizophrenia. Loos, who had always left the finances to Emerson, soon discovered that most of her money was no longer in joint accounts but in his own private accounts. Overworked at the studio and under stress from Emerson, she became more and more depressed. After 17 years of his nonsense, she finally asked Emerson for a divorce, and he agreed. Loos promptly bought <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> of her United Artists contract and re-signed with MGM, and bought a beach-front house in Santa Monica. Emerson would continue to find ways to stave off any talk of divorce plans, making finalization impossible. When Emerson was deemed well enough to leave the sanatorium, she paid for a nurse to care for him in an apartment of his own.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{a small amount}} of {{responsiveness}} to nonverbal information, including gestures and facial expressions from other people, and made reasonably good eye contact. However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible body language, and she could only nonverbally get across a few very basic needs. She clearly distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals. When upset Genie would wildly attack herself, but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts said she could not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible trigger—Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her anger—and continued until someone diverted her attention or she physically tired <b>herself</b> <b>out,</b> at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.|$|E

Despite this, Kent noted that she could only get across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums until she had physically tired <b>herself</b> <b>out,</b> after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.|$|E
