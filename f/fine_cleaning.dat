40|$|Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) {{and spring}} barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{are the most}} widely grown crop species in the {{semi-arid}} to arid areas of the Mediterranean region. However, their average on-farm yields are relatively low, 1. 95 and 2. 60 t ha- 1, respectively (FAO, 2007). Water is generally recognized as the most limiting factor for barley and durum wheat production in the Mediterranean, though it has been found, at least for some regions, that N fertilizer applications have been limiting (Passioura, 2002). Water in the Mediterranean is relatively scarce and predictions for 2025 show that water limitations for agricultural production in that region will intensify (IWMI, 2000). Nitrogen fertilizer represents a significant cost of production for the grower and may also have negative environmental impacts through nitrate leaching, use of fossil fuels for manufacture and application, and N 2 O emissions associated with denitrification. Reducing excessive N fertilizer inputs and increasing water productivity, whilst maintaining acceptable yields, will be aided by increases in uptake efficiency. To {{be in a position}} to manage irrigation and N inputs more effectively, an improved quantitative understanding of relationships between root traits and capture of water and nitrogen is required. The major phase of root growth in wheat and barley is during tillering and stem extension, and total length of the root system increases until about anthesis (Gregory et al., 1978 b; Barraclough & Leigh, 1984). A theoretical model (van Noordwijk, 1983) indicated that the rooting trait best related with water and N capture is the root length density (root length cm/ soil volume cm 3; RLD). Field data sets of barley grown on stored water in Syria indicated a RLD of about 1 cm cm- 3 is required for extraction of ca. 90 % of the available water, and it was defined as the critical root length density - CRLD (Gregory & Brown, 1989). In field-grown durum wheat and barley, RLD usually exceeds CRLD in the upper soil profile, while below 60 to 80 cm it is typically lower than 1 cm cm- 3. The relationship between RLD in cereal root systems and below-ground resource capture was recently described in a quantitative model (King et al., 2003), linking the size (RLD) and cumulative distribution of the root system with depth (β) to the proportional capture of available water and nitrogen (φ) during grain filling (King et al., 2003). β describes the shape of the cumulative distribution with depth, according to: p = 1 - βd; where p is the fraction of the root system accumulated from the soil surface to a given depth (d). φ is calculated as: φ = 1 – e-k. RLD, where k is the resource capture coefficient (cm 2). The overall aim of the present study was to: (i) identify root traits in barley and durum wheat for improved water and N capture under different intensities of water and/or N stresses, and (ii) quantify responses of root growth, root: shoot partitioning and water and N capture to simulated Mediterranean environments differing in water and N stresses, using controlled-environment experimental conditions. The main hypotheses tested were: 1. 	Mediterranean barley and durum wheat have a similar root system morphology, and comparable cumulative distribution of RLD with depth (βRLD). 2. 	Water and N deficits increase R:S, however total root weight and length will be reduced. 3. 	The proportion of roots deeper in the profile will increase with water and N deficits (higher β). 4. 	k can be defined from the relationship between RLD and φ, and hence a CRLD can be calculated; k should not differ between genotypes and the CRLD will be ca. 1 cm cm- 3. 5. 	 The k value for root volume density (root volume / soil volume; RVD) can be calculated according to King et al. (2003), and critical root volumes (CRVD) for a 90 % water extraction can be calculated. However, RLD will explain a higher proportion of φ for water capture than RVD. 6. 	 Aboveground dry weight (AGDW) and yield (Y) decrease with N and water deficits and there is an interaction between water availability and N fertilizer, such that responses to N are relatively greater under high than low water availability. 7. 	 Water-use efficiency (AGDW / water use; WUE) increases with water stress and N availability, while grain Δ 13 C decreases, and responses are similar for spring barley and durum wheat. 8. 	Nitrogen-use efficiency (grain DM / N available; NUE), N-uptake efficiency (above groung N / N available; NupE) and N-utilization efficiency (grain DM / aboveground N; NutE) will decrease with increasing water deficits and increasing N supply and responses are similar for spring barley and durum wheat. In each of 2006, 2007 and 2008 one glasshouse soil column (15 cm diameter x 150 cm length) experiment was conducted at the University of Nottingham, School of Biosciences, Sutton Bonington Campus, UK (52. 5 o N, 1. 3 o W). The responses of Jordanian spring barley cv. Rum (2006 - 2008) and durum wheat cvs Hourani (2006 - 2007) and Karim (2007) to two levels of irrigation (drought and fully irrigated) and up to three levels of N fertilizer (nil, 50 and 100 kg ha- 1 N, equivalents) were examined. In 2006 and 2007 for each genotype there were six treatment combinations (2 irrigation treatments x 3 fertilizer N levels), in 2008 for barley there were two irrigation treatments at one level of N fertilizer (50 kg N ha- 1, equivalent). The experiments used a factorial randomised block design in three (2006) or five replicates (2007 and 2008). In each experiment, detailed analysis at sequential samplings through the season was carried out, including anthesis and harvest, of root growth and morphology (by root digital image analysis), as well as for the aboveground growth and dry matter partitioning. Water and N uptake were measured and their use-efficiencies evaluated. In 2006, water uptake was gravimetrically measured by weekly weighing a sub-set of soil columns for each treatment. While in 2007 and 2008, water content was weekly measured at different soil-depth intervals using a Theta-T probe (ML 2 x Delta T Devices, Cambridge, UK) via access apertures in columns for a sub-set of columns. WUE was calculated as the AGDW /total water use, from the date of transplantation to harvest and also by the slope of the linear regression of cumulative AGDW on cumulative water uptake through time. This project attempted a comprehensive study of root (and shoot) responses of barley and durum wheat to water and/ or nitrogen stresses, to identify root characteristics for resource acquisition in Mediterranean type environments. However the conditions were atypical of Mediterranean ecosystems. High soil N available (at sowing + mineralization through the season) and/or leaching led to inconsistent and contradictory response to the ones usually found in the literature. Excessive temperatures known to be inhibitory to plant growth and development were felt in the glasshouse, with peaks exceeding 50 ºC. In the field, roots usually experience much lower temperatures below ground. However in these experiments they were subject to the same high temperatures as shoots, this would have had a major impact on the observed root distributions. Moreover, soil in the columns was found to have quite large bulk densities (1. 61, 1. 85 and 1. 76 g cm- 3 in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively), offering a quite high resistance to root growth and consequently shoot growth (Bowen, 1981). To avoid roots growing in the edges, only one plant per soil column was used. However when compared to field grown crops, it only represents an half to a fifth of the plant densities usually found in wheat and barley grown in the Mediterranean. Therefore the usual cropping inter-competition for soil resources was not accounted for. For this reasons the root densities presented in this work might not be representative of those found in the field grown crops, and hence its use has to be cautiously. Due to the large amount of time needed to extract the root system from the soil, and posterior <b>fine</b> <b>cleaning</b> before scanning, only the top (0 – 20 m); mid (60 - 80 cm) and bottom (> 125 cm) of the root system where possible to be analysed. Consequently the total root weight, length and volume, are not real totals but the sum of the layers analysed. Other root morphology parameters, like mean root diameter, specific root length (SRL) and root volume root weight ratio (rV:rW) where calculated in function of those layers. The calculation of the root parameters distribution with depth, using β coefficients (βW - weight, βL – length and βV – volume), was also done taking in account those soil depth sections. This partial analysis can result in a different distribution with depth when compared with a full analysis. Moreover the root shoot ratio (R:S) was estimated using the βW, hence those values may not be the same as if all root system was analysed. Root growth of barley was generally representative of values reported in the literature in the present experiments, but root growth of durum wheat genotypes showed some signs of restriction in the soil columns, particularly in 2007, possibly in part due to the high soil bulk density (BD = 1. 85 g cm- 3). The root to shoot dry weight ratio (R:S) increased with drought, but relatively more for wheat than for barley, so that total root weight (TRW) was actually higher under water limitations for durum wheat than under full irrigation. After anthesis for all genotypes under the droughted treatment, there was a consistent increase in the allocation of root biomass deeper in the soil profile (higher βW). Total root weight (TRW), total root length (TRL) and total root volume (TRV) were well correlated; therefore RWD, RLD and RVD distribution with depth followed similar patterns. Hence, an increase of βL and βV was also found under drought. Beta values for root length were (averaged across 2006, 2007 and 2008) : 0. 97, 0. 97 and 0. 96 for barley cv. Rum, wheat cv. Hourani and wheat cv. Karim under irrigation; and 0. 98, 0. 98 and 0. 97 under drought, respectively. N was shown to occasionally reduce RLD, possibly associated with extreme and uniform N concentration in the soil (due to a high mineralization) causing lateral root formation to cease (Linkohr et al., 2002). The sub-traits most affecting TRL differed between genotypes. For durum wheat changes in length were mainly associated with increases in R:S and TRW, whilst for barley cv. Rum specific root length (SRL; root length cm / root weight g) was more important in determining TRL. Therefore SRL could be a promising trait to target in breeding, since it may be possible to increase RLD without increasing the allocation of biomass from the aboveground to the roots. Overall water use (WU) was higher for barley than wheat cultivars associated with its more extensive root system and higher aboveground growth. However, differences between the WU of plants subjected to drought of wheat cultivars and barley were not large. As expected WU decreased with drought and WUE increased. For barley WUE was relatively higher than for wheat cv. Hourani, and wheat cv. Karim. However, ∆ 13 C in the grains, across years was similar between genotypes. Leaf SPAD values measured at anthesis were always higher for barley than wheat, possibly indicating higher specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) resulting in higher assimilation rate per unit leaf area (Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2009). N-use efficiency was higher for barley than for durum wheat cultivars and decreased with drought and N application for all genotypes. Differences in NUE were mainly explained by NupE. Fitting the King et al. (2003) equation to the RLD and φ data for water, a kRLD was found for barley cv. Rum of 2. 4 cm- 2 under drought (2007 - 08), resulting in a CRLD of 0. 97 cm cm- 3. This was similar to the value previously found by Gregory & Brown (1989); however no value could be fitted under irrigation. For wheat cv. Karim relatively higher values of kRLD were found: 0. 59 and 0. 40 cm- 2 under irrigation and drought, respectively, in 2007; corresponding to CRLD values of 0. 41 and 0. 64 cm cm- 3, respectively. Overall results indicated that under drought CRLD values were higher than under irrigation. Fitting an adapted King et al. (2003) equation to RVD vs φ for water showed a more consistent relationship than was found for RLD. Similar values of kRVD were observed for barley (5. 13 and 4. 45, under irrigation and drought, respectively) and wheat cv. Hourani (5. 03 and 4. 00, under irrigation and drought, respectively), though wheat cv. Karim had relatively higher values (10. 04 and 5. 86, under irrigation and drought, respectively). Therefore, CRVD values for wheat cv. Karim were lower than for the other two genotypes. kRVD values under drought were lower than those found under irrigation, resulting in higher CRVD under drought. AGDW and grain yield (Y) was relatively higher for barley than for both wheat varieties. Furthermore wheat cv. Karim showed the lowest values of Y. Those yield differences were mainly associated with a higher fertile shoot number per plant for barley. Indeed Y was strongly positively correlated with the fertile shoots and grain number per plant (R 2 = 0. 76 and 0. 97, respectively). Drought decreased AGDW, number of fertile shoots and therefore Y for all genotypes but more severely for barley than for the wheat genotypes. N fertilizer effects were only consistent in 2006 where the N 50 treatment increased fertile shoot number, AGDW and Y per plant, as well as WU, but only under irrigation, consistent with the literature (Ebrahim, 2008). Barley proved to have higher WUE associated with a higher SLN, and produced a higher Y. Water use and NupE were also higher under drought for barely than for wheat genotypes due to its more extensive root system. Therefore, it seems that on the basis of the present results under Mediterranean conditions, barley cv. Rum should be preferred when high rain or irrigation is available. When water is limited durum wheat varieties will probably maintain Y relatively better than barley. Nevertheless, these findings should be interpreted cautiously since wheat growth in this work was possibly limited more by the CE growing conditions in the UK than barley. Furthermore, the root growth of wheat cv. Karim was apparently susceptible to mechanical impedance that usually increases in drying soil. Overall, root systems of barley and wheat and their distribution with depth were broadly similar. However, under drought durum wheat seemed more adapted, not only relatively increasing the biomass allocated to the roots (high R:S), but in fact absolutely increasing TRW when compared to the irrigated plants. Traits underlying variation in total root length were different between genotypes; durum wheat was mainly dependent on the amount of biomass allocated to roots, while barley seems able to produce more root length by increasing SRL due to changes in tissue density. Therefore breeding programs should consider SRL a potential target trait. The relation between RLD and φ was verified resulting in a k value for RLD for barley of 2. 4 cm- 2. A CRLD of approximately 1 cm cm- 3 for barley was confirmed. However, results suggested that it might be lower under irrigation than under drought and lower for wheat than for barley. RVD was slightly better related to φ than RLD. Therefore more studies relating proportional resource capture and RVD are needed to confirm these findings and establish the basis of that relationship. β was confirmed by the present results to be a good trait to summarize the overall effects of changes of root distribution with depth and with drought. A simple framework relating the biomass allocated to roots (R:S), the investment in length (SRL) and the cumulative distribution of roots with depth (β) to a potentially higher RLD at depth and water and N uptake is suggested. Finally, the implications of the current findings for establishing agronomic and breeding strategies to improve below-ground resource capture, utilization and yield production under water and/or N stresses are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the research program is to explore the potential application of a new invention involving a multistage column equipped with concentric draft-tubes (hereafter {{referred to as the}} multistage column) for <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> and other fluid/particle separation processes. The research work will identify the design parameters and their effects on the performance of the separation process. The results of this study will provide an engineering basis for further development of this technology in coal cleaning and in the general areas of fluid/particle separation. Wastewater treatment tests program was conducted during this quarter. Preliminary tests showed that the multistage column had superior performance to conventional column. In both batch and continuous operations, the oil removal efficiencies were higher than 90 %. The results were also compared with data reported in the open literature. 7 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|Bechtel, {{together}} with Amax Research and Development Center (Amax R&D), has prepared this study which provides conceptual cost {{estimates for the}} production of premium quality coal-water slurry fuel (CWF) in a commercial plant. Two scenarios are presented, one using column flotation technology and the other the selective agglomeration to clean the coal to the required quality specifications. This study forms part of US Department of Energy program �Engineering Development of Advanced Physical <b>Fine</b> Coal <b>Cleaning</b> for Premium Fuel Applications,� (Contract No. DE-AC 22 - 92 PC 92208), under Task 11, Project Final Report. The primary objective of the Department of Energy program is to develop the design base for prototype commercial advanced <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> facilities capable of producing ultra-clean coals suitable for conversion to stable and highly loaded CWF. The fuels should contain less than 2 lb ash/MBtu (860 grams ash/GJ) of HHV and preferably less than 1 lb ash/MBtu (430 grams ash/GJ). The advanced <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> technologies to be employed are advanced column froth flotation and selective agglomeration. It is further stipulated that operating conditions during the advanced cleaning process should recover not less than 80 percent of the carbon content (heating value) in the run-of-mine source coal. These goals for ultra-clean coal quality are to be met under the constraint that annualized coal production costs does not exceed $ 2. 5 /MBtu ($ 2. 37 /GJ), including the mine mouth cost of the raw coal. A further objective of the program is to determine the distribution of a selected suite of eleven toxic trace elements between product CWF and the refuse stream of the cleaning processes. Laboratory, bench-scale and Process Development Unit (PDU) tests to evaluate advanced column flotation and selective agglomeration were completed earlier under this program with selected coal samples. A PDU with a capacity of 2 st/h was designed by Bechtel and installed at Amax R&D, Golden, Colorado by Entech Global for process evaluation tests. The tests successfully demonstrated the capability of advanced column flotation as well as selective agglomeration to produce ultra-clean coal at specified levels of purity and recovery efficiency. Test results and the experience gained during the operation of the PDU have provided valuable insights into the processes studied. Based on the design data obtained from the test work and a set of project design criteria, two sets of conceptual designs for commercial CWF production plants have been developed, one using column flotation and the other using selective agglomeration process. Using these designs, Capital as well as Operating and Maintenance (O&M) cost estimates for the plants have been compiled. These estimates have then been used to derive the annualized cost of production of premium CWF on a commercial scale. Further, a series of sensitivity analysis have been completed to evaluate the effects of variations in selected cost components and process parameters on the overall economics of premium fuel productio...|$|R
40|$|Goal is {{engineering}} {{development of}} two advanced physical <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> processes, column flotation and selective agglomeration, for premium fuel applications. Scope includes laboratory research and bench-scale testing on 6 coals to optimize these processes, followed by design/construction/operation of a 2 -t/hr PDU. During this quarter, parametric {{testing of the}} 30 -in. Microcel{trademark} flotation column at the Lady Dunn plant was completed and clean coal samples submitted for briquetting. A study of a novel hydrophobic dewatering process continued at Virginia Tech. Benefits of slurry PSD (particle size distribution) modification and pH adjustment were evaluated for the Taggart and Hiawatha coals; they {{were found to be}} small. Agglomeration bench-scale test results were positive, meeting product ash specifications. PDU Flotation Module operations continued; work was performed with Taggart coal to determine scaleup similitude between the 12 -in. and 6 -ft Microcel{trademark} columns.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to demonstrate that: The Mulled Coal process, which has been proven {{to work on a}} wide range of wet fine coals at bench scale, will work equally well on a continuous basis, producing consistent quality at a convincing rate of production in a commercial coal preparation plant. The wet product from a <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> circuit can be converted to a solid fuel form for ease of handling and cost savings in storage and rail car transportation. A wet fine coal product thus converted to a solid fuel form, can be stored, shipped, and burned with conventional fuel handling, transportation, and combustion systems. During this fourth quarter of the contract period, activities were underway under Tasks 2 and 3. Sufficient characterization of the bench-scale testing and pilot-plant testing results enabled the design and procurement activities to move forward. On that basis, activities in the areas of design and procurement that had been initiated during the previous quarter were conducted and completed...|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{control of}} <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> {{circuits}} {{has traditionally been}} limited {{by the lack of}} sensors for on-line ash analysis. Although several nuclear-based slurry analyzers are available, none have seen widespread acceptance. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} nuclear sensors are expensive and tend to be influenced by changes in seam type and pyrite content. In this investigation, an image analysis technique is used for on-line determination of ash content in fine coal slurries. The ash content of a flotation tailings stream is correlated to the mean gray level of the slurry. Based on a 90 % prediction interval, an analysis of sensor performance indicates an accuracy of 73 {+-} 4 % ash over a range from 65 - 90 % ash. While this result is comparable to existing nuclear-based analyzers, the video-based system is only a fraction of the cost. The sensor is currently being used to monitor the column flotation tailings stream at the Middle Fork preparation plant owned and operated by Pittston Coal Company...|$|R
40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this {{investigation}} to test a new <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> system, in which a coal is cleaned first by column flotation to remove primarily ash-forming minerals and then by an enhanced gravity separation technique to remove the pyrite remaining in the flotation product. Of the various column flotation technologies developed {{under the auspices of the}} US Department of Energy, the Microcel{sup TM} flotation column was chosen because it is being used commercially in the US coal industry, particularly by low-sulfur coal producers. Of the various enhanced gravity separation technologies used in minerals industry, Multi-Gravity Separator (MGS) was chosen because it shows promise for pyrite rejection from fine coal streams containing a wide range of particle sizes. The bench-scale tests were conducted using three different circuit configurations, i. e.; Microcel{sup TM} column alone; MGS alone; and Microcel{sup Tm} and MGS in series. In general, high ash-rejections were achieved using Microcel{sup TM} column and an MGS unit in series, both the ash and pyritic sulfur rejections exceeded what can be achieved using either the Microcel{sup TM} column or the MGS unit alone, demonstrating a synergistic effect...|$|R
40|$|The ash in six common {{bituminous}} coals, Taggart, Winifrede, Elkhorn No. 3, Indiana VII, Sunnyside and Hiawatha, {{could be}} liberated by fine grinding to allow preparation of clean coal meeting premium fuel specifications (< 1 - 2 lb/ MBtu ash and < 0. 6 lb/ MBtu sulfur) by laboratory and bench- scale column flotation or selective agglomeration. Over 2, 100 tons of coal were cleaned in the PDU at feed rates between 2, 500 and 6, 000 lb/ h by Microcel� column flotation and by selective agglomeration using recycled heptane as the bridging liquid. Parametric testing of each process and 72 - hr productions runs were completed {{on each of}} the three test coals. The following results were achieved after optimization of the operating parameters: The primary objective was to develop the design base for commercial <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> facilities for producing ultra- clean coals which can be converted into coal-water slurry premium fuel.

40|$|Research {{conducted}} at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale {{over the past}} two years has identified highly efficient methods for treating fine coal (i. e., - 28 mesh). In this study, a circuit comprised of the three advanced <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> technologies is being tested in an operating preparation plant to evaluate circuit performance and to compare the performance with the current technologies used to treat - 16 mesh fine coal. The circuit integrated a Floatex hydrosizer, a Falcon concentrator and a Jameson froth flotation cell. The Floatex hydrosizer is being used as a primary cleaner for the nominally - 16 mesh Illinois No. 5 fine coal circuit feed. The overflow of the Floatex is screened at 48 mesh using a Sizetec vibratory screen to produce a clean coal product from the screen overflow. The screen overflow is further treated by the Falcon and Jameson Cell. During this reporting period, tests were initiated on the fine coal circuit installed at the Kerr-McGee Galatia preparation plant. The circuit was found to reduce both the ash content and the pyritic sulfur content. Additional in-plant circuitry tests are ongoing...|$|R
50|$|The <b>fine</b> work of <b>cleaning</b> the egg fossils is {{performed}} in a laboratory. Preparation usually begins from {{the underside of the}} block, which tends to be the best preserved. Because of their fragility, cleaning fossil eggs requires patience and skill. Scientists use delicate instruments like dental picks, needles, small pneumatic engraving tools, and X-Acto knives. Scientists must determine at what point to stop cleaning based on their own criteria. If eggs are fully extracted they can be more fully studied individually at the cost of information regarding the spatial relationships between eggs or if the eggs had hatched. Commercial fossil dealers tend to expose only the bottom of the eggs since the topsides might be damaged by hatching and therefore less visually appealing to potential customers.|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{control of}} <b>fine</b> coal <b>cleaning</b> {{circuits}} {{has traditionally been}} limited {{by the lack of}} sensors for on-line ash analysis. Although several nuclear-based analyzers are available, none have seen widespread acceptance. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} nuclear sensors are expensive and tend to be influenced by changes in seam type and pyrite content. Recently, researchers at VPI&SU have developed an optical sensor for phosphate analysis. The sensor uses image processing technology to analyze video images of phosphate ore. It is currently being used by Texasgulf for off-line analysis of dry flotation concentrates. The primary advantages of optical sensors over nuclear sensors are that they are significantly cheaper, are not subject to measurement variations due to changes in high atomic number minerals, are inherently safer and require no special radiation permitting. Purpose of this work is to apply the knowledge gained in the development of an optical phosphate analyzer to the development of an on-line ash analyzer for fine coal slurries. During the past quarter, tests were performed on two prototype sample presentation systems for the optical analyzer. Preliminary results indicate that the flow of slurry past the camera lens is too consistent to provide reliable results. A third option for sampel presentation is being explored...|$|R
40|$|The Mulled Coal {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} overcoming the adverse handling characteristics of wet fine coal without thermal drying. The process involves the addition of a low cost, harmless reagent to wet fine coal using off-the-shelf mixing equipment. Based on laboratory- and bench-scale testing, Mulled Coal can be stored, shipped, and burned without causing any of the plugging, pasting, carryback and freezing problems normally associated with wet coal.
