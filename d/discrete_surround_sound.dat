50|$|From 1973, {{until his}} death in 2012, Marino worked at Sterling Sound. In 1998, Ted Jensen, Greg Calbi and Tom Coyne, along with Murat Aktar (Absolute Audio co-founder) and UK based Metropolis, {{purchased}} Sterling from previous owner, Lee Hulko. Marino was the most senior mastering engineer. Sterling Sound is located in New York City, occupying {{the top floor of the}} Chelsea Market in the Meatpacking District. Marino's studio is one of the three <b>surround</b> <b>sound</b> studios at Sterling and it was designed by Fran Manzella, FM Design. Marino's room became one of the few mastering suites in the industry, if not the only one, that was capable of doing both <b>surround</b> <b>sound</b> and vinyl mastering. Marino, along with Chris Muth and Sterling techs Barry Wolifson and Phil Sztenderowicz, turned Marino's mastering console into an 8 channel A/B preview console. This design made possible presetting console parameters from song to song, which is needed for the continuous process of cutting a side of a vinyl album. This type of design was common in mastering houses during vinyl's heyday, but what made this one different was the ability to also process 6 <b>discrete</b> channels for <b>surround</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|R
50|$|For music {{surround}} channel information {{is intended to}} be more direct as in a soundstage there would be direct noise from all around and not ambience as in a movie setting. For this reason surround speakers should not be set up to be strictly diffuse. Optimally there should be <b>discrete</b> <b>surround</b> channels for diffuse and direct effects. This is part of the design for Tomlinson Holman's 10.2 <b>surround</b> <b>sound.</b> For movies <b>surround</b> channel information is usually more diffuse ambient noise.|$|R
