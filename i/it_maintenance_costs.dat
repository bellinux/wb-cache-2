40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, more andmore {{enterprises}} and organizations are hosting their data into the cloud, {{in order to}} reduce the <b>IT</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> and enhance the data reliability. However, facing the numerous cloud vendors as well as their heterogenous pricing policies, customersmaywell be perplexed with which cloud(s) are suitable for storing their data and what hosting strategy is cheaper. The general status quo is that customers usually put their data into a single cloud (which is subject to the vendor lock-in risk) and then simply trust to luck. Based on comprehensive analysis of various state-of-the-art cloud vendors, this paper proposes a novel data hosting scheme (named CHARM) which integrates two key functions desired. The first is selecting several suitable clouds and an appropriate redundancy strategy to store data with minimizedmonetary cost and guaranteed availability. The second is triggering a transition process to re-distribute data according to the variations of data access pattern and pricing of clouds. We evaluate the performance of CHARMusing both trace-driven simulations and prototype experiments. The results show that compared with the major existing schemes, CHARMnot only saves around 20 percent of monetary cost but also exhibits sound adaptability to data and price adjustments.

When the cutting tool mills the virtual workpiece, the trainees can feel its resistance according to different simulation parameters. The system proposes two types of haptic interaction using a generic haptic device or a simple input device combined with pseudo-haptic feedback. 1 Introduction and Related Work Hundreds of people are trained to the use of milling machines in AFPA 1 centers each year.

An assessment has been done as to whether these errors would cause any problem in additive manufacturing techniques, where the test parts were built using the Wire+Arc Additive Manufacture (WAAM) technique. Finally, different compensation strategies are discussed to counter the robotic errors and a reduction of 3 mm in top surface profile irregularity by varying the wire feed speed (WFS) during the path has been demonstrated...|$|R
