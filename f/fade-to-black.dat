25|$|A {{drawback}} of SECAM {{for production}} is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals {{are not really}} possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: you just reduce the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the <b>fade-to-black</b> is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better color separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback {{in the early days}} of SECAM as such filters did not become readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{front face}} of each tower is {{animated}} with a continuous, dynamic exhibit {{of lights and}} electronic images. Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of landscapes such as [...] waterfalls, [...] most intriguing [...] are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation, the order determined using a Barco show controller. Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit. [...] As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer. [...] However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each. [...] The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second <b>fade-to-black</b> every 15 minutes. [...] If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days. A June 2007 article in the Chicago Sun-Times reported {{that many of the}} subjects who had their images digitized for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them.|$|E

50|$|In stage lighting, a fade is {{a gradual}} {{increase}} or decrease of the intensity of light projected onto the stage. The term fade-in refers to gradually changing the lighting level from complete darkness to a predetermined lighting level. A fade-out (also known as <b>fade-to-black)</b> refers to gradually decreasing the intensity of light until none is shining on the stage. A crossfade is when lighting levels are gradually altered from one setting to another. A fade-in is sometimes called a build, and where this terminology is used, a fade is understood to be a fade-out.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the {{development}} team that worked on the original God of War {{is working on the}} new installment. In regards to the camera change, Barlog said [...] "We wanted a much more intimate experience, a much more up close, and a much more player-controlled experience, so the camera really is a mechanic that we're leaning into heavily for everything in the game." [...] The entire game will be a single shot, meaning there will be no loading screens or <b>fade-to-black.</b> The frame rate will be 30 frames per second, and the enemy count has been increased to up to 100 enemies on-screen; God of War III and Ascension could do up to 50. Unlike the previous games, Santa Monica will not be making a demo specifically for public release. Barlog explained that making another demo would delay the game by a couple of months; he did not mention whether or not the E3 2016 demo would become available. He also confirmed that the game was built for the standard PlayStation 4, but the game [...] "will benefit from the power" [...] of the PlayStation 4 Pro; an updated version of the PlayStation 4 that can render games in 4K and was released a few months after God of War was announced. God of War was absent from the annual PlayStation Experience event in early December 2016, with Barlog promising that [...] "we will be showing something really awesome when it is ready." [...] In late December 2016, Barlog confirmed that the game was playable from start to finish.|$|E
5000|$|In a skit from {{an episode}} of Tosh.0 that first aired October 18, 2011, host Daniel Tosh turns his normal [...] "Web Redemption" [...] segment (where a person or group who {{appeared}} in a notorious or embarrassing online video are {{given a chance to}} explain themselves via interview/event recreation) into an [...] "intervention" [...] for a Wisconsin man named Tim, whose videotaped trip on shrooms turned into a YouTube sensation. Tosh reveals the redemption segment is really an [...] "intervention" [...] about 2/3 of the way through when he lures Tim into leaving the room with him on the pretense of going to see [...] "a Lady Antebellum laser light show"; when they open the door to leave the interview room, Tim discovers they are in a small hotel conference room, in which Tim's [...] "family and friends" [...] are gathered all around. Tosh uses Jeff VanVonderen's trademark intro ("These people love you like crazy...") and introduces Tim's mom and dad, some other people [...] "who are probably early for the next intervention", and a clown who's [...] "addicted to smiles" [...] that Tosh invited because [...] "these things are always so depressing." [...] Tim's father starts off the family portion of the intervention by reading his own letter; it begins with [...] "we're here because we wanted a free trip to L.A." [...] The interventionist quickly determines that Tim hasn't yet hit rock bottom and rescinds the offer of rehab until he does. Tosh and Tim are shown next attending a drug party, where they re-enact many of the crazy things Tim said and did in his notorious YouTube video, and a black screen with white text reveals that two minutes have passed since they began their drug party. As Tosh decides that Tim has now hit rock bottom (since they find the dead body of the clown from the intervention beside their hotel bed), they head off together to the rehab center. But when [...] "Amy Winehouse" [...] answers the door at the [...] "rehab center", the pair realize they must have overdosed (a subtle satire on one of Ken Seeley's assertions during Pre-Intervention talks, when he stresses that some addicts don't hit rock bottom until they're dead). As they enter Heaven, the screen fades to white, where black text (instead of the usual <b>fade-to-black</b> with white text summarizing the addict's time in treatment) says simply that [...] "Six months later, they are still happily dead." ...|$|E
