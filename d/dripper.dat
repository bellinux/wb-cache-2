25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than flood irrigation, like furrow irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual <b>dripper.</b> With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|E

[...] The lyrics for [...] "Honey <b>Dripper</b> Blues No. 2" [...] by Edith North Johnson follow a typical AAB structure:Lucille Bogan's (as Bessie Jackson) [...] "Red Cross Man" [...] uses an AB plus refrain structure:Blues historian Elijah Wald suggests that Scrapper Blackwell {{was the first to}} introduce a reference to a city in his [...] "Kokomo Blues", using a AAB verse:"Kokola Blues", recorded by Madlyn Davis a year earlier in 1927, also references Kokomo, Indiana, in the refrain:In 1932, Jabo Williams recorded [...] "Ko Ko Mo Blues," [...] with the same refrain, but included a counting line: [...] "One and two is three, four and five and six".

50|$|To {{increase}} effectiveness, SSTI products {{should have}} an impermeable base layer to slow gravitational loss of water and to create an elliptical wetting pattern under the soil surface (see diagram). It should also have a small impermeable top layer to ensure that water from the <b>dripper</b> does not “tunnel” through the geotextile {{and up to the}} surface (again a common problem with bare subsurface drip pipe). The effect of these two layers is dramatic as it maximizes the spread of water through the geotextile (up to 10,000 times faster than a clay loam soil as tested by Charles Sturt University).|$|E
50|$|Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a {{technology}} {{designed specifically for}} subirrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to heavy clays. A typical subsurface textile irrigation system has an impermeable base layer (usually polyethylene or polypropylene), a drip line running along that base, a layer of geotextile {{on top of the}} drip line and, finally, a narrow impermeable layer on top of the geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, the spacing of emitters in the drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves the water along the fabric up to 2 m from the <b>dripper.</b> The impermeable layer effectively creates an artificial water table.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} recover the flow rate of clogged <b>drippers</b> with {{different}} doses and permanence times of the product MaxBio. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design in split-split-plot scheme, where the plots corresponded to product doses (80, 160, 240 and 320 mg L- 1), subplots to the applied treatments (T 1 - without biological treatment, T 2 - 1 st application of the product, and T 3 - 2 nd application of the product) and in sub-subplots the types of emitters (Plastro Hydrodrip Super, Netafim Tiran and Netafim PCJ-CNJ), with three replicates. The four irrigation units operated with treated domestic wastewater for 400 h in order to clog the emitters. After applying the product MaxBio, the flow rate of the <b>drippers</b> and the relative flow rate reduction were determined to express the unclogging levels. There was significant effect of T 2 and T 3 on {{the recovery of the}} flow rate of the <b>drippers,</b> while for the reduction of relative flow rate, the doses of the product did not show statistical difference regarding the types of <b>drippers...</b>|$|R
