40|$|The {{interface}} between copyright law and competition law {{has always been}} a topic of debate in legal and economic circles. Since the last decade however, new economy markets pose new challenges to this interface. Network effects, interconnectivity, rapid innovation, and excludability are characteristics of new economy markets. Particularly network effects can, in connection with copyright protection, increase market power and provoke competition authorities to monitor the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights.</b> This thesis contains an analysis of the background and underlying principles <b>of</b> Canadian <b>copyright</b> law and competition law. It gives an overview over their interface in the legislation and the impact of competition policy on copyright litigation. It also examines the Intellectual Property Enforcement Guidelines that were issued by the Canadian Competition Bureau in September 2000. The thesis concludes that competition law and copyright law are complementary instruments that serve the same goals. The two bodies of law are drafted so that they would not oppose one another. Instead <b>of</b> curbing <b>copyright</b> protection through competition policy enforcement, new challenges posed by new economy markets should be met by rethinking copyright policy and protection in these markets...|$|R

40|$|The {{reason why}} I chose this {{subject matter is}} my {{interest}} in a possible interconnection between two fields of law, apparently far from each other-financial and copyright law.

The above mentioned groups of incomes affect each other, since if the filmmakers want to earn their own, final incomes, first they have to gain finances (taxable incomes) ne-deed to finance the film.

40|$|Treatment {{of musical}} {{borrowing}} under current copyright standards {{is far too}} often inequitable. This {{is evident in the}} works of George Gershwin, who {{for a number of reasons}} was able to borrow freely from existing traditions, works and artists, copyright the works he produced that reflected such borrowings and then restrict future borrowings and reinterpretations of his works. Looking at the operation and uses <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> in the specific instance of George Gershwin’s musical practice reflects uses <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> in the musical arena and demonstrates some ways in which current copyright rules may not adequately contemplate actual practices <b>of</b> music <b>copyright</b> holders. George Gershwin borrowed from a wide range of musical sources, worked extensively with technical collaborators throughout his career and immersed himself in African American musical traditions. Following Gershwin’s death, however, the Gershwin family came to control his copyrights, highlighting the role that heirs now play in the actual use <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> given the fact that copyright duration now extends to 70 years beyond the lives of individual creators. The Gershwin heirs have in most cases not permitted borrowing or significant reinterpretation of George Gershwin’s works. The ability of heirs to control borrowing from and interpretations of existing musical works reflects the fact that copyright structures to this point have been based on combining of rights of control and compensation within copyright frameworks. Through various mechanisms, heirs in particular tend to exert control over uses <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> in ways that have little to do with the creation of musical works that is a major rationale for copyright. By potentially significantly limiting borrowing and reinterpretation, the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> control over <b>copyright</b> in such instances may actually hinder the creation of later works. Uses <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> by creators such as Gershwin and his heirs suggest that it would be prudent in some instances to separate the control and compensation aspects <b>of</b> <b>copyright,</b> particularly in cases of post-mortem artistic legacies. This separation would also involve moving in the direction of a liability rule based standard in copyright that permits borrowing other than in instances of unfair use, in contrast to current standards that significantly limit borrowing except in limited instances such as fair use...|$|R

Recent developments have seen the successful use of gradient information alongside sampled response values in building accurate response surfaces.

40|$|This essay {{investigates the}} issues raised by Eldred v. Ashcroft, in which the Supreme Court may decide whether the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) exceeds Congress 2 ̆ 7 s {{authority}} under that clause. The essay frames the issues in Eldred v. Ashcroft by discussing the history <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> legislation in general and the CTEA in particular and then summarizing the procedural history of Eldred v. Ashcroft. The essay then undertakes a detailed investigation of the text of the Intellectual Property Clause, with a special emphasis on the interpretation of the clause by the first Congress and early judicial decisions. Three elements of the constitutional text have important implications for the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Eldred. First, the Copyright Clause empowers Congress to pursue the goal of promoting the progress of science. This goal is integral to the grant of power to Congress and does not constitute a hortatory preamble. Second, the meaning of science that best coheres with the constitutional text and the original understanding can be glossed as systematic knowledge or learning of enduring value. This understanding of the meaning of 2 ̆ 2 science 2 ̆ 2 is confirmed by Clayton v. Stone, the earliest federal case to undertake a substantive evaluation of the meaning of the phrase 2 ̆ 2 promote the progress of science. 2 ̆ 2 Third, if the limited times restriction is to impose a meaningful limit on Congress 2 ̆ 7 s power, the most plausible constructions are inconsistent with either a term of life plus seventy years or with retroactive extensions, or both. If the phrase 2 ̆ 2 limited times 2 ̆ 2 is construed to limit terms in relationship to the grant of exclusive rights to authors, then a grant of life plus seventy years is, in relationship to the outer limits of the productive life of authors, unlimited. If the phrase 2 ̆ 2 limited times 2 ̆ 2 is construed to require definite or certain terms, then the retroactive extension of terms on a wholesale basis is unlimited. Finally, the essay provides a reader 2 ̆ 7 s guide to {{the issues raised}} both by the parties and by scholars. Among these topics are the tier of scrutiny to be applied to congressional <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> the <b>copyright</b> power, the question whether retroactive extensions <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> terms can promote the progress of science, an analysis of the economic effects of the CTEA 2 ̆ 7 s extensions <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> terms, a discussion of the 2 ̆ 2 limited times 2 ̆ 2 constraint in the intellectual property clause, and an investigation of the first amendment implications of the CTEA...|$|R

In relation to the latter there is a clear, absolute and immediate need for new legislation, which will take into account their particularities (especially the fact that they combine vast amounts of different expressions and data, integration (transformation) of this data and interactivity) and which will offer them a regime of protection tailored to their specific needs.
