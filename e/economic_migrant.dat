50|$|The term <b>economic</b> <b>migrant</b> {{refers to}} someone who has {{travelled}} from one region to another region for the purposes of seeking employment and an improvement in quality of life and access to resources.

50|$|An <b>economic</b> <b>migrant</b> {{is someone}} who emigrates from one region to another to seek an {{improvement}} in living standards because the living conditions or job opportunities in the migrant's own region are not sufficient. The United Nations uses the term migrant worker. The term <b>economic</b> <b>migrant</b> is often confused with the term refugee, but economic migrants leave their country due to bad economic conditions, not due to fear of persecution {{on the basis of}} race, religion, or ethnicity. Economic migrants are free to apply for asylum and thus refugee status in the country they migrated to. However they will not be given refugee status, unless the economic situation in their home country has led to generalised violence or seriously disturbed public order.|$|E

5000|$|A {{forcibly}} {{displaced person}} is distinguished from an <b>economic</b> <b>migrant.</b> In 2008, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs suggested a better term for migrants who fled {{for the purpose of}} their and their dependents' basic survival was [...] "forced humanitarian migrants". These economic migrants fall outside the mandates of the support structures offered by governments and non-governmental organisations for refugees.|$|E

50|$|The {{lifting of}} UN imposed {{economic}} sanctions {{and the end}} of the Bush War at the time of independence produced an immediate peace dividend. Renewed access to world capital markets made it possible to finance major new infrastructure developments in transport and schools. One area of economic growth was tourism, catering in particular to visitors from Europe and North America. Many white people found work in this sector. Another area of growth was horticulture, involving the cultivation of flowers, fruits and vegetables which were air-freighted to market in Europe. Many white farmers were involved in this and in 2002 it was claimed that 8% of horticultural imports into Europe were sourced in Zimbabwe. The <b>economic</b> <b>migrant</b> element among the white population had departed quickly after independence, leaving behind those white people with deeper roots in the country. The country settled and the white population stabilised.|$|E

5000|$|Perceiving {{this growing}} {{dichotomy}} {{as a threat}} to national unity, the government promulgated directives in the 1980s that sought to preserve Bhutan's cultural identity as well as to formally embrace the citizens of other ethnic groups in a [...] "One Nation, One People" [...] policy. The government implied that the [...] "culture" [...] to be preserved would be that of the various northern Bhutanese groups. To reinforce this movement, the government forced the use of the Driglam Namzha, the Bhutanese national dress and etiquette code. This policy required citizens to wear the attire of the northern Bhutanese in public places under penalty of fines, and reinforced the status of Dzongkha as the national language. Nepali was discontinued as a subject in the schools, thus bringing it at par with the status of the other languages of Bhutan, none of which are taught. Such policies were criticized at first by human rights groups as well as Bhutan's Nepalese <b>economic</b> <b>migrant</b> community, who perceived the policy to be directed against them. The government, for its part, perceived that free Nepali-language education had encouraged illegal immigration into southern Bhutan.|$|E
5000|$|An {{asylum seeker}} (also rarely called an asylee) {{is a person}} who flees his or her home country, 'spontaneously' enters another country and applies for asylum, i.e. the right to {{international}} protection, in this other country. An asylum seeker may be a refugee, a displaced person or a migrant, such as an <b>economic</b> <b>migrant.</b> A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded. The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and becomes an officially recognised refugee or whether asylum is refused and the person becomes an illegal immigrant who has to leave the country again and may even be deported. The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given refugee status if the person's circumstances fall into the definition of [...] "refugee" [...] according to the 1951 Refugee Convention or other refugee laws, such as the European Convention on Human Rights - if asylum is claimed within the European Union. However signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are rejected varies from country to country and year to year.|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} the priority public health challenges {{with respect to the}} development of multipurpose prevention technologies in China. Design: review of published literature, databases of state and local disease control agencies and unpublished data relating to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Setting: China. Population: general and migrant populations. Methods: review of published data, government reports and databases of China Disease Control agencies, and our unpublished studies. Main outcome measures: reported STI incidence, particularly HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and genital herpes, and the migrant population with respect to disease transmission. Results: we found that the reported STI incidence increases along with that of HIV and showed significant geographic overlap with HIV. <b>Economic</b> <b>migrant</b> workers may facilitate the spread of STIs, including HIV. Conclusions: to more effectively contain the HIV epidemic, it is imperative to develop preventive measures to simultaneously target HIV and other STIs. We recommend that the development of multipurpose prevention technologies in China should target HIV and STIs. <br/...|$|E
