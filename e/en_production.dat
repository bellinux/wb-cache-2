40|$|Summary &mdash; Several {{years ago}} we {{reported}} the occurrence of potyvirus infecting maize in southern France and in Spain and Italy, the most prevalent virus being maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) strain A. MDMV is present on dent and sweet corn mainly in areas where Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense L), the reservoir host, is abundant. The aim of our work was to obtain a good and reliable diagnostic method and to start to study the biodiversity of MDMV. We have obtained a good specific antiserum directed against the capsid protein of the virus. In 1991, we started a collec-tion now made up of more than 100 isolates from southern France, {{the northern part of}} Italy and some areas of north-ern Spain. The molecular weights of the capsid protein of all the isolates were determined by the immunoblot method. We have been able to classify the isolates in different groups. The behaviour of the isolates belonging to each group defined by Western blot was analysed by mechanical inoculation on several maize inbred lines. We have thus demon-strated a biodiversity in MDMV. This situation is important for the breeder and allows {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of inbred lines of maize in different areas. maize dwarf mosaic virus A (MDMV-A) / Zea mays L = maize / biodiversity Résumé &mdash; Diversité biologique et sérologique des potyvirus infectant le maïs en zone méditerranéenne.

Au total, 27 dispositifs d'évaluation et de démonstration ont été plantés de 2009 à 2011 dans une large gamme de milieux : les grands bassins de production du Douglas, les zones d'altitude et les marges climatiques. Ce réseau, coordonné par Irstea et qui associe l'ONF, l'INRA et le CNPF, permettra de fournir des conseils d'utilisation aux reboiseurs.

Testing those orchards will allow us to acquire information about seed orchard plasticity and performances and, ultimately, produce recommendations for use to forest owners and managers. On the whole, 27 trials were planted between 2009 to 2011 in a large range of conditions of soil and climate: i) areas where Douglas-fir is widely cultivated and should remain appropriate in the 21 st century but also ii) mountainous areas that climate change should make favourable to Douglas-fir and iii) climatic marginal areas that are expected to be unsuitable for northern varieties around 2050 or are already too harsh. Though young, the Douglas-fir seed orchard testing network has already produced useful results. In particular, the 8 varieties have been ranked for lateness of bud flushing and, thus, sensitivity to spring frost. In the long term, this network will give information on adaptability, growth and form of French improved varieties of Douglas-fir. As the trials are established in a large range of environments, the results should also provide useful information to foreign silviculturists...|$|E

40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is a {{well known}} {{allelopathic}} plant species. However, Pakistani farmers generally incorporate the sunflower residue in the soil with the aim to enhance soil fertility and organic matter. Field experiments were, therefore, carried out to evaluate the effect of sunflower residue incorporation on growth and yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and subsequent wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. For rice crop, there were four treatments viz. control, sunflower residue incorporation (RI), NPK fertilizers, and NPK+RI. Two rice varieties (Basmati Pak and Basmati Super) were cultivated. Incorporation of sunflower residue markedly reduced plant growth and yield in 'Basmati Pak'. There was 34 % reduction in yield of this variety due to RI. 'Basmati Super' was tolerant to sunflower allelopathy, where the effect of RI was generally insignificant on plant growth and grain yield. Two commonly cultivated varieties of wheat (Inqalab 91 and Punjab 96) were sown in the same plots after harvesting the rice, without any addition of either RI or NPK. In 'Punjab 96 ', the effect of RI or RI+NPK was insignificant on grain yield. In contrast, in 'Inqalab 91 ', RI in combination with NPK fertilizers significantly reduced the grain yield by 41 % as compared to NPK alone. The present study concluded that rice 'Basmati Super' and wheat 'Punjab 96 ' are suitable for cultivation under sunflower allelopathic stress.

40|$|Au cours des dix dernières années, de nombreuses méthodes ont été proposées dans la littérature, afin de mesurer l'activité des bactéries hétérotrophes en milieu aquatique. Parmi celles-ci, la mesure de l'incorporation de {{thymidine}} tritiée dans le DNA bactérien semble être, à l'heure actuelle, la méthode la plus utilisée. Elle offre, en effet, l'avantage de sa spécificité et d'un protocole expérimental simple. Néanmoins, la conversion des résultats expérimentaux <b>en</b> <b>production</b> de biomasse bactérienne pose un certain nombre de problèmes quant à l'interprétation correcte de cette méthode. Cet article fait le point sur les réponses théoriques et expérimentales qui peuvent être apportées à ces problèmes, ainsi que sur les diverses possibilités d'utilisation de cette méthode. During {{the fast}} ten years, numerous {{methods have been}} proposed in the literature to mesure the activity of heterotrophic bacteria in aquatic ecosystems. Among these methods, the measurement of tritiated thymidine incorporation proposed by FUHRMAN and AZAM (1980) seems to be, at the present time, the most useful. It offers in fact the advantage of its specificity for bacteria and its simple experimental procedure. This method {{is based on the}} fact that, in bacteria, DNA synthesis is directly proportional to the division rate. The close relation between growth and DNA synthesis means that measurement of the rate of DNA synthesis {{is a good way to}} measure the bacterial growth rate. The DNA synthesis rate is estimated from the incorporation rate of methyl- 3 H thymidine. Thymidine is one of the four nucleoside precursors of DNA, but it is not a precursor of RNA. At the nanomolar concentrations of (methyl- 3 H) thymidine used in this experiment only heterotrophic bacteria utilize exogenous thymidine and all active heterotrophic bacteria utilize thymidine. The usual experimental procedure used by the various authors working with this method is that of the FUHRMAN and AZAM (1982). A 5 nM thymidine concentration has been recommended by these authors for the marine environment, but it has been shown that in more eutrophic ecosystems higher concentrations are needed to saturate the incorporation process. In fact, the conversion of experimental data into bacterial production raises some problems. Among these, two questions are important :- Which is the relative part of exogenous and endogenous thymidine used for DNA synthesis? In other words, which is the isotopic dilution factor?- The cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) fraction collected in this experiment includes, besides DNA, proteins and RNA. As some catabolic products of thymidine could be incorporated into RNA or proteins, how mach radioactivity is really incorporated into DNA?Some theoretical and experimental answers can be given to these questions. - Comparing their results of thymidine and H 32 PO 4 = incorporation in DNA of marine bacteria, FUHRMAN and AZAM (1982) found an isotopic dilution factor in the 3 - 7 range. MORIARTY and POLLARD (1981) have proposed a kinetic approach for estimating the internal pool of thymidine but the accuracy of this method was critized by RIEMANN et al., (1982) and FUHRMAN and AZAM (1982). - Usually, in order to determine the part of radioactivity incorporated into DNA, RNA and proteins, the biochemical procedure of LURIA (1960) is used. SERVAIS et al., (1987), after testing this procedure with labelled macromolecules, have concluded that this method is not accurate for such determinations. These authors have proposed an enzymatic procedure based on the use of DNase tell breakage. With this method, they have showed important fluctuations in the percentage of thymidine incorporated into DNA from one ecosystem to another. The first authors using thymidine incorporation calculated conversion factors based on theoretical data and various assumptions to convert thymidine incorporation data into bacterial cell production. These factors were in the range of 0. 2 to 4 1018 bacteria produced per mole of thymidine incorporated in the cold TCA insoluble material. More recently, because of the uncertainty or the difficulty in estimating some of the parameters (isotopic dilution, part of thymidine incorporated into DNA, part of thymidine residues in DNA, quantity of DNA per bacterial cells) required for the calculation of the conversion factor, most of the authors have used an experimental conversion factor. It was estimated from the comparison of cell number increase and thymidine incorporation in sterilized, and reinoculated samples. These experimental conversion factors were usually in the range of 0. 5 to 10 1018 bacteria produced per mole of thymidine incorporated. The conversion of cells production into bacterial biomass production expressed in carbon - which is finally the important flux to know for the study of the first trophic levels dynamic - requires a knowledge of the average bacterial biovolume and the carbon content par unit of cell volume. The first parameters can be estimated from the observation of bacteria by epifluorescence microscopy. Most authors use 1. 2 10 - 13 gC. µm- 3 to calculate carbon content of bacteria proposed by WATSON et al., (1977). The use of the tritiated thymidine incorporation method is not limited to measure bacterial production in the water column; it is also used to measure the activity of fixed bacteria, to study the grazing of bacteria by microzooplankton and in ecotoxicological studies...|$|E
40|$|<b>En</b> <b>production</b> d'eau potable, {{la nature}} bactérienne de l'abattement du carbone organique dissous biodégradable (COOB) observé dans les filtres à charbon actif en grains (CAG) a été démontrée. les {{performances}} de fonctionnement de ce type de contacteur biologique ont été principalement étudiées sur pilotes. Dans la présente étude, elles sont vérifiées et transposées en condition d'exploitation sur une usine de production d'eau potable de la banlieue parisienne. la colonisation bactérienne du CAG a été suivie et montre que l'équilibre biologique est atteint après filtration d'environ 12500 m 3 d'eau/m 3 de CAG. Durant cette phase de colonisation, la biodégradation se substitue progressivement à l'adsorption pour abattre le COD. Après colonisation, l'efficacité des filtres biologiques, exprimée en terme d'abattement de COOB, est fonction du temps de contact quelle que soit la vitesse de filtration (dans la gamme de 2 à 18 m/h). les résultats de suivis de deux filtres sur deux ans montrent que l'efficacité a été globalement meilleure en 1989 qu'en 1990, celte différence s'explique par les fluctuations plus importantes de CODB dans l'influent en 1989. Un modèle mathématique, établi à partir des équations cinétiques des processus bactériens dans les filtres à CAG (modèle CHABROL), développé sur base d'observations antérieures, permet de simuler correcte ment les observations faites au cours de la présente étude. Avec la mesure du CODB, le modèle CHABROL constitue un outil très bien adapté pour contrôler les performances des contacteurs biologiques. Ils permettent, entre autre, de définir le temps de contact optimal de l'eau dans le filtre en fonction d'une température et d'une qualité d'eau donnée dans l'influent et d'une qualité d'eau souhaitée dans l'effluent. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In drinking water production, filtration on {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) is generally used in order to remove by adsorption the dissolved organic matter. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity of GAC is rapidly saturated and it is so necessary to regenerate the GAC. An interesting alternate has been applied in sorne treatment plants. It consists to use GAC filtration without regeneration taking benefit of {{the activity of the}} microbial community which colonize the GAC particles (RITTMANN and HUCK, 1989). In fact, this biological filtration offers the advantage to specially remove the biodegradable fraction of the dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), which is responsible for the problem of bacterial growth into the distribution networks. The bacterial nature of the BDOC removal achieved by the biological filtration on GAC has been now clearly demonstrated (SERVAIS et al. 1991) and some important results of the functioning of the se filters has been obtained in studies conducted on pilots filters (BOUILLOT et al. 1990;SERVAIS et al. 1992). These studies have for example shown that only a very small part of the bacterial biomass produced in the filter is exported with the outflow. ln the present study, biological filtration has been investigated in a full scale treatment line at Choisy-le-Roi in the Parisian suburbs and the results compared with those gained on pilot filters. The working conditions of the three GAC filters studied are presented in table 1 and compared with those of pilot filters used in a previous study conducted at Neuilly-sur-Marne (table 2). The microbial colonization has been followed in two of the filters. It lasted roughly 3 months to reach biological equilibration, it corresponds to a water volume filtrated of 12 500 m 3 per m 3 of GAC. Efficiency of the removal during this period is presented in figure 2. Progressively, biological processes take turn with adsorption (fig. 1). As already demonstrated by SERVAIS et al. (1992), the efficiency of biological filtration, calculated in percentage of BOOC removal, increases with increasing contact time whatever the filtration velocity cou Id be in the range 2 mlh to 18 m/h (fig. 3). However, the percentage of BOOC, at similar temperature, is higher in the GAC filters at Choisy-le-Roi than at Neuilly-sur-Marne. The fixed bacterial biomass is also higher at Choisy-le-Roi (average 7. 5 j. lgC/cm 3) than at Neuilly-sur-Marne (average 2 j. lC/cm 3). Following during two years the functioning of the n° 56 and 38 filters (tables 3, 4 and fig. 5, 7), it seems that the global efficiency of filtration is better in 1990 than in 1989. This can be linked to the greater fluctuations in BOOC in the influent water in 1989 than in 1990, as shown on figure 8. Fluctuations in the quality of the influent water requires a period to reach the equilibrium during which the effluent is charchacterized by a lower quality (fig. 8). This period is longer at low temperature. The mathematical model based on the kinetics of the basic microbiological processes involved in biological filtration (the CHABROL model) has been previously developed (BILLEN et al. 1992) in order to simulate the performances of the filtration. It can be used to simulate the vertical profiles of BOOC and bacterial biomass in the filters of the Choisy-le-Roi treatment plant, with modifying only one parameter in the mOdel, the average bacterial mortality "kd" (fig. 4). BOOC decreases versus empty bed contact time (EBCT) calcula¬ted by the model are presented on figure 6 for the Choisy-le-Roi and Neuilly¬sur-Marne treatment plants and for Iwo temperatures. From a management point of view, the minimum BOOC is reached for contact time between 15 and 20 minutes at Neuilly-sur-Marne, while at Choisy-le-Roi it is rather between 10 and 15 minutes. ln conclusion, BDOC measurements and CHABROL model constitute powerful tools for management and design of biological GAC filters. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
