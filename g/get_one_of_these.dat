500|$|That same year, Cooper {{made two}} films with {{director}} and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York, {{one of the}} most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called [...] "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called [...] "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his [...] "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, [...] "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> That's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other early Caribbean footballers {{included}} Walter Tull, of Barbadian descent, {{who played}} for the north London club Tottenham Hotspur in the early 20th century. Some years later, Jamaican-born Lloyd [...] "Lindy" [...] Delapenha made an impact playing for Middlesbrough between 1950–57, becoming a leading goal scorer and the first Black player {{to win a championship}} medal. However, {{it was not until the}} 1970s that African-Caribbean players began to make a major impact on the game. Clyde Best (West Ham 1969–1976), born in Bermuda, paved the way for players such as Cyrille Regis (born in French Guyana), and Luther Blissett (born in Jamaica). Blissett and Regis joined Viv Anderson to form the first wave of Black footballers to play for the England national team. Although the number of players of African-Caribbean origin in the English league was increasing far beyond proportions in wider society, when Black players represented the English national team, they still had to endure racism from a section of England supporters. When selected to play for England, Cyril Regis received a bullet through the mail with the threat: [...] "You'll <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> through your knees if you step on our Wembley turf." ...|$|E

50|$|Advice for aquarists: For algae {{control in}} the aquarium, the similar Siamese Algae Eater {{is a much better}} fish - a true algae eater without the bad habits of the Chinese Algae Eater. The Bistlenose pleco is also an {{excellent}} algae eater. For the reasons listed above, the Chinese Algae Eater should be avoided. However, it is a staple of the aquarium industry, and it is heavily promoted. <b>Getting</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> 'algae eaters' is a common beginner's mistake.|$|R

60|$|However, at last, {{after many}} secret {{disputes}} with myself, and after great perplexities about it, (for all these arguments, {{one way and}} another, struggled in my head a long time,) the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> savages into my bands, cost what it would: the next thing then was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed {{was very difficult to}} resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as the opportunity should present, let it be what it would.|$|E
50|$|Exercise {{is another}} thing to {{consider}} before <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> dogs, {{especially if you are}} not an active person or family.

50|$|Marx {{discusses}} {{the army of}} labor and the reserve army in Capital, Ch. 14, Counteracting Factors, Section IV. The Army of Labor consists in those working-class people employed in average or better than average jobs. Not every one in the working class <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> jobs. There are then four other categories where members {{of the working class}} might find themselves: the stagnant pool, the floating reserves, the latent reserve, and pauperdom. Finally, people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality, Marx refers to such people as lumpenproletariat.|$|R
60|$|But how far {{will the}} ardency of desire prompt us on? For {{notwithstanding}} the many disputes and perplexities I had with myself, I at length resolved, right or wrong, to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> savages into my hands, cost what it would, or even though I should lose {{my life in}} the attempt. Inspired with this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find out what methods I should take to answer my design: this, indeed, was so difficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any probable means to execute it: I, therefore, resolved continually to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive when the savages came on shore and to leave the rest to the event, let the opportunities offer as they would.|$|E
60|$|Reddy {{could not}} {{remember}} {{when he had been}} more hungry than he was now. Lying there behind the fallen tree, watching the fat hens walking about unsuspectingly just a little way from him, {{it seemed to him that}} he simply must rush out and catch one of them. But Reddy was smart enough to know that if he did this there would at once be such a screaming and squawking that some one would be sure to rush out from the farmhouse to find out what was going on. If he were discovered, there would be small chance for him to get another fat hen. Reddy is keen enough to make the most of an opportunity. He knew that if he could <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> hens without frightening the others, he would have a chance to get another. He might have a chance to get several in this way.|$|E
60|$|Upon this, however, I {{made this}} conclusion: that my {{only way to}} go about to attempt an escape was, to {{endeavour}} to get a savage into my possession: and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty: {{that it was impossible to}} effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the same mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now—viz. that those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile myself to for a great while. However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> savages into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity should present, let what would be.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the sound}} of that thump Chewink {{instantly}} flew up in a little tree. Then he saw Reddy Fox and began to scold. As for Reddy, he looked over towards the bramble-tangle and snarled.

[...] "I'll <b>get</b> you <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> days and pay you up for cheating me out of a breakfast."

60|$|We went on fishing. Sailfish {{would jump}} around {{us for a}} while and then they would stop. We would not see one for several minutes. It is always very {{exciting}} to be among them this way. Presently I had one take hold to run off slowly and steadily, and I let him go for fifty feet, and when I struck I tore the hook away from him. Quickly I let slack line run back to him ten or fifteen feet at a time, until I felt him take it once more. He took it rather suspiciously, I felt, and I honestly believe that I could tell that he was mouthing or chewing the bait, which made me careful to let the line run off easily to him. Suddenly he rushed off, making the reel smoke. I let him run one hundred and fifty feet and then stood up, throwing on the drag, and when the line straightened tight I tried to jerk at him as hard as the tackle would stand. As a matter of fact, however, he was going so fast and hard that he hooked himself. It is indeed seldom that I miss one when he runs like this. This fellow came up two hundred yards from the boat and slid along the water with half of his body raised, much like one of those coasting-boards I have seen bathers use, towed behind a motor-launch. He went down and came up in a magnificent sheer leap, with his broad sail shining in the sun. Very angry he was, and he reminded me of a Marlin swordfish. Next he went down, and came up again bent in a curve, with the big sail stretched again. He skittered over the water, going down and coming up, until he had leaped seven times. This was a big, heavy fish, and on the light six-ounce tip and nine-thread line I had my work cut out for me. We had to run the boat toward him so I could get back my line. Here was the advantage of having a fast boat with a big rudder. Otherwise I would have lost my fish. After some steady deep plugging he came up again and set my heart aflutter by a long surface play in which he took off one hundred yards of line and then turned, leaping straight for the boat. Fortunately the line was slack and I could throw off the drag and let him run. Slack line never bothers me when I really <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> fish well hooked. If he is not well hooked he is going to get away, anyhow. After that he went down into deep water and I had one long hour of hard work in bringing him to the boat. Six hours later he weighed fifty-eight and a half pounds, and as he had lost a good deal of blood and dried out considerably, he would have gone over sixty pounds, which, so far, is the largest sailfish I know of caught on light tackle.|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a sword was so {{valued in}} Norse society that good blades were prized by successive generations of warriors. There is even some evidence from Viking burials for the deliberate and possibly ritual [...] "killing" [...] of swords, which involved the blade being bent {{so that it}} was unusable. Because Vikings were often buried with their weapons, the [...] "killing" [...] of swords may have served two functions. A ritualistic function in retiring a weapon with a warrior, and a practical function in deterring any grave robbers from disturbing the burial in order to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> costly weapons.
