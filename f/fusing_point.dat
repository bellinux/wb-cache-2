The mountain has a unique collection of flora, being the <b>fusing</b> <b>point</b> for northern and southern types of eucalypt growth and containing many types of rainforest.

50|$|The very {{slender and}} thin, almost {{transparent}} shell has an elongate-conic shape. Its length varies between 2.9 mm and 4.5 mm. It is slightly umbilicated. The smooth whorls of the protoconch are large, {{and very much}} elevated. They are coiled to resemble a small sinistral pupa. This pupoid shape makes this species peculiar, as most species in Turbonilla have a helicoid or planorboid protoconch. It is situated obliquely upon the spire of the whorls of the teleoconch and extending considerably beyond the lateral outline of this. The 12 whorls of the teleoconch are situated rather high between the sutures, somewhat overhanging (this is particularly true of the earlier volutions), and slightly shouldered at the summit. They are ornamented by strong, oblique, rounded axial ribs, which are slightly cusped at their posterior extremity, where they show a tendency toward becoming fused at the periphery. Twenty-two of these ribs occur upon the first (this whorl is more rounded than the rest and closer ribbed), fourteen upon the second, twelve upon the fifth, sixteen upon the tenth, and twenty upon the penultimate whorl. The intercostal spaces are twice {{as wide as the}} ribs, decidedly depressed, smooth, and terminating at the <b>fusing</b> <b>point</b> of the ribs on the periphery. The summits of succeeding whorls fall somewhat anterior to the periphery of the preceding whorl and give the whorls an overhanging effect as well as a narrow smooth band between the anterior termination of the intercostal spaces and the subchanneled sutures. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded, the latter very short, marked only by faint lines of growth. The aperture is very large, almost circular in outline. The outer lip is thin, transparent, and showing the external sculpture within. The columella is thin, curved and revolute, with a slight oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a mere film of callus.|$|E

30|$|The {{situation}} becomes {{complex and}} confusing when the quadriceps tendon is viewed at different cross sections. There {{is a high}} variability regarding the <b>fusing</b> <b>point</b> of the superficial and deep intermediate layer (between 13 and 90  mm proximal to the superior base of the patella). This and the oblique orientation of the two-layered intermediate layer {{appear to be the}} major reasons for the published diversity of the architecture of the quadriceps tendon (Waligora et al. 2009; Zeiss et al. 1992). Depending on the level of transection or MRI cut one finds two, three or four layers (Fig.  3 b). Additionally, depending on the direction of the plane the corresponding layers can be complete or incomplete. An oblique transection or MRI cut could easily lead to the impression of a complex multi-layered arrangement of the quadriceps tendon. Furthermore, the aponeurosis of the vastus lateralis, can separate into two or three fiber bundles (Fig.  4) causing additional confusion. Zeiss et al. studied the MRI appearance of 52 knees with normal tendons. They described that the interpretation of the architecture of the quadriceps tendon is especially difficult in its intermediate layer. They found that the number of laminations was variable, with either two (30  %), three (56  %) or four layers (6  %). In 8  % of the knees, the laminations were barely visible (Zeiss et al. 1992).|$|E
40|$|Calcination, is {{the process}} of heating a substance, to a {{temperature}} below its <b>fusing</b> <b>point,</b> with a resultant loss of water. It {{is one of the most}} important techniques currently used to enhance the properties, and therefore value, of kaolin. The overall aim of this project was to provide a better understanding of the principles of the kaolin calcination reaction in order to enhance the efficiency, quality and sustainability of the Imerys calcining operations. This research has shown a strong correlation between the chemistry of kaolin and the colour of the calcined product. This is due to the influence of contaminant materials on the colour of the hydrous kaolin, which in turn affects the calcined material. The strongest colour influencing factor is the presence of iron, particularly if it is present on the surface of the kaolin. Surface iron is currently reduced using a reductive bleaching process. This has an improving influence on even the most contaminated kaolins, however there can be quite a lot of interbatch variability. Despite its effect on colour the chemistry of kaolin has little influence on post calcination reactivity. Reactivity is due to physical factors such as particle and agglomerate size and the penetration of heat into the material. Any kaolin will calcine to produce a low reactivity product; provided the heat is able to penetrate into the bed and that the material is able to remain at temperature for sufficient time for the calcination reaction to occur. Another outcome of the research was the discovery that a higher temperature and shorter time period has little on the end calcined product but has implications for lower energy usage...|$|E
40|$|The above {{statements}} may {{be summarized}} as follows:- a. During the consolidation of magma, various magmatic emanations are exuded, by the petrification of which ore-deposits are formed. b. A definite process of deposition of emanations determines the order of petrification, as stated in Section 3, p. 4. c. The ore-deposits of igneous origin may be classified into five divisions; magmatic segregations, contacts, replacements, mineral veins and impregnations. d. There are several kinds of igneous rocks called ore-bringers, which produced the ore-deposits by their "eruptive after-action. " e. The Japanese empire is divided from the metallogenetic point of view into five provinces, according to the difference of the ore-bringers. They are as follows:- (Table) f. The minerals in the ore-deposits in the different provinces are distributed {{in the order of}} petrification as in the following table: - (Table) As the reader will see, in the pertrification order all the minerals except calcite are found in the Provinces of Korea and Kitakami. This is because they all belong to the older veins, which means that the formation of the minerals took place in the deep, where the temperature of the emanations was very high, the petrification continuing until the emanations got entirely cool. The pyrite beds in the Besshi Province are supposed to have been emitted from the most basic rocks such as serpentine or gabbro, and therefore only the minerals of the lower position in the pertrification order are deposited there. The scantiness of quartz in the pyritic beds is explained by the basic character of the supposed ore-bringers. In the Provinces of Kosaka and Satsuma only the ore-deposits of younger formation are distributed and therefore such minerals as iron oxides or ferromagnesian silicates are never found there. Sulphides are more abundant in the Kosaka, Province than in the Satsuma Province, for the <b>fusing</b> <b>point</b> of quartz-trachyte is higher than that of andesite.

Pattern Recognition, 41 (1), 152 - 1753 D {{modelling}} finds a {{wide range}} of applications in industry. However, due to the presence of surface scanning noise, accumulative registration errors, and improper data fusion, reconstructed object surfaces using range images captured from multiple viewpoints are often distorted with thick patches, false connections, blurred features and artefacts. Moreover, the existing integration methods are often expensive in the sense of both computational time and data storage. These shortcomings limit the wide applications of 3 D modelling using the latest laser scanning systems. In this paper, the k-means clustering approach (from the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures) is employed to minimize the integration error and to optimize the <b>fused</b> <b>point</b> locations. To initialize the clustering approach, an automatic method is developed, shifting points in the overlapping areas between neighbouring views towards each other, so that the initialized cluster centroids are in between the two overlapping surfaces. This results in more efficient and effective integration of data. While the overlapping areas were initially detected using a single distance threshold, they are then refined using the k-means clustering method. For more accurate integration results, a weighting scheme reflecting the imaging principle is developed to integrate the corresponding points in the overlapping areas. The <b>fused</b> <b>point</b> set is finally triangulated using an improved Delaunay method, guaranteeing a watertight surface. A comparative study based on real images shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient in the sense of either running time or memory usage and reduces significantly the integration error, while desirably retaining geometric details of 3 D object surfaces of interest.

30|$|A {{quadriceps}} tendon graft {{may be used}} {{to reconstruct}} the anterior cruciate ligament (Crall & Gilmer 2015; Geib et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2007; Marshall et al. 1979; Slone et al. 2015), the posterior cruciate ligament (Chen et al.; Chen et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2007), the medial patellofemoral ligament (Lenschow et al. 2015; Steiner et al. 2006), the lateral collateral ligament (Chen et al. 2001) and the Achilles tendon (Arriaza et al. 2016). This autograft shares biological and mechanical properties with other grafts such as the patellar ligament or hamstrings, sometimes with superiority (Han et al. 2008). Harvesting the quadriceps tendon (with or without patellar bone) might {{have an impact on the}} function of the extensor apparatus of the knee joint as a whole. The removal of a tendon graft probably alters the delicate interplay between different layers of the extensor apparatus. Chen et al. reported that 9  % of subjects exhibited donor site pain after quadriceps graft harvesting, and the risk of occult partial rupture of the remaining quadriceps tendon may exist. Late quadriceps tendon rupture at the donor site following harvesting of a quadriceps tendon graft has been reported (Pandey et al. 2015). Loss of quadriceps muscle strength of 20  % after harvesting the quadriceps tendon graft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and prolonged weakness of knee extension strength, predominantly in women, have also been reported (Chen et al. 2006; Yasuda et al.). However, others report low donor-site morbidity when using a quadriceps tendon graft compared to a bone tendon bone graft of the patellar ligament (Gorschewsky et al. 2007; Han et al. 2008; Lund et al. 2014). The harvesting technique may also impact the outcome. For example, if the quadriceps tendon is harvested at the <b>fusing</b> <b>points</b> (Fig.  3 b) it is questionable that such a graft is suitable as a firm graft. A harvest of the quadriceps tendon medial to the <b>fusing</b> <b>points</b> of the intermediate layers violates the insertion of the vastus medialis with potential consequences on the terminal phase of extension and patellar stability (Lieb & Perry 1971; Pocock 1963; Toumi et al. 2007). On the other hand a lateral harvest of the quadriceps tendon compromises the insertion of the vastus lateralis and the tensor vastus intermedius. Based on the present anatomic findings it can be assumed that a harvest of a tendon graft lateral of the <b>fusing</b> <b>points</b> of the two-layered intermediate layer would be of better quality than a medial graft removal (Fig.  3 a). Questions arise whether a partial- or full-thickness graft should be harvested and how closure of tendon defects should be performed. Latter questions also arise with regards to parapatellar approaches to the knee joint.|$|R
40|$|As a {{fundamental}} capability for mobile robots, navigation involves multiple tasks including localization, mapping, motion planning, and obstacle avoidance. In unknown environments, a robot has {{to construct a}} map of the environment while simultaneously keeping track of its own location within the map. This is known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). For urban and indoor environments, SLAM is especially important since GPS signals are often unavailable. Visual SLAM uses cameras as the primary sensor and is a highly attractive but challenging research topic. The major challenge lies in the robustness to lighting variation and uneven feature distribution. Another challenge is to build semantic maps composed of high-level landmarks. To meet these challenges, we investigate feature fusion approaches for visual SLAM. The basic rationale is that since urban and indoor environments contain various feature types such points and lines, in combination these features should improve the robustness, and meanwhile, high-level landmarks can be defined as or derived from these combinations. We design a novel data structure, multilayer feature graph (MFG), to organize five types of features and their inner geometric relationships. Building upon a two view-based MFG prototype, we extend the application of MFG to image sequence-based mapping by using EKF. We model and analyze how errors are generated and propagated through the construction of a two view-based MFG. This enables us to treat each MFG as an observation in the EKF update step. We apply the MFG-EKF method to a building exterior mapping task and demonstrate its efficacy. Two view based MFG requires sufficient baseline to be successfully constructed, which is not always feasible. Therefore, we further devise a multiple view based algorithm to construct MFG as a global map. Our proposed algorithm takes a video stream as input, initializes and iteratively updates MFG based on extracted key frames; it also refines robot localization and MFG landmarks using local bundle adjustment. We show the advantage of our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods on multiple indoor and outdoor datasets.

Besides visual SLAM, we also study specular object avoidance, which is a great challenge for range sensors. We propose a vision-based algorithm to detect planar mirrors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{complete}} system for acquisition of <b>fused</b> (textured) <b>point</b> clouds in 3 D, from a Laser Range Finder (LRF) and a CCD camera. Furthermore, we describe an approach to build and process the resulting models, including their pre-processing and mesh simplification. This approach allows manipulating the resulting data structure into consistent geometric representations, which can be further adapted based on user requirements. The advantage of our system is that of low computational cost, ease of use and accuracy in {{the representation of the}} environment, even without prior data smoothing...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-18 mm. The forewings {{are covered}} with grey, black-tipped scales. There are paired and sometimes <b>fused</b> indistinct black <b>points</b> near the base, two black spots at one-third and two smaller black spots at two-thirds. The hindwings are light grey. Adults are on wing from June to August.|$|R
