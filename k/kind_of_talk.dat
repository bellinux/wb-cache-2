500|$|Grimsby made {{a strong}} {{challenge}} for promotion in 1951–52 but finished second, three points behind Lincoln City (only one team was promoted from Division Three North, with one from Division Three South). Shankly insisted in his autobiography that his Grimsby team was: [...] "Pound for pound, and class for class, the best football team I have seen in England since the war. In the league they were in, they played football nobody else could play. Everything was measured, planned and perfected and you could not wish to see more entertaining football". Stephen Kelly quotes the [...] "pound for pound" [...] analysis but qualifies it as [...] "another slight exaggeration, but he meant well". Kelly went on: [...] "that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> could only boost morale at the club".|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's [...] "electric" [...] {{direction}} [...] "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" [...] {{and praised}} Fassbender in the role, who [...] "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [...] he fully delivers {{the essentials of}} how {{we have come to}} perceive the man." [...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> opera", which to some might seem to be [...] "Sorkin overkill but {{the same could be said}} for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E

My father was a lawyer and was in {{partnership}} with two Jews, who with their families were close to us. There were black families in our circle of friends. My father disliked talk like Archie's—he called it lowbrow." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> in drama classrooms, particularly the ways {{students and teachers}} use different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> to achieve their classroom work and construct shared moral reasoning {{as the basis of}} their practical educational activities. The data and discussion presented here bring together the curricular setting of educational drama and the methodological setting of Conversation Analysis and Membership Categorisation Analysis. The transcripts and analyses emerged from a larger study that sought to explore the particular ways students interacted within process drama lessons dealing with future life prospects and pathways.   The identification <b>of</b> three distinct <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> has significance for education scholars, teacher-educators and teacher-practitioners as {{it has the potential to}} enable a more detailed awareness of the structure of classroom practice and the particular ways students engage with significant ideas in classroom settings.  </p...|$|R
2500|$|Stalin did {{not know}} that Hitler had been {{secretly}} discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940, [...] and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the East regardless of the parties talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis Power. [...] He had ignored German economic naysayers, and told Hermann Göring [...] "that everyone on all sides was always raising economic misgivings against a threatening war with Russia. From now onwards he wasn't going to listen to any more of that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> and from now on he was going to stop up his ears in order to get his peace of mind." [...] This was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had been preparing reports on the negative economic consequences of a Soviet invasion—that it would be a net economic drain unless it was captured intact. Given Hitler's latest demands regarding negative advice, Thomas revised his report. [...] Reich Finance Minister Schwerin-Krosigk also opposed an invasion, arguing that Germany would lose grain because of Soviet scorched-earth policies, lack of effective Soviet transport and the loss of production labor with a German attack in the East. [...] Schnurre agreed with the economic loss assessment.|$|E

"Oh, {{he has not}} {{the style}} of a captain in the army, or that sort of {{carriage}} as if everybody was beneath him, or that showy <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking,</b> and singing, and intellectual talent.

5000|$|This {{question}} is to Senator Hillary Clinton. The Arab states, Muslim nations, believe its women as being second-class citizens. If you're president of the United States, {{how do you feel}} that you would even be taken seriously by these states in any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talks,</b> negotiations, or any other diplomatic relations?

6000|$|Marianne {{looked at}} her steadily, and said, [...] "You know, Elinor, {{that this is a}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> which I cannot bear.

50|$|The term {{essentially}} contested concepts gives {{a name to}} {{a problematic}} situation that many people recognize: that in certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> there is a variety of meanings employed for key terms in an argument, {{and there is a}} feeling that dogmatism ("My answer is right and all others are wrong"), skepticism ("All answers are equally true (or false); everyone has a right to his own truth"), and eclecticism ("Each meaning gives a partial view so the more meanings the better") are none of them the appropriate attitude towards that variety of meanings.|$|R

5000|$|Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media, which informs {{parents about}} media choices for their children, gave Destiny a four-star rating out of five, stating, [...] "There {{are a few}} tense moments when a character's fate is unknown, but it's quickly {{resolved}} and holds no real scares". She added, [...] "This story's meandering pace might be a hard sell for tweens, {{but if you can}} get yours to watch with you, you'll find all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> points about relationships, overcoming challenges, and the value of strong family bonds".|$|R
5000|$|On 23 September 2014, in an {{interview}} with Melty, Orelsan attempted to explain the success of his and Gringe's debut studio album as a duo, Orelsan et Gringe sont les Casseurs Flowters, stating: [...] "It's an album that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talks</b> about everyday life, and which speaks to regular people in our age group." [...] When asked {{about the possibility of a}} third solo studio album (following Le chant des sirènes from 2011), he admitted that it was something that he had [...] "not started doing", though he promised to [...] "get on it quickly".|$|R
60|$|Harry went {{straightway}} {{from the}} interview {{to call upon}} Lillie, and {{had a conversation with}} her; in which he conducted himself like a sober, discreet, and rational man. It was one of those daylight, matter-of-fact <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talks,</b> with no nonsense about them, in which things are called by their right names. He confessed his own sins, and took upon his own shoulders the blame that properly belonged there; and, having thus cleared his conscience, took occasion to give Lillie a deal of grandfatherly advice, of a very sedative tendency.|$|R

6000|$|... "I say," [...] he said--somewhat entreatingly, [...] "I thought--you're not {{stringing}} us, are you? It isn't {{just the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> we expected. You haven't even said 'Hully gee!' once. Do you really belong on the Bowery?" ...|$|E

30|$|I {{remember}} feeling {{taken aback}} that P had begun talking before any invitation from me (in which I would usually have re-iterated {{the task of}} description and staying with the detail). Following P’s comment, I offer feedback {{in relation to a}} previously stated invitation around the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> wanted at this stage of discussion.

What we might observe is, say, children looking away or playing with items on a desk, or talking—from which it is an ‘interpretation’ that they are not paying attention.|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Arena Printing & Publishing P/LThe thesis I {{want to argue}} {{in this article is}} a simple and in some ways rather formalistic one: that textual meaning is carried by formal structures more powerfully than by explicit thematic content; that what texts do and how they are structured have greater force than what they say they are about; and that genre — by which I mean merely the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> and writing, <b>of</b> imaging and of structured sound — is perhaps the most important of the structures by which texts are organized.

He noticed the flipped SUV {{on his way home}} from Gillette Stadium, assisting an officer already at the scene. Wilfork later recounted the event and his role in helping the driver: [...] "I think anybody would do the same thing, I saw the lady in there and asked her if she was OK, could she move.
