40|$|Purpose Theoretical {{background}} In {{order to}} constantly {{meet the new}} production goals and sharpen competitive advantage, focusing on improvement continuously is becoming more important. Achieving continuous improvement through small increments is a ‘world class’ practice (Schonberger, 2010). Perhaps the Japanese Kaizen {{is one of the}} best known improvement methods to offer a cumulative character (Marin-Garcia et al., 2008), provide on-going improvement and sustained incremental innovation (Bessant and Francis, 1999). Managerial problem The importance of Kaizen is exemplified by many existing studies and its implementation steps have been well studied (Ma et al., 2010). Although it appears simple on the surface to implement and as a tool for any organisation, Kaizen has been proved to be easier said than done, and difficult to sustain it in the long-term (Marin-Garcia et al., 2008). Prior studies have suggested that the successful implementaion of Kaizen needs to be supported by shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> (Handyside, 1997) and relay on a practice that can constantly bring issues up (Medinilla, 2014). The shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> contains many tools to support improvement (Figure 1). There are four building blocks: 5 S practice (sorting, streamlining, systematic cleaning, standardisation and sustaining), waste removal, standard operations, and visual management. Quality Control Circle programmes (QCCs) is an effective practice to collect improvement and implement improvement ideas (Ma et al., 2010). Figure 1 the building block shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> tools (Bateman and Brander, 2000, p 242) Research objectives (a) to define the roles of shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> and QCCs in Kaizen (b) to provide evidence of the linkage between the 4 building block shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> tools and QCCs (c) to provide evidence of the relationship between QCCs and long-term Kaizen (Figure 2) Methodology A survey is used in this study. In total, 371 valid samples are collected. The questionnaire is developed based on previous research to measure the implementation of the shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> tools (Soriano-Meier, 2002, Rahman, 2001, Terziovski and Sohal, 2000), the QCCs (Lillrank and Kano, 1989) and the improvement outcomes (Doolen et al., 2008, Farris et al., 2009). The study conducted canonical correlation analyses (CCA) to investigate and illustrates the relationships (Figure 3 and 4). CCA is a technique to test the significance of the correlations between one set of multiple dependent variables and a second set of multiple independent variables. It can also determine which variables are the most important (canonical loading > 0. 30) in a given pair of canonical variates. Findings The Table 1 shows that the canonical correlation between the 4 shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> tools and QCCs implementing measures was statistically significant. The results also indicated that the 5 S Practice and Standard Operations were significantly and positively correlated with QCC Meeting and QCC Presentation. These may appear to disagree with some of the previous studies (Bateman and Brander, 2000), as not all of the four building block tools support the QCCs implementation. The Table 2 shows that there are two significant canonical correlations between the QCCs implementing measures and improvement outcomes. For the first canonical pair, QCC Meeting and QCC Presentation were significantly and positively correlated with Shop Floor Performance and Improvement Knowledge. Where for the second canonical pair, QCC Meeting and QCC Presentation were also significantly and positively correlated with Shop Floor Performance but negatively correlated with Improvement Knowledge. These findings are in line with some previous studies in showing that QCCs could involve short-term holistic shop floor changes and enhance improvement participants’ problem-solving capabilities (Liker and Hoseus, 2008, Rapp and Eklund, 2002), but necessarily affect their senses of future improvement participations (Marin-Garcia et al., 2008). Contributions This study has three theoretical contributions: a) developing generic models for examining the relationships between shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> and Kaizen; b) providing evidence to determine the significance/goodness of fit of the models; and c) indicating that shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> implementation could provide a framework to maintain shop floor orders and discipline, hence, lead to the continuous improvement. Practical implications are also threefold: a) the shop <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> tools should be implemented regularly not only to eliminate waste and reduce variations in the standard operations, but also to initiate long-term improvement; b) it is feasible to apply QCCs to collect improvement ideas/ information to support Kaizen; however, c) more efforts may be needed to motivate employees to participate in future improvement activities...|$|E
40|$|Orchard <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> {{is vital}} to tree health, yield, and fruit quality. Current {{standard}} management practices include maintaining a vegetation-free tree row and a grass-covered alleyway. This system is effective at limiting competition from undesirable vegetation and creating a favorable environment for the fruit trees. However, limitations to standard orchard floor practices are that the grass alleyway provides no nutrient benefit, and current practices do not readily lend themselves to organic management constraints. Alternative in-row and alleyway systems are requisite to creating improved orchard <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> systems. Three different approaches were used to investigate alternative orchard <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> strategies, including: alternative in-row weed control with combinations of mulch and organic herbicides, alternative alleyway management with legume cover crops, and combinations of in-row and alleyway alternative strategies. Although organic in-row weed control was best accomplished with combinations of straw and acetic acid, this management approach was not economically viable at current costs of labor and supplies, and current fruit prices. Alfalfa and alfalfa clover treatments contributed the most aboveground biomass and nitrogen among alternative alleyway covers, but consumed 45 % more water than the conventional grass alleyway. In combinations of in-row and alleyway alternatives, birds-foot trefoil alleyway had a beneficial effect on tree growth compared to grass, while consuming {{the greatest amount of}} water. Peach yields were the highest for the integrated compost and NPK fertility treatments that used herbicides to minimize competition. Treatments that experienced the most competition from weeds, no herbicide and reduced herbicide treatments, resulted in lower yields. Weed fabric and tillage in-row weed control methods resulted in the highest tree growth as compared to the straw and alyssum treatments. Finally, results from the combined studies were integrated into a series of recommendations for commercial fruit growers. While alternatives to orchard <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> show a number of potential benefits for growers in the Intermountain West, additional work is needed to determine the long-term viability of these approaches...|$|E

The effect of these management practices on the emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from vineyards is not well understood and most prior studies were short-term (< 1 year). To investigate longer-term effects, a {{study was conducted in}} grape (Vitus vinifera L. cv. Merlot planted in a sandy loam soil in British Columbia, Canada. The experiment was a factorial treatment design consisting of two micro-irrigation types (Drip or Micro-sprinkler), two nitrogen sources (surface applied Compost or fertigated Urea at a rate of 40 kgNha− 1), and two vineyard <b>floor</b> <b>managements</b> (bark Mulch or “Clean”—meaning bare soil). Frequent measurements of N 2 O flux and soil and environmental variables were made over two complete years (2013 and 2014). A considerable portion (37 % in 2013 and 61 % in 2014) of the annual cumulative N 2 O emission (ΣN 2 O) occurred during the pre-growing season particularly within the thaw period. In 2013, the annual area-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions for Drip was ≈ 1. 8 ×Micro-sprinkler, Urea was ≈ 1. 5 ×Compost and Clean was ≈ 1. 7 ×Mulch. In 2014, ΣN 2 O emissions were over 14 % higher, likely due to more freeze–thaw events, higher soil mineral N availability (47 % higher), but treatments differences were not significantly different. Analysed over two years, micro-sprinkler reduced growing season emissions by 29 % and surface application of bark mulch decreased annual area-scaled and yield-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions by 28 % and 23 %, respectively, suggesting bark mulch as a strategy for mitigating N 2 O emission. The observed interannual variability in the total N 2 O emissions suggests that at least a minimum of 2 years of continuous study may be required to estimate representative annual N 2 O emission budgets and to recommend N 2 O mitigation strategies in vineyard systems...|$|R

In this paper it will be presented data from 2013 growing season (four seasons after experiment setup). The volumetric soil moisture, assessed with a capacitance probe to a 1. 5 m depth, showed a decreasing pattern throughout the growing season in all treatments with the resident vegetation presenting lower values as compared to the tillage treatment, while no significant differences were observed between the two undervine <b>floor</b> <b>management</b> practices. From budburst to flowering the resident vegetation treatment showed a higher soil water depletion (up to 1. 5 m depth) than the tillage treatment but the relative situation was reversed during the flowering-veraison period, while no significant differences were observed during the ripening period. Vine stem water potential values showed a decreasing pattern along the season attaining very low values during September but with no significant differences between treatments. In general the soil management practices did not significantly affect vine vigor, yield and berry composition however, since these results are only from one season, further data analysis in ongoing in order to allow stronger conclusions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
