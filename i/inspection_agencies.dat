50|$|The United States Grain Standards Act (USGSA) of 1916(P.L. 64-190), {{as amended}} (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq.), authorizes the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration to {{establish}} official marketing standards (not {{health and safety}} standards) for grains and oilseeds, and requires that exported grains and oilseeds be officially weighed and inspected. Domestically marketed grain and oilseeds may be, but {{are not required to}} be, officially inspected. Export inspections are carried out by federal inspectors or by federally supervised state <b>inspection</b> <b>agencies,</b> called delegated official <b>inspection</b> <b>agencies.</b> Official inspections of domestically traded grain is done by federally supervised state agencies and private companies, called designated official <b>inspection</b> <b>agencies.</b> Typically, marketing standards describe the physical characteristics (such as weight, damaged kernels, foreign material, shrunken and broken kernels, and defects) of the commodity and serve as contract language to facilitate marketing. Official weighing and inspection is paid for on a fee-for service basis, not with federal funds. Major changes to the law were adopted in the USGSA Amendments of 1968, the USGSA of 1976 (P.L. 94-582), and the Grain Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-641).|$|E

50|$|GIPSA's Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) {{establishes}} the Official Standards for Grain, {{which are used}} each day by sellers and buyers to communicate the type and quality of grain bought and sold. FGIS also establishes standard testing methodologies to accurately and consistently measure grain quality. Finally, the program provides for the impartial application of these grades and standards through a network of federal, state, and private <b>inspection</b> <b>agencies</b> known as the official system. The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) was established by Congress in 1976 to manage the national grain inspection system, which was established in 1916, and to institute a national grain weighing program. The goal of creating a single federal grain inspection entity was to ensure development and maintenance of uniform U.S. standards, to develop inspection and weighing procedures for grain in domestic and export trade, and to facilitate grain marketing.|$|E

The Center was established in November 1992, and has been launched its work around 1990, {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China. Afterwards, the CGFDC joined the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements(IFOAM)in 1993.The center of headquarter is located in Beijing includes general office and divisions of logo management, authentication, sci-tech and standard, planning and finance and international cooperation etc..Currently,it has set up 42 local food regulatory agencies,commissioned the 38 quality <b>inspection</b> <b>agencies,</b> and 71 green food producing environmental monitoring branches. Its basic purpose is to promote the development of food with safety and nature, to protect the ecological environment and to maintain the development of economy and society. Its mainly responsibilities include：developing Green Food generation policies, regulations and planning organizations to develop green food standards, organizing and guiding the development and management of Green Food; trademark green logo management, review, approve green flag products; commissioned and coordinating the work of local agencies and green environment and product quality monitoring; organize research, technology promotion, training, advocacy, information services, green building demonstration bases, as well as foreign economic and technological exchanges and cooperation. The main partners consist of some organizations namely China Organic Food Certification Center（abbreviated COFCC）,State Food and Nutrition Consultant Committee, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and Development Research Center of the State Council as well as some media networks as supporters. It has already published couples reports named" [...] Green Food Products Bulletin","Green Fashion",and [...] "Brief Report of the Center"to the public. The CGFDC oversees two Green Food Standards: A (which allows some use of synthetic agricultural chemicals) and AA (which is more stringent, allowing less use of such chemicals, and is consequently less popular with agricultural producers). Both standards focus on the end product rather than the process, and do not generally monitor actual use of agricultural chemicals, preferring instead to test the products themselves for chemical residues. Green Food thus provides farmers with a steeped path way from chemical farming, to Green Food Grade A through to organic certification.Also,the China Green Food Development Center demonstrates the genesis of Green Food :"China's Green Food development is the outcome of actively exploring new ways of food production and consumption based on China's own situation and in line with the international trend of sustainable development. The statistics show an increase of 7 percent of green food enterprises which up to 6400 compared with the data of 2009 from the China Green Food Development Center.And the China's Green Food has launched high quality through the supervising of CGFDC.|$|E
