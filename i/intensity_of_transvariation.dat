40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} shape <b>of</b> the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> steel use and to test if it {{exhibits}} an inverted U-shaped form as the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> use hypothesis suggests. This hypothesis states that the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> metal use in a country is related to its economic development. This thesis also investigates if high, middle and low income countries affect the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> steel use differently. The theoretical framework used in this thesis is the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> use hypothesis. Two variations <b>of</b> the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> steel use model were tested empirically through Ordinary Least Squares regressions. They were tested on data from 61 countries under the period 1970 to 2004.

This implies that the industrialised high income countries are those who have led the development and followed the shape <b>of</b> the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> use curve during this period of time, but the developing countries are believed to follow.
