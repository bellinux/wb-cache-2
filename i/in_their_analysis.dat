5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, the poem {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is {{currently}} {{one of four}} living species in the genus Triaenops; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African T.afer and the Yemeni T.parvus from T.persicus and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus Paratriaenops. An extinct species, Triaenops goodmani, is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used phylogenetic and coalescent methodologies to investigate {{the history of the}} Triaenops group. They found that T.menamena (as T.rufus) was closest to mainland African Triaenops (but did not study Middle Eastern bats) and concluded that T.menamena and the species of Paratriaenops (then still placed in Triaenops) independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by T.menamena was dated to about 660,000 years ago. Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in Triaenops and included Middle Eastern T.persicus and T.parvus <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>analysis.</b> They found little resolution of relationships within Triaenops, but some evidence suggested that T.menamena is more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to T.afer in mainland Africa; therefore, T.menamena may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between T.menamena and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeat of}} the {{plebiscite}} came as a great surprise to most commentators because few had predicted that it would fail. The Labor movement, and the 'anti' cause in general, had fought under many disadvantages, and the 'yes' campaign had most of the media, many major public institutions, {{and many of the}} state governments on its side. Supporters of the referendum were circumspect <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> of the result, noting that only a few percentage points and fewer than 75,000 voters had separated the results.

25|$|In 1825 John Limbird was {{interested}} in founding a Mechanics' Newspaper with Robertson. The project was diverted by the intervention of John Gast's committee, becoming the Trades Newspaper of 1825 to 1827.

In radical politics, Robertson and Hodgskin actually differed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>analysis.</b> When Labour Defended, Hodgskin's landmark pamphlet, was reviewed in the Newspaper in 1825, there was a note of dissent from Robertson on fixed capital.

25|$|Hughes {{accepted}} {{the decision of}} the voters, despite calls from some newspapers and supporters to push ahead with the introduction of conscription regardless of the result. The men who had been called up and whom had reported would be free to return home upon a month of training. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> of the failure of the poll, Hughes and Pearce calculated that, assuming a consistent bloc of support from the Commonwealth Liberal Party, about half of the Labor movement had stuck with Hughes at the polls, and half had defected to defeat the referendum, in concert with other narrower demographic groups such as farmers, pacifists and the Irish. Through the operations of his colleagues during the two-week interlude between the failure of the vote and the break-up of the party, Hughes was aware that the Labor Party was conspiring to rid themselves of him at the first opportune moment, presumably after the settlement of the coalminers' industrial dispute.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 the General Conference {{in world}} session voted not to {{establish}} a worldwide policy permitting the ordination of women, {{but they did not}} vote a policy forbidding such either. In 1995 GC delegates voted not to authorize each of the 13 world divisions to establish ordination policies specific to its part of the world. In 2010, the North American Division of the church voted to allow commissioned pastors to lead a Conference or Mission, as well as ordained ones. In 2011, the North American Division, without GC approval, voted to permit women to serve as conference presidents. In early 2012, the GC responded to the NAD action with an analysis of church history and policy, demonstrating that divisions do not have the authority to establish policy different from GC policy. The NAD immediately rescinded their action. But <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>analysis</b> the GC reminded the world membership that the “final responsibility and authority” for deciding who is ordained resides at the union level.
