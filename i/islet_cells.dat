40|$|Among 77 {{patients}} with endogenous hyperinsulinism seen in 2 medical centers, diffuse <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> disease accounted for 17 (22 %) patients. Since diffuse <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> disease poses spe-cial problems in management, its prevalence is empha-sized in this report. Among these {{patients with}} diffuse <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> disease, there were 11 patients with adenomatosis, 4 with nesidioblas-tosis, and 2 with <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia.

50|$|Pancreatic <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> tumors {{occur in}} 60 to 70% of patients. Tumors are usually multicentric.

25|$|Normal glucose {{homeostasis}} {{is controlled by}} three interrelated processes. These processes include gluconeogenesis (glucose production that occurs in the liver), uptake and utilization of glucose by the peripheral tissues of the body, and insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> The presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas' beta <b>islet</b> <b>cells.</b> The main function of insulin {{is to increase the}} rate of transport of glucose from the bloodstream into certain cells of the body, such as striated muscles, fibroblasts, and fat cells. It also is necessary for transport of amino acids, glycogen formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, triglyceride formation from glucose, nucleic acid synthesis, and protein synthesis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Islet</b> <b>cell</b> {{transplantation}} is {{categorized as}} a β-cell replacement therapy for diabetic patients who lack {{the ability to}} secrete insulin. Allogeneic <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is {{for the treatment of}} type 1 diabetes, and autologous <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is for the prevention of surgical diabetes after a total pancreatectomy. The issues of allogeneic <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation include poor efficacy of islet isolation, the need for multiple donor pancreata, difficulty maintaining insulin independence and undesirable side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. Those issues have been solved step by step and allogeneic <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is almost ready to be the standard therapy. The donor shortage will be the next issue and marginal and/or living donor <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation might alleviate the issue. Xeno-islet cell transplantation, β-cell regeneration from human stem cells and gene induction of the naïve pancreas represent the next generation of β-cell replacement therapy. Autologous <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation after total pancreatectomy for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain is the standard therapy, even though only limited centers are able to perform this treatment. Remote center autologous <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is an attractive option for hospitals performing total pancreatectomies without the proper islet isolation facilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of a}} normal childhood population identified 44 <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibody positive individuals. These subjects were typed for HLA DR and DQ alleles and investigated {{for the presence of}} antibodies to the Mr 64, 000 (64 K) <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antigen, complement-fixing <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies and radiobinding insulin autoantibodies to determine their potency in detecting subjects with impaired Beta-cell function. At initial testing 64 K antibodies were found in six of 44 <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibody positive subjects (13. 6 %). The same sera were also positive for complement-fixing <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies and five of them had insulin autoantibodies. During the follow-up at 18 months, <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies remained detectable in 50 % of the subjects studied. In all six cases who were originally positive, 64 K antibodies were persistently detectable, whereas complement-fixing <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies became negative in two of six and insulin autoantibodies in one of five individuals. HLA DR 4 (p < 0. 005) and absence of asparic acid (Asp) at position 57 of the HLA DQ chain (p < 0. 05) were significantly increased in subjects with 64 K antibodies compared with control subjects. Of 40 individuals tested in the intravenous glucose tolerance test, three had a first phase insulin response below the first percentile of normal control subjects. Two children developed Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus after 18 and 26 months, respectively. Each of these subjects was non-Asp homozygous and had persistent <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> and 64 K antibodies. We conclude that 64 K antibodies, complement-fixing <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies and insulin autoantibodies represent sensitive serological markers in assessing high risk for a progression to Type 1 diabetes in <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> antibody positive non-diabetic individuals. ...|$|R
40|$|People {{with type}} 1 {{diabetes}} have normal exocrine pancreatic function, making <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> rather than whole organ transplantation an attractive option. Achieving insulin independence in {{type 1 diabetes}} was the perceived goal of <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation. The success of the Edmonton group in achieving this in a selected group of type 1 patients has led to renewed optimism that this treatment could eventually replace whole organ pancreas transplantation.

25|$|Motivated by his {{personal}} experience with the disease, Ommaya focused {{on the problem of}} transplantation of <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> for the treatment of diabetes. A major challenge facing survival of <b>islet</b> <b>cells</b> is immune rejection. Ommaya thought that the CSF would provide an ideal setting for transplanted islets due to the immune protection provided by the blood-brain barrier. He developed an artificial organ which would house transplanted islets, and the cells could be nourished by the CSF. Ayub, Illani Atwater, and colleagues identified that ventricular-peritoneal CSF shunts provided an immune protected site for the transplantation of mouse and rat islets in dogs and llamas. Ayub and colleagues also identified that CSF glucose mirrors blood glucose. Islets cells were able to survive in this system and function in the llama model, but further work on the model is needed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sixteen primary {{pancreatic}} tumors {{were found}} in a retrospective study of bovine pancreatic lesions detected in slaughtered cattle. Eleven <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> tumors and three pancreatic exocrine Carcinomas were identified based on light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Nine of 1 1 <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> tumors were classified as malignant. Metastatic sites included iliac, mediastinal, hepatic, and mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneum, mesentery, and liver. Six cows with multiple <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> tumors also had pheochromocytomas. All 1 1 <b>islet</b> <b>cell</b> tumors had positive immunoreactivity to insulin and somatostatin. Three tumors also contained cells immunoreactive for glucagon and two tumors contained pancreatic polypeptide immunoreactive cells. Immunoreactivity of tumor cells in metastatic sites was similar to their respective primary tumors. All exocrine pancreatic carcinomas metastasized widely and were immunonegative for insulin, somatostatin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide. No mixed endocrine*xocrine tumors were identified. None of the endocrine or exocrine tumors contained amyloid. Additional primary tumors of the bovine pancreas included one neurofibroma and one neurofibrosarcoma. Additional cases with lesions of the bovine pancreas included nodular hyperplasia in 15 cows, exocrine acinar atrophy and fibrosis in four cows (two of which also had pancreatic lithiasis), pancreatitis in one cow, peripan-creatic fibrosis in two cows, pancreatic steatosis in one animal, and pancreatic hemorrhages in one cow.
