5|$|A 1990 study {{claimed that}} <b>diazepam</b> {{has a higher}} misuse {{potential}} relative to other benzodiazepines, and that some data suggests that alprazolam and lorazepam resemble <b>diazepam</b> in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and <b>diazepam</b> are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, <b>diazepam</b> due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal <b>diazepam</b> or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are usually}} {{administered}} orally; however, very occasionally lorazepam or <b>diazepam</b> {{may be given}} intravenously {{for the treatment of}} panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{report of}} her autopsy was {{released}} in December 2016. Laurer died on April 20 of an overdose of alcohol, combined with the anxiety drugs <b>diazepam</b> and nordazepam, painkillers oxycodone and oxymorphone, and sleeping aid temazepam.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{cross the}} placenta, enter the fetus, {{and are also}} {{excreted}} in breast milk. Chronic administration of <b>diazepam,</b> another benzodiazepine, to nursing mothers {{has been reported to}} cause their infants to become lethargic and to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Long-acting {{compounds}} have a half-life of 40–250 hours. They have {{a risk of}} accumulation in {{the elderly}} and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, {{but they have a}} reduced severity of rebound effects and withdrawal. Examples are <b>diazepam,</b> clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide, and flurazepam.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as <b>diazepam</b> and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to <b>diazepam</b> and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|In Metal Gear Solid, Sniper Wolf is {{a member}} of FOXHOUND and an elite sniper capable of going without food and staying still for up to a week. She {{typically}} forms an emotional connection with her targets before killing them with her favoured weapon, the Heckler & Koch PSG1, and uses mercury-tipped hollow-point bullets to poison her victims. She is also addicted to the drug <b>diazepam.</b>|$|E
5|$|The list of benzodiazepines {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed {{for the treatment of}} insomnia varies between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and <b>diazepam</b> have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and <b>diazepam.</b> The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as <b>diazepam</b> and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, she {{was accused}} of using drugs, {{including}} oxycodone, <b>diazepam</b> and Vicodin (hydrocodone/APAP) without valid prescriptions. Ryder was convicted of grand theft, shoplifting and vandalism but was acquitted on the third felony charge, burglary. In December 2002, she was sentenced to three years' probation, 480 hours of community service, $3,700 in fines, and $6,355 in restitution to the Saks Fifth Avenue store and ordered to attend psychological and drug counseling. After reviewing Ryder's probation report, Superior Court Judge Elden Fox noted that Ryder served 480hours of community service and on June 18, 2004, the felonies were reduced to misdemeanors. Ryder remained on probation until December 2005.|$|E
5|$|Geneva and {{the nearby}} French {{department}} of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN, dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), <b>diazepam</b> (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, <b>diazepam,</b> secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and <b>diazepam</b> {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, <b>diazepam,</b> and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines <b>diazepam</b> (Valium) and {{oxazepam}} (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was <b>diazepam</b> (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of <b>diazepam</b> {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. <b>Diazepam</b> and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but <b>diazepam</b> may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him <b>Diazepam.</b> A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. <b>Diazepam</b> may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to <b>diazepam</b> in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and <b>diazepam,</b> because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as <b>diazepam.</b> This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, <b>diazepam,</b> clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of <b>diazepam</b> before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as <b>diazepam</b> or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; <b>diazepam</b> should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered <b>diazepam</b> in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as <b>diazepam</b> or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diazepam</b> binds {{with high}} {{affinity}} to glial cells in animal cell cultures. <b>Diazepam</b> at high doses {{has been found}} to decrease histamine turnover in mouse brain via diazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex. <b>Diazepam</b> also decreases prolactin release in rats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diazepam</b> {{is a drug}} of {{potential}} abuse and can cause drug dependence. Urgent action by national governments has been recommended to improve prescribing patterns of benzodiazepines such as <b>diazepam.</b> A single dose of <b>diazepam</b> modulates the dopamine system in similar ways to how morphine and alcohol modulate the dopaminergic pathways.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous <b>diazepam</b> or {{lorazepam}} are first-line {{treatments for}} status epilepticus. However, intravenous lorazepam has advantages over intravenous <b>diazepam,</b> including {{a higher rate}} of terminating seizures and a more prolonged anticonvulsant effect. <b>Diazepam</b> gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures. <b>Diazepam</b> is rarely used for the long-term treatment of epilepsy because tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects usually develops within six to 12 months of treatment, effectively rendering it useless for that purpose.|$|E
