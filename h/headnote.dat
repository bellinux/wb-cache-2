5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a <b>headnote</b> or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this <b>headnote</b> (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any <b>headnote</b> or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

[...] In the classical Noh play Izutsu, an adaptation by Zeami Motokiyo of [...] from The Tales of Ise, portrays Narihira and Ki no Aritsune's daughter as childhood playmates who eventually marry; Narihira is unfaithful to his wife, and her pining spirit appears to a monk after their deaths.|$|E

2500|$|He {{stopped in}} Venice {{for a month}} and {{experienced}} various operates and other theatrical and musical events. Venice also showed him a Republican form of government that he later admired as promoting freedom. While in Italy, Milton's childhood friend, Diodati, had died. Milton composed an elegy in memory of Diodati, and included a <b>headnote</b> saying that they [...] "had pursued the same studies" [...] and that they were the [...] "most intimate friends from childhood on". It took Milton seven months in all to return finally to England, with the trip extended from Venice as he visited Giovanni Diodati, his friend's uncle, in Geneva. There he encountered Calvinism in power and another model republic. He was introduced to the various scholars and theologians of the region. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving in England in either July or August 1639.|$|E

5000|$|The Lawyers' Edition {{differs from}} the {{official}} reporter in that the editors write <b>headnotes</b> and case summaries, {{as well as provide}} annotations to some cases, and decisions are published far in advance of the official reporter. As such, it is similar to West's unofficial Supreme Court Reporter (S. Ct.). Lawyers' Edition case reports differ from Supreme Court Reporter case reports in three respects. First, coverage in Supreme Court Reporter does not begin until Johnson v. Waters, 108 U.S. 4 (1882), while Lawyers' Edition covers opinions back to the first volume of United States Reports. Second, while both reporters contain <b>headnotes</b> written by the reporters' editors, the Lawyers' Edition <b>headnotes</b> are not keyed to the West American Digest System's topic and key number system. Third, Lawyers' Edition historically included analytical articles, referred to as [...] "annotations", similar to those contained in American Law Reports.|$|R

2500|$|After his death, Purcell was honoured {{by many of}} his contemporaries, {{including}} his old friend John Blow, who wrote An Ode, on the Death of Mr. Henry Purcell (Mark how the lark and linnet sing) with text by his old collaborator, John Dryden. William Croft's 1724 setting for the Burial Service, {{was written in the}} style of [...] "the great Master". Croft preserved Purcell's setting of [...] "Thou knowest Lord" [...] (Z 58) in his service, for reasons [...] "obvious to any artist"; it has been sung at every British state funeral ever since. More recently, the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote a famous sonnet entitled simply [...] "Henry Purcell", with a <b>headnote</b> reading: [...] "The poet wishes well to the divine genius of Purcell and praises him that, whereas other musicians have given utterance to the moods of man's mind, he has, beyond that, uttered in notes the very make and species of man as created both in him and in all men generally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Intrigued by one {{of these}} poems, Melville began to rework the <b>headnote,</b> {{expanding}} it first as a short story and eventually as a novella. He worked on it {{on and off for}} several years, but when he died in September 1891, the piece was unfinished. Also left unpublished were another volume of poetry, Weeds and Wildings, and a sketch, [...] "Daniel Orme." [...] To Billy Budd, his widow added notes and edited it, but the manuscript was not discovered until 1919, by Raymond Weaver, his first biographer. He worked at transcribing and editing a full text, which he published in 1924 as Billy Budd, Sailor. It was an immediate critical success in England and soon one in the United States. The authoritative version was published in 1962, after two scholars studied the papers for several years. In 1951 it was adapted as a stage play on Broadway, and as an opera by English composer Benjamin Britten with assistance on the libretto by E.M. Forster. In 1961 Peter Ustinov released a movie based on the stage play and starring Terence Stamp.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was also}} in the Gilded Age that a ruling by the Supreme Court {{included}} <b>headnotes</b> written by John C.Bancroft, a former railway company president. Bancroft, acting as court reporter, indicated in the <b>headnotes</b> that corporations were [...] "persons", while the actual court decision itself avoided specific statements regarding the Equal Protection Clause as applied to corporations. However, the legal concept of corporate personhood predates the Fourteenth Amendment. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Clause was used to strike down numerous statutes applying to corporations. Since the New Deal, however, such invalidations have been rare.|$|R
