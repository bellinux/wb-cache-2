2500|$|In April 2012 {{a special}} edition jar in {{commemoration}} of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II was released. With the product renamed [...] "Ma'amite," [...] the redesigned label featured a colour scheme based upon the Union Jack; the marmite and spoon logo replaced by a gold crown, and with a red rather than yellow cap. The <b>front</b> <b>label</b> also declares [...] "Made with 100% British Yeast". Coinciding with the 110th anniversary of the brand, production was limited to 300,000 jars. For Christmas 2012 a gold limited edition was launched, containing edible gold-coloured flecks.|$|E
2500|$|Rioja red {{wines are}} {{classified}} into four categories. The first, simply labeled Rioja, is the youngest, spending {{less than a}} year in an oak aging barrel. [...] A crianza is wine aged for at least two years, at least one of which was in oak. Rioja Reserva is aged for at least three years, of which at least one year is in oak. Finally, Rioja Gran Reserva wines have been aged at least two years in oak and three years in bottle. Reserva and Gran Reserva wines are not necessarily produced each year. Also produced are wines in a semi-crianza style, those that have had a couple of months oak influence but not enough to be called a full crianza. The designation of crianza, Reserva etc. might not always appear on the <b>front</b> <b>label</b> but may appear on a neck or back label {{in the form of a}} stamp designation known as Consejo.|$|E
40|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{has begun}} the {{implementation}} of a new <b>front</b> package <b>labelling</b> system for packaged food products. Despite calls from various health groups advocating for a mandatory <b>front</b> package <b>labelling</b> system, the Commonwealth opted for a voluntary system that relies on the goodwill of individual companies for its implementation. In discussing Australia’s obesity epidemic that has given rise to a need for <b>front</b> package <b>labelling,</b> this paper examines the constitutionality of mandatory <b>front</b> package <b>labelling</b> requirements. It argues that as the Commonwealth Government has the requisite jurisdiction to make the system mandatory it should forego voluntary implementation in favour of a mandatory system...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies show that {{consumers}} {{are willing to pay}} premiums for GM-Free foods. In this paper, we examine the effect, if any, that GM-Free messages have on product selection by the consumer. We made sample products which differed {{in the use of the}} labels and conducted two experiments: a choice experiment and a memory recall experiment. The result of our choice experiment demonstrates that the consumer who shows general concern about GM foods without relevant biotech knowledge responds to GM-Free messages on <b>front</b> <b>labels.</b> On the other hand, the result of our memory recall experiment shows that the consumer with relevant biotech knowledge uses the product information on back labels. Thus, firms can positively influence the product selection of biotech un-savvy consumers by placing GM-Free message on <b>front</b> <b>labels.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The left {{attempted}} a comeback following the disastrous {{experience of the}} UDP years. Headed by Antonio Aranibar's Free Bolivia Movement, the left grouped into a broad <b>front</b> <b>labelled</b> the United Left (IU). The IU brought together splinter factions of the MIR, the Socialist Party-1, and the Communist Party, and it counted on the support of organized labor, especially the COB. Given the historical divisions within the Bolivian left, however, the IU was not perceived {{to be a serious}} contender. If it could maintain unity beyond the 1989 elections, observers believed that its impact might be greater than anticipated.|$|R
5000|$|On December 18, 1907, owner Taylor {{announced}} that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color.

For the 1908 season, the AL team shirts featured a red stocking across the <b>front</b> <b>labeled</b> [...] "BOSTON". They also wore red stockings, along with white caps. Meanwhile, for 1908, the NL team returned to wearing red stockings as well as red caps, while retaining the old-English [...] "B". So the primary visual {{differences between the two}} teams' uniforms in 1908 were the caps and the shirt fronts.|$|R

50|$|The Italian Communist Party of the Julian March (Partito comunista italiano della Venezia Giulia, {{abbreviated}} PCIVG) was {{a communist}} {{organization in the}} Julian March. The group was founded as the Italian Communist Front (Fronte comunista italiano) in Gorizia in February 1946, following a split from the Communist Party of the Julian March (PCRG). The founders of Italian Communist Front rejected the pro-Yugoslav position of the PCRG and adhered to the line issued by Palmiro Togliatti at the fifth congress of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) (i.e. that Trieste should be integrated in Italy, not Yugoslavia). The Italian Communist <b>Front</b> <b>labelled</b> PCRG as 'provocateurs' and 'secessionists'.|$|R
