Writing about the town of Hustisford, Wisconsin, <b>Jennifer</b> <b>Ludden</b> discusses Mel Grulke, who was born in 1941, with German his first language at home; [...] "Grulke's great-grandparents immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1880s, yet three generations later, his farmer parents still spoke German at home, attended German language church services and chatted in German with shopkeepers when they brought their farm eggs into town to sell". Bethany Lutheran Church in Hustisford offered German-language services into the 1970s. Homer Rudolf, a man from North Dakota of German Russian descent, stated in 2004 that his maternal grandmother, who died in 1980 at the age of 90, [...] "did not learn English". As recently as 1990, one quarter of North Dakota's households included a German speaker.|$|E
