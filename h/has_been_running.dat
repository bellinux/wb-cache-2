5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>running</b> much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already {{the supply of}} high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's output by about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E
