25|$|DT {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from alcoholic <b>hallucinosis,</b> the latter of which occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized alcoholics and does not carry a significant mortality. In contrast, DT occurs in 5–10% of alcoholics and carries up to 15% mortality with treatment and up to 35% mortality without treatment. DT {{is characterized by the}} presence of altered sensorium; that is, a complete hallucination without any recognition of the real world. DT has extreme autonomic hyperactivity (high pulse, blood pressure, and rate of breathing), and 35-60% of patients have a fever. Some patients experience seizures.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common cause}} of {{psychotic}} symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve {{after a period of}} observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency room, as it is a long term condition. Both acute alcohol intoxication as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions. Acting as a depressant of the central nervous system, the early effects of alcohol are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete anesthesia of the respiratory system. Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual hallucinations, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic alcoholics may also suffer from alcoholic <b>hallucinosis,</b> wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. Antipsychotics are often used to treat these symptoms.|$|E

[...] He also stated, [...] "We flirt with various tempos mixing death metal with grindcore and almost outright black metal atmosphere together with more, so to speak, 'crowd-puller' beats verging on groovy, almost stoner-rock climates. There are also a few more modern metal rhythmic riffs where we return to the climate of Organic <b>Hallucinosis</b> album. I'm certain that the very fact we are again, after 9 years, in Hertz studio will evoke the spirit of that album. The vocals sound very promising. Rasta [...] is a much more experienced vocalist compared to the Carnival Is Forever album times. And his voice sounds more powerful and deeper." ...|$|E
50|$|Both {{alcoholic}} <b>hallucinosis</b> and DTs {{have been}} {{thought of as}} different manifestations of the same physiological process in the body during alcohol withdrawal. Alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> is a much less serious diagnosis than delirium tremens. Delirium tremens (DTs) do not appear suddenly, unlike alcoholic <b>hallucinosis.</b> DTs also take approximately 48 to 72 hours to appear after the heavy drinking stops. A tremor develops in the hands and can also affect the head and body. A common symptom of delirium tremens is that people become severely uncoordinated. The biggest difference between alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> and delirium tremens is that alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> {{have a much better}} prognosis than DTs. Moreover, delirium tremens can be fatal when untreated.|$|E
50|$|Alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> (or alcohol-related {{psychosis}} or alcohol-induced psychotic disorder) is a {{complication of}} alcohol withdrawal in alcoholics. Descriptions {{of the condition}} date back to at least 1907. They can occur during acute intoxication or withdrawal with the potential of having delirium tremens. Alcohol <b>hallucinosis</b> is a rather uncommon alcohol-induced psychotic disorder only being seen in chronic alcoholics who have many consecutive years of severe and heavy drinking during their lifetime. Alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> develops about 12 to 24 hours after the heavy drinking stops suddenly, and can last for days. It involves auditory and visual hallucinations, most commonly accusatory or threatening voices. The risk of developing alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> is increased by long-term heavy alcohol abuse {{and the use of}} other drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{documented}} case of peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> was by French neurologist and neuropsychiatrist Jean Lhermitte, which {{described a}} 72-year-old woman’s visual hallucinations [...] The hallucinations occurred during normal conscious {{state and the}} patient’s neurological signs were associated with those characteristic of an infarct to the midbrain and pons. Von Bogaert, Lhermitte’s colleague, named this type of hallucination “peduncular,” {{in reference to the}} cerebral peduncles, {{as well as to the}} midbrain and its surroundings. In 1925, Von Bogaert was the first to describe the pathophysiology of peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> through an autopsy of a patient. [...] His autopsy revealed the infarction of many areas of the brain including the inferolateral red nucleus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, third nerve nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, substantia nigra, and pulvinar. Later in 1932, Lhermitte, Levy, and Trelles discovered an association between peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> and “pigmentary degeneration of the periaqueductal gray and the degeneration of the occulomotor nucleus.” [...] Posterior thalamic lesions were also found to be linked to peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> by De Morsier. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to localize lesions in the brain characteristic of peduncular <b>hallucinosis.</b> In 1987, the first case of peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> was reported in which MRI was used to locate a midbrain lesion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} {{alcoholic}} <b>hallucinosis</b> is unclear. It {{seems to be}} highly related {{to the presence of}} dopamine in the limbic system with the possibility of other systems.

Typically, alcoholic <b>hallucinosis</b> has a sudden onset.|$|E

50|$|People {{diagnosed}} with Parkinson's disease, narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, delirium tremens, Lewy Body Dementia, and temporal lobe epilepsy {{are more prone}} to complex visual hallucinations such as peduncular <b>hallucinosis.</b> Peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> is more common in patients with a long duration of Parkinson's disease and also with a long treatment history, depression, and cognitive impairment. Paranoid delusions are common in these patients even though the hallucinations can occur during clear sensorium.|$|E
50|$|Peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> (PH), or Lhermitte's peduncular <b>hallucinosis,</b> {{is a rare}} {{neurological}} disorder that causes vivid visual hallucinations that typically occur in dark environments, and last for several minutes. Unlike some other kinds of hallucinations, the hallucinations that patients with PH experience are very realistic, and often involve people and environments that are familiar to the affected individuals. Because {{the content of the}} hallucinations is never exceptionally bizarre, patients can rarely distinguish between the hallucinations and reality.|$|E

5000|$|The effect lesions on the {{brainstem}} {{have on the}} ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) {{has also}} been hypothesized. It was proposed that since the ARAS {{plays a role in}} consciousness and waking, the lesions of the brainstem common to peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> may “disrupt ARAS impulses from the brainstem reticular formation” and, as a consequence, lead to the sleep disturbances characteristic of peduncular <b>hallucinosis.</b> The use of drugs such as Olanzapine may help treat sleep disturbances as it has been found to “improve sleep continuity, sleep quality, and to increase slow wave sleep.” ...|$|E
50|$|Long-term use rebound effects, which resembled those seen in withdrawal, have anecdotally been {{described}} in patients who were still taking a stable dose of the drug. The symptoms included delirium, <b>hallucinosis,</b> convulsions and fever.|$|E
50|$|They are {{normally}} colorful, vivid images and occur during wakefulness, and predominately at night. Lilliputian hallucinations (also called Alice in Wonderland syndrome), hallucinations {{in which people}} or animals appear smaller {{than they would be}} in real life, are common in cases of peduncular <b>hallucinosis.</b> Most patients exhibit abnormal sleep patterns characterized by insomnia and daytime drowsiness. Peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> {{has been described as a}} “release phenomenon” due to damage to the ascending reticular activating system, which is supported by the sleep disturbance characteristic of this syndrome. In most cases, people are aware that the hallucinations are not real. However, some people experience agitation and delusion and mistake their hallucinations for reality.|$|E
50|$|Other visual {{hallucinations}} tend {{to stem from}} psychological disorders. Whereas {{a person with a}} psychological disorder thinks their hallucinations are real, people with peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> normally know that the {{visual hallucinations}} they see are not real.

50|$|Expansive {{delusions}} may {{be maintained}} by auditory hallucinations, which advise the patient {{that they are}} significant, or confabulations, when, for example, the patient gives a thorough description of their coronation or marriage to the king. Grandiose and expansive delusions may also be part of fantastic <b>hallucinosis</b> in which all forms of hallucinations occur.|$|E
50|$|The lesions that disturb {{brainstem}} {{reticular formation}} or thalamic targets {{seem to be}} the source behind peduncular <b>hallucinosis.</b> For example, lesions affecting the dorsal raphe system can lead to hallucinations by preventing ascending inhibition to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). This inhibition may hyper-excite the LGN, inducing visual hallucinations. Lesions of the retina and areas proximal to it can remove or alter the inputs coming in from the external environment to the visual system. Peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> therefore might emanate from disturbances in distal portions of the visual system. Lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes can also lead to complex visual hallucinations because the lobes connect to the visual system via the lateral geniculate nucleus and medial pulvinar. In addition, visual processing and salience can be disrupted by thalamic lesions which affect important structures such as the pulvinar.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{any kind}} of complex visual {{hallucination}} requires an understanding of the different pathologies in order to correctly diagnose and treat. If a person is taking a pro-hallucinogenic medication, {{the first step is to}} stop taking it. Sometimes improvement will occur spontaneously and pharmacotherapy is not necessary. While there is not a lot of evidence of effective pharmacological treatment, antipsychotics and anticonvulsants have been used in some cases to control hallucinations. Since peduncular <b>hallucinosis</b> occurs due to an excess of serotonin, modern antipsychotics are used to block both dopamine and serotonin receptors, preventing the overstimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The drug generically called carbamazepine increases GABA, which prevents the LGN from firing, thereby increasing the inhibition of the LGN. Regular antipsychotics as well as antidepressants can also be helpful in reducing or eliminating peduncular <b>hallucinosis.</b>|$|E
