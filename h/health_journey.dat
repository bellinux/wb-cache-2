40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{learning}} design project that encourages the creative (re) use of popular literature as educational materials by bringing together scholars and insights from diverse disciplines to engage learners and build the human(ising) skills needed in health professions. A capable health professional is one who has technical competence, interpersonal and critical thinking skills. They {{need to be able}} to understand and cope with complexity and ambiguity, human diversity, and the reality that people differ in the factors that assist them to become ready for change and stay well. Critics of the direction that health education has taken to prepare graduates indicate that there is a preference for technical skill development, whilst overlooking craft knowledge. Students still need to learn bio-technological knowledge, but they also need to understand the multiple social, cultural, and environmental contexts that can impact on a person’s journey of change in health. The project reported in this paper outlines a novel process of engagement in case-based learning. Particular illness memoirs have been selected, and important plot lines within the stories extracted to depict variations of a person’s <b>health</b> <b>journey.</b> A book club process, familiar to most people as a fun way to engage in multiple readings and perceptions about the merit of a text, is the medium through which these excerpts are discussed. Thus, the materials act as triggers, not solely for inquiry, but for the development of empathy and understanding of different contexts, which are then aligned to clinical strategies assisting students to develop technical skills and interpersonal abilities...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{documented}} that patients from lower socio-economic backgrounds do not access health services. There have been Government led initiatives to ask service users what they want from services to provide initiatives that will improve {{the health and well-being}} of the population. There has been little or no involvement of patients who do not access services to ask them why they do not attend or involve themselves in decision making. Previous studies into access to cardiac rehabilitation have been predominantly quantitative, with very little qualitative data to explore the reasons why people from lower socio-economic backgrounds do not access the programmes provided. In this study beliefs of people who have not accessed cardiac rehabilitation are explored with a group of participants who have a diagnosis of coronary heart disease using a Heideggerian phenomenological approach. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Themes were identified using line by line analysis. Three case examples were described bringing the data back together into a whole transcript for further exploration. The key findings from the research showed that the participants, all from the five poorest electoral wards of Darlington highlighted what to them were the significant factors in their <b>health</b> <b>journey.</b> The most common themes were (1) support, (2) choices and risks, (3) cardiac rehabilitation inhibitors and (4) perceptions of what had happened to them. In conclusion the findings from this study can be used to stimulate a review of current thinking and practices among health professionals, educators and other agencies involved in supporting this group of individuals to meet their long-term adjustment needs. Long term cardiac rehabilitation provision could be further enhanced if future policy initiatives reflected the needs of this group of individuals, and further research into this area could be implemented.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to define the construct of hope-based action from the perspectives of nine participants and myself. As researcher-participant, I used reflexivity and personal narrative to describe the language and rituals of a culture of hope. The construct of hope was investigated from the perspectives of Snyder 2 ̆ 7 s hope theory (1994) from the field of positive psychology, Greenleaf 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) servant leadership approach from the field of organizational studies, and autoethnographic methodology. The purposeful sample of my culture-of-hope guides were selected from the Leadership Areas of Business, Education, and Healthcare. Interview data from the participants and document data from my own writings were collected and analyzed. I used ethnographic analysis methods along with ATLAS. ti, a Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS), to conceptualize the model. Findings suggest that heart-centered leaders take hope-based action. The major cultural components related to a hope-based and heart-centered leadership culture are: Identify the Need, Implement Approaches, and Monitor the Impact. A Heart-based Hope Model of Leadership (L 2 L) showcasing how these three cultural components operationalized five cultural categories: Communication, Guidance, Mindset, Motive, and Value was presented. An overarching theme of a hope-based philosophy was shown as being carried out through a heart-based approach. The results of this study may have theoretical implications for workforce researchers interested in positive workplace cultures. The findings may also have practical implications for workforce leaders from Business, Education, and Healthcare, who want to implement hope-based action to create a heart-centered culture...|$|E

40|$|Background: Research {{into the}} impact of {{personal}} health record-enabled consumer systems {{is still in its}} infancy. Little is known about effective designs of web-based personally controlled health management system (PCHMS), how people use these systems in their real-life settings, nor how usage relates to concurrent support from other sources. Objective: To inform PCHMS design and feature development by assessing how patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) use a web-based PCHMS in their real-life setting, and how their usage compares to concurrent support from other sources. Methods: An in-depth formative evaluation study was conducted with 17 women undergoing IVF, who were invited to use a web-based PCHMS called Healthy. me, providing targeted IVF program information over an eight-week treatment. Online interactions were recorded on computer logs. Participants were interviewed weekly by telephone throughout their cycle, and were specifically questioned about their feedback of PCHMS and concurrent sources of support beyond that provided by the system. Interview data was coded and analysed using two-way repeated ANOVA. Results: 62 interviews were collected from 14 participants who completed the study. Twelve of 14 participants accessed all features in Healthy. me, which included i) accessing information about the next steps of their treatment (i. e. journey), and ii) viewing or updating details in their pillbox, schedule, test results and team members during their IVF treatment. Healthy. me alerted 21 % (3 / 14) participants to seek advice from clinic staff on issues that could affect treatment outcome of which they were previously unaware (e. g. sexual practices, frequency and order of ultrasound screenings after a sequence of blood tests). Patients additionally sought support from people, informational resource and organisational tools outside Healthy. me to help decide IVF and manage different stages of their treatment. There was a significant interaction between IVF stage and sources of support (F(10, 50) = 2. 54, p=. 015, ηp²=. 34). Suggestions are presented on ways to tailor support at different stages of the IVF cycle using a PCHMS. Conclusions: IVF patients seek support from the web-based PCHMS, and concurrently do so with other sources of support. More research is needed to inform PCHMS design that effectively tailors support for patients at different stages of their <b>health</b> <b>journey.</b> 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This descriptive, {{correlational}} {{study was}} designed to describe levels of consumer satisfaction with emergency department (ED) nursing and to identify the key determinants of satisfaction with ED nursing in a regional New Zealand hospital. The relationship between satisfaction with ED nursing and with overall satisfaction with the ED visit was also explored. Satisfaction is an important indicator of the quality of healthcare and an understanding of satisfaction and its determinants has the potential to improve healthcare services and consumer health outcomes. The study employed a survey design using the Consumer Emergency Care Satisfaction Scale (CECSS) which is an internationally recognised tool that has demonstrable reliability and validity. It consists of 19 items divided between two subscales - Caring and Teaching. Respondents indicate on a five point Likert scale {{the extent to which they}} agree or disagree with each item. In addition to the 19 items in the scale, respondents were also asked to provide some consumer characteristic data and to answer two open-ended questions. The survey was posted to a convenience sample of 410 ED attendees within 24 - 48 hours of their visit to the emergency department. The final sample comprised 100 completed or partially completed surveys. The majority (n = 65, 88 %) were either satisfied or very satisfied with ED nursing. There were no statistically significant relationships between any consumer characteristics and satisfaction; however the following visit characteristics were demonstrated to affect levels of satisfaction - triage category, self-rated acuity, the times consumers arrived at and were discharged from the ED, being able to differentiate between health professionals, being kept informed about the visit and any delays, length of stay (LOS), and number of previous visits to the emergency department. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 571, p = 0. 000) between consumer satisfaction with ED nursing and with overall satisfaction with the visit. Thematic analysis of the data from the question about what consumers liked about ED nursing revealed four themes - personal qualities of the nurse, professional qualities of the nurse, interpersonal qualities of the nurse, and miscellaneous comments. Thematic analysis of the data from the question about what the nurse could have done to make the visit better also revealed four themes - nothing, staffing/service, information giving, and the environment. The study concludes that ED consumers want to know who their nurses are and to have nurses who communicate well with them and keep them informed about their visit. The most significant implications and challenges for researchers are in exploring the area around the consumer <b>health</b> <b>journey</b> as it is these visit characteristics that this study has demonstrated affect levels of satisfaction with ED nursing...|$|E

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} a {{qualitative}} analysis of youth mental <b>health</b> <b>journeys</b> in Atlantic Canada, asking how youth experience treatments {{in the mental}} health system. Participants (N= 8), aged 13 - 18, identified with anxiety disorders and had sought services with{{in the mental health}} system. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with participants. Youth narrative summaries were presented providing rich youth perspectives in mental health research. A thematic analysis detailed both positive and negative experiences, which acted as facilitators and barriers for treatment often in contradictory forms. The central themes were: therapeutic relationships, treatment in school, medicalization, wait times, and being stuck in the margins. Communication and trust issues, a lack of comprehensive treatment options, and the complexity of navigating the system, pervaded the narratives. A social historical framework also informed the design, analysis, and findings of this thesis, which tracked the rise of anxiety in the twentieth century and contextualized current day treatments. This thesis has produced insights regarding the importance of youth perspectives in evaluating mental health care given the marginalization of these perspectives in past psychiatric discourses and present- day narratives.

40|$|Every {{patient has}} a story which can {{influence}} their <b>health</b> care <b>journey.</b> But not every story gets heard because health care professionals do not always {{have the time to}} listen. However, to not hear the narrative of the client is to potentially ignore them as a holistic being. How often do health care professionals ask the questions to really determine who the person is, what shapes their world and how best do they understand the alteration in their health care situation? The rich information that exists in the client’s story needs to be integrated into health care delivery. The challenge however is to make every health care professional cognizant of the need to listen, to appreciate the patient experience and to ensure that the patient is involved in the decisions about their <b>health</b> care <b>journey.</b> Care delivery should be based on effective communication and education and health care professionals need to make this their business. This starts with novice students being taught the fundamental skills of communication. In 2009 Dr Kerry Reid-Searl, pioneered an innovative simulation technique in the undergraduate nursing program at CQUniversity which would see students appreciating the concept of communication and listening to the patient story from a first year first term level. The technique- now termed as Mask Ed (KRS simulation) has proven to engage learners and promote reflection beyond the simulation experience. Further, the pedagogy behind the technique has now been extended to cater for students understanding the paediatric experience through puppets. The following presentation will showcase both simulation techniques followed by an explanation of the pedagogy. The presentation will also provide evidence {{of the success of the}} techniques. Most importantly, the audience will gain an appreciation of the patient story, the value of being listened to, the power of effective communication from health care professionals, the relationship between compliance and understanding and the impact that the latter has on the patient’s <b>health</b> care <b>journey.</b> Finally it is hoped that this paper inspires others to consider different strategies in order to engage patients as learners...|$|R
